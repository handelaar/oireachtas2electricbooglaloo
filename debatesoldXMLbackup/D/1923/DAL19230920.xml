      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>My nomination as President of the Executive Council has been approved by the Governor-General, and I now beg to submit formally, for the assent of the Dáil, the names of the following Deputies as members of the Executive Council:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputy Kevin O'Higgins as Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs;</P>
      <P>Deputy Ernest Blythe as Minister for Finance;</P>
      <P>General Richard Mulcahy as Minister for Defence;</P>
      <P>Deputy Joseph McGrath as Minister for Industry and Commerce;</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald as Minister for External Affairs; and</P>
      <P>Deputy Eoin MacNeill as Minister for Education (when he will have complied with Article 17 of the Constitution).</P>
      <P>I regret that I have found it necessary to consult the members of the old Executive Council&mdash;those of them who are present&mdash;with regard to the Ministry of Finance, and that I do not feel justified in keeping that portfolio myself.  I have asked the Deputy who has been Minister for Local Government to accept that portfolio, and he has kindly consented to do so, with the approval of the other members of the Executive Council.  I do not think it is necessary to do more than formally move for assent, and I now formally do so.</P>

      <P>The motion that has been made by the President of the Executive Council asks the Dáil, in effect, to approve the re-election of the same Deputies to act with him as an Executive Council as have been so acting for the last year.  He is quite entitled to do so, and it is necessary that the President should call to his aid those persons who may have the confidence of the Dáil and the country to act with him as the Government of the country.  It seems to me that before the Dáil approves of this selection, we should have something to say, and we should hear something from the President in regard to the intentions of this Ministry, and rather to suggest to the new Executive Council which will be elected certain lines of policy which the Dáil thinks, or the individual members of the Dáil may think, should be carried out by this Ministry which has now been nominated.  The fact that the same Deputies are to be associated with the President in the future suggests that there is no change in policy, or if there is to be a change in policy it seems to me, at any rate, that we might have some indication from the President as to what his mind is in calling these gentlemen to his assistance in the Government of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that the party which the President leads has been returned by a majority to the Dáil, has presented a programme to the country, and has got the confidence of the country for that programme.  I have followed, as carefully as it has been possible for me to follow, the various statements made officially by that party and by the President, and I have failed to divine what is the intention in regard to policy of the President and his party. We know, of course, that what was put before the country was the re-establishment of peace and the maintenance of the Constitution. Well, that, of course, is a kind of thing that is usually put before an electorate by a Ministry which has happened to come through successfully military disputes and military conflicts.  We are all old enough to remember the khaki election in England and the results of it, and, I think, the Dáil should express itself rather upon other matters, such as the means <Col N="35" /> whereby that Constitution is to be consolidated and the intentions of the Government regarding the problems that are really important.  We heard, of course, officially from the President and his organisation that it was the intention of the party and the Government to deal with problems of reconstruction, house-building, industrial development, industrial disputes, domestic and foreign trade and commerce, agriculture, fisheries, manufactures, transport system, etc.  Well, the Ministry to be established will necessarily have to deal with these things; but what we really desire to know is what method will be adopted in dealing with them; what is the purpose of that method; what is the policy that is intended to be carried through in dealing with these various problems.  I would like this occasion to be used in such a way that the Dáil may express its views upon the methods of dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>We have in this motion an intimation that Deputy Kevin O'Higgins should be appointed as Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs.  I could, perhaps, with pleasure to myself, perhaps displeasure to many Deputies of the Dáil, require some enlightenment and utter some words of criticism regarding the policy of the Ministry of Home Affairs during the past month or two, since the Dissolution, and make suggestions regarding the immediate future of the policy of that Ministry.  I might deal with the question of the imprisonment and internment of 10,000 to 15,000 people. I might deal with the question of the treatment of internees and prisoners. I think it is the duty of someone to be here to deal with those questions and to raise them and to criticise the policy of the Government with regard to them.  But for my part it has been intimated fairly and clearly by the electorate that they do not desire that we, of the Labour Party, should take the responsibility of criticising Government action upon these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions of this kind have, if we interpret the intentions of the electorate rightly, been <Col N="36" /> relegated rather to the Deputies of the Government Party and to the Deputies of what is known as the Republican Party, and I have the right to assume that both these Parties will accept the responsibility which has been imposed upon them.  While saying that, I want to say as definitely as it is possible to say that we stand where we stood all through last Session in saying that men and women who have been arrested, men and women especially who have been arrested in time of peace or comparative peace, ought not to be detained one hour beyond the necessary time that is required to bring them to trial.  We say, as definitely as it is possible to say, that in our opinion these men and women ought to be released, and we are prepared to vote for any proposition brought forward with that object in view, by any person who deems it to be his or her responsibility to raise that question in this Dáil.  But our interests rather lie in questions of social and economic difficulty, problems that I fear are going to prevent the re-establishment of peace and the stabilisation of the State, unless they are dealt with on lines very differently from those hinted at and suggested by the Government, and the Government supporters, whether in the country or in the Dáil in the last Session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see the mind of the Government is running in the direction of allowing the development of economic affairs to follow the beaten path, and to trust to the ordinary operations of commerce and exchange to bring about prosperity in this country.  During one of the Debates in the Dáil last Session I drew attention to the state of unemployment in such countries as Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, each of which countries is somewhat in the same position as Ireland is towards the neighbouring countries.  Economically each of these countries lives to a very great degree, indeed, upon export trade, upon the markets abroad.  The figures which I quoted in that discussion showed that even such a country as Denmark, which was prosperous as-an agricultural country, comparatively prosperous, had within the last year a percentage of unemployment as high <Col N="37" /> as twenty-five, and Sweden had a percentage of unemployment as high as thirty-two in March, 1922.  This country is dependent for the export market upon prosperity in England.  You are trusting to the development of the ordinary methods of commerce, and you are hopeful that the times will grow better in this country, with the coming of military peace, and that the trade of this country will revive, and a market will continue to be found across the water for Irish produce. That is the proposition, that is the mind of the Ministry, that is the mind of the supporters of the Ministry in this country.</P>
    <P>The market in England is not improving. We were told by leading British industrialists three or four weeks ago that they expected, as things were going, an unemployed population in Great Britain of two millions.  It is steadily rising since the middle of the summer, notwithstanding the fact that twelve months have elapsed since the enforcement of the wage reduction campaign in that country.  People in England were told by the employers there that they must accept reductions in wages if they wanted to improve trade, to regenerate the commercial system. Reductions were enforced, but the promise has not been fulfilled.  Trade and commerce have not improved, and unemployment has increased.  The market for Irish goods has decreased in that country because of the decrease in employment, and because, still further, of the reductions in wages of those who are employed.</P>
    <P>I want to know whether it is the intention of the Ministry here, whether it is the mind of the Government here, or, shall I say, whether it is the mind of the majority on the Government benches and those behind the Government benches, to continue that policy and to assist and encourage the present policy in this country towards reduction in wages.  The plea is put forward here, just the same as it was in England, that employment can only be revived by reductions in wages.  That was the cry in England, and it has not been fulfilled.  Is there any reason for thinking that reductions in wages in Ireland will be followed by an increase <Col N="38" /> of employment in Ireland to any appreciable extent?  I deny it.  I say, on the other hand, as I said before in this Dáil, that the true policy is to keep up wages and to readjust your economic system in such a way as to ensure that those high wages will be spent in the purchase of Irish commodities.  I want the Ministry to realise, and I want some of the new members of the Dáil to realise, that even though trade were to improve to an unexpected extent in England within the next few months, that in itself is not going to improve your industrial prospects in this country.  Everyone who has studied these matters knows that the power to produce cheaply in this country, even on similar rates of wages, is not as great as the power to produce cheaply in England, or one might even say in Germany, or in any of the continental countries where the standard has been lowered within recent years.  But the power to produce cheaply of our industrial manufacturers in this country is not as great as the power to produce cheaply in England.  During the European War we all know how manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity of lavish expenditure of Government funds to enlarge their establishments, to improve their facilities for production, and generally blind the Exchequer by spending what should have been paid in taxes&mdash;excess profits tax&mdash;in the refurbishing of their machinery and their productive processes. That was not done to anything like the same extent in this country, because the foundations were not there, and your comparative position for cheap production in Ireland as compared with England is much worse than it was prior to 1914.  Assume a revival of trade in England, where are your competitive industries to be?  That revival of trade in England means an easing of the opportunities for those cheap manufactures to come into Ireland and to compete with your Irish manufactures.  Neither the hope of improved conditions in England nor the hope of lower wages in Ireland are going to make your industrial position satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the President that if his Ministry, when formed, tends to <Col N="39" /> proceed on the lines of least resistance, simply to allow the ordinary processes of commerce as they have been known in the past to proceed and develop of their own volition, seeking the highest profit irrespective of human effects, seeking to buy in the cheapest market and to sell in the dearest, then the industrial and economic position of this country, in my opinion, is going to be a very bad one indeed, and any hopes that the country had that the revolution which has been accomplished would lead to improved material life for the people would be lost and unfulfilled.</P>
    <P>We have on the Statute Book a Bill dealing with unemployment insurance. It was passed during the last Session, and affects the system of unemployment insurance, abolishing the system of uncovenanted benefit and re-establishing what might be called pure insurance schemes.  During the discussion on that Bill, I pointed out from these benches that, unless there was an extraordinary revival of trade and an increase in employment between that date and October, we were going to find the winter a very serious one, because of the fact that from the middle of October we shall have a steadily increasing number of men coming on to unemployment or continuing unemployment without any unemployment insurance whatever.  The dole, as it was called, was abolished, and it was hoped by the Assistant Minister in charge of the Bill that trade and commerce would so improve, between the date of the introduction of the Bill and the middle of October, that the forecast, or, rather, fears that were given voice to would not be fulfilled.  There is no improvement.  There is very much to the contrary.  There has been an increase of several thousands in the numbers of unemployed on the Unemployment Exchanges, quite irrespective of any effects of the trade disputes.  There will be a still further increase with every man demobilised, and I think it is well to ask the Ministry, or the President, whether they have taken into account the position of these people during the coming winter.  During the debate on the Second Reading of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, Mr. Whelehan stated that by the middle of <Col N="40" /> August 10,000 persons would have exhausted all their contributions, and would have no right to benefit but for the special arrangement proposed in the Bill.  He also stated that when the first benefit year terminates, on October the 7th, about one-third of the unemployed will, if they continue to draw benefit until then, have no contribution left unexhausted with which to restart the new benefit year.  &ldquo;It is hoped,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that by that time economic conditions will have so improved as to have absorbed all, or nearly all, of these workers into employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, what are we to contemplate, if nothing is done to substitute for the dole, as it was called, something better?  Are we to look on calmly and without fear at the increase in unemployment, and the steadily and rapidly growing number of men, who are not only unemployed, but are not receiving any insurance benefit?  Do you think that that large number of people in the country are going to be contented and satisfied to rest silent, quiet, and patient until the Government is satisfied that peace has been re-established, and that the ordinary processes of commerce will have solved this problem? I have no such hopes.  On the contrary, I have very great fears that this growing number of unemployed, with nothing to fall back upon in the way of insurance benefit, will make your social problem, perhaps make your military problem, a very, very great one indeed. It seems to me that the Government, and that any Ministry that may be elected, is faced, at this moment, with the question of whether they are going to choose to follow on the ordinary British and European system of commerce&mdash;<i>laissez faire</i> in commerce&mdash;or whether they are going to show some imagination and resist the temptation to take the easy line of life and leave things to find their own level.  I hope the decision of the Government will be to follow on and bring into practical application those principles which they advocated, which we advocated prior to the establishment of the Free State, principles which laid it down clearly that it was the duty of the State to see that the children of the State would have opportunities for employment, for wealth production and opportunities <Col N="41" /> to live in the country to which they belong. I would ask Ministers to spend a day or two in looking back upon the propaganda that they indulged in prior to the signing of the Treaty, during the agitation which led to the signing of the Treaty, and to face the implications honestly, and to bring them into practical operation. If they will do that they will get our support to the utmost possible extent, but if they do that they will lose the support of many others, whose support, I imagine from the signs we have seen, they will much rather have than the support of those who have spoken on behalf of labour in the past.</P>

      <P>I am very much surprised to hear the tone of Deputy Johnson's speech.  It seems to me that he has taken the advantage which he complains the English manufacturers took during the war.  They took the opportunity to make profits during the war, and he took the opportunity of the President's motion to make a long speech and to profiteer on it.  The motion before the Dáil, as I understand it, is that certain Ministers be appointed or reappointed.  Deputy Johnson made a speech in which he has not had a single word to say about any of the Ministers, but puts a series of questions to a Minister that has not yet been appointed.  He has not said a single word why those Ministers should not be appointed.  We have instead listened to a lecture on political economy in which he talked about everything but the President's motion. I suggest that it is the duty of every member to criticise the Government, if the Government ought to be criticised, but the criticism ought always to be helpful.  I can get up and talk without any responsibility, but Ministers have responsibility, and if I am going to criticise them my criticism ought to be helpful.  I do not think it right for any member to stand up here and waste the time of the Dáil with a lecture on political economy and criticism of a Ministry that is not here.  Anybody may get up and propose an alternative Ministry, but lectures on political economy are no use.</P>

      <P>I rise, with a good deal of hesitation, as a new <Col N="42" /> member, to speak in this Dáil, and I ask your indulgence in dealing with a matter that the leader of the Labour Party has raised.  I take a good deal of exception to his attitude towards this problem.  In the first instance, he refers to the fact that at an earlier stage the common sense of employers and workmen in England came to the conclusion that the situation justified a reduction in wages, which the men there, through the advice of their leaders, were prepared to accept.  Those reductions were put into operation and were largely based on the argument that in reducing the wages it was necessary for the maintenance of trade, but also behind that was the very important argument that as the wages had been inflated during the war owing to exceptional circumstances, the business community claimed that in the reflex action the fall in the cost of living ought also to be taken into account.  Now, Deputy Johnson has referred to the fact that these reductions have not been as successful in stemming the tide of bad trade as was expected at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say on the other hand if the reductions had not taken place and if the Labour Party at the other side had adopted the same attitude as is advocated by the Leader of the Labour Party that, bad as the situation to-day is, as far as the trade of the country is concerned, it would be infinitely worse with the palliative which was not as successful as it might have been, owing to the fact that continental politics came in and interfered with the revival of trade which had undoubtedly set in by that stage.  Now, applying that to this country we, on this side, cannot help but be affected by the economic operations and the economic laws on the other side of the Channel.  We might reasonably have expected that labour and the labour leaders would have recognised that and that coming out of troubles at home, troubles from other causes, that at all events we might have the opportunity of sitting down calmly and of being able to reason out all those matters as between Capital and Labour, without having to come to the deadlock that is at present holding up the country and is threatening increased unemployment in the near future.  I claim that the policy of <Col N="43" /> the Labour Party has not been as intelligent as one would expect from a Party who put forward a claim that they are able and willing to govern.  The question of unemployment is a serious one, and the outlook, as far as winter is concerned, is serious also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has referred to the abolition of the dole.  The dole has been very useful in some cases, but I think that as far as Ireland is concerned it has been grossly abused, with the help and assistance of the Labour Party.  Go down the country, into any part you like, and anyone there will tell you about obviously manufactured cases. What we want to get at is the man who is willing to work, and if he cannot get the work he has got to get assistance from the State.  I would join with Deputy Johnson in saying to the Government that that is obviously a situation that must be attended to.  On the other hand the only remedy for the man who is prepared to put his back to the wall, to stand all day and do nothing, is to make him feel in his stomach, if necessary, the need for work.  The country needs that the work must be done on a fair basis.  That to-day is holding up an immense amount of work.  That to-day is putting a strangle-hold on all individual enterprise.  If any man has money to spend in advancement let him look around.  Let him compare his cost to-day of any building as compared with pre-war costs and he will see that it is not reasonable.  What the country wants to-day is an opportunity to develop every resource.  To do that we must have a position in which a man willing to extend his capital shall do so in security and with a fair expectation of a reasonable return for his money.  Take the question of the North Wall to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to apologise for transgressing.  It is my ignorance in this matter.  I say in these matters the position that ought to appeal to the Ministry is that they must help to encourage individual trades and individual <Col N="44" /> enterprise, rather than unnecessarily interfere in connection with matters that are not properly under their control.  I would like to say that Deputy Johnson's argument seemed to me to appeal in this way, that if wages are not to be governed by competitive conditions and if they are to be subject only to the wish of the person receiving the wages, I am afraid the country would be very different to live in for the ordinary man who has an income which is not liable to those fluctuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise principally to express regret that the President, in nominating his Executive Council, has again this year deemed it advisable to include as one of the Ministries within the Executive Council, the Ministry of Education.  I think, from any point of view, that decision is to be regretted, but in saying that I would like to make it clear that I do not wish to be regarded as indicating the unsuitability in any way of the Deputy who is named as the Minister for Education for that particular position. What I do say is, that under the provisions of our Constitution we have some Ministers within the Executive Council, and some who are outside Ministers responsible only to this Dáil.  I say that if there is one Ministry more suitable than another to be regarded as one which should be directly responsible to the Dáil, and only to the Dáil, it is the Ministry of Education.  The Executive Council is responsible for policy, and I take it the main policy for which this Executive Council, now about to be chosen by this Dáil, will be responsible is the maintenance of the Treaty, and that all its actions and all its acts will be governed by a consideration of that policy.  Now we know, and it is admitted by every Party, that the necessity for an improvement in our education, and in our educational system, is one of the most pressing problems that this Dáil will have to face.  In my opinion at least it is not right that the proposals which might be brought forward to improve our educational system should be governed by considerations which have to do with matters of broad policy such as the Executive Council will have to deal <Col N="45" /> with.  The Minister for Education should be in the position that he could take the Dáil fully and wholly into his confidence, and every Party in the Dáil, in framing his proposals.  He cannot do that if he is a member of the Executive Council, because it would mean if the proposal that he brings forward happens to be defeated, and happens not to meet with the wishes of the Dáil, it is immediately a question of policy, and as the Minister is a member of the Executive Council, the Council stands or falls, the Government stands or falls, on this educational proposal.  I hold strongly that that is not as it should be.  While knowing that the President would naturally find it necessary to call to his aid a man of the experience and wisdom and wise judgment of Deputy MacNeill, I must express very great regret, and I believe that regret will be shared by a great many people in this Dáil and in the country who believe that education should be dealt with and kept as far as possible from politics or political concerns, that the President has again included in the inside or Executive Council this Ministry of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. WILSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking through the Ministries which in future are to be the inner Cabinet, which in reality will be the Governors of this country, it seems strange to us here representing the farming interests that the Minister for Agriculture, who has to deal with the greatest industry in this country, is excluded from the inner Councils of the Cabinet and thereby deprived of the support which he should necessarily be expected to have in a country that is mainly agricultural. It must seem strange that I should be asking that the Minister for Agriculture should be included in the Executive Council, while my friend on my left is desirous of excluding from the Executive Council the Minister for Education.  My reason for making the request I have made is that in the very near future the fiscal problem in this country will have to be dealt with, and when it comes to be dealt with, we are afraid that unless we are properly <Col N="46" /> represented, or rather the great industry in which we are interested is represented, in that Executive Council our interests will be overlooked.  Five out of every six men in this country are engaged in agriculture, and if our industry is not given proper representation, we are afraid that it will be let down and become impoverished. If it is necessary to have in the Executive Council the Minister for Industry and Commerce, surely it is of far greater importance that the agricultural industry, which gives employment to five out of every six men in this country, should also be represented in the Council so that the necessary proposals for the protection of our industry could there be put forward directly.  With regard to the nominations for the various Ministries, I have nothing to say further than this, that most of the Deputies named have given faithful service in the past, and as far as we are concerned, not being able to form our own Ministry, we must of course accept them as the best substitutes that could be found.</P>

      <P>I should just like to say that I am sure, from all that has been said of the Ministers whose names have been put before the Dáil on nomination, they certainly have a right to feel honoured and proud of the confidence they inspired.  Not one word has been said against any Minister who has formed part of the Government of the country; it certainly speaks well for them.  During the propaganda employed outside we were told that we must not recognise these Ministers at all.  This Assembly is the place, and this is the opportune time for anyone to say anything they have to say in criticism of the Ministry.  I have listened with intense interest to every speech that has been delivered, and I have not heard one word as to why we should not recognise outside in the country the men whom we recognise as Executive Ministers inside in this Dáil.  The majority of the Teachtaí in this Dáil may not probably value my independent manner of speaking, but I am very pleased myself, and so is my Party.  I am the Party known as the Town Tenants' Party, but I may say that I have several colleagues in the Independent <Col N="47" /> Party.  It is a great consolation to be able to stand up here and say that no Party in this Dáil has ventured to put forward one of their own members in opposition to members of the Executive nominated, and in that connection we have only had an expression of regret from Deputy Wilson on behalf of the Farmers' Party that they were not numerous enough to form a Cabinet.</P>

I have nothing further to say only that I am quite satisfied, and I believe that if some Parties in the Dáil had sufficient power they would try and nominate somebody from their own ranks for the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>The purport of the speeches which have been made refer to matters of policy, and it will be within the recollection of the old members of the Dáil that last year the policy was outlined in the speech delivered by the Governor-General.  Much the same objection was made last year when forming the Ministry as has been made now, to the inclusion of particular Ministries, or rather a particular <Col N="48" /> Ministry, and the exclusion of another Ministry.  With the exception possibly of two or three Ministries the selection of the Executive Council is not a matter of particular Ministries, but the inclusion of certain persons.</P>

    <P>I explained last year, as I observed just now, in reading over the report, my very great regret at not being able to include the then occupant, and, I hope, the future occupant, of the Ministry of Agriculture within the Executive Council.  Last year when making up the Ministry I consulted with the other Ministers.  It was within the period known as the Provisional Parliament in the Third Dáil, and I got their advice and their assistance, and I took the advice and counsel separately of some of the Ministers&mdash;I think more than of any other that of the Minister for Agriculture.  The success or improvement of the development of agriculture in this country does not, in my view, depend upon the inclusion or otherwise of the Minister for Agriculture in the Executive Council.  If it be thought that the work of a Ministry is of great importance to the particular subject under that Ministry, there is the fact of the maximum amount of time if the holder of that office is not a member of the Executive Council. He is not troubled by questions of policy, and he has not to attend Executive meetings, and he has not to accept responsibility unless he so desires.  But I would like to say, on the part of the present occupant of that office, that he so desired and he accepted responsibility for every action of the Government as if he were a member of the Executive Council.  I think the same thing might be said of the other Ministers. The circumstances of the times may have suggested to these Ministers that that was the patriotic policy.  I believe that at any rate in the case of the particular Minister mentioned it was more than his conception of patriotic policy, that it was the real individual, the man himself who stood for that policy and his belief that, where there was a case in which his counsel might have altered our decision that nevertheless he was a loyal, conscientious and energetic supporter of the Government in its policy. I have only to repeat what I did say on <Col N="49" /> the last occasion, that it was with regret that I could not include him in the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>It does not interfere with what the Farmers' Party have put forward; it does not interfere with the development or improvement or the existence of the industry of agriculture in any way whatever, and when the time comes, when the farmers form their own Government, I think they will come to the conclusion that what I am saying now was not far short of the real state of the case.  Now, with regard to the other Minister, I think I mentioned that the Ministry of Education was an institution in itself.  That is what is in the report.  But my recollection of that particular reference at the time was that I said the Minister for Education was an institution in himself.  I think that Deputy O'Connell will practically admit that.  I do not know, having given the matter still more consideration, that the Minister for Education should not be included within the Executive Council.  After all, how are you going to reconstruct this nation?  Upon what basis is the superstructure to be built?  Will you not depend and must you not look to the Minister for Education to mark out the Gaelicisation, if I might so say, of our whole culture? While we have complaints that in the past that has been neglected, and that the country has not been fashioned according to the best wishes of the thinking people who are anxious for nation building, ought we not now look with hope and confidence that we will get some inspiration from the Minister for Education?  I think it will be admitted upon a question of such importance as that, that the Executive Council would not be doing its duty if it did not include the Minister for Education within its ranks and accept responsibility for whatever proposals he would put forward in an attempt to make our nation separate and distinct and something to be thought of.</P>
    <P>The economic questions that have been raised are raised at a time when the industrial atmosphere is not perhaps best constituted to lend to any statement that I might make, any degree of stability, or any hope of leading towards a more peaceable settlement of <Col N="50" /> the present condition of affairs.  This much I would say, that it certainly appears to me that there are certain trades or certain businesses&mdash;I have one particularly in mind, I think it was mentioned by Deputy Hewat in his maiden speech&mdash;which are not an economic proposition no matter from what angle they could possibly be considered, and that is, the provision of houses.  It has always appeared to me during my experience of towns and cities in Ireland that the housing problem was a matter of the most vital importance to our people.  If one examines the Census Returns of the City of Dublin I think it will be found that 62 per cent. of the people are native born.  The drain from the country to supply that citizenship is enormous, and that drain will be continued until there are more satisfactory conditions prevailing with regard to the housing of the people.  But does anybody suggest that the present prices, the present cost of building houses, is a cost that can be borne by the State or by any component part of the State? We know that it is not, and we know furthermore that there is something more at issue than the mere question of wages, that it is a very serious and very complicated problem, and though at this moment Deputy Johnson gave us a prescription, the patient is scarcely in a fit state to get that prescription. But even if we had agreement there is something more than agreement wanted upon the mere question of wages.  There must be an admission by all parties that greater sacrifices must be made if we are to achieve the solution not only of that problem, but of many others. These are, however, problems which might be very well discussed another time.  I had not any information that these questions would be raised.  I should say that it may be inferred from some of the statements made, that we have not been considering these industrial disturbances.  We have.  I have been in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce some times or at least many times in the day.  He has kept me very well informed of the movements and fluctuations, and I regret to say, from what I have learned of them, that the fluctuations do not <Col N="51" /> promise very well.  If circumstances to-day are favourable towards one side, that side hardens.  If the circumstances are reversed to-morrow, that side hardens.  That is not the spirit upon which there is very great hope for a solution of these difficulties.  I hope that in the matter of the consideration of these problems that are very serious&mdash;and more serious than things that affect this life&mdash;that they will bring with them very serious consideration for the future and upon the future of this country and upon the future of every order that is in the country.  If we can only get some real earnest spirit of accommodation from both sides I have no <Col N="52" /> fear whatever but that the result will be satisfactory to the country.</P>

      <P>Before we pass this motion, I would like to raise the question whether or not experience of the past year justifies the appointment of a Minister for Fisheries.  I have no doubt whatever that there is great work to be done, and very important work to be done, in the Department of Fisheries, but I am raising again what I raised before, and that is whether this Department is of such importance at present, and whether it is even possible to place it in a position of importance such as to justify the appointment of a Minister in charge.  I am not going to find very great fault with it, but I am very doubtful indeed whether the work to be done in connection with fisheries will justify the appointment of a Minister, specially in charge of the Department, unless we can be assured that the finance that is necessary to put this on a proper basis to justify a Ministry is likely to be forthcoming.  I do not think that anything that was reported, to the Dáil at any rate, would warrant us in saying that the work of this Department requires the attention of a special Minister.  I can readily conceive that it may do so provided that finance was available in sufficient quantity; but there is no appearance of that, and I think that unless there is some promise that money will be available for the very extensive development that this Department of the National life demands, a Minister in charge of it is not required at the present stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this Ministry of Fisheries, I think it can only be justified on the grounds that there are fish in the rivers and in the seas around our coast.  There is no use in having a Minister for Fisheries without having the fish, and I would like to know from the recent occupant of the office what has been done and what is being done at the moment in regard to our inland or our sea fisheries.  Complaints have been made by the fisherman on practically every river that nothing has been done to protect the fish.  The Ministry of Fisheries has been in existence for some time, and I would like to know <Col N="54" /> what is being done, now that the spawning season has commenced or is about to commence, to preserve our spawning rivers.</P>
      <P>In the constituency I represent nothing to my knowledge has been done to protect fisheries.  Money can be found for everything else in the country evidently, sometimes to the tune of millions, but this matter of fisheries, that requires very little expenditure and that would repay the country perhaps ten hundred per cent., has been left without attention.  Practically all our fisheries have been denuded of fish.  During the recent trouble, when there was no law or protection, all the spawning beds were denuded of fish.  Dynamite had been used in the destruction of fish, and fish have been killed wholesale.  At the present time fishermen on the Nore, the Suir, and the Barrow are making complaints to me and to other Deputies that there is no protection whatsoever for the fish, and they want protection.  They even suggest that if there was nobody else to protect them, the military, who have little to do at the moment, should be sent out.  There is no use in burking the fact that nothing has been done.  I should know a little about fisheries, and I did not acquire my knowledge second-hand.  I have had experience and have lived by fisheries for some time.  I know all that there is to be known about fisheries.  The Minister has this advantage, that he might be able to educate the fish how to protect themselves, seeing the profession that he has been brought up to.</P>
      <P>I would like an assurance that the remnant of the fish left will be protected, and that the spawning stocks will be preserved.  You have no use in appointing a Minister for Fisheries if a serious effort is not made at the beginning of the spawning season.  If a serious effort is not made there is no use in proceeding with the farce of appointing a Ministry of Fisheries which would be a Ministry in name only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>My complaint against the continuation of the Ministry of Fisheries is not that it would not be necessary, but because, in view of the <Col N="55" /> finance of the country, it would be a farce to continue the Ministry and grant it £30,000 a year.  The expense of the Ministry in respect of salaries and wages is £22,000, and the amount of money which these gentlemen administer is £30,000.  I put it to you, is it a reasonable proposition to appoint a Minister when you have no money to develop the Department of which he is the head?</P>
      <P>Would it not be better to wait until our finances are in a proper state before starting off with a Minister and a Department and all the other paraphernalia which can give no results because there is no money to spend?  The whole thing is really a farce and a laughing stock for everybody on the ground of expense.  We should abolish the Ministry, and when we have the money let us support our fisheries, because I believe the fisheries of the country, if properly handled, would yield us as much possibly as the land.  For these reasons I am opposed to the appointment of a Minister for Fisheries at present.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that nothing has been said about the creation of a Ministry of Health. The medical profession, at all events, have been looking forward with some hope that in the new appointments to be made by the present Dáil a Ministry of Health would be among the Ministries formed.  I have not urged this matter very strongly because of the expense connected with it.  One does not want to multiply the number of Ministries, but, as I said on a past occasion, surely the health of the people is of more importance than the fish in the rivers and in the seas.</P>

      <P>We all know, at all events, that we cannot have a healthy population if the health of the people is not looked after, and I say deliberately that the public health of the country is in a very serious condition. I am not going to press this matter at the present moment, because I feel like an orphan in this assembly. I am not going to press the President to add to his Ministries that other <Col N="56" /> Ministry of Public Health, but I am going to suggest that the Government should do the next best thing, and that a Public Health Department should be formed within the Ministry of Local Government, and that there should be a Parliamentary Secretary in the Dáil who would be responsible for the Public Health Department of the Ministry of Local Government.</P>
      <P>I admire very much the work done as Minister for Local Government by Deputy Blythe.  He made himself thoroughly acquainted with the matters relating to the public health of the country, and as we know, he proposed to introduce a Public Health Bill which is one of the Bills that has been delayed owing to the work that the Government had to do before the dissolution of the last Dáil.  I am very conscious that it will be a difficult matter to get a Minister who will be able to follow in the footsteps of Deputy Blythe.  Deputy Blythe had made himself very thoroughly acquainted with the needs of the country, and he understood very clearly the matters that were necessary to help in the public health administration.  Perhaps the President will give me some encouragement by saying that the Government will form such a Department within the Ministry of Local Government and that some Deputy will be responsible for public health matters in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am one of those who, in the first instance, opposed the formation of this Ministry of Fisheries, but the Dáil, in its wisdom, thought otherwise.  The Ministry was formed, and I am not going to oppose it now. But I think the whole Department ought to be scrapped.  As far as I know, it consists of scientists and messenger boys.  The scientists are no good, and they never produce anything.  You get treatises that repel by their very appearance. They could never discover anything.  They never discovered a new fishing ground.  I must beg their pardon.  I think they discovered, two or three years ago, a fish off the Kerry coast that was not caught in any other place except off the coast of Spain. That is so much to their credit.  Deputy Gorey says there is no fish.  There is any amount of fish.  There are hundreds <Col N="57" /> of thousands of square miles of fishing grounds off the coast of Ireland, and up to Iceland, and there has not been the slightest effort made to develop them.  Men from the East coast of England come over and take the fish away.  We have a Ministry of Fisheries with an income of £30,000, and only £3,000 is spent upon development.  All the rest goes on the messenger boys and the scientists, who never produce anything at all.  I think that the whole of them ought to be turned out and men put into the Ministry who know something about the business and who would develop the fisheries of the country.  This previous Ministry of Fisheries have not yet published their report for 1921.  My boots were nearly worn going to Eason's, before the last Dáil dissolved, to try and get the report for 1921, but it has not turned up yet.  They are overpowered with work, but what they are doing I cannot see.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy MacBride's talk about our scientists and the officials of the Department is very ill-mannered, to say the least of it.  It is very cheap for Deputies to get up here and criticise officials who cannot defend themselves. These officials, in a sense, of course, were traditional.  They were handed down to me from the C.D.B. and the D.A.T.I.  At least they have worked loyally with me, and they have performed their duties to my satisfaction. I think it is very bad taste of any Deputy to get up in the Dáil and criticise persons who cannot defend themselves here.  Deputy MacBride stated, and the same mistake was made by other Deputies, less ill-mannered, I should say, that there was only £3,000 for development and that the rest was spent upon administration.  Deputies will remember that when the estimates <Col N="58" /> were brought up it looked as if there was only £3,000 for development, but I pointed out that there was money coming from the C.D.B., something like £25,000 or £45,000&mdash;I have not the figures with me&mdash;that was also to be spent upon development.  When persons criticise it would be well that they should have their figures made up more correctly than the criticisms I have heard this evening would show.</P>
    <P>I should say I agree almost entirely with Deputy Johnson.  I agree that it is a joke to have a Ministry of Fisheries if it is not financed, and I hope that the finance will be forthcoming.  Deputy Gorey asked me about the protection of spawning beds.  Under the existing law that is the duty of the Conservators. The Ministry has really very little control, except inasmuch as it makes a small grant annually to the Boards, and that is the only power the old Fishery Department had as far as protection was concerned.  The Boards of Conservators appointed bailiffs, or whatever they were called, to supervise the rivers, and actually in Deputy Gorey's own county my information is that there was an extraordinary improvement through the action of the Civic Guard and the military in the county.  I think that is all that it is necessary for me to say.  I feel it would be rather bad taste on my part to defend the Ministry to which I am attached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that some of the recent speakers are under the impression that we are criticising or have under consideration the work of the Department of Fisheries. The real question at issue is whether a separate Ministry of Fisheries should be set up or not.  While agreeing with what Deputy Johnson has said, that there is little use in having a Ministry unless it is properly financed, I do hold that a separate Minister for Fisheries is essential.  Knowing something of the condition of our fisheries on the western coast I believe that there is there a vast field for development.  We have very few industries in Ireland, but I am confident that fishing could be developed very much to the benefit of the people who work in the industry, and also the people who through its development <Col N="59" /> would be provided with cheap and wholesome food.  Anyone who knows conditions there, and who has seen, as I have, fishermen unable to send out their boats owing to want of proper tackle and appliances, while, at the same time, trawlers coming over from Fleetwood and Hull rake up at the very doors of the fishermen the harvest that should be theirs, must admit that it is essential a special Department of the Government should be set up to look after what could be a great industry in this country.  If that is to be done properly, it must, as Deputy Johnson stated, be taken seriously, and a matter of £3,000 or £30,000 is nothing when compared with the results that may be attained by properly dealing with the whole question on a big scale. I do not agree with the policy of my friend, Deputy Wilson, in waiting until the finances are there.  You will not have the finances if you wait.  The way to provide finances and to provide employment and money in the country is to set about the development of industries such as this, and for that reason I am prepared to support the establishment of the Ministry of Fisheries.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the appointment of a Minister for Fisheries.  I wish to mention that in the county from which I come there are a number of lakes to which large numbers of visitors came from different parts of England to fish.  Owing to the fact that during the last three, four, or five years 90 per cent. of the trout that went up to spawn in the rivers never came back, that industry at the present time is practically extinct.  In the last couple of years you could count the boats during the May-fly fishing season, whereas four or five years ago, when there was protection, the lakes in that county were dotted with fishing boats. An immense amount of money was spent in the county by the visitors.  I would ask the Minister for Fisheries to endeavour during the coming spawning season to see that the gross abuses which existed, and which I can guarantee to prove did exist, will be stopped. Otherwise it would be much better that the rivers should be blocked up, so as not to allow the trout up to spawn, because <Col N="60" /> when they did go they never came back, and the rivers are so depleted that fishing has become a bye-word. Instead of going to fish now you might as well go out and take the fresh air.</P>

      <P>With regard to the remarks of Deputy Sir James Craig, I think it should be clear to the Dáil that there could be no question of having a Department of Public Health and a Department of Local Government at the same time.  The Department of Local Government is really, so far as it goes, a Department of Public Health. Nearly all the activities of that Department, if you leave out roads, are concerned with Public Health.  Housing and the relief of the necessitous are really matters for a Department of Public Health.  The medical charities or the provision of medical relief is also a matter for the Public Health Department. In the Ministries Bill, which it was not possible to bring before the Dáil, I believe it was the intention that the name should be the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and that the National Insurance Commission would come in under that Department. It would then be merely a matter of choosing a name.  It could be the Department of Health, or the Ministry of Health, or any other name that was suggested.  It is intended really to give a substance to the Department of Health.  There are one or two functions added to it which it is thought would be an administrative convenience to have added.</P>

      <P>In view of the discussion that has been created by the suggestion that Ministries should be allocated in advance, I would like to suggest to the President quite briefly, that it might be better to adopt the procedure adopted in the previous Dáil. Instead of deciding before the Committee meets what are the posts to be filled by the Committee, the Committee itself should undertake the consideration both of the Departments to be created, which are non-Executive Departments, and of the Ministers who shall fill those Departments.  It has been urged that certain revision of Departments should occur.  A proposal <Col N="61" /> has been made that one Department shall be deleted.  Before any decision can be taken on matters of that kind it is perfectly clear that detailed information would be required, such as is not before the Dáil at the present moment, and which is not likely to be before the Dáil under its present constitution.  It is rather a matter to be looked into by a Committee that might call special evidence from the Departments concerned. I therefore suggest, without going into any details, that if the Dáil were to proceed with Resolution 3, appointing the Committee as required under the requisite Article of the Constitution&mdash;Article 55&mdash;that the Committee might be charged not merely with appointing names to certain Departments, but that the Committee might bring recommendations before the Dáil as to what other Departments should be created beyond the six Departments already defined, as existing within the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I notice that during the contests that have just taken place throughout the country a great deal of lopsided financial propositions were dealt with, sometimes in publications, and at other times by speakers. Amongst the rest, in some parts of the country this particular Ministry may have been under discussion.  It would appear from an examination of the estimates for Fisheries that there was some extraordinary extravagance and that where development is only put down for £3,000 the total gross cost of the Ministry would be £55,500.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister for Fisheries a couple of days ago and told him that, so far as I could see, his particular Ministry would be probably criticised and that its retention would probably be questioned in the Dáil.  In considering this particular Ministry one ought to bear in mind what the circumstances of the moment are, and what they have been for the past few years, not alone in this country, but in England, Scotland, and on the Continent.  One should see how the fisheries developed or how the industry of fishing progressed in England during the last couple of years and what its condition is to-day: We should take stock of our particular position with regard to this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> I understand there is no country in Europe with such a coast line suitable for fisheries as we have, and I suppose there is no country in Europe where the fishing industry is at such a low ebb as it is in this country.  That there are potentialities in the fisheries of this country, both internal and external, I think everybody will admit.  Even if there is not sufficient money available to develop fisheries, surely it is not waste of money to have a Minister appointed who will consider how it is best to accommodate the expenses of such development with the financial condition of the country.  I have gone through the report which I have got from the Minister for Fisheries on this subject, and in it attention is drawn to the fact that the fishing industry not alone in Ireland, but in Great Britain, was at its lowest ebb during the last twelve months.  It was due to three causes.  The European markets, it appears, were disorganised through political upheavals.  Mackerel was not in demand in the big centres of population in England since these markets were flooded with fish carried on the steam trawling fleets which had just begun to operate after the war, and even these steam trawling companies were unable to make ends meet.  The general conditions prevailing in Ireland during 1922 did not lend themselves to the development of an industry such as that of fishing, which requires prompt delivery and excellent transit and accommodation, more than is supplied by the ordinary times of the departure and arrival of trains that one sees in the railway companies notices.  It is well known that the loss of a train may possibly involve enormous loss to persons engaged in this calling.  The Minister has shown me tables dealing with the number of English, Scottish and Irish steam vessels.  In England the number is over 2,000, in Scotland it is nearly 1,000, and in Ireland 11. Motor vessels in England number 468, in Scotland over 2,000, and in Ireland 291.  Sailing vessels in England number over 500, in Scotland over 4,000, and in Ireland the number is written down as 3,089, and it is remarked underneath that that number includes 1,639 rowing boats.  The report goes on to say what has been done even under <Col N="63" /> these very depressing and unusual conditions. It states that the fishing season opened last spring, and the task was to induce the fishermen to go to sea.  Many boat-owners had no nets fit for fishing. Their gear had become worn out in fruitless efforts in 1921, and they had no means to buy new ones.  Loans were given by the Ministry to equip the Arklow fleet for the south-west mackerel season which opened in April, and even with the provision of gear they were unwilling to undertake the voyage to Baltimore and other places, as the railway service from Cork to those fishing places was still suspended. The Ministry was compelled to set up a scheme for the transit of these catches to the nearest port to the Welsh markets.  The catches were sold in bulk in Milford Haven by a salesmaster, but the scheme did not prove a financial success, as the fish were late in striking the coast, and the weather was wet and stormy and unsuitable for fishing. Now, the Ministry apparently was satisfied that were it not for the little assistance given in that instance it would have been impossible, if a good deal of the expenses were not available for use in the proper channels, to have got these particular facilities.  Loans, it appears, were made available at Howth, and, generally speaking, from a perusal of this report I would say that the Ministry has not been idle. To my mind the actual sum that would be saved by not having a Minister appointed to this particular activity would not be a financial proposition, and I would be very glad if, in considering financial propositions, a little more study of the fundamentals of finance were given.  I have observed in some publications&mdash;if I may digress for a <Col N="64" /> moment&mdash;that comparisons are made between the cost of the services in 1923 and in 1916.  A child in the matter of finance would tell you that it was much less expensive to live in 1916 than it now.  Comparisons such as these mislead not alone the unfortunate dupe who conceives the idea of making such comparisons, but also mislead others. They do not lead anywhere, and they would not be altered if the persons issuing these publications were trying to do here what we have been trying to do for the last twelve months.  Two points have been under discussion on the question of this Ministry.  One is whether a Minister should be appointed at all, and another is, whether the particular Minister who has been in charge of this Ministry should be re-elected. That is not the point.  The point is, that there are four Ministries put for ward by me, the holders of which will have to be recommended by a Committee of fifteen Deputies in accordance with Article 55 of the Constitution.  I should say that if the Minister for Fisheries had his way a very much larger sum of money would have been included in the Estimates, but whether it is his great respect for me as Minister for Finance, or the power I had over Estimates, they were cut down.  It is a very small amount.  It may be, even in the exceptional circumstances through which we passed, that fishing was not economical, it is just as well that the amount was small.  But there ought to be great opportunities for development, and I think every member is satisfied that there are such opportunities, and if that be so I think they warrant the appointment of such a Ministry.</P>

      <P>What is in the mind of the Ministry in this matter?  Do they desire that the new appointments shall be made at an early date, or do they desire that the actual appointments should be postponed for some time?  I rather anticipated that the appointment of the Committee would be finished this week and that the Committee would meet at once.  I have no doubt the decisions have already been taken.  Therefore, the final result of the election of this Committee, that is the appointments of the Ministers, could be completed at an early date next week.  I do not know what the intention of the Ministry may be in regard to the continuation of the sittings of the Dáil, but I have heard it whispered that there is likely to be an adjournment some day next week for a week or two.  If that is the case we ought to get rid of this little problem before this adjournment.  If we are only to take the election of the Committee on Tuesday, then it means if they are to do any business allotted to them while the other people are adjourning or enjoying the adjournment, the decision will be postponed until the resumption after the adjournment.  That, I think, will be too long distant.  I suggest we get a Committee elected this week.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out this to the Deputy.  He knows some of the difficulties we were in last year.  Permission is asked to introduce a Bill on the 1st of the month. The second reading takes place on the 3rd with some accommodation from the House.  If it passes its second reading on the 3rd it cannot be taken in Committee until the 7th.  So that between the date of the introduction of the Bill and the going into the actual discussion on Committee something like six days must elapse.  Let us assume the Governor-General delivers his speech at a given date.  Obviously members want to see that in print before it is discussed. We were hoping to have the first reading of the Judiciary Bill this evening, the second reading on Tuesday. This election could take place on Tuesday, and we could have the Governor-General's speech on the 3rd of October.  The Judiciary Bill could go into Committee on that date.  Let us give two or three days for that.  Then a discussion could take place on the Governor-General's speech.  In the absence of such arrangements as that we would be almost committed to bringing members up from the country for a day in the week.  We anticipate bringing them up on Tuesday next would obviate the necessity of bringing them up one day only in the week until we settle down to business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move for leave to introduce &ldquo;A Bill for the establishment of Courts of Justice pursuant to the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann, and for the purposes relating to the better administration of justice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Just before the close of the last session I moved for permission to introduce this Bill.  Permission was given, and the Bill is now in print, but the fact that it was not passed in the last session leaves us in the position of having to introduce it again from the very beginning.  For the benefit of members of the Dáil, who were not members of the Third Dáil, I should say that this Bill is drafted on the lines recommended by a Committee which was set up by the Executive Council to consider the whole question.  It was stated during the last session of the Dáil that owing to its importance, and to the fact that it marked such a distinction, such a passing away of what might be called old landmarks and the establishment of a new system, it would be advisable that this particular Bill should be before the country for some time.  It has now been before the country for nearly two months, and, as far as I have been able to find out, there has been no criticism of it.  The Bill is drafted to suit the needs of the country.  It follows out the lines laid down in the Constitution, and we hope that it will give that confidence which courts of justice ought to command in any country.  There are certain objections to it from certain quarters, but they have not found any real volume of public opinion behind them.  I am sure it will not be taken as any slight upon either of the professions mainly concerned if I say that it is natural that there should be objection to it, having regard to the fact that law is going to be made somewhat cheaper for the ordinary citizen in the country.  Naturally, if a particular commodity that was very expensive is going to be made cheaper, somebody must suffer, and, consequently, there will be dissatisfaction among the sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Bill to the Dáil, on the last occasion, I laid some stress <Col N="69" /> on the fact that the system by which the Bench was recruited in the old days did not lend itself to popular approval, and, as a consequence, the courts came to be termed &ldquo;British Courts.&rdquo;  During the struggle that took place for the assertion of the rights of the Nation, alternative courts of justice, called Dáil Courts, were established, and it might have been urged against the Saorstát that a considerable time elapsed before we attempted to bring into being courts which should command, and which ought to command, the confidence of the people, because the system, as it was, was not of our making, and the system that is outlined in this particular Bill is of our making.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not within itself deal in a detailed manner, and could not deal in a detailed manner, with the whole organisation for the administration of justice.  It creates the framework of courts of justice into which the detailed organisation will be fitted. It prescribes, in accordance with the recommendations of the Judiciary <Col N="70" /> Committee, the various grades of courts and measure of jurisdiction in each grade.  It provides that each court shall, by means of a Rule-making Authority, settle the detailed scheme of administration of the courts.  The Rules that will be made for that purpose will be laid upon the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas, so that they can be examined to see that they are administratively satisfactory and really enable the new courts to fulfil the high hopes entertained for a more efficient, expeditious, and less costly judicial system. I accordingly move for permission to bring in this Bill.</P>
