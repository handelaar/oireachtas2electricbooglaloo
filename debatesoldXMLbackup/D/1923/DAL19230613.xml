      <P>The British Government during the European War made certain pledges to the members of <Col N="1808" /> the British armed forces in regard to the provision of housing and of land, and so far as Ireland was concerned they passed an Act entitled &ldquo;The Irish Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Act,&rdquo; in 1919.  Under that Act a certain number of houses were erected and a special department of the Local Government Board carried on the work of acquiring land and erecting houses.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of houses in various parts of the country has been erected.  Now, with the Treaty, and with the establishment of the Free State, of course, new circumstances arise.  The Irish Free State Consequential Provisions Act of 1922, of the British Parliament, provided for the setting up of a Trust &mdash; the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust.  The British Government agreed to provide £1,500,000 for financing the operations of the Trust, provided both the Government of Northern Ireland, as it is called, and the Parliament of the Free State, passed legislation enabling the Trust to hold land and to function.  One member of the Trust will be appointed by the Government of the Free State; another member of the Trust will be appointed by the Northern Government.  I understand legislation enabling the Trust to operate is going through the Northern Parliament.  The houses built will be provided entirely out of the British Exchequer. No cost whatever will fall upon the Free State.  The proportion is not fixed, but we will certainly get from 1,600 to 2,000 houses, or more, because of the operation of this Trust.  I move for leave to bring in the Bill.  The Bill is simply enabling the Trust to act as a Statutory Body and hold lands and carry on its functions.  It will not have any power of acquiring lands compulsorily.</P>

      <P>I think everybody will be gratified that a definite step has been taken towards ensuring that the position of wounded soldiers will be made somewhat secure, and that their widows and children, and the dependants of deceased soldiers, shall be provided for.  It is not the class of Bill that will require very much discussion at this Stage; but one or two questions might be answered, and some difficulties cleared up, by the Minister.  In his statement on the First Reading he made it clear that the Bill would provide for pensions for wounded members, not only of the Volunteers of the time, but of the Citizen Army of the time.  The name of the Citizen Army did not appear in the Bill.  There seems to be no good reason for their exclusion, and when other organisations are referred to by name, it seems to be an unnecessary slight that the Citizen Army should not be referred to by name.  The question also has arisen as to whether the powers of the Bill would include pensions for persons who have suffered disability, not actual wounds, but disability directly traceable to service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that it raises a difficult problem &mdash; the differentiation &mdash; but it is a problem that has to be met, and has been met.  I refer to sufferers from such mental disorders as those which in the European war arose from shell-shock, or disorders of a physical kind arising from lying-out on service, and similar complaints and sufferings which are directly traceable to active service.  It may be claimed that one or two Sections do cover such cases, but one would like to know from the Minister whether they have been in mind in the drafting, and whether he is satisfied such cases are met by the provisions of the Bill.  There is another matter which is a little delicate and difficult to deal with, especially when one bears in mind the composition of the Army of 1916-17-18.  One cannot quite reconcile that Army with the rather striking distinction in the treatment as between officers and men &mdash; the age at which allowances for children of officers and men <Col N="1810" /> ceases.  The distinction there is one I cannot reconcile with the democratic army that we knew.  That criticism may apply very generally to those distinctions. One cannot say that social standing makes it essential that the distinction shall be made, and one cannot see that in those days pay was the factor that decided the distinction.  I would like to hear the Minister's views upon that side of the question.  There are two or three matters of more detail that can be dealt with at a later stage.  These one or two points seem, on a cursory reading, to require some attention and explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to give a welcome to this Bill, I desire, if I may, to underline, underscore, one question that Deputy Johnson has put, and to add a second.  In doing so, I say this is a Bill that is welcomed by this Dáil, and should pass with such slight amendments, if amendments be considered, as may be deemed necessary.  The principle of the Bill is one that carries the general consent unquestionably.  The first question I wish the Minister to answer is respecting the point made by Deputy Johnson with regard to injuries received other than direct wounds.  As the Minister is aware, I know something of one who has had the handling of a large number of cases of this kind for the White Cross, and who is handling such cases now, and merely by way of ordinary information, I can instantly recall some 6 or 7 names of men who are at present receiving treatment.  In the particular case that comes to my mind, a man is suffering from consumption contracted when sleeping out on active service. That kind of case is not easy to deal with, and not so easy to trace as in the case of wounds.  It is very definite and widespread, as I happen to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many a young fellow at that time had his health irremediably broken because of the conditions under which he happened at the time to be conducting the Nation's war.  It will be known to the Minister, that in some of those cases, the assistance that they are now receiving will shortly cease.  Then they will be helpless and will not be in receipt of any further assistance.  Provisions are already being made to set aside sums of money for them by the White Cross, if I am rightly informed.  But this is rather <Col N="1811" /> a question that should be undertaken by the State.  I fail to see how they can be covered by this Bill as it stands.  We think they should be covered by special machinery set up to deal with matters of that kind.  The second inquiry is with regard to the machinery by which the Bill will be worked.  I do not recall that the Minister, on the First Stage, gave any information on this matter.  We remember when the English Government in this country had to deal with soldiers wounded in its war in Europe they set up a special Department that gave special attention to Irishmen in this matter.  The Department worked that with great success, and gave very great satisfaction. Perhaps the Minister has in mind the creation of a Department of that special kind for working this Bill.  Why I bring it to his attention is because I think some special Department of this kind might suitably be created.  Whatever the conception is for the machinery by which the Bill's provisions will be executed, perhaps the Minister, when he comes to conclude this discussion, will give such information as he may have with regard to proposals to that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity of urging upon the Minister not only the desirability, but the absolute necessity, of making provisions in the Bill for the dependants of those who died as a result of hunger-striking.  It may be correct to state, and it is correct to state, that men who were killed on active service have rendered great service to the country and their dependants should be amply provided for.  I contend, however, that the attention of the world was drawn to the Irish war in a far greater degree by the people who undertook to carry out the hunger-strike in prison. During the Anglo-Irish war we had cases of many noted Irishmen whose names I am not going to mention at the moment, but I am sure the Minister will realise that the men who died on hunger-strike did make equally as great a sacrifice as the men who died out in the field in action with the enemy.  We know of several such cases.  There are one or two of them from my own area.  One is a case of a widow with a small family whose husband went through the hunger-strike and who contracted consumption and, as a result, died some short time ago.  It <Col N="1812" /> can be clearly proved by medical authorities that his death was attributable to the effects of the hunger-strike.  There is another case of a young man from my own area also who is at present in a sanatorium.  I do not believe there are many such cases, but they are cases where the Minister might make provision for their dependants under the terms of this Bill, and I would appeal to him to try to do so at a later stage and to have the necessary amendments made so that provision may be made for this particular class of people.  I am quite satisfied that the number would not be very great.  I would like if the Minister in his reply would give the Dáil information of the number of people in his opinion who would come within the terms of the Bill as it is drafted.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that organised representations have been made to the Ministry by the old I.R.A., and, if so, I daresay he would be in a position to give the Dáil the number of men affected by this Bill, which, generally speaking, makes reasonable provision for the men who made sacrifices.  I appeal to him, and I do not think that it would add any great burden to the State funds, to make provision for the dependants of people who died as a result of hunger-strike in prison or after they left it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister for Defence of a few cases which I brought forward here some time ago in reference to young men shot in ambushes during the fight against the enemy Government.  I would also like to bring under his notice the case of a young man, a despatch rider, who got serious wettings and died from pneumonia and whose parents are in a bad state.  I am sure that the Minister fully realises the importance of taking into account the cases of the majority of the men who laid down their lives in 1916 and during the time prior to the Truce.  I particularly mention the case of Captain James Tormey, who was killed on the 2nd February, 1921, outside Athlone.  At that time he was O.C. of the Athlone Brigade fighting against the enemy Government. I understand that his parents have received no compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister, in reply, would say whether it is intended to include in the provisions of <Col N="1813" /> this Bill the cases of men who were acting in the Intelligence Department during the old Volunteer days.  I had a communication from some of these people who, while they were not formally enrolled, were engaged to do intelligence work.  If such can be ascertained to be correct, I think that if any of these men suffered in any way, while performing that work, they should be entitled to come under the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is a point I would like the Minister to deal with in reply.  Up to a few months ago I know that there was at least one man in an asylum as a result of ill-treatment received by enemy forces.  From information which I have got, I believe there are others also in asylums as the result of such ill-treatment.  I would like to know whether such cases will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection of any kind to associate in the title of this Bill the name of the Irish Citizen Army of 1916.  I did mention, in speaking on the last day, the reason why we did not include it in the title, viz., that the Irish Volunteers played rather a different part in the whole struggle that was taking place to bring about the present situation, but the Irish Citizen Army is entitled to be mentioned in the Bill just as it is entitled to be provided for the part which it took at that particular time.  On the question of distinctions between officers and men, you have officers and you have men at the present time bearing rather different responsibilities and playing rather a different part in the work that is carried out by the Army.  In the matter of making a difference in making provision for the dependants, we are bearing that in mind and we are influenced by general precedent. Even in the pre-Truce days you had officers and men, and you had even then a greater distinction between work that was carried out and a greater distinction between the services rendered by officers and men.  The presence or absence of an officer, or two or three officers in any particular district made all the difference in the world as to whether you got any return from the men in the district or not.  I do not see any reason, on the face of it, why the provisions that we propose to make with regard to these two distinct classes should undergo any <Col N="1814" /> change.  I would rather put on anybody else the onus of showing why we should not make different provision for the widow and children of men who acted in the capacity of officers from those who acted simply as men.  On the question with regard to persons who lost their lives as a result of hunger strike, or as a result of disease, or persons incapacitated as a result of these, we have to make rather a distinction between what is possible for the State to do, in a formal way through its machinery, and what it is possible for voluntary societies to do in the case of moneys voluntarily subscribed for the general purpose of giving assistance to people in distress.  The purpose of this Bill is such that we do not desire to leave unprovided for, the dependants of anybody who in any phase of the armed struggle against the British lost his life or became incapacitated.  You will have to be very careful in the matter of persons who say that they are suffering from consumption because of services rendered by them in a military capacity and because of nights they slept out. Voluntary societies may deal readily and generously with cases like that, but it is a different matter for the State to come along with its particular type of responsibility and handling money taken from people for definite purposes, to be indiscriminate about these matters.  Our outlook on the Bill is that if a person died on hunger-strike in protest against the British in their actions here, to make provision for his dependants, or if a person died directly as the result of any action due to such protest to make provisions for his dependants also. I will have the provisions of the Bill examined to see whether, as they stand, they do secure that, and if they do not, to see what amendment is necessary to make that secure.  The machinery it is proposed to set up is that we shall have a Medical Board, which will be responsible for examining all cases from the medical point of view and give decisions on medical points, and we shall have a Pensions' Board, set up by the Executive Council, which will deal with the judicial aspect of the examining of each case and the assessing of the various pensions. There will be set up under that Pensions Board the necessary machinery for the proper carrying out of the work in connection with the payment of these pensions. Any person who can be declared <Col N="1815" /> to have been a member of the Irish Volunteers, and to have given service will come within the scope of this Bill, and those persons who served actively and definitely as Intelligence Officers or members of the Intelligence Branch of the Volunteers would be included also.  As far as the number of persons likely to have to be provided for is concerned, all I can say at the present moment is that roughly the number of people during the 1916 period, and that general period, who were killed or who died as an immediate result of their service at that time, is less than 100.  The number of persons who, in the second period, that is down to the period of the Truce, who were killed in one way or another, amounts to 650, approximately.  The number of persons who, in the present struggle lost their lives, is, approximately, 540.  I am not in a position to give any approximate figures with regard to the persons who are permanently or semi-permanently disabled at the moment.</P>

We have to attend here daily in addition to other occupations we have occasionally to fulfil, and, perhaps, if it is not an urgent matter, <Col N="1816" /> we might have a lengthened time before going on to the next stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To insert after the word &ldquo;judgment,&rdquo; line 28, page 6, the words &ldquo;Provided <Col N="1817" /> that where a contract of tenancy entered into since the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, contains a provision which imposes upon the landlord liability for, or in respect of, Poor Rate, such provision shall be deemed valid, notwithstanding anything in Section 52 of the aforesaid Act, so that poor rate charged upon the tenant pursuant to the judgment in Bradshaw v M'Mullan, shall not be considered a part of rent &ldquo;lawfully due&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 4 (1) (a) hereof.</P>
    <P>Deputy Magennis has asked me to move this amendment.  I do not know a lot about it, but I do believe that there is something in it that would remedy a defect in the Bill, because where a landlord contracts to pay a certain proportion of the rates by reason of a judgment given in the House of Lords, and which was reversed on appeal here in Ireland, the landlord was relieved of that responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do think that before this Bill is passed if this amendment is not accepted there should be a provision in the Bill whereby that could be restored.  If a landlord covenants with a tenant to pay any portion of the Poor Rate I do not think that he should be allowed to get out of that liability by a judgment of any Court.  Lawyers of course turn cases inside out, and many times attach meaning to them that was never intended. I move that this amendment be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment that stands in Deputy Prof. Magennis' name is intended to deal with a grievance that has become known as the Bradshaw and McMullan grievance.  Whatever may be said as to the propriety of quoting a particular lawsuit in an amendment to an Act the fact remains that there is or there was in the past a very definite grievance which gave rise to that lawsuit. The Local Government Act of 1898 placed the burden of the Poor Rate on the occupier in all circumstances, and made void any contract to the contrary. A great many people unaware of that went into tenancies under which the landlord bound himself or undertook to pay all rates.  It was open to the landlord in law to repudiate that, and to fall back on Section 52 of the Local Government <Col N="1818" /> Act of 1898.  That procedure can only be compared to a pleading of the Gaming Act.  The landlord who did that had undoubtedly his Chapter and Section for it, but it was not an equitable and scarcely an honourable performance. That was the issue involved in this particular case which the Deputy has thought fit to quote in his amendment. Deputy Prof. Magennis, I think, has scarcely had time to read this Bill as closely as he might, because the Bill in fact deals with that question, and the necessity for dealing with it was very much before the minds both of the Departmental Committee which was set up to advise the Ministry and of the Ministry's officials themselves.  The process by which it is dealt with is rather elaborate and would need to be carefully followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right to say there was very little tendency on the part of landlords to fall back on that 1898 Act until this particular house famine that we are now attempting to deal with, even in a small way, arose.  It is probable that if they had attempted to fall back upon that Act in breach of their undertaking in more normal times that the tenant would have left the house in indignation, and landlords 8 or 10 years ago did not like to have their houses empty.  When the shortage became very acute and it was clear that no tenant who was firmly established in a house would leave even though he might feel that he was labouring under a grievance there were a certain number of cases of that kind where landlords definitely went back on the undertakings which they gave the tenants and threw back on to the tenant, depending on the Local Government Act of 1898, the burden of the rate.  The object of this amendment is clear; it is to alter the law so that no such transfer of burden shall count against any increase of rent which could otherwise be claimed.  We agree entirely with the object, but point out that the object is achieved in the Bill and that the Amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.  The object is achieved through the terms of Sec. 2, where the standard rent is defined. In Sub-section 2 of that Section it is provided that the standard rent is the actual rent in 1913 less any rates chargeable on the occupier; that is less the Poor Rate.  And the word used in <Col N="1819" /> that Sub-section, it will be noticed, is &ldquo;paid,&rdquo; not &ldquo;payable.&rdquo;  The importance of the fact that the word &ldquo;paid&rdquo; is used and not the word &ldquo;payable&rdquo; will be appreciated by reference to Section 8, where we find that the addition which may be made in respect of rent and rates are respectively 10 per cent. of the standard rent, and (2) the full amount of the rates which are chargeable on the tenant but are payable by the landlord.</P>
    <P>Now, it would take a considerable time to show by general reasoning that this provision remedies the McMullan grievance. Take a specific example.  A tenant who had a contract in 1913 under which he paid £60 rent and the landlord paid £5 Poor Rate, will serve as an example. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the landlord repudiating his technically illegal contract.  He can still say to the tenant the day after the Bill becomes law, &ldquo;You must pay all the Poor Rate; I know that I contracted to do so, but I repudiate that contract, and the law will uphold me in that repudiation.&rdquo;  And the law, if this Bill becomes law, will uphold him, and the tenant will have to pay the full Poor Rate, but when it comes to determining the new rent the tenant will get his own back, because the landlord's standard rent is the net 1913 rent; this is not including the £5 Poor Rate, and he cannot add the Poor Rate to it, because the Poor Rate is not payable by him within the meaning of Section 8, Sub-section 1 (b), which reads:&mdash;&ldquo;An amount not exceeding the amount for the time being payable by the landlord in respect of the rates chargeable, or which but for the provisions of any Act would be chargeable on the occupier.&rdquo;  He cannot add the Poor Rate to that, because the Poor Rate is not payable by him within the meaning of Section 8, in asmuch as he has successfully refused to pay it.  The thing turns absolutely on the word payable.  The result is, that when the landlord repudiates what is, in fact, his moral liability for the Poor Rate, relying on the fact that that contract is technically illegal, it comes back on him as a perfectly legal liability under this Act in the form of a diminution of the increased rent which he could otherwise claim.  We contend then, and we are confident of it, that the grievance underlying the Bradshaw v. McMullen case is <Col N="1820" /> met absolutely and without question in the Bill, and our position is that Deputy Professor Magennis's amendment is superfluous.  It is not a matter which we would be at all likely to take any risks about.  That particular grievance was definitely under the consideration of the Committee and under the consideration of my Ministry, and we give a very positive assurance to the Dáil that it is amply covered.</P>

      <P>When certain Courts, known as Sinn Fein Courts, sat in different parts of the country, a certain gentleman, very well known to the Minister and to myself, acting as judge in those Courts, gave judgment on one occasion in a case in which a father had left a farm to his two sons, and the elder took possession of the farm.  It was decided that the elder brother was to divide the farm in halves and leave the younger brother the choice as to which half he would have.  I imagine that there is something of the same kind of mind displayed in this matter, and very ingenious it is.  I am perfectly satisfied so far as I am personally concerned &mdash; and I discussed this matter with Deputy Professor Magennis &mdash; that in the case cited by the Minister the point intended to be achieved by the amendment has been achieved by the terms of the drafting, and, as I said before, very ingenious drafting it proves to be.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very well aware that one can never gamble with certainty &mdash; if one can ever gamble with certainty &mdash; on the possibilities of what the law may do or how the law may interpret certain provisions.  I would suggest that it might be well in cases of this kind to achieve this purpose by direct specific negation of this possibility rather than to leave two or three spring traps in the way of the landlord, so that if he is not snared in one he will be snared in the other.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear the lucid explanation given by the Minister of the rather subtle manner in which he has sought to achieve what Deputy Magennis's amendment also seeks to achieve.  But, greatly daring, I may say that I am not quite satisfied that the Minister has altogether succeeded in attaining his object.  I do agree that the amendment is out of place, and <Col N="1821" /> I think, out of order.  The amendment proposes incidentally to a section of the Act to repeal for all purposes a section in another Act of Parliament.  I think that is a clumsy and an unsatisfactory way of achieving that object.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if the Ministry agree that the decision complained of is wrong, they ought to take the line of putting in a special section in this Act explicitly repealing the Section of the Local Government Act of '98, upon which that objectionable decision was based.  Then, no question could arise.  Surely it must be plain &mdash; and I think the Minister, on reflection, will agree &mdash; that there will be cases outside this Act to which the objectionable decision will still continue to apply, and there will be also cases in which it will continue to apply between a particular landlord and a particular tenant before the Act comes into operation.  If that be so &mdash; if there be cases outside the Act which the decision will continue to apply to, and if there be cases to which the decision will continue to apply until some future date, when the Act comes into operation, as between particular landlords and particular tenants &mdash; surely it is better directly to repeal this particular objectionable section, and thereby do away with all question of what the intention of the legislature was when this section comes to be canvassed in the Law Courts.</P>

      <P>It occurs to me that there may be a way of meeting this difficulty which will avoid confusion and trouble.  It could be met by the landlord, in presenting his claim for rent &mdash; which is rates compounded &mdash; being obliged to divide the amount of rent from the amount of rates and intimate to the tenant that fact.  I am doubtful of the wisdom of making alterations in the law, which would remove from the citizen, or tenant, the ultimate liability for rates in the city in which he lives.  I am inclined to think that that is quite a good and acceptable principle, but that where, for <Col N="1822" /> the convenience of both landlord and tenant, the price of the house, for a given period, is to include rates, the landlord, acting in fact as the agent for the citizen in the payment of such rates, ought to make the ratepayer aware on every occasion what his rent and what his rates are.  Then the danger would be avoided. I doubt the wisdom of putting in a Clause in the Bill which is going to remove liability for rates from the citizen.  I am sure I will not be thanked by many people for saying this, but, it is my firm conviction that the citizen of a city and the occupier of a house in a district ought to know that he is paying rates, and that it is his money &mdash; not the landlord's money &mdash; that is going to the upkeep of the city or district in which he resides. I would not like to remove that principle from the law in respect of house-rents, by inserting in this Bill a provision which would have that effect.</P>

      <P>We have the concrete fact that to-day most of the tenancies in existence in Dublin were entered into in ignorance, or forgetfulness, of the particular section in question, and, consequently, that Section is non-existent for most people, except so far as the objectionable decision referred to has brought it into being again.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that the citizens should be liable for the rates in all cases, but where a landlord contracts with the tenant that he is to pay half a certain rate, I do not think he should be allowed, while the tenant is in possession, to make him liable for all.  If a landlord is satisfied when he is getting a certain rent, and <Col N="1823" /> when he is allowing half of the Borough rate that the tenant pays, that landlord should, in justice, be made keep his contract. I want to see that made plain in this Bill when it is going through, so as to protect the tenants against any landlord who may go back on the agreement he makes when the man enters into possession. There should be no ambiguous language used in the Bill by which the landlord can find a way out.</P>

The Bill leaves it open to the landlords to fall back on the Act of 1898, but it absolutely removes all inducement for them to do so.  Now, we would undertake between this and the Report Stage to reconsider the mere wording of the Bill, with a view to, if possible, making that fact more apparent to lay minds.  The thing to remember is, it is not for a Minister for Home Affairs to go into a question of the incidence of rates, or to attempt in a Bill which is of its very nature temporary and emergency to alter the permanent Local Government code.  That would be a matter for the Minister for Local Government to consider, and it could be dealt with in a later Act.  The question of bringing out more clearly the fact that the Bradshaw <i>v.</i> McMullan grievance is amply met in the Bill will be considered between this and the Report Stage, and we may possibly alter the wording of the Bill to meet the case.</P>

The owner who lets his house at the seaside for May and June should not be faced with the possibility of his tenant claiming to retain possession, under the Act, for July, August and September; or again, an owner of a house and garden with a gate-lodge ought not to find himself quite unable to dispose of his property because the occupant to whom he lets the lodge says <i>J'y suis, J'y reste.</i>  The provisions in the Act of 1920 intended to meet the case have, in practice, proved inadequate, and several cases of extreme hardship have been cited to us.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is very much to the convenience both of the landlords and of the prospective tenants that there should be freedom in that matter.  Yesterday I spoke of that position which exists on a large scale through the country of houses where tenants are accepted by virtue of their employment, their tenancy dependent on and contingent on their employment. I admit that there can be criticism of that system.  I admit that certain employers may hold the heavy hand over an employee and may use unfair leverage for the fact that when the employment ends, the tenancy also ends.  They <Col N="1825" /> may attempt to exploit unduly the difficulties of the tenant-employee's position. But if you insert an amendment of this kind, then, in effect, you leave no opening for this kind of casual letting, and no householder will consent to make such a casual letting.  You simply bar the door against him.  Under the 1920 Act you had a position where a man gained employment as a gardener or something of that kind, living in the gate lodge, and then, for one reason or another, when the employment ended, claimed the right absolutely to remain on as tenant after the termination of the considerations that gave rise to the tenancy.  I submit that it is to the convenience of the prospective tenants and prospective employees that there should be a certain latitude in this matter and that the effect of that amendment would be merely to make such lettings impossible.  If a person has a position by virtue of employment, there must be power to make room for a successor when a new appointment becomes necessary.  The amendment would certainly necessarily mean that that system of tenancy contingent on employment would come absolutely to an end.  I doubt very much if on reflection the Deputy himself would consider that a desirable thing.  Certainly we do not, and we are aware of the anomalies and hardships which the 1920 Act gave rise to.  This Bill has been framed on the experience of that Act, and the evidence tendered to the Committee on these anomalies and hardships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister cannot see his way to accept this amendment, at least in so far as it affects houses occupied by persons in the employment of the owner.  I am surprised especially when I consider his speech opposing the amendment re alternative accommodation.  Everything said in opposition to that amendment was said because of the existence of Courts which would decide with a reasonable amount of justice or with a general sense of justice the hardship on landlord or on tenant, and that it was quite fair to trust to the judgment of the Courts in such a matter.  That argument convinced the Dáil, or a majority of the Dáil at any rate.  We now ask that the same course should apply in the case of the occupant of the house which is the property of the employer.  We say, &ldquo;Let the Court decide <Col N="1826" /> whether there is to be greater hardship on the owner or upon the occupier.&rdquo;  We say, &ldquo;Leave it to the Court to decide that question.&rdquo;  That seems to be a pretty fair deduction from the arguments used yesterday, and the Minister minimises the risk of hardship upon the tenant.  There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of families in houses to-day through the country, which houses are the property of the employer of the tenant.  Railway companies' houses, for instance, and houses which are owned by shopkeepers, the employees of whom are occupiers. The fact that the tenant can be removed by the will of the landlord is placing that man and his family in a position of utter helplessness.  He can be evicted under the terms of the Bill as it stands, or alternatively accept any terms of employment that the employer wishes to impose on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds of cases which one could cite of employers using the fact that the employee occupied a house of the employer, as a lever to compel acceptance of terms and conditions which would not otherwise be accepted. Now you are placing these people in a position of absolute dependence on the employer.  When the alternative accommodation is not available, the alternative to accepting the conditions which may be imposed is to find another house somewhere, and there are no houses to be found.  What we ask in this amendment is that before an eviction of that kind can take place, the Courts shall be satisfied that there is alternative accommodation.  That is what is asked for in this amendment, and that the provisions of Sub-section 3 of this specific Clause should be applicable. That seems to me to be quite a reasonable proposition.  The amendment might be accepted by the Minister if it were made to apply to dwelling houses let to a tenant during his continuance in any office, appointment or employment, and the Section may stand with respect to houses let for temporary convenience or to meet a temporary necessity, that is to say, to meet summer lettings.  We have no desire to bring that into the provisions of this amendment, but in the other case I think the Minister ought be convinced that the hardships may be heavy on tenants who are absolutely dependent on their employers for house room, and to leave it to the operations <Col N="1827" /> of Sub-section 3 before they can be evicted.  I would press the Minister to reconsider his attitude on this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment in substance amounts to an alienation of property.  It is asking really that a tenancy acquired and initiated on very definite conditions should now become something quite different, and that a casual letting contingent upon employment should be converted into fixity of tenure as long as the rent was paid.  We have to consider the hardships and anomalies that such a provision would give rise to.  Take this as a convenient example &mdash; this gate lodge position.  A man is engaged as a gardener.  He gets the casual letting, the temporary and contingent letting of the gate lodge.  Six or eight months or a year later he sees the prospect of better employment, higher wages down the road, and he goes. He continues to live in the gate lodge and refuses to leave.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to make a matter for the Court the clear exercise of the house-owner's rights, to subject that as if it were something that lay in question.  But it is not and it ought not to be, deemed a matter that can be called in question before a Court. It is a matter of undoubted right.  It is a matter of definite undertaking that a man securing employment and getting as a perquisite, or condition, of that employment, temporary residence, that temporary residence should end when the employment ends.  It is not proposed to make that a matter for the Court to say the last word upon, and it is not proposed to enable anyone to call that clear possession of right into question before any tribunal.  Now, at the risk of monotony, let me say that these matters were very thoroughly gone into before a Committee on which the conflicting interests were very fairly represented.  We thought it wise to base the Bill very strictly and very closely on the recommendations of that Committee.  We did not think it either wise or safe to venture far from the recommendations of that Committee, and we have adhered to these recommendations even in respect of certain matters <Col N="1828" /> where our own inclinations would lie otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy speaks of thousands of cases throughout the country where you have this position of employees living in the houses of their employers.  I admit that cases of that kind are numerous but we cannot agree to be put in the position of saying that a tenancy acquired very definitely as the result of employment, and by virtue of that employment shall continue beyond the expiration of that employment, or that the question as to whether it should or not, should be left as a matter for a tribunal to decide, or that the unreasonable odium in many cases, but, nevertheless the undoubted odium, should be put on the Court of saying that such tenancies should expire. It is a matter of agreement, of fair contract, and it will be bad if you take a step that would result in making these casual lettings impossible and making it necessary for the house-owner to tie up, in the strictest way, a person going into his house as a condition, or by virtue, of employment.  I cannot accept the amendment. These representations were made to the Committee, and the Committee did not think it fit to pass on to the Ministry such recommendations.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that he followed out the recommendations of the Committee very closely.  Yesterday evening, when the Dáil was discussing Deputy Johnson's amendments to Sub-section 1 <i>(d)</i>, I was absent but I support the present amendment before the Dáil, because I think that the clause regarding the greater hardship covers Sub-section <i>(a).</i>  I would like to explain my view of the recommendations of the Committee.  We had before us certain cases, as the Minister has mentioned, of gate lodges, and cases where houses had been let temporarily just prior to the Act coming into force, where tenants took advantage of the Act to remain on for years afterwards.  It was on that account that we decided that alternative accommodation should be a condition, and that the question whether the greater hardship lay on the tenant or owner should be considered.  I intended yesterday to press for Deputy Johnson's amendment for alternative accommodation on the ground that Sub-section 8, which the Minister has moved, covers all the reasons the Committee had <Col N="1829" /> for putting in the Clause with regard to greater hardship.  Personally, if the &ldquo;alternative accommodation&rdquo; amendment had been accepted, I would be quite willing to support Sub-section 8, simply because I considered myself compelled to do so, as it would comply with that recommendation of the Committee but with that term &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo; included in Sub-section 1 <i>(b)</i> I think there is no necessity for Sub-section 8. Therefore, I support the amendment, and at the same time, I will ask the Minister to consider the question of alternative accommodation on the lines of Deputy Johnson's amendment yesterday evening, being included in the Fourth Reading of the Bill.  Except for these points, I think the Bill follows very closely the recommendations laid down by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just say that there have been many cases which will be affected by this section as it stands and I think the Minister will be interested to know that during the time when he was acting in another capacity, when the strike against carrying munitions was operating, many railwaymen, occupants of railway companies' cottages, were served with notice of eviction. Now it may be reasonable to say that these men ceased their connection with the Company voluntarily and, therefore, that they should be evicted from their houses.  That may be the view of the Minister but it is not only in time of strike that Railway Companies serve notice upon their tenants. A case in point is provided where a man in Co. Dublin has been arrested on suspicion and the Railway Company has no reason to believe that he is guilty, and have no reason for dismissing him, but they seem to have obtained possession of his house.  Under this Bill, if it passes, even though the man proves absolutely his innocence of any offence of any kind against either the Company or the State, if any member of the Company's staff has a grudge against the man, he can put in a claim for the house, and there can be changes and changes of that kind. More apposite cases could, however, be quoted where shop assistants and shop managers were brought from one part of the country to another years ago, long before the war, and rented a house from <Col N="1830" /> the employer, perhaps a mile away from the place of business.</P>
      <P>It may be well contended under this section that that is a part of the condition of employment, that it is incidental to the employment.  You are letting the employer of that man use the fact that he resides in one of his houses as a means of &mdash; shall I say &mdash; coercion, compelling him to accept certain conditions under the penalty of eviction.  I am surprised at the position taken by the Minister in this, because the whole Act is an interference with the rights of the owner of the house, and why that distinction should be drawn between a house that is owned by the employer of a man, and another house owned by another man, passes my understanding.  There may be cases where special hardship would be imposed on the owner of the house, if you retain the rights of the tenant under all circumstances to remain in that house, but we are asking you to use that machinery which you, yourselves, have provided for the Court to say whether it is a reasonable case.  We are not asking in this case to provide alternative accommodation.  We are asking that the Courts should also have power to act in those cases, and in the case of tenancies where the dwelling house is the property of the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to enlarge on the subject just dealt with by Deputy Johnson.  The Minister appears to take the view that the houses, in which certain classes of people live, are houses that are given because the occupiers are employed by a company or an individual, and that the house is charged at such rate so that it may be taken as part of the emoluments of the individual employee. Now, take the case of a Stationmaster. The house in the case of a Stationmaster is provided by the Company at the station, in order that he may be convenient to the station premises, so as to make this individual, at all times available in the interests of the Company, especially for the protection of the Company's property.  There was a time when houses were provided for Stationmasters, and the arguments used by the Minister might be taken as correct. The house was provided, and the nominal rent was charged.  Under the new condition of service the Stationmaster is <Col N="1831" /> charged what is to be considered the proper rent according to the classification of the station.  I fail to see why provision should be made in a case of this kind to deprive the individual of his house, especially in such a case as Deputy Johnson refers to.  I know the particular case he refers to, and another where one individual Stationmaster is in prison, and where the Company seeks to put him out of his house, although he has not been tried or found guilty on any particular charge.  Until the Company can prove him guilty of some charge they cannot determine his employment, and have no right to deprive him of his house.  There is another case where an individual was charged with a certain offence brought into the Courts, and where the case was remanded to the City Commission.  Between the time of trial at the Police Courts and trial at the Commission the Company sought to put this man out of his house, although it had not been proved that he was guilty of the charge on which he was arrested.  Cases of this kind should be brought into account in the Bill, and the Bill should be made to prevent people from being ejected so far as the Company is concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, when he finds himself weak on general principles, is never at a loss for specific cases, and as he has a monopoly of knowledge with regard to specific cases, he can present them in a way eminently calculated to support the contention he happens to be pressing at the time.  I prefer to deal with the general principles, and not to be drawn into specific cases. If I wished to deal with specific cases, I could point to cottages of the General Prisons Board, occupied by men, by virtue of their positions as warders.  I could point to cottages built by the Tramway Company, and so on and I could elaborate the hardship to the employer whether individual or company, if people claim the right to remain on in those dwellings as long as they pay rent, and after they will have gone elsewhere to some more remunerative employment.  Further, Deputy Nagle thinks that we are not adhering to the Report.  Paragraph 14 of the Report deals expressly with this case.  It would be impossible in the case of the scope of the <Col N="1832" /> Act of 1920 to provide against all exceptional cases of hardship, but every reasonable effort should be made, and it seems there are certain lettings of a purely casual character that should be exempt from the application of this Act, or at least from its restrictions.  The owner of a house at the seaside who lets it for a month or two to a tenant, should not be faced with the possibility of having that tenant for a longer period; or again, the owner of a house and garden, with gate lodge, ought not to find himself quite unable to dispose of his property because the occupant to whom he let the lodge says <i>j'y suis, j'y reste.</i> Deputy Johnson says that the whole Act is an interference.  I admit that, but I do not agree with him when he says &ldquo;You have scratched these people; you have drawn blood; why not cut through the jugular vein and make an end of it.&rdquo; He may think that that is a splendid argument: &ldquo;You have encroached to a certain degree on strict property rights; finish the job.&rdquo;  In fact, we do not find any temptation at all along those lines. We rather regret that a particular emergency, a particular disease in the social system, has necessitated such an interference with individual rights.  We do admit it has necessitated it, but we are not prepared to go any further than our own conception of what the emergency demands, and so, because we have drawn blood, we will not cut a jugular vein.</P>

If a dispute took place in one of these firms and the landlord happened to be looking out for other employees from a different part of the country, would he, under this Section, be allowed to evict the tenants?</P>

      <P>Furthermore, in the case of labourers' cottages owned by District Councils, a large number of tenants of these cottages work on the roads.  They may be employed for 20 years, and they may be living in those cottages for that period.  When they are no longer of use to the District Council are these men liable to be evicted from the labourers' cottages, although they have paid for them in rent.</P>

This Sub-section says that the Act shall not apply to any dwellinghouse provided by a Local Authority under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919, or under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921.</P>

      <P>I know a number of landlords throughout the country who have a large amount of house property. Their employees live in their houses, and those employees are working for them and living in those houses for 25 or 30 years.  These employees come to be regarded as a piece of machinery, and in old age are thrown on the scrap heap. Is the employer to be allowed not alone to throw them on the scrap heap but to evict them?  I think that is rather unjust, <Col N="1834" /> and I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter before allowing this Clause to go through.  I may say that I am not in favour of the Bill, but I would like to make a bad Clause as good as I can.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of Deputy Lyons to one class of case which he does not consider. That is the case referred to in the last sentence read out by the Minister from Section 14 of the Departmental Committee's Report &mdash; the owner of a house and garden with a gate lodge.  The tenancy of the gate lodge man is, according to Section 8, during his &ldquo;continuance in the office, appointment or employment.&rdquo; The owner wishes to sell the property and, as Deputy Lyons, perhaps, forgets, he has to give clear possession to the buyer.  He cannot give clear possession if there is an irremovable tenant in the gate lodge.  In the case of a house, with stable and loft attached, the stable and loft may be sub-let to a cabman who employs it not only to shelter his horse and cab but also to shelter himself.  If the owner wishes to dispose of the property, he must first determine the tenancy of the cabman.  Otherwise he cannot deliver up clear possession, and unless he can give clear possession he cannot sell.  After all, if we are here to weep over the hardships of suffering humanity, we ought to have some tears to spare for the owners of property as well as for their victims.</P>

      <P>May I just draw attention to the terms of this amendment, which says nothing about the gate lodges or stables.  The minds of Deputies seem to be fixed upon these exceptional cases. The Minister says, &ldquo;We have called attention to exceptional cases.&rdquo;  True, but there are very many more classes of people affected by this Section than residents in gate lodges.  I would be quite prepared to leave them to the Section as it stands, but remember what the amendment proposes to do.  All it proposes to do is to say &ldquo;that a dwelling-house let to a tenant during his continuance in any office, appointment or employment&rdquo; shall come under the provision of Sub-section 3, which merely says &ldquo;the Judge shall have power to adjourn the application or to stay or suspend the execution of any such order or judgment <Col N="1835" /> or postpone the date of possession for such period or periods as he thinks fit, and subject to such conditions in regard to payment of arrears,&rdquo; and so on, &ldquo;as the Court may think fit.  He may then discharge or rescind any such order or judgment.&rdquo;  It is throwing the whole onus of deciding this case upon the Court, and that is the very argument that was used here last night.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister when he states that he cannot think of any suggestion that would afford a compromise under this particular Clause.  There is something more behind this Clause than what the ordinary eye can see.  I say frankly that it makes provision for dealing with people who may go on strike.  In the case of a <Col N="1836" /> railway company's houses or any other company's houses it gives the power to evict during a dispute.  Further, according to my reading of the Bill, it makes provision for blacklegs who may be brought in to take the place of the men on strike, and go into the houses, although the workers' services may not have expired with the company with whom the dispute is going on.  That is my reading of the Clause.</P>

      <P>The object of this is to place the landlord and the tenant on equal terms.  I am sure the Minister will applaud that desirable intention.  As I read the Bill, at the expiration of the Act the tenant may be bound to give three months or such other length of notice as the contract of tenancy will require, but the landlord shall not be in such bond.  Notwithstanding anything in the contract of tenancy, he shall not be required to give any notice to quit: he may enter into occupation at once.  If I have not understood correctly the meaning of the Bill, I would like to be corrected, but it appears to be unfair that, on the expiration of the operation of the Act, the tenant automatically could be evicted without notice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson is half right.  The position is that there are really two tenancies.  There is the contractual tenancy, which is assumed to expire and to be artificially prolonged by the statutory tenancy which this Act establishes.  What Deputy Johnson's amendment amounts to, in effect, is to ask that the statutory tenancy should not expire with the Statute which gave rise to it, but that it should have the life of three months beyond the lifetime of the Act which establishes it.  We have to remember that that is the effect of the amendment, to prolong control after the Act expires.  Personally, I am not satisfied there is sufficient reason for doing that.  It is a concession to the tenant that he has been allowed to remain in possession after the expiration of his contractual tenancy, and that that contractual tenancy has been artificially prolonged <Col N="1840" /> by the statutory tenancy provided for in this Act.  As the Bill stands, when the Statute expires the statutory tenancy will expire with it, as we think it should. The contractual tenancy will have expired long since, and there seems no sufficient reason why the tenant should be given any further special rights.  We take it this Bill has a lifetime of three years.  Presumably, if the Parliament of the day considers that the conditions are still such as to require control, the Bill will be renewed and prolonged.  There seems no reason for saying that after the necessity for control and after the Act providing for control expires, that there should be still a period, even a period of two or three months, in which the effects of the Act are allowed to continue to run.</P>

      <P>It may be wrong, but it is the only explanation that suggests itself to me for the amendment. This section should be read with the following one, where a corresponding right is given to the tenant, and <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i> stand or fall together.  There is no reason why the landlord should not be in a position to secure the full rent allowed within the limits of this Bill.  This section merely provides for that, as sub-section (c) provides that a tenant may apply for reduction.  They are reciprocal rights, but the proposal before us amounts to striking out one and leaving in the other.  Section 7 was rendered necessary by the peculiar provision in the Act of 1920 that a landlord could not agree with an incoming tenant as to rent without formally serving notice to quit. The effect of Section 7 is to remove this anomaly by making it possible to have agreements, and the Bill provides that that agreement can be modified in accordance with the general idea of the <Col N="1843" /> Bill.  It is a perfectly fair provision, and opposition to it can only be explained by some peculiar idea that one man was not as good as another, and if one happens to own a house and another wants to occupy it, that ownership of a house places a man in a position of inequality or inferiority.</P>

      <P>If the Minister deals with plain, blunt facts, I wish he would draft the Bill in plain, simple language, as then perhaps we would not get involved in any difficulties.  Section 7, so far as the plain, blunt man can understand it, determines the rent to be paid by tenants, and says that within the limits of the Act the landlord and tenant may agree on a rent which is less than the standard rent.  It is very unlikely, of course, but they may agree that a house for which the standard rent is £50 may be let at £45, but if at any time, according to sub-section <i>(b)</i>, the landlord takes it into his head that the agreement no longer operates, all he has to do is to give notice and say that the rent henceforward shall be sixty pounds.  Sub-section <i>(c)</i> is a different matter altogether. The tenant's right in that is only a claim for reduction when there has been, say, a change in the rates and when the landlord is charging more than he is entitled to.  The tenant then has to prove that he is entitled to a reduction. <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> deal with provisions in the Bill, whereas <i>(b)</i> touches the agreements come to in regard to payments of something less than standard rent, and the landlord is free to break the agreement.  That is what the Minister asks us to agree to.  If the Bill means what a blunt man reads into it, I would like the Minister to explain, and if not I would like to know if he means anything else.</P>

The Bill <Col N="1844" /> provides in <i>(a)</i> of Section 7, Sub-Section (1), that &ldquo;The landlord and tenant may by agreement determine the rent to be paid by the tenant for the time being under this Act, and in such case and subject to the provisions of the Act the rent so determined shall, until varied by new agreements or by notice under this section, be and continue to be the rent to be paid in respect of such dwelling-house.&rdquo;  That is plain and blunt enough for anyone. It provides that the landlord and tenant may come to an agreement.  It does not say what the agreement is to be.  It does not even exclude insanity on the part of the tenant agreeing to pay a rent in excess of the terms of this Bill, any more than it excludes the conception of the landlord agreeing to take less.  It simply says that an agreement may be arrived at, but it goes on to provide in <i>(b)</i>&ldquo;If at any time the rent to be paid by such tenant does not exceed the standard rent or exceeds the standard rent by less than the amount permitted by this Act, the landlord, notwithstanding any temporary agreement under this sub-section, may serve upon such tenant a notice increasing such rent not exceeding the standard rent by more than the amount permitted under this Act.&rdquo;  The net result of <i>(a)</i>, <i>(b)</i>, and <i>(c)</i> is this, that agreement may be arrived at by which either party agrees to accept the terms, either more or less than what he is entitled to by the provisions of the Bill, but there is liberty to both parties by notice to claim their full statutory rights.  You say that in <i>(b)</i> the landlord may give notice that he intends to stand on the Statute and to claim all that the Statute gives him, and you say in <i>(c)</i> that if the tenant decides to claim a reduction under the Statute, notwithstanding any agreement previously come to with the landlord, that is open to him also.  It is not, as Deputy Johnson says, a case of the appeal in one case only.  It simply does not, as the 1920 Act did, preclude the idea of agreement or arrangement except after a notice to quit.  It makes it possible for such agreement to be come to, and it makes it possible for the other party to terminate that agreement by notice, and to say whether he intends to stand by the Act.  There is no unfairness or inequality there, but there would be if the Deputy succeeded in carrying his amendment, which I can only understand on <Col N="1845" /> the basis that he sat down to strike out the rights of the party he had the least sympathy with, considering that it was a safe rudder and compass when wading through this Bill.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that a tenant cannot have protection of the Act unless he gives notice that he is going to claim protection of the Act? Are we to take it that when there has been agreement to pay certain rent for a house, which the tenant finds is above what the landlord is allowed to charge, that a tenant is not protected because he has not the insight, knowledge, and ability to go through the processes of law and to give notice that he is going to call for the protection of the Act?  Is that the case?  Are you throwing all the onus on the tenant to plead the Act for his protection, and to give notice that on and after a certain date he will not pay more than the Act requires?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain whether this applies to all tenants &mdash; tenants who have been tenants before 1914&mdash;or does it apply only to tenants going into possession today or when the Act becomes law?  Section 2 fixes the standard rent.  Section 7 determines the rent.  Is this to be considered fair rent?  If the tenant and landlord are in dispute at the moment, the tenant may say his rent is not a fair rent.  Does this Act prevent them going into Court to fix it there?</P>

      <P>There is an ambiguity in the whole Act, and we have got to get it cleared up line by line as we proceed.  I quite accept the Minister's statement with regard to <i>(a)</i>, <i>(b)</i>, and <i>(c)</i>, taken together, but there is something after all in Deputy Davin's amendment. We all know fairly well that the landlord who possesses a considerable amount of property has his work done by some solicitor or solicitor's agent, in either case of which the Act of Parliament is under his nose.  The tenant comes along, and we know the conditions under which the tenant hitherto or at the moment goes into possession.  He finds 150 other applicants before him for that house.  He may have to move to <Col N="1846" /> some other part of the country to undertake his ordinary day's work.  He is forced to live, at all events, in that particular place, and as his family is in some other place, consequently there is a hardship on him to get a home at the earliest opportunity.  He approaches the landlord, and finds various applicants before him for this house.  After some time the landlord yields.  The landlord is cognisant of this Act.  He approaches his solicitor, who is conversant with every line of it.  We know that tenants have not this Bill or any other Bill in their pockets, and they are not going to produce this Bill and ask the landlord&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As the tenant is not conversant with the Act of Parliament, he is taken at a disadvantage, and if the landlord there and then enters into an agreement with the tenant while he is conversant with the Act of Parliament, any agreement entered into by the landlord should be compelled to stand over.</P>

      <P>Not to protect the tenant; it is to protect certain tenants.  That was a misleading generalisation. It is to protect certain tenants, statutory tenants &mdash; to wit, tenants whose tenancy under lease or under contract of tenancy would have come to an end, and the tenant would have to leave the house but for the provisions of this Act, and by virtue of the provisions of this Act is allowed to continue on in the tenancy.  The first thing to bear in mind is that the tenant we are dealing with now is one who is a tenant by virtue of the provisions of this Act.  Under the Acts between 1915 and 1920 that were <Col N="1847" /> passed in the Westminster Legislature with a view to making the tenants in some such wise as this, the difficulty arose, as the Minister has explained, that the ritual or ceremonial had to be gone through on serving notice, which everyone knows was not a notice or was not to take effect.  All this is explained in the Departmental Committee's report.  Now the purpose of Section 7 is to allow agreements between tenant and landlord, &ldquo;the rent to be paid by the tenant, who by virtue of the provisions of this Act retains possession&rdquo;&mdash;I beg the attention of Deputy Hennessy now to this &mdash;&ldquo;of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies shall be determined as follows: &mdash;<i>(a)</i> The landlord and such tenant may be agreement determine the rent to be paid by such tenant for the time being under this Act, and in such case and subject to the provisions of this Act, the rent so determined shall, until varied by new agreement or by notice under this section, be and continue to be the rent to be paid in respect of such dwelling-house.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, members of all Parliaments, I believe, do not read the Schedules to the Bills.  I remember having a case submitted to me under one of the Land Acts, when the solicitor saw that the first thing I did was to read the forms of notice.  He was quite amazed.  He did not see that the forms of notice threw a very great illumination upon the text of the Acts.  Now, I turn to the most valuable form set out in the Schedule, and I think it would relieve the mind of Deputy Hennessy if he were to read Forms 1 and 3.  Form 1 is the notice by a landlord of increase of rent.  That is the mode in which Sub-section <i>(b)</i>, Section 1 <i>(a)</i> will operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proceeding to damn my own cause with my own eyes open, and, according to theologians, that is the only effectual way in which anyone can be damned.  Form 1 is a form of notice which the landlord is obliged to serve when he happens to increase the rent.  A study of it will show the operation of Section 8.  I do not like to suggest that Deputies, speaking to an an amendment, are discussing one section <Col N="1848" /> without having read the remainder. That is the great benefit of having a united scheme &mdash; all the parts of it hang together with wonderful agreement.  The items set out in Form 1 belong also to Section 8 of the Bill.  Form 3 will be found interesting; that is the notice that the tenant has to serve on the landlord for a reduction of increased rent, and that form throws a light, I suggest, on <i>(c)</i>, Sub-section (1), of Section 7, which reads: &ldquo;If at any time the tenant is entitled to claim a reduction of an increased rent he may, notwithstanding any temporary agreement under this sub-section, serve upon the landlord a notice,&rdquo; etc. Now, what these notices are for and why the variation in the agreed terms is to be permitted is, I think, understood by reading Section 8.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, might I say that my point is that the ordinary tenant is not conversant with the Act of Parliament; very few of them read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the ordinary tenant does not.  There is a fiction that everybody knows the law. That is a valuable fiction, though it sounds ludicrous, like many other fictions of the law.  If the law is the bulwark of personal liberty, and if every man can plead ignorance and escape the liability he has incurred, we should soon have social chaos in the country.  Why is the landlord supposed to know?  This is really what happens.  The landlord is trying to get as much as he can from the tenant, and the tenant is trying to escape as much as he can.  This is generally the attitude: A and B bargain, particularly about rents.  A, the landlord, puts on a higher rent, and Deputy Hennessy asks us to imagine the tenant in such a desperate need for a roof to cover his family's head that he agrees to the higher rent. Now he has time to discover the wrong he has done himself.  Under paragraph <i>(c)</i> of Section 7 he can serve notice in Form 3 to ask the Court to have the rent varied.  Very good.  That is a splendid thing, Deputy Hennessy would think, if the tenant can be saved from his own folly and reckless haste in entering into the bargain.  Yes; but what is sauce for the goose is sauce also for the gander. Under these circumstances it is a noble and a splendid thing for the tenant, who <Col N="1849" /> is a human being.  But let us look at the case of the human being who owns the house.  For a variety of circumstances let us say that the man who holds the house holds on after the expiry of the lease, and it is arranged that the lower rent he had been paying is to continue to go on as the rent.</P>
      <P>Now, under one of the later provisions of the Act the sanitary authorities step in, or a development of ill-health in the family arises, and repairs are called upon to be made and must be made, and the landlord is out of pocket, and he discovers that the contract is not paying. Now, is he permitted to have recourse to the courts to have the bargain set right, as it affects him injuriously?  Is not that equity?  That is the effect of paragraph <i>(b)</i>, which reads: &ldquo;If at any time the rent to be paid by such tenant does not exceed the standard rent, or exceeds the standard rent by less than the amount permitted by this Act.&rdquo;  The landlord, if he can show good cause, is to be permitted to increase the rent up to an amount permitted by the Act.  What the amount is to be you discover on reading Section 8.  We are going to destroy Section 8 by anticipation if we carry out the behest of Deputy Hennessy and eliminate Section <i>(b)</i> altogether, and then you will have to change the title of the Act, which will certainly not be a Rent Restriction Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was led to understand that the meaning of this section, from the speech of the Minister, would be as follows:&mdash; That the landlord and the tenant might agree upon a rental of any sum whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the Minister's definition.  I think that was the intention subject to the provisions of this Act.  Now I find they could agree to any sum whatever, and that until it comes to a threat of eviction or volition of the tenant, who may serve notice that he will not pay a rental over and above the rent allowed by the Act.  I think <Col N="1850" /> that is the meaning of the Minister's last speech.  The landlord and the tenant are to be free to make an agreement, but then &ldquo;subject to the provisions of the Act.&rdquo;  The tenant can secure a reduction, and if that is the meaning, and if the Minister is right in his interpretation of the Bill, then the Bill is a very bad one, and worse than the existing law. It may be quite right to say that the tenant can take advantage of the Act, but the purpose of the Act in the beginning was to protect the tenant from the landlord who is going to take advantage of the tenant who may not only be ignorant, but may be in an unprotected state. Now the Minister tells us that they can make an agreement, but that if the tenant, after having made the agreement, seeks to take advantage of the provisions of the Act he may do so.  I submit if that is the intention there is no protection of the tenant at all such as is required, because poor men or women living in hundreds of houses together in streets and tenements are not aware of their rights under the law and they are afraid of the risk of being evicted and they will suffer all kinds of ignominy and they will pay pence and shillings per week more than they are required to do by law to avoid the risk of conflict with the landlord.  If the Act is not going to be a protection to the tenants it is not worth anything.  If the Act is going to throw the onus of appearing in court and serving notices upon the landlord then what Deputy Lyons said a few moments ago is right, namely, &ldquo;better throw it overboard and resist forcible eviction.&rdquo; It is much better than having a pretence of protection which is neally no protection at all.  If the Minister's interpretation is right, and I am still doubtful, I prefer to read Sub-section <i>(a)</i> as meaning that any agreement they enter into should be within the limits of the Act and within the standard rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so it is satisfactory, but if it means as the Minister suggested, or as I understood him to suggest, that they may make an agreement outside the standard rent, then the onus is upon the tenant, and that is all wrong.  I want to draw attention to this fact that, speaking generally throughout the country, there are a large number of cases of tenants who have automatically entered into agreements under the Act, which <Col N="1851" /> is now being amended, to pay, say, 40 per cent. above the standard rents.  The onus is now sought to be thrown on all those tenants to seek a reduction.  That is the kind of provision that ought to lie upon the landlord and not upon the tenant. The tenant ought, automatically, to come into the region of the Act when it is passed, and not have to serve notice upon the landlord to the effect that he intends to come within the region of the Act.  I hope the Minister will clear the air on this matter.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a good system to consider one amendment at a time.  There has been a tendency, in discussing this particular amendment, to forge ahead, and to discuss simultaneously the following amendment.  To combine discussion on two amendments does not make for clarity.  Keeping to Deputy Davin's amendment, the position is as I have stated, that a landlord and tenant may come to an agreement within, as Deputy Johnson said, &ldquo;the provisions of the Act,&rdquo; but it is open to either of them, to the landlord by <i>(a)</i> and to the tenant by <i>(b)</i> to claim the fullness of his rights within the Act, just as it was open to forego them by the agreement.  Under the 1920 Act no such agreement could have been come to without the formality or the ceremony, as Deputy Magennis described it, the empty ceremony of the notice to quit which gave rise to quite a lot of confusion.  &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the Act&rdquo; has been stressed by Deputy Johnson and properly stressed.  It is not competent to a landlord to charge a higher rent than the Act provides.</P>

      <P>It is open to him to take a lower rent than he is entitled to under the Bill, and it would be open to him to terminate that by a notice just as it would be open to a tenant, if he were foolish enough to do it, to accept less than the fullness of his rights <Col N="1852" /> under the Bill.  He might do that in certain circumstances, and it is open to him to terminate that state of affairs and to stand on the Bill after notice has been given.  There has been a tendency as I say to forge ahead and to discuss the next amendment, but you can take the next amendment when it comes. Deputy Hennessy drew a picture of one man, one party, with a solicitor in his pocket, and the other with no means of knowing the law at all.  That is an entirely inaccurate picture.  The word landlord has, of course, a certain association of ideas with regard to us here, but without following Deputy Johnson's example and stressing too many specific instances, I know cases of landlords that do not at all correspond to the popular mental picture of them, and I know cases of landlords whose circumstances are very much worse than many of their tenants.  Deputy Davin's amendment, as I have stressed, and as I stress again, is inequitable.  It proposes to deprive one party of a right which the following section gives to the other.  Now there must be reciprocity. If an agreement is come to, and if it is open to one party to terminate it by notice, it should be equally open to the other.  The effect of Deputy Davin's amendment would be to leave a hopelessly lopsided arrangement by which one party to the agreement could keep it or break it as he choose, but by which the other was bound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I satisfy Deputy Johnson and read to him again a few words of the Section under discussion. Section 7 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The rent to be paid by the tenant who, by virtue of the provisions of this Act retains possession of any dwelling-house, shall be determined as follows:&mdash;<i>(a)</i>  The landlord and such tenant may by agreement determine the rent to be paid by such tenant.&rdquo;  Linking up the opening words of Article <i>(b)</i> Section 7 with the opening words of Sub-section 1, it is impossible for anyone to misinterpret the rent to be paid by the tenant &ldquo;who by virtue of the provisions of this Act retains possession of his dwelling house.&rdquo; Article <i>(b)</i> (Section 7) reads:&mdash;&ldquo;If at any time the rent to be paid by such tenant does not exceed the standard rent or exceed the standard rent by less than the amount permitted by this Act <Col N="1853" /> the landlord, notwithstanding any temporary agreement under this Sub-section, may serve upon such tenant a notice increasing such rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is only one interpretation of these words, and that is that the agreement entered into between the landlord and tenant is, for the purposes of Article <i>(b)</i>, a rent either equal to the standard rent or above it, but not up to the limit allowed by the increase of rent under Section 8.  Consequently, as the Minister argues properly, <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i> are reciprocal.  One provides for the landlord and the other for the tenant, and the forms to which I have drawn attention are the proper forms in each case. I quite agree with Deputy Johnson to this extent, that there are no charitable societies for providing relief to tortured minds.  There are charitable societies like the St. Vincent de Paul, the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers' Society, and so on, which come to the material aid of the needy poor, but legally it is not given unfortunately.  That is one of the respects in which our charitable organisations are defective, notwithstanding the number of them, the extent of their operations, and the amount of money that they distribute.  It is quite conceivable that hardship would ensue in the case of tenants such as Deputy Johnson describes.  There is no one to let them know of their rights.  If Deputy Johnson would introduce into the Bill some workable Clause by which a huge penalty would be imposed on the landlord who sought, trading upon the ignorance and the continuity of the ignorance of these tenants, to increase the rent beyond the limits allowed, that would improve the Bill.  There is a later Section &mdash; Section 12 &mdash; which I will quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, if an increased rent or an increased rate of interest exceeds by more than the amount permitted under this Act the standard rent or the standard rate of interest, the amount of such excess shall, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, be irrecoverable from the tenant or the mortgagor, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There is in another Section, a penalty prescribed for anyone who attempts to get a fine or bonus or other payment for permitting the continuance of a tenancy. If there were a penalty Clause, so that <Col N="1854" /> a landlord who preys upon ignorance shall, when the offence is proved against him, be subject to a penalty of £100, I think that would meet he desire of Deputy Johnson.  I throw that out to him as meeting his purpose, whereas the amendment under discussion does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeGDuffy" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that interests me is to know whether or not Deputy Johnson is right in the interpretation which I gather he took from the Minister, that the landlord and tenant may agree as they like, though afterwards the tenant may come along and claim a change.  I am not at all satisfied with Deputy Magennis's explanation. I invite the Dáil to look again at this Section 7 <i>(a)</i>, which, after all, is very clear.  There are two parts of it.  The first part says, in terms, that the landlord and the tenant may by agreement determine the rent to be paid by the tenant for the time being under the Act. That is to say, that when an occasion arises for a change of rent under the Act an agreement may be made between them.  So far there is nothing in these words to limit in any way the agreement. The terms of that agreement are limited, to some extent, by the following words, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act, the rent so agreed upon shall be the rent.&rdquo;  I ask what is the meaning of &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act?&rdquo;&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; means this: unless there is anything in the agreement conflicting with the provisions of this Act.  Very well.  Deputy Magennis refers to Section 12, which places restrictions on increasing the rent and makes improperly increased rent irrecoverable in certain circumstances.  But Deputy Magennis overlooked the opening words of Section 12, &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, subject to the complete liberty which we have given the landlord and tenant to agree as they like under Section 7, the following should have effect.  In each of these two Clauses, 7 and 12, you have the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  Therefore, Section 12 must be read subject to the latitude we have given landlord and tenant under Section 7.  I take another Section &mdash; Section 8.  The same fatal words appear again. &ldquo;The amount by which the increased rent of a dwelling-house to which this Act applies may exceed the standard <Col N="1855" /> rent shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be as follows&rdquo;&mdash; subject to the latitude we have given you under Section 7 to do what you like, be as follows. I do not wish to assert that that view of the section is correct, but I do assert that the opposite view is very far from being proved, and I do assert that in a court of law a gentleman who took the view of Deputy Magennis might find himself in Queer Street.  What then is the meaning of these words in Section 7 <i>(a)</i>&ldquo;The rent to be paid by the tenant for the time being under this Act&rdquo; and the following words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo;?  I take it that the meaning is clear, that it means that where you have a provision like that which occurred in Section 13 expressly prohibiting the taking of a premium or a fine, that the landlord and the tenant in coming to their new agreement will be absolutely bound to observe the provisions of that Section 13.  Because observe, if I have not mis-read that Section 13, Sub-section 1 &mdash; and, indeed, I think, the following Sub-sections &mdash; there is nothing there in this very carefully and skillfully drafted Act about &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  Section 13 is a definite mandatory Section &mdash;&ldquo;you shall not do so; you shall not put on a fine as a condition.&rdquo;  That is clear and unequivocal &mdash;&ldquo;We tell you that is a thing you must not do.&rdquo;  Therefore when Section 7 talks about giving the right to the landlord and tenant to agree upon a rent under this Act, they mean &ldquo;you must not infringe Section 13.&rdquo; I venture to submit that Section 7 <i>(a)</i> does not mean &ldquo;we prohibit you from infringing other Sections like 8 and 12,&rdquo; which in their terms only apply subject to the preceding provisions which this Dáil shall have put into the Act of Parliament. Both Sections 8 and 12 expressly say &ldquo;subject to anything we may have allowed you to do under other Sections of the Act, such-and-such a provision shall have effect.&rdquo;  I think it is obvious that some change in the wording is required in Section 7 if the intention is to be carried out.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept, and would the Dáil agree to accept, a phrase something like this?  After &ldquo;the landlord and such tenant may by agreement determine the rent to be paid by such tenant for the time <Col N="1856" /> being under this Act,&rdquo; and &ldquo;within the limits provided for by this Act.&rdquo; It seems to me that without such provisions there is very grave risk of the interpretation being such as has been suggested by Deputy Gavan Duffy, and which I think the Minister suggested as possible.  I am driven to this conclusion now by the insistence of Deputy Magennis in previous amendments that this was an Act limiting the rights of eviction and limiting the rights of ejection. That is probably true, now.  If the landlord and tenant are prepared to make an agreement outside the Act, and <i>sub rosa</i> saying &ldquo;neither of us will take any action within the Act,&rdquo; then they may do so, and such freedom simply overrules everything that the Act intends to provide because it places the tenant helpless as he is, by virtue of the fact that there is no accommodation, completely at the mercy of the landlord, or at the mercy of circumstances.  He says,&ldquo;I can afford to pay 5s. a week more for my house, and I will do so, and let the Act slide,&rdquo; thereby steadily raising the rental and inducing other people to make similar agreements.  I am afraid the Bill as drawn does encourage such agreements, and will allow of such agreements, practically to contract out of the Act.  That is not the intention, and should at once be provided against.</P>

      <P>There may be this duress, and under it a tenant may make this agreement which is so inimical to his own interests.  Very good.  This Act comes to his relief, and Sub-section 1, Article C of Section 7, enables him, notwithstanding that agreement to serve upon the landlord a notice under Form 3.  What is the use of any Act to anyone who does not know?  That is <Col N="1857" /> a practical question.  Deputy Gavan Duffy argues very speciously, and he repeats the argument of Deputy Hennessy that unless a man knows what protection he is afforded by the law he is not able to take advantage of it.  Why that is one of the jests made by the clown in &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo;  The old philosopher at Prague says, that &ldquo;is is.&rdquo;  We all know perfectly well that a man who does not know he has a weapon is unarmed. At the critical juncture when he ought to use it in his defence, if he does not know he has it, he has it not for all practical purposes.  I concede to Deputy Johnson that what Deputy Gavan Duffy calls the dweller in the slums is not likely to know of this, but surely I have suggested how he can be made to know it. There are sufficient philanthropists to let him know what his rights and protections are.  It is not a good thing to encourage litigation, it is not a good thing to have too much work for too many lawyers, and if Deputy Gavan Duffy, as a lawyer who has exhibited what he could do in making the Clause appear to defeat the purpose for which it was introduced, can argue so speciously, and if a man of such clarity of mind as Deputy Johnson can entertain doubts about it, what I suggest to him, and I hope I am a reasonable man, is that it would be better to reword this, but not to omit Sub-section <i>(b).</i>  I am speaking altogether against the amendment, which has the effect of nullifying Article <i>(b).</i></P>

      <P>There may be. As I understand, the amendment we are discussing is to Section 7 <i>(b)</i>, and it has been so discussed by those who advocate it as to drive us into the desire really to debate, at times sub-section (b), and above all going back on <i>(a)</i> which we had passed.  I am trying, therefore, within the limits of order to arrive at what I think is the proper view to take in regard to the proposed amendment, namely, to defeat that amendment because it serves no useful purpose to pass it.  At the same time I candidly admit that in the course of the discussion, when Deputy Johnson raised this point, he <Col N="1858" /> raised a point which is undoubtedly one with regard to which a great many minds will be clouded, and for the benefit of the Act hereafter, and not for the benefit of lawyers, it would be well to have that amended.  This penal Clause 13 says a person shall not, as a condition of the grant, renewal, or continuance of a tenancy or sub-tenancy of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies, require the payment of any fine, premium or other like sum, or the giving of any pecuniary consideration in addition to the rent, etc.  There is a penalty &mdash; any person making or offering to make any such payment shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £20.  If there were a penal clause imposing a penalty of not less than £100 on a landlord who would attempt to force a tenant to contract out of the Act and become liable by agreement under <i>(a)</i> to pay a rent in excess of the increase permitted by Section 8.</P>

I have said that it should be amended, but not amended as proposed in the amendment now under discussion.  Surely that is an intelligible position to take up when the amendment is worthless, inasmuch as it would defeat a very useful purpose of the clause to which it purports to be an amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to <i>(a)</i>, that precedes it, an alteration of words, plus a later Section imposing a penalty in connection with that, is an amendment to the Act, but it is not an amendment in the sense that makes me guilty of such illogical self-contradiction as Deputy Hennessy seems to suggest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 21.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;Then the right of the landlord to increase the rent by the prescribed notice should be given affirmatively, with the right to serve further notices from time to time; also the tenant should be given the right to serve notice, for he might claim the amount of the permitted increase, which falls since the last notice; lastly, an existing rent should be continued up to the amount permitted by the Act, pending any agreement or formal notice.  If this course were adopted, it would do away with the indiscriminate service of notices and confine the normal service of a notice to cases where a dispute is anticipated. It should be made clear that a notice is not to be invalidated <i>in toto</i> by reason of a technical difficulty or some error in calculation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the difficulty is not a real one, and that the key to it is this: the Bill contemplates a maximum rent, but that maximum is not fixed; it varies.  For instance, when rates go up, the maximum will go up and <i>vice versa.</i> What this Section in the Bill aims at is to enable the fluctuation in either direction, upwards for the landlord, or downwards for the tenant.  While it lies with them to come to an agreement at any given time, they may, without changing circumstances, decide to stand on the Bill and to serve their notice, the landlord for an increase, or the tenant claiming a reduction.  The maximum rent payable under the provisions of the Bill will not be a fixed, but a variable rent, and any party may make up his mind, from time to time, that it would benefit him to claim the fullness of his statutory rights, and that some change has taken place either since the agreement or since the last notice, as the case may be.  The tenant may decide that though the landlord at a particular time gave him notice to increase the rent, and did in fact succeed in getting that increase, circumstances have changed in such a way that it would not benefit him (the tenant) to claim a reduction. <Col N="1860" /> The idea of agreement simply gives you a starting point, and it is open to either party to claim, as they think the circumstances would favour such a claim on their part.  I cannot see, though I am prepared to discuss the thing as between this and the next stage, that there is real ground for confusion, real ground for ambiguity, in that expression &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Bill.&rdquo;  In the report on which the Bill is modelled you have practically the same expression.  I would undertake to look into the matter and discuss it, and if, in the opinion of experts and the draughtsmen, there is any real ambiguity as to the intent or the meaning of the provision as it stands, I would undertake to bring forward a suitable amendment.  It would not be an amendment along the lines of what we are now discussing, or what we ought to be now discussing, which involves leaving to one party the right of which it is proposed to deprive the other.</P>

      <P>I am very much obliged to the Minister for quoting the paragraph he has quoted from the Report. When he comes to consider what amendments should be made I do urge upon him the desirability of taking note of the very great difference between the phrase, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; and the phrase in the report, &ldquo;subject to the restrictions in this Act.&rdquo; There is a very great difference.  If it be made clear that the agreement that the landlord and tenant may make, must be subject to such restriction as the Act contains, then I for one would not have another word to say.  But I think on investigation it will be found that it is not clear at present, because of the repetition of that ambiguous phrase in these sections whereby one section throws you back on another, and that section on another further back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Minister wants to be very strict, I am out of order. But inasmuch as he began the disorder and we have all followed him, and that the disorderly discussion is very much more important than an orderly one would have been, I suggest that it is more desirable to allow this matter to be finished, and we would not be long in getting through it.  Deputy Magennis has pointed out that this is an Act restricting eviction. Now, we have come to consider as a possibility that people may contract out of the Act by agreement.  It is generally believed, and the report which was quoted by the Minister shows, that the Committee desired that there should be restrictions upon the power of the landlord to increase rents, or that even there should be restrictions upon the landlord and tenant agreeing to rents outside the limits of the Act.  If the Minister would make sure that the intention of the report would be embodied in Section 7, presumably in Sub-section <i>(a)</i> of Section 7, then that issue would have led to a satisfactory conclusion.  As the Minister has agreed to do that then we may leave it.  On the amendment itself I do not see the injustice, but, as I say, it is of quite secondary importance. I do not understand the Minister's contention that it is unjust to say that an agreement entered into, knowing that the people are protected can, at the instance of one side be broken simply by notice. It seems to me that surely when an agreement has been entered into, after the Act comes into operation for a rent lower than the increase allowed, that that agreement will persist until a new agreement has been made.  The proposition of the section is that in the event of an agreement to accept lower than the permitted increase being entered into, it will be of no avail as soon as the landlord says, &ldquo;I want to break the agreement.&rdquo; I do not understand the argument in favour of that view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, I think, stated his view upon this amendment too.  The proposal of the amendment is to impose upon the landlord the duty of informing the tenant that he is entitled to a reduction.  It is because of practical difficulties I want such an amendment embodied, whether in this form or some other form I do not mind.  Take the case of the tenant who has been entitled to pay 5/- standard rent plus, say 2/- for permitted increase, plus 2/- rates, say 9/- in all.  That is the utmost that is legally chargeable, but there has been a reduction of rates.  The tenant not paying the rates directly, is not aware of this, and unless some organisation is promoted and encouragement is given by the clause as it stands to such an organisation simply to provide tenants with the information that they are now entitled to a reduction of rent, because of the reduction of rates, tenants are much more likely to continue paying the rental which they have been paying during the previous year.  I submit that the onus of this matter of readjusting the rental to the new circumstances should be upon the new house owner, and that it should <Col N="1863" /> not be required of the tenant that he must serve notice on the landlord that a new charge is now to be made because of decrease in rates.  It seems to me that the landlord, who is paying the rates in most instances, and who is much more likely to be acquainted with the changed circumstances, should bear the onus of informing the tenant of the new rental. That is the object of the amendment.  I think the Bill as it stands, throwing upon tenants the onus of serving notice and of making themselves acquainted with all reductions of rates, etc., and how much that will affect their particular rental, is unreasonable.  As a matter of fact I suppose 75 per cent. of the tenants know nothing about their valuation.  They do not know how their rates affect them, and what proportion of the rent that they are paying the landlord is really rent, and what proportion is rates.  Consequently they are not, except by means of some organisation, in a position to serve notice on the landlord.  Therefore, I submit, that the purpose of the amendment should be accepted, whether in its present form or not, I am not particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we ought not to proceed to throw that statutory duty upon the landlord, and we ought not to strike that new note, that any section of the people are so incapable of looking after their own rates that the onus must be thrown on the opposite party to the contract to inform them.  It runs contrary to the whole trend of ordinary business relations in which each man is expected to mind himself and mind his own interests and know his own rates.  You come along now and you ask one of the contracting parties to do something that is contrary to human nature, and I do not think that there are grounds for it.  Although in this whole matter it is clear that certain people are thinking of tenants and landlords as opposite ends of the social scale, a picture which is most untrue, I think that the tenant is in fact capable of watching his own interests or has means at his disposal of ensuring that they will be watched either by an organisation or by the services of a solicitor.  It would be open to the landlord to say, &ldquo;If the tenant gets statutory protection in this way, why should you not throw on him the positive duty of paying an increased rent before he is <Col N="1864" /> asked for it?&rdquo;  Despite the conventional picture of the landlord that is presented here, one knows that very often the full legal right is not exacted, and that the landlord does not, in fact, come along to exact his last pound of flesh under the terms of this or any preceding Act.  If you put on the landlord the positive duty of minding the tenant's business, either personally or through a solicitor, if he happens to have one, then you will certainly work up the state of mind where the full liability will be exacted.  We are not standing for this simply because we refuse to accept the view that this Bill is so complicated that it does not lie in a fairly normal way within the power of the citizen to find out his rights in the matter.  There was no such provision in previous Acts.  If tenants find it necessary to organise to have their rights preserved, that is a matter they must consider, but I think the State ought not to come in in this way between the contracting parties, and put on one the positive duty of watching the other's rights and interests and assume that one is ignorant, while the other has all the information at its disposal.</P>
      <P>I know cases where the circumstances of the landlord are inferior to those of his tenants, and it is becoming the rule rather than the exception, because there have been cases of people who were living on certain annual rentals at a time when the purchasing power of money was very much greater than it is now, and the rentals not having increased in proportion to the decrease in the purchasing power of money left those in very straitened circumstances indeed.  The feeling is entirely against putting a positive duty which is unnatural on one of the contracting parties.  Normally the relations between them would be free and unfettered. Owing to special circumstances we are coming in and, to a certain extent, controlling those relations, but we ought not to take the entirely new and exceptional step of saying that one party should watch the interests of the other where the interests of the other conflicted with his own.  That is contrary to the whole trend of business relations as between man and man.</P>

      <P>St. Thomas Aquinas, the mention of whom I notice excites laughter in Deputy Gorey &mdash; the incipient laugh was unmistakeable&mdash;has raised a question which I think will interest Deputy Johnson.  It is following a problem of morals started by Cicero. Suppose there is a beleagured city running short of food supplies.  Some farmers, with that enterprise which characterises farmers in other lands, break through the lines, and bring supplies of corn.  One of them arrives ahead of the others.  The absolute necessity of the beleagured citizens would make them willing to pay any price which the enterprising farmer could exact.  St. Thomas as a moralist asks, is the farmer bound to inform the needy citizens that there are other carts on the way with other supplies, and he answers the question that it would be heroic virtue on the part of the seller of corn to let it be known that the supply is not quite so limited as it seems, and that there will be no shortage in a little time.  What Deputy Johnson proposes to introduce into the relation of landlord and tenant is heroic virtue.  So the situation, as he visualises it is, I am a landlord who entered under <i>(a)</i> into an agreement with tenant B, and tenant B is to pay me such-and-such a sum.  I have discovered later on that the amount of repairs I have to provide, and the cost of these on a falling market is such-and-such, and that the rates are decreasing. Whereupon I watch my books and write to B as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear B, Notwithstanding the temporary agreement into which we entered under a Sub-section of the Act, I rejoice to inform you that I find myself in a position to reduce the amount you agreed to pay.  You will therefore kindly take notice that the amount is not so much, but so much, mentioning a lesser sum.&rdquo;  No doubt what Deputy Johnson proposes would be a highly desirable improvement in a relation of man to man, but is it practicable?</P>

The tenant, according to the argument in favour of the amendment, knows nothing about the situation, and it is because he could not possibly know that the rent he has agreed to pay ought to be reduced, that the amendment has been proposed, so that the situation, I imagine, is that my tenant B does not know that he is entitled to a reduction but we will introduce a Clause into the Act of Parliament making it obligatory upon me to notify him.  But supposing I do not choose to recognise the obligation what will happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I explained the position of the Land Commission on the First Reading of the Bill.  As a result of the operation of the Transfer of Functions Order the office of Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission is abolished and the present position of the Land Commission, as I understand it, is that the corporation is in existence but that there are no Commissioners except a Judicial Commissioner.  The Judicial Commissioner is functioning under Sub-section 5 of Section 28 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1881, referred to in Section 3 of this Bill.  In that Section, that is to say, Sub-section 5 of Section 28 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1881, the head of the Judiciary has jurisdiction to assign any Judge of the High Court to act as a Judicial Commissioner in the event of the office being temporary vacant.  That assignment has been made, and at the present moment the Judicial Commissioner is acting under the assignment made under this Section.  We are now under the necessity, as I stated on the First Reading, of reconstituting the Land Commission.  I am not in a position to say at the moment how many Commissioners shall be appointed, but there will probably be three.  As I explained, the new Commissioners will be not only Land Commissioners but Estates Commissioners. They will exercise the functions of Land Commissioners and Estates Commissioners.  The Estates Commissioners were always Land Commissioners but they exercised different functions.  As <Col N="1870" /> Land Commissioners they exercise different functions.  As Land Commissioners they exercised one set of functions and as Estate Commissioners they exercise another.  There is no necessity for that state of affairs any longer.  They will be called Land Commissioners now, and they will exercise the functions in connection with the Land Purchase Acts and all land law as they did formerly, of course with the one name.</P>

      <P>In connection with the reconstitution of the Land Commission, I think this section would be the proper place to raise an inquiry that I wish to bring before the Minister's attention.  I would preface it by stating that I am not moving an amendment, partly because the matter was brought before my attention somewhat too late for that purpose, and even then I did not press for an amendment, for I am not sure that it is a question that ought to be dealt with by specific drafting of the Bill, or whether it should not more properly lie under the Executive action of the Ministry.  The question refers to a certain section of the Land Commission staff. On the Second Reading we had the matter raised in the Dáil with regard to the Congested Districts Board staff as being taken over and that when taken over they should receive the full status of Civil Servants.  There are amendments on the Orders of the day that will come before us later on, dealing with that matter. The question that I am now dealing with refers to a certain section of officials in the Land Commission known as surveyors and draughtsmen who have no pension rights.  I believe the practice is that when such surveyors are promoted to the position of inspectors that they receive pension rights, as they are then reckoned as belonging to the Civil Service establishment, but prior to that promotion they have not that status, and, therefore do not carry the pension rights attaching to the status.  The matter has been raised by them very frequently, as I am informed, and pledges were given that a certain number of them should come on to the permanent establishment, and that they should be without the necessity of being promoted inspectors, for which a large number might not care, though the services that they render might be excellent enough to deserve it, but that they should still have their place <Col N="1871" /> on the established Civil Service, and be entitled to pension rights.  I will not go into the category of dates in which this matter was brought up, before the British Treasury when these servants were strictly under that Treasury.  The facts are briefly, as set out here for me, that this matter was raised before the British Treasury, and that the British Treasury did admit that a certain number of them should be given the rank of Civil Servants and receive pension rights.</P>

      <P>The point is we are dealing with Section 2 of the Bill, by which the powers of the Land Commission are reaffirmed and the Land Commission reconstituted.  A certain number of the staff that had hitherto belonged to the Land Commission have not hitherto been entitled to pension rights. They claim that under previous conditions under the British Treasury they had such rights accorded to them.  Obviously the matter if it is to arise at all arises under this Bill, and I thought that the proper section of the Bill under which to raise it is Section 2.  The point now raised by Deputy Professor Magennis is, if the question of these persons arises under Section 2, then the question of the other staffs respecting which amendments are down should arise under that section also.  The only point I put before you on <Col N="1872" /> that Bill is that the Congested Districts Board's staff are dealt with under a different section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated the position with great justice.  I am going to give an analysis of the persons with whom I am dealing. There are 28 of them and it is said that they are in temporary employment. Seven of them are there for the past 25 years, one is there between 20 and 22 years, four between 15 and 20 years and four between 10 and 15 years; they can hardly be described as temporary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the Section: &ldquo;Immediately upon the passing of this Act the Congested Districts Board shall stand dissolved, and thereupon every officer and person then in the employment of the Congested Districts Board shall be transferred to the employment of the Irish Land Commission, and shall, for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919, be deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by Parliament or the Oireachtas throughout their service under the Congested Districts Board within the meaning of Section 17 of the Superannuation Act, 1859.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say we are re-constituting the Land Commission and we do not interfere in any way with the status of any one.  The Deputy wants to know whether certain temporary officials in the Land Commission will be made permanent. That is a matter for administration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment may sound as if it was something in the nature of continuing the discussion that was originated a few minutes ago by Deputy Figgis, but the circumstances and the nature of the amendment are wholly different. The C.D.B. by this Bill is dissolved.  It was in possession of very considerable staffs.  Until the Bill dissolving the C.D.B. was passed, the Board were the masters of the persons whose interests I am now endeavouring to save.  These individuals are being transferred to the Land Commission, and as soon as the Bill becomes an Act they will in future be the servants of the Land Commission. The Section that the Minister has put into the Bill carries, I think, all rights to pension to which these clerks, when transferred, are entitled, because it says they &ldquo;shall be deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by Parliament or the Oireachtas throughout their service under the C.D.B. within the meaning of Section 17 of the Superannuation Act, 1859.&rdquo;  That means that their years of service in the C.D.B. will be treated as if they were years of service rendered for moneys voted by Parliament.  That is a curious expression to put into a Superannuation Act, but I think it safeguards their rights to pension.  The Superannuation Act gave other rights which, in my humble judgment, have been overlooked inadvertently by the Minister in the drafting of this Bill.  A Civil Servant who dies, if he has been a Civil Servant for five years, has acquired the right that <Col N="1877" /> certain gratuities shall be paid to his dependents, and in the Gratuities Section of the Superannuation Act, the person entitled to these gratuities is defined, not by the source from which his emoluments were derived, whether voted by Parliament or not, but he is described as a male Civil Servant who has served for five years, and the same Statute by reference defines a male civil servant as a person who has served in an established capacity in the permanent Civil Service of the State.  What I fear is, that the intention of the Minister, about which I have no doubt, may be defeated by the necessary performance of their duty by officers of other Ministries. If one of these people has the misfortune to die to-morrow, or even within a year or two after he has been taken over by the Land Commission, and the Minister submits to the Ministry of Finance an estimate providing for gratuities for dependants of that deceased C.D.B. clerk, it is the duty of the Treasury, and the duty I suppose of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to check every estimate that is submitted to them and to see that no payments are made which are not justified by Act of Parliament. They come to the Minister and say, &ldquo;Where is your Act of Parliament which justifies your gratuity?&rdquo; and he says, &ldquo;Section 5 of the Land Law Commission Bill.&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;Section 5 only justifies the payment of pensions to people who are deemed to have been Civil Servants, and who are deemed to have been paid out of moneys voted by Parliament, but they were not in fact, and no Act of Parliament deems them to have been persons serving in an established capacity in the permanent Civil Service of the State. Therefore, you can produce no Act of Parliament which justified the payment of gratuities that you have put down in your estimate.&rdquo;  I am quite satisfied that the Minister will tell us that when he was taking these people over from the C.D.B. that he had no intention of depriving their dependants of the gratuity right, while he was giving the men themselves pensions.  The difference between the Minister and myself about the Act of Parliament is, that in my humble judgment the Act of Parliament does not confer the right to these gratuities.  If he tells us that, after taking all the advice that he could get from responsible <Col N="1878" /> advisers, he is completely satisfied that these rights are protected, and that he will resist this amendment, then I shall have to suffer the defeat that no doubt his voting power will inflict upon me; but I do, with all humble diffidence, submit to him that if he cannot point out that my amendment must hurt the Treasury, then I do respectfully suggest to him that he might accept it, because if he does, it will do the Treasury no harm, and it will give the safeguards which I still think the Act does not give.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt it would be gilding refined gold, and attempting to add another colour to the rainbow for me to follow in support of Deputy Fitzgibbon's argument, but I would like to inform the Dáil as to how this amendment becomes necessary.  The C.D.B. was founded by the Land Act of 1889, to which allusion is made in the definition clause, making it a corporate body, and giving the Board power to establish their staff on a pensionable basis. It is precisely on all fours as regards the constitution of its staff, and the remuneration of its officers, with the Intermediate Board Act.  Now, it happened that Section 52 of the Act, which refers to pensions, says:&mdash;&ldquo;The C.D.B. may, with the approval of the Treasury, make a scheme providing for the granting of pensions or gratuities according to scale, and subject to the conditions, so far as applicable, prescribed by the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1892, or any Act amending the same, to such officers or persons employed by them, not being otherwise pensionable, as may be from time to time approved by the Treasury, and the Board may pay to any such officers or persons out of the funds at their disposal such pensions and gratuities under the scheme as the Treasury may sanction in each case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was provided for in Section 52 of the Act of 1909, and it was not until 1920, 11 years afterwards, that the Board proceeded to put a pension scheme into operation.  Then the Board discovered this difficulty.  The words of the Section which I quoted to you are: &ldquo;That the Board may pay such pensions or gratuities to such officers or persons employed by them.&rdquo;  You will observe the limitation, the restriction in connection with the word &ldquo;gratuities&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;shall pay such gratuities to such officers or persons employed <Col N="1879" /> by them.&rdquo;  Consequently the right to a gratuity to be paid to the dependants of a deceased officer of the Congested Districts Board was not conferred and the Board were restricted by this legal limitation.  What is desired is that in the transfer of these officers to the Land Commission they should be put upon a proper basis of Civil Servants so that the Superannuation Act, making it possible to pay gratuities to dependants of them on their decease, would be legal. The Intermediate Board did this for their officials in 1913, so that there is a precedent for it.  It might be argued plausibly that Section 5 really carried out in regard to these officers the amendment required to put them on the same footing as the Intermediate Board officers were put in 1913.  But the words here in Section 5 are: &ldquo;shall be transferred to the employment and shall for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts be deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by Parliament throughout their service.&rdquo; That is to say, they are not to be deemed to have been paid out of the funds of the Board, but out of moneys provided by Parliament.  The point at issue then is, will the legal effect of the terminology of the Act be that those officers who are deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by Parliament are consequentially given the status of Civil Servants? Deputy FitzGibbon argues, and I think convincingly, that it does not, because under the Superannuation Act of 1809, Section 7, grautities to dependants, as he quoted, are gratuities to dependants of male Civil Servants who have served five years, and Civil Servants for the purposes of that privilege are Civil Servants as defined in the prior Superannuation Act of 1887, and those are the Superannuation Acts referred to in this particular Clause&mdash;&ldquo;the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919.&rdquo;  Therefore, it is only by a species of logical deduction that we are to set these men on the status of Civil Servants so as to enjoy the advantages of the Superannuation Act.  If there is no difference between us as regards intention and there is a loophole for legal difference; if an argument might be made that would persuade a Judge that, deemed to be paid out of a Parliamentary grant, as contrasted with actually having been paid out of the funds <Col N="1880" /> of a Board, merely provides a certain status that falls short of the full status of the Civil Service which carries the right to dependants' gratuity, then I think since there is no difference between the Minister and us as regards what he seeks to compass, it would be better to alter the terminology employed so as to make it beyond all doubt that in the transfer of the Congested Districts officers to the Land Commission they are being made what they ought to have been made at the very latest in 1913.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGibbon fears that I will disagree with him and then vote him down.  My position is that I will disagree with him and accept an amendment rather like this.  I hold that that Section as it stands gives everything that I desire, and that Deputies Magennis and FitzGibbon desire.  We all agree that under this Section these men will be placed in the Land Commission in a position in which they will get pensions, and there is some disagreement as to whether they are entitled to the gratuity.  It is pointed out that they are not entitled to the gratuity unless they are permanent civil servants.  We intend to establish them, to give a certificate of establishment to each of these pensionable officers on transferring them to the Land Commission, and that will effect the purpose.  As Deputy Magennis has pointed out, if there is no difference between us, if we really mean to compass the same thing, there is no occasion to have any dispute, and I am quite prepared to accept an amendment to the following effect: To add at the end of Section 5 &ldquo;and the pensionable service under the Congested Districts Board of such officers and persons as are pensionable pursuant to the provisions of any scheme made under Section 52 of the Irish Land Act, 1909, shall, for the purposes of Section 2 of the Superannuation Act, 1909, be deemed to have been service in the permanent Civil Service of the State.&rdquo;  That, I think, meets the point of Deputy FitzGibbon.</P>

      <P>I move: To add a new Sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Upon the transfer to the employment of the Irish Land Commission of Officers of the Congested Districts Board the Minister for Agriculture, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, may make regulations providing for the appointment to the Executive class of the Civil Service of the State of pensionable officers who obtain such certificate of efficiency as may be required by the regulations, and for the appointment to the clerical class of the Civil Service of the State of all other pensionable clerical officers and non-pensionable clerical officers, and such regulations may provide that for the purposes of determining the salary and seniority of officers transferred and appointed as aforesaid their permanent service in the Civil Service of the State as provided by Sub-section (1) shall be taken into account, and their salaries adjusted according to such service, and that any increments which would have accrued in such service shall be paid retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that some apology is expected from me for bringing this single class before the Dáil so often, but the staff of the Congested Districts Board have been, I think, badly treated by the Board which is now being dissolved.  I have no doubt they will receive sympathetic treatment from the Minister, but I should like, if possible, to secure for them some statutory protection rather than reliance upon mere sympathy.  The object of this second amendment is shortly to put them in the position that they would have occupied if their former masters had carried out their promises in the bargain they made with their staff. This Board was formed in 1909, and it was stated that it was being organised on a Civil Service basis.  The clerks who went in there passed the same examination that they had to pass to enter any other branch of the Civil Service and I do not suppose you at any rate will count it to their discredit, an additional subject, Irish, which was not demanded from the ordinary Civil Service clerks.  Therefore, as to their qualifications, there can be no doubt.  They were promised that they would be put on a Civil Service basis.  It was stated that they were upon a Civil Service basis, and <Col N="1883" /> they were in all respects, as regards qualifications, service and everything else, except the rights as to pensions and promotion.  The Minister has now, by the amendment, given them, I think, all those pensionable and gratuity rights, so far as I can judge, to which they would have been entitled.  They have, however, for all these years, some since 1909, served in the Congested Districts Board, and some of them actually relinquished posts in the Civil Service to go to that Board, because they believed it would be on a Civil Service basis and because they believed their promotion might be better there.  They served under the Board and find at the end that they have not moved up as they would have done if the Board had carried out its promises to place them on a Civil Service basis.  The object of this amendment is to put them in the position they would have been in if the Board, which is now being dissolved, had carried out its obligations to them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Board had been brought under the control of the Minister those obligations would have been carried out long ago.  I have no doubt that he would be anxious to do all that he could for them.  But whether he is in a position to do so or not I have my doubts, and the object of this amendment is to make it lawful for him to do what his predecessors ought to have done but did not.  The Dáil will observe it is permissible and that there is no compulsion about it.  It empowers the Minister to make regulations, empowers the Minister to pay to the servants of the Congested Districts Board the rate of emolument they would have if the Congested Districts Board had carried out their obligations.  I have done my best in this amendment to protect the Exchequer of the State against unfair payments and am merely asking to make provision for giving to those people the status they would have and the rights and emoluments they would have had if the Congested Districts Board had carried out its promises to them.  It may be said where is the money?  The answer to that is this: the Land Commission is taking over from the Congested Districts Board a sum of £100,000, or as I think, it is now £150,000.  That money is earmarked without doubt for the purposes of the <Col N="1884" /> Congested Districts Board.  But surely the first duty of that Board, if they still continued to exist, would be to pay their own obligations out of that fund to the servants by whose energy that fund was created.  Therefore it seems to me there is no undue call upon outside finance to carry out the bargain made by the Congested Districts Board.  They were getting their gratuity out of the funds at the disposal of the Board.  I suggest to you that the first duty of the Board was to pay their own debts to their own servants out of the funds at their own disposal.  Now that the Minister is taking over the funds of the Board I do suggest that he takes them over burdened with the obligations they possessed in the hands of the Board, of paying their own debts.  That I suggest can be done out of the moneys taken over, and if so there is no unreasonable draft upon the general Exchequer of the State.  They do not come upon the general taxpayer.  They come, if the amendment is accepted, out of the fund that was earned by the energy of the servants of this Board.  I respectfully submit this amendment to the Dáil's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance smiled sardonically when the Deputy referred to some money that was being transferred with the Congested Districts Board's functions and officers.  He should take the moneys subject to the equities.  That surplus is a surplus because the promises and undertakings of the Congested Districts Board to their officers were never honoured.  It seems cruel and harsh to begin an attack upon a body whose death is decreed and the transfer of whose assets is being arranged for.  But I have here a document which shows that this Board, like the National Board in the language used incidentally with regard to a statement of mine by the Minister for Education, is now in a state of death-bed repentance. Here is the document by way of a death-bed repentance which was sent by the Congested Districts Board for Ireland to the Minister for Agriculture on the 10th May, 1923.  It says, &ldquo;it is a great relief to receive your assurance that the passing of the contemplated Bill will not in any way prejudice the position of the Board's existing staff, or of their officials who have been superannuated.  But as regards <Col N="1885" /> their existing staff the Board desire to repeat their previous statement as to the relatively unfavourable scales of remuneration sanctioned many years ago for their officials when compared with the salaries approved upon reconstruction of all other analogous departments in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Remember the Board itself being the guilty agent in the matter.  The statement goes on:&mdash;&ldquo;Proposals for improvment in this respect would have been submitted at the time when the status and salaries of the officials of other departments were being considered, but for the fact that the Board's officials were paid out of the Board's income, and not out of voted money&rdquo;&mdash;a legal point made and passed by the Board itself when these officials were asking to be recognised as Civil Servants.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was obvious such an increase in salaries as might reasonably be anticipated would entail diminishing the funds applicable to the relief of congestion.&rdquo; The point was made by these gentlemen during the war, that because there was a war they could not entertain the claims for proper consideration put forward by the office, and yet they had one and a half millions of money invested at the time, over and above their annual income.</P>
      <P>I continue to read this death-bed wail, and believe that the Ministry should have a better sense of justice and equity than has animated the writers.  &ldquo;It was obvious such an increase in salaries as might reasonably be anticipated would entail diminishing the funds applicable to the relief of congestion.&rdquo;  They did not unduly diminish the funds, for the surplus to which Deputy FitzGibbon referred, of nearly one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, is to the good, being handed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote further:&mdash;&ldquo;And the Board, therefore, felt unable to encroach on the amount, little enough, available for their projects.  Now, however, as their staff will be transferred to reconstituted departments, the Board suggests, for the consideration of yourself and the Ministry of Finance, whether an introduction of the proposed Bills does not afford a suitable opportunity to legislate for the regulation of the status and salaries of the Board's staffs, or, at all events, for the insertion of a clause that the transferred officials shall, subject to the approval of <Col N="1886" /> the Ministry of Finance, be entitled to such status and salaries as have been sanctioned for the departments to which they may respectively be transferred. The Board feels very strongly that obligations to their meritorious staff compel them to urge upon the Government the justice of placing their officials in line with those of other departments, whose position has already been dealt with and approved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, from the brief which I have, I should like to inform you of what exactly is proposed in the amendment.  In 1911 there was a reorganisation of the clerical staff of the C.D. Board, and the result of that was, that a scheme of salaries was arranged similar to those provided for Second Class Clerks in the Civil Service. That does not mean that those officials were deemed to be Second Class Civil Servants.  They were merely remunerated at a scale similar to that provided for Second Division Clerks.  Now, here were the salaries: third grade goes to a maximum of £130; second grade rises from £130 to £200.  At these two points, as you are aware, in the Civil Service there are placed what are called efficiency barriers; in other words, promotion is not automatic.  It is conditional upon a report from the head of the Department declaring that the character and the efficiency of the man who is rising to this maximum are satisfactory.  Upon that report, he moves into the higher grade, and rises then until he reaches the next efficiency barrier.  That is the arrangement in the Civil Service.  These unhappy officials of the C.D.B. thought that though they were not Civil Servants technically because they were paid out of the funds of the Board and not out of a grant voted by Parliament, yet they were, so far as salaries and promotions were concerned, to be dealt with upon the same lines.  Mr. Micks, by the way, in his evidence before the Civil Service Commission of 1913, declared they had established scales of pay which brought their establishment on a Second Division basis.  Mr. Micks declared that his Board had brought the establishment on a Second Division basis, but when the time arose for promotion, in the mode arranged for in the Civil Service, it was declared that no vacancy existed in the Second Grade, and because there was no vacancy there could be no move up.  This seems like a point of metaphysics.  There <Col N="1887" /> was no vacuum.  It was a congested district; in fact, as the Minister for Agriculture suggests, in the C.D. Board it would be a congested district if the move up were made.  The contention of the officials concerned was that they should have the scheme applied to them which operates in the Civil Service, and curiously enough two officials were promoted to the Second Grade after a great deal of contention.</P>

      <P>That was done, notwithstanding all the protestations of the Board.  They created a sense of grievance in the others who were barred.  &ldquo;In June, 1918, the Board definitely limited the number of clerks for each Grade, the effect of which was to take away the prospects of promotion held out earlier.&rdquo;  A more important thing, much more important, in which the Congested Districts Board did not follow upon the lines parallel to those of the Civil Service, was with respect to the staff reorganisation on Whitley lines.  Now, according to staff reorganisation on Whitley lines, a certain number of graded clerks would have been made Executive officers.  We had the point raised, you will recollect, with regard to the estimates for public education. There were two divisions there in the office of Primary or National education, of lower Executive clerks and upper Executive clerks, and I think it was Deputy Johnson who raised the question as to how many women were in the lower Executive division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in the lower the Board refused to apply the staff reorganisation on Whitley lines. The result is that none of these officers was moved up into an Executive position, and that puts them in a very bad position when they come over to be part of the new reconstituted Land Commission for then they are men who passed an examination, which, as Deputy FitzGibbon pointed out, is precisely that which the others, who will become their colleagues, have passed with the addition of Irish.  They have much more years of service than some <Col N="1888" /> of these men, yet, because of this non-application of the Whitley reorganisation they will be in a very much inferior position. They remain the only pensionable class in the Civil Service who receive no benefit whatever out of the Whitley reconstruction scheme.  Now practically these are the losses which they have suffered &mdash; the annual increment of salary within the limits of £150 and £300; substantial cash payment which was made to the Civil Servants generally under the Whitley Report; special increments of salary which followed the application of the Whitley Report, and which have been in operation since January, 1920. Briefly then, the purport of the amendment is, that these Congested Districts Board officials shall not go into the newly constituted Land Commission and remain Cinderellas.  They have been long enough in this outer darkness of oppression &mdash; Civil Servants not Civil Servants. I think that this will appeal, even to the Minister for Finance, that as there is a fund out of which these long overdue increments can be paid they ought to be paid out of it.  I may regard this as loot on the part of the Board made out of the blood and service of these men whom they penalised.  As regards the grading you will hardly have satisfactory service from these men &mdash; I am not speaking with any intention of a threat and I hope I am not using an unhappy form of words, but I am using the ordinary kind of speculation and the ordinary kind of prophecy that humanity is entitled to make.  You will not have a happy family made up of two sets of Civil Servants, one with a decided grievance, the other with none, and both called upon to discharge the same work in the service of the State.  Therefore it seems to me it makes for good administration to consider well the grievances of these men and to remedy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>After the very eloquent appeal made by Deputy FitzGibbon and Deputy Magennis, I think the heart of the Minister, if it ever has been hard, is considerably softened.  Deputy Magennis read a document from the old Board which, although under the British regime, was, strange to say, composed wholly of Irishmen.  That document, which I have had the pleasure of reading, is one of these documents typical of the the old regime, overflowing with sympathy <Col N="1889" /> and regret that they did not do what they should have done.  I am not going to read it again, but there are many things in it which, if carried out by the Minister, would make him do quite the opposite to that which they appeal for in the last paragraph.  The document has been sent to the Minister, and I understand that representations have been made to him with regard to these grievances by representatives of the very small number of men affected.  Yesterday, apparently, a document was issued by the Secretary to the Board warning members of the staff regarding the question of canvassing T.D.'s and others.  I do not know whether there is very much in that, but it would appear from that that they were afraid the Staff would state their case in a way that would secure it being remedied.  I am not assuming that the Minister is unsympathetic to the amendment moved by Deputy FitzGibbon.  It has been stated, I believe, that this is a legacy that is being handed over by the British administration.  No doubt we have had many legacies handed over by the British administration which we would like to get rid of and forget, but I think that this one, at any rate, is one which the Minister would not like to take over without, at least, giving it very serious consideration as to the consequences of not remedying what appears to be a serious injustice.  Deputy Magennis has harped upon the danger of taking over a staff which is no doubt very much discontented. I happened to know, not recently but for a long time, that many members of the Congested Districts Board staff were men associated with the Gaelic movement, and many of them suffered during the period of the Anglo-Irish war. I am not stating that to influence the mind of the Minister in coming to a decision on the point, but I think it has some bearing on the question, especially as these men feel that they are suffering under a grievance.  I know some of these men personally and, to be quite frank, I know that they are in debt.  One man got married on the assumption that at a certain period of his life, when his responsibility would increase, he would have a certain salary, but he assures me that his wife is threatening a divorce for having married her under false pretences.  I am sure the Minister would not like any member of his staff taken over and dealt <Col N="1890" /> with by the public courts for such a very serious matter.  The members of this old Board who were apparently very anxious to put off the evil day were regretting their treatment of these men, giving as reasons from time to time that the European war was not over and that the men on active service had not returned to duty.  It is possible that many of them did not return.  Perhaps they thought the whole of them would not come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Pension scheme was not settled, the time was not opportune&rdquo;; that is a very vague term.  &ldquo;The Whitley Council was not set up,&rdquo; and last, but not least, &ldquo;the change in the Government of Ireland.&rdquo; They foresaw that development, and foresaw a time when an Irish Minister, such as the Minister for Agriculture, would deal with them in a more just manner than that in which they were prepared to deal with them.  Professor Magennis has referred to the fact that the status of the individuals concerned, and there are only about 80 altogether, was admitted to be that of a Second Division status.  I have not the Blue Book before me, and I have not read the Blue Book, but giving evidence before the Royal Commission of 1913, Mr. Micks was questioned with regard to it.  I will read a little of the contents.  &ldquo;You have an established scale of pay placing your establishment on a Second Division basis?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;If your claim to bring your clerks on the establishment were granted it would practically establish a Second Division in your office?&rdquo;&ldquo;Certainly.  Our hope and aim is to have all our staff on the grade and salary of a Second Division.&rdquo;  That proves what he was prepared to admit before the Commission but not to carry out in practice. That is, in fact, the real position so far as these men are concerned.  One can see there is a distinction between an Extern Minister responsible to this Dáil on the one hand and the Minister for Finance on the other, and one can also see especially when one can see as I do, that there is a tight grip of the hidden hand of the old Ministry that we knew so much about in the old days, behind this.  The Minister is responsible to this Dáil directly, and I would ask him if there is any difference between his own view and that of the Minister for Finance, he should submit the matter to a free vote of this Dáil.  The Minister has on many occasions, to my knowledge, <Col N="1891" /> said hard things, but the worst he says to us here is the very opposite to what he would say to us outside.  I mean to say he would say it in a different form. I am sure, from documents in my possession that the carrying out of the obligation can be covered by the amount of £14,900.  That amount of £14,900 is asked out of the surplus of £153,000 which is taken over from the C.D.B. by the Minister.  I think, taking all the circumstances into consideration, and claiming, as I do, that the contract of service has been broken in this case, the Minister might be agreeable to set such a small amount out of the surplus when taking over the clerical staffs of those Departments.  If he has any doubts, and wishes to free himself from the responsibility of committing his department to such a question of this kind, I hope he may submit the matter for the free decision of the members.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a portion of this debate with a considerable amount of curiosity.  I feel that the staff likely to be installed in the future will probably comprise four classes; you will have the Cinderellas, the two classes through whose services we have arrived at our present position, and those who were passive, if not more so, during that period.  I do not envy the position of the Minister who is going to attempt to reconcile that position with the economic interests of this country.  I think, with regard to the arguments brought forward by Professor Magennis on behalf of those officials, that it is a technical difference that prevents them from having exactly the same status as Civil Servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is just these technical difficulties that the local bodies at the present time are taking full advantage of, and we have got to take full advantage of that for economical purposes in the same way with regard to this amendment, which really deals with the economics of the position.  The Minister for Finance is right in his position when he stands up for economies.  Otherwise you will have a military victory turned into an economic defeat.  If every official is allowed to have a certain status assigned to him and get the same pensionable rights, I think we would be doing a disastrous thing to the country.  The country <Col N="1892" /> can very ill afford to bear this burden and leave this legacy behind, and the country will deal with us if we do any thing of the sort.</P>

The idea of the amendment is to give power to the Minister for Finance, and to the Minister who is responsible for the department, to create pensionable officers of the Congested Districts Board in the clerical and executive classes of the Land Commission.  We have power to do that already.  The suggestion now is that all the pensionable officers and non-pensionable officers should be graded and established. That is a suggestion that could not and would not be carried out. There are non-established officers in every department, temporary non-established officers in every department, in the Department of Agriculture, in the Land Commission, in Education, in every department, and I can say one thing offhand, that all the temporary clerks of the Congested Districts Board will not be established, just as all the temporary clerks in the Land Commission will not be established.  But the Minister for Finance and the Minister who is responsible for the Land Commission have ample powers to establish any clerical or pensionable officer in the Congested Districts Board, and what more is wanted?  That is the reason I say I do not understand the amendment.  I do not know what more is wanted.  I take it that no one would suggest that every temporary clerk in the Congested Districts Board should be established as a civil servant and that you would make a new grievance, namely, that all the temporary clerks in the Land Commission would say &ldquo;Why would we not also be established?&rdquo;  If you do not want every clerk in the Congested Districts Board established then the position is quite clear.  The Ministry of Finance have power to establish any officer that they wish and they will take the merits of each case into account.  They will take the length of service, efficiency and every other consideration which the head of the department and the Establishment Branch of the Ministry of Finance take into account when they are thinking of promoting an officer.  They have that power already for that purpose.  This <Col N="1893" /> does not help us one bit except, of course, that it is a very unsound principle to put into an Act of Parliament to try to confine in an Act of Parliament the discretion that is purely executive and administrative.  With regard to these men I may say that all the pensionable officers of the Congested Districts Board will be established in the Land Commission and a number of temporary officers in the Congested Districts Board will be promoted when they come over to us, just as there will be promotions in the Land Commission, but they will get as fair a chance as the existing staff of the Land Commission, or of any other Government department, and all the circumstances of the case, their previous service, the efficiency of their service, everything, will be taken into account in the ordinary way to deal with these matters, and more you cannot do.</P>

      <P>I thought I made it clear that when a Minister for Finance tackles the question he will take into account all the relevant circumstances, their length of service under the Board previously, the actual quality of the service that they gave, and so on, and will take it, if I may go so far as to say, in a sympathetic way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I should say that the Minister for Finance would take into account the service that they have had under the Board.  Even this Act provides that their previous pensionable service shall be taken into account. It will be open for the establishment to consider all the relevant circumstances, their treatment in the Congested Districts Board, the services they gave in the Congested Districts Board, the length of service, efficiency of service, the class of work they were doing and all the other consideration that are usually taken into account when questions like that are gone into.  It will come to this, that their service in the Congested Districts Board will be regarded as their service, let us say, in the Department of Agriculture will be regarded; they will get credit for it, I take it.  I cannot accept this amendment under any circumstances.  With regard to the circular which Deputy Davin read, complaining that these officers were lobbying in the House, I may say that I am responsible for that circular.  I have been looking at them now for three weeks, and they seem to be spending most of their time here in the Dáil button-holding Deputies as they come out in the lobby.  That, in my opinion, is a grossly unsound principle to recognise, that officers of the State should come here to the Dáil, day after day, and collar Deputies outside in the lobby, and canvass and generally worry and bother them.  There is a right time and a wrong time to do that sort of thing, and certainly they got ample time to do all the propaganda and all the organising they require, and as far as I have anything to do with them I will certainly not stand for any more of that.  They seem to spend more time here than at their work.</P>

      <P>There is one point I would like to put before the <Col N="1895" /> Minister, and it draws his attention directly to a certain wording in the amendment.  He has stated quite correctly the obvious truth, that if the Minister for Finance or the Establishment Section of that Department of the Ministry, desire to promote or sanction the promotion of any person taken over that way, it has the liberty and right to do it.  Nobody is questioning that at all. The question is rather that the amendment lays down quite clearly that certain rights which should have been earned, were earned and, in fact, were recognised as having been earned by the Board, should now be taken over.  The words are that their salary should be adjusted according to such services, just as salaries should be adjusted in the service in which they were, just the same as if that service had been service in the ordinary Civil Service, which it was for all practical purposes recognised to be by every person.  It is a matter of plain, simple equity.  You might be able in this regard by not giving that recognition to make, as Deputy McGoldrick suggests, a certain economy, but I think that is not the worthiest suggestion to put before the Dáil.  I think what we ought to recognise is, if it is an honourable commitment in the change that we are about to make that we should accept it and acquit ourselves of it.  That is as I understand the meaning of the words used by Deputy Fitzgibbon.</P>

      <P>I rather think that the last three lines give powers that they do not already possess, and give a distinct addition to the powers they profess to claim, that they make certain regulations, and in making these regulations they may provide for a repayment of money that they would not otherwise be entitled to give.  I confess that I am not myself very experienced in the details of Civil Service regulations, but when I framed the amendment I was of opinion that that was the power which required to be specifically conferred in dealing with public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I answer the point so far as I am able?  It does look as if from what the Minister for Agriculture says, that the first part may make regulations for payment to the Executive class of the Civil Service, which is proposing what they can already do.  They can do that to men who are already Civil Servants of the State.  The Minister for Agriculture may have overlooked that.  The Minister for Finance may settle that by the Whitley Reorganisation Scheme as regards men who are Civil Servants.  But these men are not Civil Servants, and our object here is that they shall be Civil Servants once the transfer takes place.  Therefore, I dissent from the view of the Minister for Agriculture that it proposes to give them powers which they already have.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated we have power to make a higher executive officer of every officer of the Congested Districts Board if we wish.  I think that is clear.  That applies to every officer, and it is entirely at the discretion of the Ministers.  None of them are Civil Servants at the moment.  They can be taken over and established, and they will get Civil Service certificates when established. As far as I know there is power to make a higher executive officer of every officer now in the Congested Districts Board, but that is not going to be done. There must be discretion.  We have all these powers already.</P>

      <P>I may be particularly stupid.  All I gather clearly is: there is power to make an executive class officer, provided that and this is a condition precedent that the officer in question is an established Civil Servant. However, what we desire to have is that these men should become established Civil Servants on the transfer.  I agree that once that has been done then the rest is unnecessary, because the provision is for it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that, subject to certain conditions, which we all know, that certain men who have certain qualifications will become Executive Officers as from the date of the transfer.  The point at issue is, whether or not they are going to be compensated for positions they have lost during the past period.  If the conditions of Second Division Clerks were given to them and they got into a certain class at the time they were not entitled to, and because they have not got that, is the Minister empowered or prepared to make provision at the date of transfer?  The cost of paying the claims of the graded staff would be approximately: Arrears of Increments (and War Bonus thereon) to 1st January, 1920, £2,500; Arrears of increments arising out of assimilation as from 1st January, 1920, £23,700; overtime earned from 1st January, 1920, which under the terms of the Whitely Report is refundable by Executive Officers, £5,500; allowances given by Board to married clerks for children, £3,700; income tax, £2,100, which makes it appear that there is a sum of £14,900 due to the individuals concerned.</P>
