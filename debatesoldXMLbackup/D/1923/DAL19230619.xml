      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that the establishment of direct steamship services between Ireland and Manchester is primarily a question of Irish interests; whether the Irish Government as a Government has made representations to the British Government as to the importance and urgency of giving through rates <i>via</i> Manchester, and, if so, with what result; whether he is aware that the present system of charging the same rates in England for short haulage as for long haulage, with a view to forcing traffic by particular routes, is a violation of the English Railways Act, which requires the rates to be fixed on a basis consonant with the economical earning of dividends; whether the attention of the British Government has been called to that fact, and also to the fact that the preferential rates now in operation in Great Britain are prejudicial to Irish interests; and whether similar representations have been made by the Government officially to the British Railway Companies, and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>The Government has not made any representations to the British Government on this matter, as the British Government has no power to grant through rates.  The obligations of the railways in Great Britain in the matter of through rates depend on the Railways Act, 1921, which established a Railway Rates Tribunal, <Col N="2046" /> before which proceedings can be taken at the instance of traders affected in disputes with the railway companies as to rates.  It would obviously not be proper for me to express any opinion as to whether the English Railway Companies are violating the English Railways Act, but if they are, I am advised that traders prejudicially affected have the right to resort to the Railway Rates Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been in communication with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, which is the company concerned in Manchester traffic, and has represented the importance to Irish cross-Channel trade of facilitating traffic <i>via</i> Manchester.  A definite reply has not yet been received, but the company is known to be considering the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the shortage of housing accommodation in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin, he will issue instructions that prior to any compensation being paid to the owner of the seven cottages in Clonard Street, Balbriggan, which were burned during the Black-and-Tan regime, he will secure a guarantee that the compensation so awarded will be used for rebuilding purposes.</P>

      <P>When the Compensation (Ireland) Commission attached to their award a condition that the whole or any part thereof is to be applied in the reinstatement of the structure, the amount awarded is normally greater than it would have been had no such condition been imposed. In the case referred to by the Deputy a decree by the Recorder of Dublin for £2,600 0s. Od. was reduced by the Commission to the sum of £850 0s. Od. Had a rebuilding condition been enforced the presumption is that the amount of the award would have been considerably greater.  Where the award is made free of any condition as to reinstatement, the Minister is not empowered to impose any condition or exact any such guarantee as that referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that for the year 1922 the staff of Dundrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum did not receive the amount of annual leave to which they were ordinarily entitled as one of their conditions of service at the date of their transfer to the Free State Government; what are the intentions of the Ministry in respect to the annual leave due to them for the current year; whether the loss of annual leave is due to the fact that the positions filled by two charge attendants, who retired on pension in January and March, 1922, have not been filled, the duties attaching to them being since carried out by two ordinary attendants, without extra remuneration, and that there is in consequence a shortage of staff; further, whether he is aware that the number of patients in the Asylum is practically the same as when the two charge attendants retired, and, taking these facts into consideration, will he now take the necessary steps to have the two posts filled, and so permit of the staff receiving the annual leave to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1922 it was necessary to restrict the annual leave of the male attendants in the Central Asylum to fourteen days, as it was not found possible with the existing staff to grant the maximum leave of twenty-eight days.  The question of adding male attendants to the staff in order that full leave may be granted is at present under the consideration of the Ministry of Finance.  Two male charge attendants retired in January and February, 1922. and in accordance with a scheme of reorganisation which came into force on 1st March, 1920, and which provided for a reduction of the number of charge attendants from five to three, these posts were allowed to lapse.  The ratio of attendants to patients in this asylum is high, there being now one male attendant to less than four male patients.  The staff has been largely increased in recent <Col N="2048" /> years in order to effect a reduction in the hours of duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether his refusal to allow the Town Commissioners of Newcastle West to proceed with the building of houses by direct labour indicates a general objection to direct labour by local authorities for such work; and whether he would be prepared, in view of the delay which has already occurred owing to legal difficulties and the default of the original contractor, over which the Township Commissioners had no control, to expedite the commencement of the work by allowing the Commissioners to do it by direct labour.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there are upwards of 200 employees of Messrs.  Smith and Co. and Messrs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made enquiries into the placing of contracts with the two firms mentioned.  Messrs. Smith are makers principally of high-class hosiery, of a quality much superior to that which the Contracting Departments of the Ministries of Defence or Local Government require.  Presumably, for this reason no tenders in reply to advertisements appear to have been received from them, and they were not in a position to quote for articles about which a communication was addressed directly to them.</P>
      <P>With regard to Messrs. Gallen, who are a linen firm, an order has been placed with them by the Contracting Branch of the Ministry of Local Government, and their name is on the list of contractors. I may add that all Government requirements of linen are being obtained in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I desire to move for permission to have printed and circulated to the Deputies a Bill the object of which is to give the Commissioners of Public Works power to examine and acquire, if necessary compulsorily, premises for the accommodation of the Civic Guard.  The total Civic Guard establishment provides for 807 stations.  To date only 401 stations have been established, and there has been considerable difficulty and delay in establishing these. It was only after very long negotiations that a station could be established, for instance, in the important town of Mallow, and it is only quite recently that we have been able to open stations in Tullamore, Carrick-on-Suir, Claremorris, and other towns of populations running into thousands.  The reaction of that delay on civic administration will be obvious, and we consider that the circumstances justify asking the Dáil for powers for compulsory acquisition. There will be in the Bill provisions for arbitration or settlement on the questions of rent, and so on.  It seems definitely a question where the public interests demands the sinking of the strict legal rights of individuals.  It seems eminently a case where compulsory powers are needed by the State and ought to be given by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;Before Section 28 to insert a new Section as follows:&mdash; Any Regulations or Orders made under any of the provisions of the Act of 1918, imposing a fee on insured persons desiring to transfer from one Approved Society to another, are hereby repealed, and, for a period of twelve months from the passing of this Act, transfers of members between Societies may be effected without fee charged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>After that wonderful exhibition of faith in the good sense and administrative abilities of the Minister and his Department, I think that there is not much to be said in favour of this Amendment, because it will only require something of this kind to be a set-off to all that has passed.  The object of the Amendment is to nullify to some extent any faults that may have occurred through the hurried rushing of this Bill through the Dáil, and the circumstances that have preceded the bringing of this Bill to the Dáil.  Many persons have been transferred automatically without their knowledge from British to Irish societies.</P>
      <P>Many persons are and have been in Irish societies more or less without choice, and the object of the amendment is to allow for a time&mdash;I have suggested twelve months&mdash;such transfers as are allowable under the Act to be made without a fee to the transferred person.  This was the condition of things prior to 1918. Since that time there has been a transfer fee charged.  But especially touching members that are now being transferred from English societies, it is desirable, I submit, that such transfer of individuals after the 1st July should be facilitated where the individual makes such a claim, and he should not be penalised for the faults of the administration.  With that end in view I propose the Amendment.</P>

    <Col N="2063" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy is aware of the fact that the reason for the inclusion of the charge of 2/- was to cover the cost of the transfer. The cost to a Society by the loss of a member is calculated at 2/-, which about covers the cost of labour, postage, and other incidental expenses.  If the amendment is passed it would mean that any person in any Society could elect to transfer to any other Society, and that would afford a licence which has not been in operation for nearly five years.  I do not know if the Deputy had in mind giving an opportunity to all persons to change.  Apart from the actual cost entailed, it is thought inadvisable to allow an opportunity for canvassing, I think it is called grabbing.  From that point of view I am not disposed to look favourably on the amendment.  I do not know if the Deputy had any intention to allow complete power of transfer in those cases. Quite a small number would be affected in the sense, which he has described the case for, and the sum involved might be very considerable and the result unsatisfactory. I am advised that it would not be an improvement in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the case which I have cited is of pressing importance.  Leaving out the general question of the transfer of members of Irish Societies, the case of the transfer of members of English Societies, who must be transferred by the 1st July, and who are being transferred, practically, without their knowledge, and under powers which we are now considering, places these members in an unfortunate position.  I submit that we are in duty bound to give these transferees the right to re-transfer to such Society as they choose without paying a fee.  The position is that insured persons are permitted to transfer, subject to approval by the Commissioners, but that transfer must be accompanied by a charge of 2/-. That is not the case where an insured person is assumed to have chosen his Society, but in the case in question which is especially in mind, the case of transfer of members who are being transferred automatically under the provisions of this Bill.  There has been provisional transfer, and people are being transferred, provisionally, in the expectation that this Bill will authorise such transfer.  The <Col N="2064" /> very fact that we are discussing this matter on the 19th June, and the whole business has to be made legal by the 1st July, and the transfers must automatically have taken place before the 1st July, surely imposes on us an obligation, and we ought not to penalise the individual who desires to transfer at a later stage to a Society which he chooses to transfer to.  It seems to me that the request is a very reasonable one, and I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not acceded, at least, to the principle of the amendment.  We have some responsibility, and I think that the Minister ought not to forget that many members are being transferred and that they know nothing whatever about the conditions of their transfer, with whom they will be associated, to what Society they will be going&mdash;nothing, in fact, touching the question at all.  I do not mind what period is selected if it is a period after the 1st July, so that when the Bill becomes law, and the insured person knows what the law is, he should have the right to choose to what Society he wishes to belong. If such transfer is not allowed, and if such an amendment is not met fairly, I think that the Bill would not, perhaps, have received quite the same facilities as it has had for its passing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to meet the Deputy, though he has not come far on the road to meet me.  I propose to insert a new Section before Section 10 as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The provisions of Proviso <i>(e)</i> to Sub-Section 1 of Section 14 of the Act of 1898, requiring the payment of a fee by a member of an Approved Society on terminating his membership, shall not apply in the case of any person who becomes a member of an Approved Society in Saorstát Eireann on the 1st July, 1923, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this part of this Act, and who gives notice within six months from the passing of this Act, of his desire to terminate his membership.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That will meet the main point.  I hope there will be some provision made whereby there will be some easing of the situation regarding transfers in general.  I think that power rests in the Commissioners, and I would ask that that whole question be considered with a view to facilitating transfers, if the Commissioners approve of such transfers.  It is a point that may be <Col N="2065" /> dealt with by the Commissioners alone apart from this Bill.</P>

      <P>The President has produced his amendment as the result of a case made by Deputy Johnson for the transfer of members of English Approved Societies who automatically must go into an Irish Approved Society before the 1st July.  I hope now that the President will see that his new resolution will not allow that resolution to be used for the purpose of any Irish society poaching the members of any Irish Approved Society which has members already. That point has been completely hidden, and I would ask the Minister to go carefully into it, and see with regard to Irish societies that members already in a society will not be taken from them by any means brought about by the introduction of this resolution.  You may see a number of efforts made to start new Irish societies, and attempts will be made to induce other members to leave societies already approved of by the Commissioners.

The fact of his being able to introduce this huge measure in our own Parliament must make plain to every citizen in the State, and to people outside of it, also, the importance and the nature and scope of the work which is placed in the hands of <Col N="2067" /> the people of this country.  Everybody ought to realise that this State is given the power to do good or to do evil.  Every Deputy knows that, and this is one of the measures that ought to bring it home to the people.</P>
      <P>On the Bill itself I do not know that I can congratulate the Minister.  There are some of the terms of the Bill that I do not agree with.  The Bill is not new. The principle of this Bill as regards compulsion and everything else was agreed, for instance, in 1918 and again in 1920.</P>

      <P>As regards compulsion, yes, but the terms are different, I admit. The Minister, to use his own words, said, &ldquo;We are meeting the position put up by the unpurchased tenants of the Saorstát, to force a Land Bill and to force an ending of this trouble.&rdquo;  We refuse to pay rent, and we refuse to pay anything, in future, but annuities.  I admit the Minister has met that fairly.  The great question is that the agreements of 1920, and their monetary consideration, must be radically altered, and are, to a certain extent, altered by the conditions that prevail now in 1923.  Anybody who has an eye to see, or who pays any attention to matters moving around, must know that the conditions in 1918 and in 1920, as compared with now are radically changed.  The agricultural position is different altogether to-day from what it was then.  Anybody who looks around the country to-day realises that the economic conditions that prevailed then, and the rates of the figures of purchase that prevailed then, are not obtaining to-day, and anybody who observes the burden that the State has to bear will be struck with the difference between the position prevailing now and what prevailed then.  The purchase figures must be calculated so as to meet this difference.  There is a good deal of sympathy here for one class of the community&mdash;the landlords.  Some people call it &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and other people call it &ldquo;fair play all round,&rdquo; and even some go to prove the innocence of these people. I have seen it stated in the papers that these people did not obstruct land purchase, and did not interfere with these things at all, but helped land purchase in <Col N="2068" /> every way.  I have a letter here received by a tenant after the passing of the Wyndham Act.  It is dated February 8th, 1905, and it is addressed to a gentleman named John Flynn.  It is in reply to a letter demanding the right to purchase under the Wyndham Act, and it is only one, out of a hundred or a hundred and fifty similar letters that we could produce, and it reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, You may inform those, in whose behalf your letter appears to have been written that I have no intention of selling my property, and no intention of reducing rents, because sales have taken place on neighbouring properties, and, under these circumstances, I cannot receive a deputation to discuss such subjects.  I may add that any of my tenants who want to see me can do so individually at any time.&rdquo; That is a sample of the attitude, one out of hundreds, of, those people towards every Land Act that was passed.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the question of price, the price set out in the Bill falls very far short of the demand we put forward, and that applies both to price and arrears.  I will deal with the question of price first.  They are not even as high as the prices put up by Father Maguire on behalf of the unpurchased tenants of Co. Monaghan.  These were 45 per cent. on first term rents, 40 per cent. on second term rents, and 35 per cent. on third term.  Even that, which was the smallest demand of any county in Ireland except one, has not been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGoldrick told us on Friday last a good deal about figures.  I am sorry he is not here this evening, because I would like to have a talk with him about his figures.  Can he deny, or can any Deputy in the Dáil deny, that a purchased tenant under the 1903 Act of a first term rental has benefited more by a reduction than the capital sum of less than 4.20 or not more than six years' purchase?  Any purchaser under the 1903 Act could not be in receipt of a capital sum of less than 4.20, or more than six years, that is to say, that to the extent of a little less than four and a quarter of the capital sum he is better off than the man who never purchased.  Four and a quarter years' purchase is a big thing as regards the financial position of the unpurchased tenants of this country, and would be a big thing now if taken into consideration with regard to this Purchase Bill.  If four and a half years' <Col N="2069" /> purchase, with the rate of interest at 4½ per cent., were taken into consideration now, it would bring the present price to the unpurchased tenants of the country down to about 9½ or 10 years' purchase. I would like to know what Deputy McGoldrick based his figures on when he said that there was only a point in the difference as between 35 per cent. and 36 per cent.  I would like to know what he was talking about.  Was he making a comparison as between the time when the interest on purchase money was 2¾ per cent., compared with 3 per cent. or 4½ per cent. now?  With regard to arrears, the Government has put it in their Bill that three years' arrears are to be considered, subject to a 25 per cent. reduction. On the Committee Stage we, acting on behalf of our people, will submit an amendment that only two years be considered instead of three, and that these two years' arrears be subject to a 40 per cent. reduction; adding one year to the purchase money, the other to be paid in cash.  The majority of the unpurchased tenants of the country are poor men, small holders, with rentals from £5 to £25.  Everyone in the country knows that the last three years have not been years of plenty; they have been lean years, and everyone acquainted with the condition of the country knows that men with these small rentals could not have amassed or could not have made money. To ask them now to pay three years' arrears on the purchase of their property would be asking them to do something which it would be impossible for them to do.  People engaged in agriculture made no money in the year 1921; the land was worked at a loss, and there was no money made either in the following year, and as far as I can see there is very little money going to be made this year.  Men in a small way who had to meet these losses, and who had to face facts and pay their way, had no money laid aside to meet three years' arrears now.  If three years' arrears were to be added to the purchase it would mean that these men would have to go to the banks, if the banks were good enough or foolish enough, to give them the money, but what I submit is that you are asking these to do what is impossible.  It must be remembered, too, that adding a year's rent to the purchase money now is a different proposition altogether to adding a year's rent to purchase money under <Col N="2070" /> the Wyndham Act, when the interest on purchase money was 2¾ per cent., while the present rate is 4½ per cent.  Adding a year's rent to the purchase money now would be almost like adding two years under the Wyndham Act, and I ask the Minister to take a note of that fact. Anyone dealing with finance, or dealing with the people, cannot ignore the fact that, adding one year's rent to the purchase money now is equal, almost, to two years' rent under the Wyndham Act. I also want to say a word on behalf of a small body of third-term tenants.  They number, I believe, about 5,000.  These were men who, when their second term was up, went into the Courts.  At that time the country was gradually forcing itself ahead; it was building up reserves and there was prosperity all round. There was security for everyone, and men knew what they were doing, and could make fairly accurate anticipations as to the future.  When sowing their crops they could tell almost to within 6d. per barrel as to what they were going to get for their barley and oats, and it was the same as regards the sale of their cattle in the autumn.  They could tell almost to within 10/- per head as to what the cattle would realise, and it was the same with the dairy farmer.  He knew what his income was going to be.  But the position is quite different to-day.  No one knows what is going to happen, and there is no security or guarantee for those engaged in the agricultural industry.  There is no steadiness in the industry.  A man may sow a crop to-day, but someone else may reap it, or even worse, burn it to-morrow. My point is that these third-term tenants ought to be put on the same level as the second-term tenants.  I notice from the Bill that there is no provision for lease-holders, except short lease-holders, or future tenants, or holders under fee-farm grants.</P>
    <P>Probably that is an omission.  It will be our duty as representing the people whom we do represent to put down amendments including all these tenancies, in fact any person who is occupying land at present.  We view with pleasure the condition under which those in possession of uneconomic holdings and the landless men of the country are going to get a reasonable and decent way of living.  We have been agitating for this and other sections of our people have been agitating before us, and I do congratulate <Col N="2071" /> the Government on this ranch-breaking proposal.  It is something that has not been contained in any previous measure, and has never before been agreed to, and I do congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and the Government on handling this question in no uncertain manner.  I am glad, too, that the evicted tenants&mdash;I mean the genuine evicted tenants, not the professional ones who are making capital out of it&mdash;will get a fair show, and I hope that will apply not alone to the evicted tenants since 1881, but since 1870, because it was the men who fought since 1870 who made the 1881 position.  It was the men who were victimised and had to go on the roadside to draw attention to the condition of things who made this a living issue, and I think we ought to go back to 1870 at least.  We demand, and we will put down amendments demanding a 40 per cent. reduction in the three classes of judicial rents dealt with in the Bill.  There is no use discussing the question of amendments now, or making speeches about them, but we will put down amendments demanding that reduction, and I think that the majority of this Dáil ought to be with us in making that demand, because I do not think it is asking too much.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sporting and fishing rights, I would like to deal with the sporting rights first.  I see it is proposed in the Bill to reserve the sporting rights to the Land Commission.  I know a little about preservation and about game.  I have had a little to do with these matters in my time.  It is a different matter altogether when you are dealing with game on untenanted lands or mountains, than it is when you are dealing with the game on the tenanted lands.  There may be game on the untenanted lands and mountains in the hands of the landlord, but it is mainly the tenants who have kept any game there is on the tenanted lands of the country.  It is the tenants that have preserved these lands and not the landlords.  I never knew a landlord to preserve tenanted land.  I can conceive no position in which you could look with more certainty to the destruction of game than if you were to make the tenant hostile to your laws.  In a short time you would not have a head of game in the country if that were done.  Without the co-operation and good will of the occupiers <Col N="2072" /> of the land game would disappear absolutely in six months from this country.</P>

      <P>If that is so, I can guarantee from my knowledge of the people of the country that game will multiply.  There are no better preservers of game than the tenants.  In my district where I happen to live, before we purchased the property in 1914 there was no game and no preservation.  Since that time we have started preserving, and we have got the game, and at the present time we have hares in abundance; we have wing game in abundance, and the only trouble is that we have too much vermin&mdash;rabbits, etc.  I am very glad that this question of the sporting rights is settled as far as we are concerned. With regard to the fishing rights, inland fisheries are quite a different proposition from the seaboard fisheries or the tidal fisheries near the mouths of the rivers. Our people hold that at least in the fresh water portion of our rivers the fishing rights, which have not been exercised heretofore in many cases&mdash;they have been exercised only in a few cases&mdash;should go to the tenant.  We are not so keen about the fishing rights as about the sporting <Col N="2073" /> rights.  At the same time our people hold that the fresh water portion of the fishing rights, at least, should go to the tenants in occupation of the land.</P>
      <P>There is one clause, in fact there is a series of clauses in this Bill dealing with the powers of the Land Commission, and I think those powers, to say the least of them, would want to be more clearly defined. In fact they ought to be curtailed unless upon explanation we are convinced that they should be retained.  We may be taking a wrong view of them.  We may not understand everything that appears in the Bill&mdash;I am quite certain we do not&mdash;but I hope these clauses do not bear the meaning we put on them.  We think that the Land Commission is to be given most autocratic powers, and that the matter needs very careful consideration. However, we can discuss that in Committee. With regard to the law proceedings for the recovery of arrears, that question of arrears has been in dispute for years.  It became acute recently in dealing with the position up-to-date. There was no law in the country or very little law, and men had brought home to them when the 1920 Bill failed that it was up to them to force the position. They refused to pay rent.  It was up to them to force the position so that they would be put on the same level as the rest of the purchased tenants, and no rent therefore was paid.  That dispute has been going on.  The first public intimation that this Government was going to deal with the question was contained in the speech of the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a few months it was followed by the introduction of the measure we are now discussing.  In other words, the State became an Arbitration Court on this question, and once the State not alone offered to arbitrate but compelled both sides to agree to what they thought right it was the duty of both sides to abide by the result.  We abided by the result, but the other side did not. Wherever differences exist among men, in labour or in any other class of dispute, or differences arise between classes and nations, the first thing to ensure a settlement is that hostilities should cease in order to try and create an atmosphere of peace.  The State demanded that both sides should agree to the proposal and await the result of legislation.  One side has not done that.  You cannot have peace and you cannot have an ending to a dispute <Col N="2074" /> of any description where one side is carrying on hostilities as they are to-day This war or this meanness, Shylocking, that is carried on aims at over-reaching the Bill and getting at the back of it. It is up to the Government and the Minister for Agriculture to preserve the legitimacy of their child in this Bill so that it will not be born in disgrace with the bar sinister across it.  I can conceive no quicker way of creating chaos and disorder in the country than by allowing the landlord community to run rampant by taking advantage of the civil law on this question.  We on these benches would not have said a word only that the Government forecasted this measure.  We stood for the enforcement of the civil law and we stand for it still and make no apology for our action on the Enforcement of Law (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  Deputy Nagle went down to Cork and asserted that he put up an amendment to save the tenants of this country from paying rents.  Nothing of the sort was put down and Deputy Nagle knew when he was stating that that he was uttering a deliberate falsehood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I made any charges against the Minister. We and every other citizen of the country look upon it as our duty to obey this and every other measure introduced by the Government.  Every citizen must respect the law and obey the decrees of the legislature from whom he claims protection. I will not say that landlords as a body have not done this, but there are a few individuals here and there who are the worst elements in the community. Some of them to my own personal knowledge are the worst elements in the community. <Col N="2075" /> One man in particular has not paid his railway fare for years.  The station-master had to pay it for him.  I see where this man has issued writs down in Cork and is getting them executed.  I hope the Government will give the same protection to the people this man owes money to.  They will have a job to recover it.</P>
      <P>I think that the duty of the Government&mdash;indeed I not only think it, but I know it&mdash;is to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, and not to allow this thing to go on any further.  This is not an attempt to deny civil rights to these people, but to prevent individuals getting behind the backs of the Legislature.  I go further and I ask the Government to insert a clause in the Bill in the Committee Stage, making it retrospective whereby any moneys over and above the terms contained in the Bill will be recoverable, together with all costs, from those people who have been trying to get at the back of the law.  I want this to date at least from the last gale day, or perhaps March ought to cover the whole of it, because there have been no executions before that and we do not want to go back further than that.  The people want a clause in this Bill making it retrospective whereby moneys that have been extorted by law proceedings, together with all costs, would be recoverable.  As to the men who paid voluntarily for the last two or three years, the best they can do is to do without this; I think they deserve no consideration.  If this thing is not dealt with satisfactorily we will have to put up a Bill here ourselves though our party is small, rendering null and void all judgment decrees, writs of execution, writs of possession, etc., obtained since the introduction of the Bill.</P>

      <P>A suggestion was made here about co-operative farming.  I do not want to go into it extensively.  Co-operative farming was mentioned, and I <Col N="2076" /> think it was asked here that some land should be set aside to test this question of co-operative farming.  Now, co-operative farming has been fairly extensively tested already.  The National Land Bank balance sheets could give you a lot of information about this question.  There are two or three farms that I know that they have bought up and divided; there are two or three farms that they have bought up and employed labour on, and the result has been anything but satisfactory. The result has been simply bankruptcy.  I can give instances.  There is the Kilcomney farm down near Bagnalstown, and I can give instances of two or three others.  I am afraid that in this question of co-operative farming the word &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; does not cover everything.  I think that a good deal else beside co-operation is needed, and I hope these things that are required will be forthcoming.  If they are not this country will go down in misery and chaos, and people will die from hunger and want.  The Minister for Home Affairs made a statement, I think when he was replying to Deputy Vaughan, about the seizure for rent and costs down in the County Cork.  I took a note of it at the time, and I think it was twenty-five per cent. reduction he spoke about.  Well, the twenty-five per cent. reduction would not cover the costs.  What I want to know is had the Sheriff any instructions about the amount he had to seize, or had he instructions to take less than the amount of the warrant?  I dare say the matter was only a retort by the Minister for Home Affairs.  I have sufficient faith in the integrity of the Minister, and of the Government, to believe that they would not be a party to a swindle of this kind, for it is nothing less than a swindle.  It is trying to swindle the people of the country and to get the better of the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are satisfied to abide by the Bill when it is passed, but we are not satisfied that any section should get around in this matter, and take advantage of the Legislature.  I will not say any more about this question because I do believe that no member of the Government would be a party to conduct of this sort.  There is no excuse for those men.  Why should there be writs if there is going to be legislation?  Why should there be force? There is another important question on this Land Bill to which I do not think <Col N="2077" /> attention has been paid in this Bill.  In this Bill provision has been made for the maintenance of the waterways and embankments. That is all very well, but there is a bigger matter than the maintenance, and that is putting into proper order the water-ways.  Those have been attended to years ago.  All over the country to-day they have been allowed to fall into neglect, and they have been neglected for the past fifteen or twenty years, with the result that the condition to-day is that the land is deteriorated and flooded.  Provision for the maintenance of present conditions would not be sufficient.  It is practically a question of reconstruction, and I should ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this:&mdash;That these water-works should be put into a proper condition and then a sum set aside for their maintenance. There is also a question of turbary.  I assume if the turbary is going to be taken either off the landlord, or the tenant, who acquired it under previous Acts, that the present owner or occupier is going to be compensated, and compensated to the full amount taken from him.  I take that as a matter of course.  The statement of the Minister with regard to the appointment of a Committee and the date of the Vesting Order is, I think, satisfactory, inasmuch as I take it that the annuity will, to all intents and purposes, be payable as from the appointed day.  That is satisfactory.  We could not ask for anything better than that. The only thing we ask for is that the appointed day be as near as possible to the passing of the Act.  With regard to Deputy Johnson's arguments, I think I dealt with them before.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with them again.  In passing, I may mention that we are not sorry for supporting the Enforcement of Law Bill.  I think it has done a great deal of good in the country.  We would not question the operation or the Civil Law now were it not that this measure is being considered by the Legislature.  There is not enough, and never has been enough, value put upon the improvements carried out by agriculturists in the country.  The land, such as it is&mdash;its quality and productiveness, and everything in connection with <Col N="2078" /> it&mdash;is the result of the tenant's labours. It is his labour, and that alone, that has made the land what it is, and I maintain that enough of value had not been placed upon the improvements for which the tenant is responsible.  The Land Commission always took matters as they found them.  The man who farmed badly invariably came out best, and the man who farmed well never had his labour taken into consideration, not to speak of the amount of manure put out, and the attention he had to pay when improving his place.  It is a general principle in this country at the present moment to take everything as you find it.  If the original value on a good many properties that I know of were taken&mdash;their valution prior to the labour and improvements of the last forty, fifty or a hundred years&mdash;they would be next to worthless; they would not be worth sixpence an acre to-day. That applies more to property in the West than to property in the Midlands.  Men have made good land on top of rocks, and the landlord is now asking for rent in respect of that land.  He never asked for rent for the rocks, but when good land was made on top of them we are told that it is only justice to compensate the owner.  I am not exaggerating when I say that in fixing rents there was never full consideration given to good and bad husbandry.  I desire to emphasise that I have experience of at least thirty years visiting land with Commissioners, while some of the gentlemen who talk about justice were in pinafores.  It is nobody's fault to be young; they will be getting good as they grow older.  Another matter I wish to dwell upon is the amount of money advanced&mdash;£3,000, or whatever it is going to be.  It is all right for a purchaser under the new Act purchasing his property, but if he happens to purchase under the 1903 Act it will be quite a different proposition.  There is much less of a capital sum now required at 4½ per cent. than there would be under the 1903 Act.  A man purchasing now could purchase more land&mdash;a sixty, seventy or a hundred acre farm&mdash;whereas a man purchasing partially under the 1903 Act and partially under this Act, could not purchase the same amount.</P>

      <P>He got it at 2¾ per cent. under the Wyndham Act.  It is not because other Governments gave him a lot more that we should follow suit.  They would not be on equal terms&mdash;a part purchaser under the Wyndham Act and a part purchaser under this Act.  I think that is admitted.  There is another aspect to this question, and that is whether a man who has already given up to the limit, or near the limit, for a holding, and who has three or four or five sons who are of age, can make the property over to those sons.  This can be dealt with easily.  I know any amount of people with sons 18 or 19 years of age, and the sons could not be made purchasers except the father purchases in trust for them.  In all fairness a provision ought to be put into the Act by which the owner ought to be allowed to purchase in strict trust for his sons.  First of all the man is only dealing with his own property, and secondly it spares the State any additional trouble in the way of finance or otherwise.  It is a question that settles itself, and the gospel of charity beginning at home ought to apply in this case above all others.  I would ask the Minister in his statement to remove a suspicion.  There is suspicion amongst people in the country&mdash;suspicion not well grounded, I may say&mdash;but the facts of the situation lend themselves to suspicion. That suspicion is with regard to the recovery of arrears.  Nothing could create more suspicion than lending the Army to collect arrears at the present moment.  Even lending the forces of Civil Law is arousing suspicion, and I ask the Minister to end it.  I do not hold that suspicion, but I am speaking for the rank and file, and I am endeavouring to tell you the way they think about it.  With regard to justice&mdash;justice seems to me to be based upon previous Acts.  The Blue Books of the recent Conferences giving the history of previous Acts have been always laid on the table in any Conference we have ever had.  I take it, it is from this basis that justice is understood. We must remember justice dealt out in those cases was dealt out by an English Conservative Landlord Government.  The <Col N="2080" /> 1903 Act is a Conservative Act fathered and sent out by George Wyndham, and there were other Acts.  I do not think that these Acts were meant to do justice to the tenants.  They were meant to be as much as could be extracted from them, and I do not think that is a basis to measure justice upon.  I think all these Acts were good bargains for the landlords, excellent bargains.  A good deal of praise has been given to the 1903 Act.  I do not think it deserves it.  The only praise I think you could give would be to the fool Government on behalf of the fooled people who put on big bonuses they paid under this Act.  It is said that a good many of the landlords in Ireland to-day do not mind about the operation of this measure; that they are rich, but that a good many others are not able to pay their way and are poor.  I believe that is true.  But are we to pay for the sins and crimes of every waster, and his father before him, and his grandfather. perhaps, before him?  What obligation is there that a man in any business should be recouped for the sins and crimes he committed?  It is a crime for any man to waste the substance of his family. Everyone who knows the history of the social life in London and Dublin knows what these people have done in the way of squandering and wasting.  They are wasters and nothing else.  I do not think it is up to this Parliament, or to the Parliament of any nation, to make good the crimes of the wasters at the public expense.</P>

      <P>It would be good enough for them.  The question of the non-judicial tenants is rather a knotty one, and I give my full support to the Minister's method of dealing with it.  It could not be based on a flat basis.  It could not be done in justice with any honesty to the State and to the public purse.  This question of non-judicial rent can only be fixed by a Commission if the State wants to secure itself, and the State must secure itself.  A Commission has never gone out on these lands; a fair rent has never been fixed, neither First, Second nor Third.  All these things must be taken into consideration, and if the State wants to secure itself, as I for one will insist that it will, it is only by a Commission going out, as <Col N="2081" /> the Minister has suggested, and taking into consideration the operations of all the previous Land Acts and the operations intended by the present Bill. Land, like every other business, must be valued when you come to take it in terms of purchase, not at what it is fetching on the market in Ireland at present.  The English standard of what it is fetching in the market would be more right, but apart altogether from what it is fetching, the value of land must be taken from the revenue derived from the land.  It must be taken from the amount of profits derived from the use of it.  That is the only criterion for arriving at the value.  What are the conditions in England to-day for better land?  What are the conditions in England for farms when maintained and put up and kept in the highest state of efficiency by the landlord?  What are such farms selling at?  The English are a business people and the Irish are not. They have only one outlook on life; they have only one means of fulfilling the human destiny, and that is settling on the soil.  You know what I mean by &ldquo;human destiny.&rdquo;  A man, like a nation, does not want to die out.  He wants a home and is prepared to pay for it, not at its market value, but to give him a home, and that is the reason why land is costing as much as it is.  In England it is quite a different proposition. It is dealt with there on purely business lines.  There you have farm after farm well kept, beautiful homes, beautiful approaches, perfect drainage and fencing, and all this put up by the landlord, selling at less than Irish land under this Bill.  I hope that the Dáil will take into consideration the full merits of the amendments which we are going to put up to this measure.  It is an honest attempt, but it does not go quite far enough.  We differ over this idea of justice&mdash;the Minister and our people.  We want a little more, and we hope that little will be made good.  It has been stated that the prices were agreed on in 1918.  They were, but the conditions in 1918 differed from the present.  The price a commonsense business man would have given in 1920 and 1918 he would not think of giving now.  What was business in 1918 would be suicide or madness now.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture will deal <Col N="2082" /> with this vexed question of the arrears. All the other matters can be dealt with in Committee, but this question of arrears is urgent, intensely urgent.  There is nothing but unrest in the country.  It is as much as we can do to keep our people within the limits of the law. There is any amount of opportunity for lawlessness if we had not our people under control.  They are under control and they are obeying us loyally and acting under our instructions, though not perhaps in every instance, but really, to take them as a whole, they have been very good and better than any other section of the community.  I hope the Minister will deal with this question.  If not we will have to introduce a Bill to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I am very much disappointed with this pronouncement of the leader of the Farmers' Party in the Dáil.  I am grievously disappointed. This morning's newspaper contained the announcement that Mount Etna was in eruption.  I felt that this was the sympathy of nature with the affairs of man, that the leader of the Farmers' Party, like Nicholas Bottom in the play, &ldquo;has roared as gently as any sucking dove.&rdquo;  Occasionally, like the dove with its companions, when there is a little bickering there is a difference of opinion between the leader and his followers in the Dáil.  For example, Deputy Wilson told us that the Wyndham Act of 1903 was very much superior, that it was a good Bill, and Deputy Gorey informs us that it was a bad Bill.</P>

      <P>Very good, I accept Deputy Gorey as the <i>censor morum.</i>  It was written by Mr. James Haverty, of Moylough.  Writing on the Land Bill, he says: &ldquo;While I agree with it in principle, it has some very grave defects.  I do not notice any reference to the large farms purchased years ago under the Ashbourne Act by large shopkeepers, all graziers, and still kept as grazing ranches.&rdquo;  This is the type of criticism to which nearly every measure in the Dáil is subjected to from time to time.  Letters are written by people who fail to see, and very properly fail to see, something in a measure which they have not been at the pains to read.  There are references to the large farms purchased years ago under the Ashbourne Act, and the references become very interesting in connection with the speech of Deputy Wilson.  Section 21.  Sub-section 3&mdash;one <Col N="2084" /> of the most interesting sections in the entire Act&mdash;takes power &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing Sub-sections, where the Land Commission declare in the prescribed manner that any land wherever situated herein-before excluded from the operation of this Section, is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, then such land shall vest in the Land Commission pursuant to this Section.&rdquo;  I should have thought that the Farmers' Party would be very chary about proposing any interference with lands previously dealt with under earlier Purchase Acts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey is now proving like the correspondent I am reading, that he is not aware of all the Act contains.  I suspected it before, and I am sure of it now.  I will give him full proof before I have sat down that he does not know what is in this Act.  If he did he would not have made the criticisms that he has committed himself to in this Act.  Section 21, sub-section 3, confers power on the Land Commission to take land required for the purpose of relieving congestion on lands anywhere.  When interference is necessary for the reform of the condition of the very poor among those who live upon the land how jealous and how attached the man becomes who already has a good farm.  Let me read from Deputy Wilson's speech.  Deputy Wilson knows his own mind and is able to state it with absolute clearness&mdash;&ldquo;Then there is the question of the omnipotent power which is to be given to what in future they will call the Land Commission, the power to take land anywhere and at any time.&rdquo;  Deputy Wilson, by the way, knows what is in the Act when he uses those words.  I want to know what rules <Col N="2085" /> and regulations are there, and how the powers of the Land Commission are to be defined.  Deputy Gorey wanted also to have the powers of the Land Commission more strictly defined, but he was content, like the bee with the flower, to touch upon it and fly away. Deputy Wilson is not afraid to speak his full mind on the matter and reveal what it is that troubles the hearts of those critics.  It may be that the land of a working farmer would be required for the purpose of what would then be described as the common weal&mdash;let us plunder the landlord, let us dip deep into the Exchequer and beware of redressing the iniquities of uneconomic holdings, and beware of interfering with turbary, bought under previous Acts. You may gild what you do under the name of interest for the common weal&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do want to remember everything.  I hope Deputy Gorey will find I have an unpleasantly accurate memory for all he says.  With Deputy Wilson I have no quarrel My heart goes out to Deputy Wilson in the criticism and views he expressed.  He knows his own mind, and states it frankly. One would imagine to hear Deputy Gorey, that the chief thing that disturbs the sleep of a farmer is what is to become of his sporting rights.  What a sense of proportion!  Five-sixths of the Deputy's speech this afternoon was made up of lamentations about sporting rights, and how they would be secured, and the remainder was his reiteration of the question of arrears.  There, of course <Col N="2086" /> I am with him.  One would imagine to hear those speeches that we are in the presence of a highly revolutionary Act.  They all congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill, but they do not tell us what extraordinary alteration there is in the attitude of a Minister dealing with the land question here in this Bill, and the attitude that was ever taken, or dare to be taken, by any land reformer such as Mr. Wyndham, who was highly sympathetic, so far as an English Minister could be, or dared to be.  Let me call Deputy Gorey's attention to some of these highly revolutionary items in the Bill. I take Section 21, which, speaking with professional interest, is a marvel of perfect draftsmanship.  Section 21 says that &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act and notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, all tenanted land wherever situated, and all untenanted land situated in any congested districts county and such untenanted land situated elsewhere as the Land Commission shall, before the appointed day, declare to be required for the purpose of relieving congestion or of facilitating the resale of tenanted land, shall by virtue of this Act vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day.&rdquo;  It then reserves from the operation of that, very cleverly, a number of types of land, and then at sub-section 3 proceeds with absolutely unmistakable clearness and sequence to say over what land the Land Commission shall be at liberty to exercise that power. That is in fact confiscation.  I am not calling it confiscation to complain of it, but only being in the habit of calling things by their names, and loving to see a thing as it really is.  I like to call it confiscation&mdash;confiscation which we will all, no doubt, applaud.  I now turn to Section 35, sub-section (<i>d</i>), article 5 &ldquo;Any holding which in the opinion of the Land Commission ought to be retained.&rdquo; Now, that is in connection with the section which deals with a holding up to £3,000.  &ldquo;Any holding which, in the opinion of the Land Commission ought to be retained for improvement or enlargement, or for utilisation in connection with the relief of congestion.&rdquo;  If I were a landlord the only language I could apply to that would be that it was a most arbitrary power&mdash;that the Commission is to exercise, and that it can retain for the improvement or enlargement, or for the <Col N="2087" /> utilisation in connection with congestion any holding which in its opinion ought to be retained.  It is the sole arbitrator, the first and final judge of whether reservation ought to be made or not. Could anything be finer for the relief of the people?  Now, I take Section 36, which is the turbary section.  &ldquo;The powers of the Land Commission to make regulations with respect to turbary and bogs on holdings shall be expended so as to include power to make regulations with respect to turbary on any bog whether the owner thereof has or has not an exclusive right to turbary thereon.&rdquo; Deputy Gorey feels the pinch there on his class.  No claim of right is to exclude the interposition of the long hand of the Land Commission where it is necessary for justice, and making life proper for others who have not been benefited before. That is revolutionary with regard to the rights of property.  It is that or nothing.  Now, I take another section. Section 54, sub-section 2, article (<i>a</i>) &ldquo;Provided that where land has become tenanted land, as above defined, by reason of a contract of tenancy entered into on or after the 1st day of September, 1922, if the holding is in a congested district county, the tenancy shall if the Land Commission, before the appointed day so declare, be deemed void as against the Land Commission, and the holding shall vest in the Land Commission as untenanted land.&rdquo;  Again, other stipulations are that something shall not be sold under the Act to the tenant unless the Land Commission certifies that the creation of a tenancy was in the interest of the country.  Section 51 appeals to the lawyer, as it sweeps away every disability that was ever known to the law. &ldquo;Every person who for the purpose of this Act is deemed to have entered into a purchase agreement shall be deemed capable of entering into such agreement, notwithstanding, infancy, lunacy, or any other disability to which he may have been subject.&rdquo;  No expensive litigation, no coming into the Chancery Court, simply with one sweep the infant and the lunatic will be dealt with, and the registration of title proceeds apace.  The reference to the infant and the lunatic is rather with regard to the landowner. Deputy Wilson was premature in thinking that I was referring to the farmer.  Another <Col N="2088" /> excellent item of the Bill about which the Farmer Party were silent is the genuine relief that is afforded, and I recommend their study, by Section 25 sub-section (5), and also Section 29 (<i>a</i>). Deputy Gorey was alive to the operations under Section 27 and Section 28, by which advances may be made to the following persons for purchase by them from the Land Commission of parcels of land.  &ldquo;A person being a tenant of a holding which is not an economic holding in the opinion of the Land Commission; a person who twenty-five years before the passing of the Act of 1903 was the tenant of a holding, and was evicted; a person who being a labourer, and who by reason of the sale of any land under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts has been deprived of employment on the said land; and any other person to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission an allowance ought to be made.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the antagonism to doing justice which found expression from the Deputy who spoke last with regard to the confiscation of landlords has overflowed its bounds somewhat&mdash;if I may mix my metaphor&mdash;and has extended to the Bill itself.  There is a great deal being said about the sub-sheriffs and the decrees but very little about the substantial benefits which are being conferred upon every farmer and even landless men in the proposed operations in this measure. An importunate suitor for office to George III made the King ask Lord North &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; and the Premier replied &ldquo;He is the type of man, sir, that if you were to give him for a park Great Britain and Ireland he would ask for the Isle of Man as a potato patch.&rdquo;  It is not enough, apparently, that all these things are being done and being done without mention, but there must also be huge reductions and advances.  I would be very glad, for one, if we could declare all these arrears done with and sponged out and declare that &ldquo;on and after the passing of this Act any arrears of rent shall be regarded as paid.&rdquo;  But will the Exchequer of the country stand that?  After all, there are other taxpayers in the country <Col N="2089" /> besides farmers.  There are many doles which I would like to give but in the course of a few days I myself will be pleading with the Minister for Finance for further grants to the Universities in order to allow us to live.</P>

      <P>Really, sir, I am quite anxious to carry on a dialogue with Deputy Gorey, if it were in order, but after all there must be some decorum. It comes out of my pocket in so far as I am taxed.  Deputy Gorey denies that that is so, which shows that not only does he not know what is in the Bill but what the State is, how it gets its money or from whom, or at any rate that he has that great gift of being able to chloroform a section of his brain so as to be unaware of what it does not suit him to realise.

Those landlords are no doubt most objectionable relics of the old regime, and if we could blast them out of their position as one would blast rocks out of a harbour what a delightful thing it would be.  Just as if we could give the farmers all the land and if the rest of us betook ourselves to Canada to break virgin soil it would be a grand thing. I would remind Deputy Gorey that there is a General Election coming soon.  If he has nothing to go upon but sectional claims and has no general policy, he will come back here with a smaller following than even he has at present.  In this matter the Minister for Agriculture has acted as a statesman and not as a party politician.  No doubt it would be very popular to go out on the hustings and talk of all the wrongs our peasantry has suffered at the hands of those unmitigated scoundrels.  Unquestionably history shows that the landlords under the British regime were a blot upon the land. We are now trying to reconstruct Ireland. We want every citizen here to stay, and cast in his lot with Ireland.  We realise that those men in many cases are more sinned against than sinning.  I have so aroused the leonine wrath of Deputy Gorey that I may go on and say one little word in mitigation of his condemnation of the landlords who did not sell.  Some of them were not able to sell, for the most excellent reasons that their estates were so encumbered that selling would mean becoming a conduit for handing money from one person to another and ruining themselves.  That letter Deputy Gorey <Col N="2091" /> read is susceptible of a more charitable interpretation than he put upon it.  I do not know the individual case.  There may be circumstances in the case that would alter it, but as a mere letter it is quite possible that the private affairs of the writer were such that he could not discuss.  It would not be likely that he would exhibit his financial position to people who were his natural foes.  The fact remains that the Minister for Agriculture is seeking no more than to make tranquillity.  He is trying to bring to an end, a quarrel, which if it were to continue would mean that the future of this country would be imperilled very gravely.  He is behaving as a statesman in the matter.</P>
    <P>The farmers of Ireland are not merely speaking with two voices in this Dáil, but with many voices outside.  It would help us very considerably, in the Dáil in dealing with those amendments with which we are threatened, if we could get some measure of illumination from outside. Personally I have stated there is no letter that appears in the newspapers that I do not study with the same care as if my eternal welfare depended upon it, but I find that the writers of those letters, like the speakers of those criticisms, are either unwilling or unable to understand the situation.  Some of their figures are extraordinary. They forget, for example, the purchasing power of money to-day.  They are hypnotised by the difference between four-and-three quarters and two and a half. They do not realise that two and a half is nearer to six in present values than to four and three quarters.  They are not in the world of to-day at all.  They are living in another period absolutely.  Some of those calculations are grotesque.  Only that I feel that I am wearying the Dáil unduly, I would like to give you a specimen of it, and only that it is signed I would think Deputy Gorey had written it himself. This is agricultural arithmetic. &ldquo;The landlord who sold in 1903 must now weep tears of repentance for being so foolish.  He got only two and three-quarter per cent., or if paid in cash he could only invest his money at a time in securities bearing about the same rate of interest.&rdquo;  I need not stop to point the absurdity of that.  &ldquo;We know what securities were yielding as a safe investment at that period, so the landlord who gets fifteen years' purchase, and is paid four and a half per cent. is equally as <Col N="2092" /> well off in purchase terms as the landlord who sold in 1903 at 24¼ years' purchase.&rdquo; The implication is he ought not to be. What has he done in the interval?  &ldquo;This is, bear in mind, under a Native Government elected by those who are the purchasers. Further, we are now dealing with the stubborn landlord who refused to sell when money was cheap.&rdquo;  The writer was aware that money was cheap in 1903, but in the next and succeeding sentence he evidently forgets.  That is why but for the evidence before me, I would attribute this to another author. &ldquo;He has since drawn 20 years' rent from his tenants, who, in turn, will have to pay their annuities for 20 years longer.&rdquo; Again a slip of memory, the reduction in the land Courts which vitiates the entire calculation, the end of which is that an apocryphal tenant called Mike Hennessy is found to be paying £4,000 more than a man who bought in 1903.  Here Deputy Wilson I am sure and Deputy Doyle must lament the leader whom they have elected to serve under, because I notice that when they put forward what are reasonable views, he seeks to suppress them.  Deputy Wilson, for example, showed the accuracy of his knowledge of the Bill in his speech when he referred to the tenant as paying 4¾ per cent.  He was corrected by his leader that it was 4½, whereas, of course, the 4½ attaches to what was the share of the landlord.</P>
    <P>Those writers in the papers are not aware that there is a sinking fund.  Some of them are not aware that there are no fees for registration.</P>
    <P>However, I will take a leaf out of Deputy Gorey's book, and say that at the Committee Stage there will be more to be said. I will bear in mind what happened in the case of the clergyman who was getting a <i>locum tenens</i>, or a local demon as it is popularly called.  The new clergyman asked how long he was expected to preach and the answer was: &ldquo;well there is a feeling in this congregation that there are no souls saved after the first half hour.&rdquo;</P>

My class were not represented at any deputation that came before the Minister for Agriculture, and I could give you one reason or many reasons for that.  There was a Farmers' organisation in the County Sligo; that organisation did all it possibly could against us up to 1921, when we were trying to collect the rates, and when the Farmers' organisation sent round the country telling the people not to pay the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I must explain my position, and my status, and I think I have a perfect right, as an unpurchased tenant, to bring this matter forward. A very large landlord was Chairman of the Farmers' Union Organisation at that time, and what was more when I did not belong to the Farmers' Union I was told it was illegal for me to be represented on a delegation at any convention that would deal with the unpurchased tenants. Therefore, the unpurchased tenants, of my class, were shut out from any representation on deputations that came before the Minister for Agriculture, and I think it right to bring these points home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I know more about the division of land than most Deputies in this House. I remember in the County Sligo, for it was there the land fight started&mdash;I mean the Sinn Fein Land fight agitation&mdash;what happened, and I know that there are some members here in this Dáil who were present at a Conference held somewhere between this building and Grafton Street in 1920.  All I have to say now, in regard to this, is that I join in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture in bringing forward such a Bill, and I want to congratulate the men of that time and the men since that time that put him in the position to bring this Bill forward and <Col N="2094" /> put it in our power to support such a measure when brought forward.  I got a communication from a man named Mr. Belton, a few days ago, not to support this Bill as brought forward, until he had become a member of the Dáil; but still I think I would advise the Minister for Agriculture to go ahead.  I know the big rocks he has to meet and the little criticisms and the bickerings and the little jealousies that will be going on throughout the country amongst those parties who have not yet been returned to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy Gorey speaks about compensation for bogs.  He talks about sweat being put into the bogs.  I think there is not much sweat put into the bogs, and I think there ought to be very little compensation given for bogs.  Of course a reasonable amount should be given, but I do not think it should be much, because no man ever lost a bit of sweat over bogs. Now he spoke about the operations of the law.  I know what the operation of the law is with regard to land, and I know the difficult problems that are before the Minister for Agriculture.  I know, and would like to advise the people as well as the Minister here, what they will have to deal with in the connection of the division of this land.  Everybody will say &ldquo;we fought for this land and we must get this land.&rdquo;  I am sure, although we may congratulate the Minister now, there will have to be drastic action taken with regard to anybody who gets up and says &ldquo;I fought for this land and I must get it.&rdquo;  There must be drastic legislation to deal with all this and all that it involves, because I know, being in the land fight so long, what difficult rocks are before the Minister and what disturbances they may lead to if drastic action is not taken.  At the same time I certainly wish to congratulate the Minister on this Bill.</P>

      <P>It speaks well for the Minister, and it is very gratifying that he <Col N="2095" /> is not suffering any ill effect after the three or four days' speeches made by various Deputies upon this Bill.  There are just one or two remarks I wish to make in reference to labourers' cottages.  I have not heard any Deputy refer to the matter, or suggest that it was nearly time that the agricultural labourers, who are deprived of any insurance against unemployment, or of any right to out of work pay, should now be included in the Land Bill, and that they should get five acres of land instead of the half acre they have at present.  I think that could be done in the Midlands, where there is plenty of available land and large ranches.  Deputy Gorey said that the past three years for these people were lean years, but he forgot to say that the previous three years seem to have been very fat judging by the wealth they made from the land in their possession.  To my mind the landlords are deserving of all that was said about them by Deputy Magennis and of all the names he was so pleased to call.  Now the landlords of Ireland have been looked upon as one of the greatest evils of the country, and, certainly, it is true that owing to the action of the landlords the population of Ireland has been reduced by the emigrant ship which took the best of our people to foreign lands to build up foreign nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell on the subject at any length, but I earnestly hope that, when the time for payment comes, these landlords will not get any payment that would in any way hamper the tenant, or that, as a result of any payments made to the landlords, the land purchased by the tenants would hang like a millstone around their necks as happened with tenants who purchased land under the Land Bank system.  Under this latter system the land in some cases came to £6 15s. an acre on the tenants.  With such a rent as that it is impossible for a tenant to make a livelihood.  When the ranchers are called on to hand over the land to the original owners who, I claim, are the people of Ireland, I hope the Government will not pay them big compensation, because the ranchers were the men who battered down the homesteads of the original occupiers of the land of Ireland. The ranchers, I hold, should not get huge compensation, nor should the tenants who purchase be hampered with such rents as <Col N="2096" /> would make it impossible for them to make a living in the country.  There is no use in giving land to a man and fixing such a rent on him as would make him and his family slaves for the remainder of their lives.  There is no doubt about this fact, that there are small farmers in Ireland at the present time who, because of the impossible rents that they are called upon to pay for the uneconomic holdings they occupy, are simply slaves, and they are unable to earn a decent livelihood for themselves or their families.  I know that anyone who holds half an acre of land in the country has been invited to join the Farmers' Union.  I was surprised to hear from Deputy O'Donnell that he was not a member of that Union.  I would invite him, if he has no other Union to cater for him, to join ours.  The duty of placing people on the land is certainly a very important work, and the necessity for giving people on the land a decent way of making a living will, I am sure, receive the attention of the Dáil and of the Government.  The landlords have been looked upon as very bad men in the country, but the times are changing.  We are beginning to realise that every individual residing within the Saorstat is a citizen of this country, and we want to treat him as such.  It has been explained here day after day that justice will be done to the landlords.  I hope that double justice will be done to the tenants.  A great many cases throughout the country that call for immediate and sympathetic consideration are those of evicted tenants. These tenants, or their ancestors, were evicted not because they were not the original or proper owners, but because some middleman came along and offered a few shillings per acre more than they were paying for the land, with the result that the landlord evicted them, and, where they resisted eviction, their homes were battered down, and the land they had occupied for generations was turned into ranches.  Some of the ranchers we have had in Ireland were people who came over with Cromwell or with his associates. I think it is about time these people were asked to clear out, and to hand over the land to those to whom it really belongs. I would not leave any of them in possession except where they could prove their ownership.  I think if one were to go back on past history very few of these ranchers could make any claim at all to the land <Col N="2097" /> that they have.  Some of the finest land in Ireland in the Counties of Westmeath and Longford is at present in the possession of ranchers.  In the county Longford we have an old gentleman, a bachelor, who holds between sixteen and eighteen hundred acres of land.  He was never of any earthly use to the Nation.  I do not suppose he ever smoked a cigarette because he would have to pay a little duty to the Government if he did so, and he never had the courage to join the &ldquo;Union of Hearts.&rdquo;  I think a man like him should not have possession of such a large area of land.  He may have even more land elsewhere.  In the county Westmeath there are a couple of old ladies, probably not as bad as the old gentleman I have referred to, who have from 750 to 1,000 acres of land.  I ask the Dáil is it right that a poor man, who may be lucky enough to possess a cow, should be summoned for trespass if that cow happens to look over the ditch of a neighbouring ranch, or that the military should come along and take the cow for trespassing.  I think the Minister for Agriculture should take into his consideration cases like these in which poor people are suffering great hardship.  In my opinion, the first duty of the Government is to look after the landless people, the agricultural workers and all the rest.  I hope, when the Committee Stage is reached, that the Bill will be so improved as to give an opportunity to the occupiers of labourers' cottages, and workers similarly situated, to get a little land so that if they are ever knocked out of employment they will have the land to turn to to earn a living for themselves and their families, and so that they may be able to keep a cow to provide milk for their children. If that is done, it will go a long way to relieve the unemployment problem that is at present engaging so much attention. I think it is only fair that the poor should be raised from their present position and given some kind of security, and that the big ranchers should be lowered.  Many of these poor people are suffering great hardships, people such as small farmers, unpurchased tenants, uneconomic holders, agricultural labourers and town workers. A great many of them have suffered long before 1916, in fact, since the start of Sinn Féin by Arthur Griffith.  Ever since that time a lot of these men have suffered <Col N="2098" /> in one way or another in the service of the country.  I think these people have suffered quite long enough, and I am sure that this Dáil will fully realise the necessity of putting an end to the sufferings of the small farmer and the uneconomic holder and of giving a way to the labourer to rear his family.</P>

      <P>I hope I will succeed in remembering the various points that have been raised during the debate, but I must say I have been saved a considerable amount of trouble by Professor Magennis's answer to most of them. People have done me the compliment of wondering what were my impressions of the debate.  The thing that struck me was what a pleasant thing it must be to be in opposition and not to be under the necessity of making sure that one's theories can be worked out in practice. I was invited by Deputy Johnson a few days ago to read <i>The Fall of Feudalism</i> and <i>Stolen Waters.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I read them before the week end.  I read them before I was under the necessity of introducing this Land Bill.  I suppose we all know something of the history of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries apart from any little knowledge we have gained from these books.  I am invited to go back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and in addition to reversing the processes or helping to reverse the processes that took place during those centuries I am invited to reverse them by somewhat the same methods that they were accomplished. That is really what Deputy Johnson's advice amounts to, and I am rather surprised to get that sort of advice from the Labour benches.  I am not prepared to take that advice.  I am not prepared to advise the Dáil that the Land question, or in fact any question, should be settled by going round in a vicious circle.  As poetry seems to be the order of the day, shall I say it is the old story, &ldquo;the good old rule, that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can.&rdquo;  I am surprised to receive advice of that sort from the Labour benches. It is true that Deputy Johnson suggested that the equities of the case would be met if we gave the landlords terminable <Col N="2099" /> annuities, annuities, he suggested, for a period of twenty-five years.  I do not know whether he has taken the trouble to work out the figures, because if he did I think he will find that the cost of terminable annuities of that sort, annuities even for twenty-five years, would not be very much less than the cost of the present scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be twice. However, leave the figures out of account, and let us consider the idea.  I tried to make it plain on the First Reading and again on the Second Reading that we are dealing with land that for the last 100 years, and perhaps more than 100 years, has been bought and sold, devised, bequeathed, mortgaged, in a word, treated commercially, and that, consequently, we are dealing not only with the tenant for life with the immediate occupier, but with the owners of his superior interests&mdash; individuals, insurance companies, charitable institutions, banking institutions, here, and in England and in America. That is the fact, and it is an unpleasant fact that we simply cannot shut our eyes to.  People may draw different conclusions from these facts, but these facts are there, and we must admit them.  We are dealing with all these people.  Deputy Johnson's suggestion of a terminable annuity would be simply informing them that they could whistle for their money. It would be informing the various banking institutions here in Ireland and in England and America who have lent money on the security of the land and on the strength of existing laws that they were not going to get a penny of it.  That is the simple proposition, and I would like to pay Deputy Johnson the compliment of saying that he has taken his courage in his hands and stated his position clearly, so that we can all understand it.  But I would like to know what is the position of the Farmers' Party and the other business men, or alleged business men in the Dáil on that question.  Do they suggest that now in this Land Bill we ought to give notice to people who have invested money in the past in Irish securities, that they are not going to get it, and that we should give notice to prospective investors that Irish securities are not the proper sort of <Col N="2100" /> securities to invest money in in the future?  I think we are entitled to an answer to that question.  Deputy Johnson, as I say, has made his position perfectly clear on the matter, but I would like to hear from the other parties who have received this Bill with a certain amount of modified rapture.  That is the question, and we must have an answer to it before we can get anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Farmers' Party have suggested that the price should be based on a reduction of 40 per cent.  Of course the duty of an Opposition is to oppose, and I am perfectly sure if the price in the Bill was based on a 40 per cent. reduction that the Farmers' Party would think it their duty to come forward and to ask for a 50 per cent. reduction or a 45 per cent. reduction.

      <P>I make all allowance for that, but I think we are entitled to know, as Deputy Magennis asked, what are the processes by which they arrive at this figure of 40 per cent.?  I do not know.  I have a shrewd suspicion that if there is any validity at all in these processes that they are extremely variable, that they would apply equally to 50 or 60 or 75 or 80 or 100 per cent.  In any case if we are talking business let us talk business and let us be told why 40 per cent.  I have indicated the consideration which the Government had in mind in the fixing of 35 per cent.  I have stated how it compares with previous Acts, and how it compares with the merits of the case at the moment.  But we have got no reason whatever for this magic figure of 40 per cent., and we ought to be told it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on that, Deputy McGoldrick made a point on the last occasion on which this Bill was debated, and he said that the terms which we are giving tenant-purchasers in the Bill in fact compensate them for not having purchased under the 1903 Act.  I repeat that statement, and I invite the mathematicians, there are some really marvellous mathematicians in the Farmers' Party, and I invite Deputy Wilson, who was able to prove on the last <Col N="2101" /> occasion that £1,505 was something like 20 years' purchase of £100 rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will prove that 15 years' purchase under the Minister's rate of 4¾ was identical with twenty years at 3¼.  Twenty years at 3¼ is 65 and his figures are 65 also.  That is plain mathematics.</P>

The tenants under this Bill are getting 12 or 13 per cent. on an average better terms than the tenants who purchased under the 1903 Act, and getting that for a period of between 66 and 68 years.  That is agreed.  It is not a matter of opinion.  It is there in the Blue Books, and any mathematician, as I say, can make it out for himself.  I say they are getting a reduction of anything up to fifteen per cent. more than the tenants who purchased under the 1903 Act, and getting that for the whole period of 68 years.  The Deputy should capitalise that and compare it with the losses they have suffered, because they have been paying twenty-five per cent. more for the last, say, ten years, striking an average.</P>

      <P>I have not mentioned Deputy McGoldrick's figures.  I made these figures up for myself.  It shows you the irresponsible demands that are put up on occasions like this.  We are now apparently to go back, not to 1903, <Col N="2103" /> but to the previous Acts of 1885 and 1896. I presume what we have got to do now is to compensate all the tenants, four hundred thousand, who purchased under the 1903 Act for the rent they paid between 1885, when they should have purchased under the Ashbourne Act, and 1907, 1908 and 1909, when they did purchase.  Responsible people should not put forward demands of that kind.  It is not even a good debating point.  We cannot go back and make it up to the tenants who purchased under the 1903 Act for not having purchased in 1885. We cannot make it up to the tenants who purchased under the 1909 Act for not having purchased under the 1903 Act. We do not admit for one moment that we are under a duty to do so, but we do say that we have given them terms which in fact compensate them for not having purchased under the 1903 Act. I have been asked why the Bill does not deal with fee-farm grants, long leases, and leases for lives.  These are all fee-simple lands, they are all landlords if you like, who own what we call untenanted lands.  They own the fee-simple of their lands; they are home-farms, if you like.</P>

It is the only principle of democracy worth fighting about, and that is that one man is as good as another. Whatever treatment we give one owner of fee-simple property, any other owner should and will get the same.  It is a debatable point as to whether we could not include within the scope of this Bill fee-farm grants and long leases&mdash;leases for sixty years or life leases.  I am ready to consider that question.  I am just <Col N="2104" /> pointing out its bearings on some of the theories which have been put forward by the Farmers' Party.  With regard to price, I do not intend to go into the figures again, as they have not been seriously challenged.  We have given our reasons for fixing 35 per cent.  This 40 per cent. has been put up to us, and I may say I do not take it seriously.  If I get facts and figures to justify it, I am willing to debate the matter.  I recognise the Farmers' Party is under the necessity of saying 40 per cent. because we have fixed 35 per cent.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the point.  Perhaps the Deputy might remind me of it on the Committee Stage.  It has been stated the tenant is not to be allowed for improvements, and the case of Adams and Dunseath has been quoted.  I do not think there is anybody very clear as to the effect of that case.  I doubt if the Judges themselves are very clear about it.  Tenants have always been allowed for improvements, in practice.  I have the Pink Schedule here, and Deputy Gorey will know what I mean when I refer to the Pink Schedule.  It is the Schedule on which tenants pay rent, as assessed.  On one side of it you have set out the annual sum which should be the fair rent on the assumption that all buildings were made or acquired by the landlord, and there are set out details of valuation, etc.  Then you have various sub-heads setting out a description of the land, a description of various sections, the rate per acre of each section on the assumption that for the farm as it stands the rent has to be settled as the property appears to the valuer.  Then you have sections specifying conditions for buildings, any additions necessitated by <Col N="2105" /> special incidence of taxation, and any deductions for inconvenience of access. That is one side.  You have the complete schedule there, enabling the valuer to fix a rent on every section and in respect of every easement existing on the holding, and to make deductions in respect of drawbacks of every kind, want of water, inconvenience of access, and so on.  Then on the other side you have improvements effected by the tenant, the nature and character of such improvements, present capital value, increased letting value due thereto, the extent to which a landlord has paid or compensated the tenant in respect of such improvement, and deductions from the rent on account of each such improvement.  That is the schedule upon which every fair rent is assessed. On the one side you have the rent of the holding, and on the other side the improvements made by the tenant.  In practice, the tenant always got the benefit of the improvement which he himself effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Johnson's question, the land courts were set up in 1881, and rents have been regulated since by law.  I can give the Deputy the average reductions that the tenant got on the first and second rents, and wherever a third rent was fixed, on the third rent.  On top of all these reductions we are providing that a tenant should now get a 35 per cent. reduction.  All these figures when taken into account and put against one another, really answer the question of whether the annuity at present fixed is what we would call an economic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2106" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the economic rent, during the years when there is no economic rent there should be no annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another example of how easy it is to propound theories.  I would like if the Deputy would suggest some way that would meet all the expediencies of the case and that we could carry into operation.  It sounds very nice. As regards the third term tenants, or tenants with fair rents fixed since 1911, we are asked why not give them the 35 per cent.  The answer is quite simple. The average reduction which tenants who went into Court after 1911 received was 9 per cent.  Take the case of two second term tenants, on whose holdings rents of £100 were fixed in 1900.  One of them failed to go into Court in 1911, and remained a second term tenant.  He gets a 35 per cent. reduction which brings his rent to £65.  The other goes into Court and he gets a 9 per cent. reduction.  His rent at present is £91 and he gets 30 per cent. on that, and that brings him to 63.7 per cent.  He is 1.3 per cent. better off than the second term tenant.  That is the simple reason, and we cannot afford to treat an important question like this casually and fix figures at haphazard.</P>
      <P>The reason we are not giving the tenants whose rents were fixed in 1911 the same terms as the tenants who had their rents fixed before 1911 is that the tenants who had rents fixed after 1911 got reductions, which the other class did not get and which leaves them in a better position than the other class now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation what will happen in those cases where the rent is raised after 1911?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They will live at the loss.  Where the tenant went into court and his rent was raised, we must assume that he had an extraordinarily low rent before going in.  Very few tenants made such a mistake.  Even during the war I do not believe there were two per cent. of rents raised, that is two in a hundred. What I want to impress on you is that we cannot have it both ways.  That is you must deal in averages as we propose to do in the Bill or do as they did under the 1903 and 1909 Act, have the Land Commission to enquire into each case.  With regard to the limit of £3,000 advance, I agree that that will react rather unfairly <Col N="2107" /> on the tenant who purchased, let us say, part of his holding under the 1903 Act. But the price under the 1903 Act was so much higher than the price here, he may have got an advance of £3,000 for a very small area of land, and I can well conceive certain cases of a tenant with 100 acres of land, fifty of which he had purchased under the 1903 Act, being unable to get an advance for the remaining fifty acres, whereas, if he had not purchased any of the land under the 1903 Act, he might be able to purchase it all within the limit namely, £3,000; that is quite possible, but I think we may in these cases give a discretion to the Land Commission to take all the circumstances into account. I was about inserting a clause empowering the Land Commission to make larger advances in the cases of men who had purchased already.  But I think the discretion which the Land Commission will have, to take all the circumstances into account, will meet the case.  If the Deputies think there is any question about it we can make it right in Committee. We all want to make it right. We do not want that a man should suffer because of fortuitous circumstances in any case, but I think the Section of the Bill which gives discretion to the Land Commission meets the case.  Deputy Johnson made a point on this matter of the limitation of the advance.  He pointed out that it was absolutely essential that there should be farms of sufficient size to make it possible to carry out scientific experiments.  That is to have experimental farms.  I am not quite clear as to what he means.  I am not clear whether he means the necessity of getting ample land for the Department of Agriculture or whether sufficient land should be sold to the tenants or to a couple of them in an area to enable them to farm their land so as to be able to buy the latest machinery and to carry on the most up to date system of farming economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I had in mind that the Land Commission might hold, here and there through the country, large holdings for use in their discretion in the way of experiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be Governmental farms.  There is no danger whatever that the Department of Agriculture would be short of land.  On the other <Col N="2108" /> point I would regard it as extremely important that fairly good-sized farms should be sold, that advances should be made to enable people to purchase fair-sized farms, and I agree that the circumstances to which the Land Commission should advert when making up their minds as to whether they can give a man an advance of more than £3,000 should be whether or not he is farming his land economically, and that if he is they will give him a much larger advance to enable him to purchase a good-sized farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Davin would ask that.  But it depends on the quality of the land.  I could contemplate it being the very best business from the view point of the State that a man might have four hundred or five hundred acres of land.  That would be a very rare case.  I could contemplate that a two hundred and fifty to a three hundred acre farm would be extremely useful from the point of view of the State. I believe one fair sized farmer with two to three hundred acres of good land, and farming his land scientifically and economically, would be worth more than a Department of Agriculture farm in his parish, and worth more than any department could be.  I would anticipate that that ought be the case in the future, and more especially so as agricultural education spreads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question more for the Land Commission Bill than for this.  I do not think that the particular politician who is Minister for Agriculture should have any control over the Land Commission.  The Land Commission has certain judicial functions.  When the question of price comes before the judicial commissioner he hears evidence from both sides.  That is a judicial act and should not be controlled in any way by the Minister.  Purely administrative work is, of course, absolutely under the control of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say so, in general.  This is a very wide question to answer.  So far as the powers are judicial, the Land Commission has discretion.  So far as they are administrative they are controlled by the Minister for Agriculture just the same as any other service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, that is provided for in the Land Commission Bill. With regard to turbary, I need not waste time over this.  The Land Commission had always power to acquire turbary compulsorily; but we are specifically enabled by the Bill to acquire turbary compulsorily and to make any regulations necessary regarding it.  We come now to sporting rights.  As I stated, in practice there are no sporting rights that you can put any money value on.  Deputy Wilson raised the point about there being valuable sporting rights on land over which the tenants have certain rights appertaining to their holdings.  It is probably so in the case he has in mind, the case of a mountain where the tenant has the right of grazing over certain lands.  Someone else has the sporting right.  You can hardly call that mountain untenanted land in the ordinary sense of the word.  But take an ordinary holding.  There are no sporting rights on a holding on which you could put a money value.  The holding goes entirely to the tenant.  He holds that in fee simple.  The same applies to fish and to fishing rights.  Nobody ever thought of stopping a farmer from fishing for trout in the stream that flows through his land.  We are dealing with the fishing rights on valuable rivers.  These rights will be retained by the Land Commission. They are very valuable rights, and they are worth a lot of money.  The Land Commission will dispose of them, probably by letting to the fishermen and to the other interests, who were making their living out of them up to that, at a reasonable rent, and I think that is an equitable way to deal with it.</P>

If you have any sympathy to spare you always stand up and talk about the evicted tenants and the wounded soldiers of the land war.  We try to deal with evicted tenants who have been evicted since there was such a thing as land tenure in Ireland, namely, since 1881. If you go back behind 1881 you will have, not only a claim for each evicted holding, but you will have four or five.  Holdings changed hands three or four times between 1870 and 1881.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>1878 is the exact date. It deals with the tenants who were evicted since then.  With regard to town parks, we are selling them to the tenants.  With regard to advances to labourers, to groups, I am not quite clear as to what Deputy Johnson means, but we have taken power, under Section 52, to make advances to trustees for the purchase of land for the purpose of letting it for pasturage or tillage to labourers and others, and that clearly meets the case.  Under the existing laws we have power to make advances to trustees for grazing purposes in connection with the grazing of cows near a town, and so on.  We had no power to make advances to trustees for land for tillage; we are providing for that in this Bill.  We can make advances to trustees in respect of land near a town either for tillage or for grazing purposes.  I doubt if we would have power to make advances to groups of people except in that sense&mdash; to societies, let us say.  It is very difficult. It is an aspect of the question I have been thinking about.  It is very hard to know exactly what one should do in the matter, that is to say, without doing too much, without opening the door to a lot of abuses, and if the Deputy has any suggestions to make later I will be very glad to receive any help he can give me, and we can amend the Bill in that direction.</P>

      <P>With regard to arrears, which I think is really the last point&mdash; Deputy Magennis dealt with it mostly&mdash;I <Col N="2112" /> explained already the reasons that prevent us from giving the same terms to tenants in regard to arrears as in regard to annuities.  Again it is mathematics.  If the price is right, if a 35 per cent. reduction is a fair reduction as an annuity, then we cannot give the same in regard to arrears, because until the landlord receives his purchase-money and is in a position to redeem his head-rent and superior interests he must pay his head-rent, interest charges and all the rest, in full and without any abatement.  The position is this: When the landlord receives his purchase-money he will get 4½ per cent. on that. He will receive his purchase-money in bonds.  His income will be 4½ per cent. on that.  Now, if he has any mortgages, any encumbrances on that land, for every £100 of that purchase-money for which he is receiving an income of £4 10s., he will probably be paying 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. interest.  That will be his position.  He will overcome that difficulty by redeeming his superior interests and his encumbrances in bonds, immediately, but until he receives his purchase-money and is in a position to redeem these interests he must pay his full rent and interest charges.  Hence, it would be absolutely inequitable to give the same terms in regard to arrears as you give in regard to annuities.  Deputy Gorey mentioned another point which is a good point.  He stated that, having regard to the fact that this Bill is now before the Dáil and is getting its Second Reading, it is scarcely fair for a landlord to attempt to get behind the intentions of the Bill by executing decrees on anything like a large scale, and Deputy Johnson, of course, was very glad to ring the changes on that particular point. This matter was debated before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson is now interested in showing that the Enforcement of Law Act is imposing the greatest possible hardship.  I realise he is under that necessity, but it is not a fact that the Enforcement of Law Act has caused any hardship.  The fact is that the mere presence of the law on the Statute Book, and, perhaps a little more the presence of the military in the counties, has obviated any necessity for their use in 95 per cent. of cases.  The Enforcement of Law Act has done more to make people honest than, perhaps, any other Act or precept of the last 12 months, but <Col N="2113" /> there are particular cases.  There is a case like this where we introduce a Bill such as this giving 25 per cent. reduction on rents, and, consequently, implicitly admitting that people are entitled to this 25 per cent. reduction.  It would be unfair if the landlords attempted on any large scale to get behind the intentions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It would be unfair if its policy was to attempt to get behind the intentions of the Bill in executing decrees.  However, we can meet the case.  We have no power, as I have often explained, to interfere between a plaintiff and defendant.  We never attempted to exercise that power, and what we can do, the resources of civilisation not being yet exhausted&mdash;what I am willing to do if necessary&mdash;is to make the Bill retrospective as from the date of its introduction, and I think that if there is a policy of executing decrees now in order to get in front of the Bill that tenants are entitled to that assurance. I would be willing to consider that. There is just one point left&mdash;Deputy O'Connell's query as to tenancies created since September, 1922.  Section 52, Sub-section (2) reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The expression `tenanted land' means land held under any contract of tenancy other than a fee-farm grant, or lease for lives or years renewable for ever or lease for a term of years of which sixty or more are unexpired, and the expression &ldquo;untenanted land&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that where land has become tenanted land as above defined by reason of a contract of tenancy entered into on or after the first day of September nineteen hundred and twenty-two, then</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) if the holding is in a congested districts county, the tenancy shall, if the Land Commission before the appointed day so declare, be deemed void as against the Land Commission and the holding shall vest in the Land Commission as untenanted land; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if the holding is situate elsewhere, the land shall be treated as tenanted land for the purpose of the provisions of this Act vesting tenanted land in the Land Commission, save as to the price thereof, <Col N="2114" /> but shall not be sold under this Act to the tenant unless the Land Commission certify,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made the point that tenancies have been created within the last year or two for the purpose of forestalling the Act.  That is true.  He suggests that the 1st day of September, 1922, should be altered, and that we should go back further.  I doubt myself if that clause is necessary at all, because the Land Commission has ample powers without that of acquiring any holding needed for relief of congestion.  In that state of affairs I think that the clause is really unnecessary, that only makes assurance doubly sure.  The Land Commission has ample powers under any circumstances to acquire any tenancy of any kind, even a present tenancy or a judicial tenancy.  That, however, is another matter that can be dealt with in Committee.</P>

It is intended to make it clear that the Bill will operate to neutralise the effect of the decision in the case of Bradshaw <i>v.</i> McMullan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

      <P>I may say in connection with this amendment that it was scarcely seriously contested or doubted on the Committee Stage that the grievance underlying the Bradshaw McMullan decision was dealt with in the Bill.  This amendment is the result of a promise given that it would be taken beyond the region of any possible doubt, that that particular hardship was removed.  The result of the amendment is to define the standard rent in such a way as to make it perfectly clear that standard rent means pre-European war rent, <Col N="2116" /> less such rates as were contracted to be paid by the landlord, whether such contract was legally binding or not.  It will be observed that the words used are &ldquo;habitually paid or allowed a deduction or set off against or indemnified the tenant against.&rdquo;  If Deputies turn to Section 8, Sub-section 1 (b) it will be observed that the permitted increase in respect of rates as rates payable by the landlord, payable in that context, means legally payable.  There is a judicial decision to that effect.  It will be clear that poor rate cannot be legally payable by the landlord, which is the effect of the Bradshaw-McMullan decision.  Consequently the landlord cannot add poor rate to the standard rent.  Take a concrete example.  If a landlord and tenant, having agreed in 1913 on a yearly rent of £60, the landlord paying the rates, and if the poor rate in that year be taken as £3 and the other rates amount to £7, then in those days the tenant will probably have paid £60 to the landlord, who paid £10 in rates to the rate collector, or possibly the tenant paid £50 to the landlord and £10 to the rate collector.  In any case the tenant's effective burden was £60, and the landlord's effective rent was £50.  It will be understood that the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; is used in relation to the rates as an outgoing.  There would be other outgoings.  £50 is clearly the standard rent of the house as defined by this Bill.  Suppose now that rates have doubled, and that the poor rate is £6 instead of £3, and the other rates are £14 instead of £7, and assume then that the tenant is compelled to pay the rates direct to the rate collectors, the landlord as regards rates can only add on the £14 for the rates to the standard rent, because the £6 poor rate is not legally payable by him.  As regard the £14, other rates, the tenant can successfully claim a set off.  Thus, it is perfectly clear that the tenant's effective burden cannot exceed £50 plus the full rates.  In other words, the landlord cannot get more than £50 effective rent, and that is in fact the end that is desired.  The Bradshaw-McMullan decision, which is analogous to a pleading of the Gaming Act, is definitely met and definitely removed in the Bill, and the amendment that Deputy Duggan has moved is simply subsequent to an undertaking given by me to raise that out of any possible doubt.</P>

      <P>The amendment which I have set down is one about which I must confess I had, at the time, considerable doubt, not with regard to its necessity or value, but as to the exact place in the Bill to introduce it.  At first I thought it should come in after Section 8 altogether as a new sub-section. Then, because in Section 4 the words are used &ldquo;rent lawfully due,&rdquo; it occurred to me in haste that that was the place in which to introduce this reference to Bradshaw and McMullan.  I was aware in Sub-Section 2 of Section 2 that there was a phrase which looked remarkably like counteracting the effect of the House of Lords decision, and in Section 8, also, there was, and there is, used a phrase which seemed also to deal with it.  I will try to make my mind clear on the matter, if that is possible.  The words of this amendment are, instead of &ldquo;paid,&rdquo; to read &ldquo;habitually paid.&rdquo;  To go back a little to the history of Bradshaw <i>v.</i> McMullan case might serve a useful purpose even though it would take a few minutes.  Previous to the Local Government (Ireland) Act of 1898, ordinarily the landlord paid half the poor rate and the tenant the other half, but it was always legal for the tenant and landlord to make an arrangement by which the landlord would be liable for the entire poor rate.  Then, through Section 52 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, an agreement of this kind was declared null and void.  In any contract of tenancy, entered into after the Act of 1898, a provision putting liability for the poor rate upon the landlord was null and void.  Now, in the case of Bradshaw <i>v.</i> McMullan, at the second stage of the hearing of the action between these two litigants, Bradshaw claimed to take advantage of that, presumably, as the Minister says as a man in a betting dispute may claim the cover of the Gaming Act. The present Chairman of Seanad Eireann, who was then Lord Chancellor, decided in favour of Bradshaw's contention that under Section 52 the contract made by McMullan for his own cover was null and void.  The other landlords immediately proceeded to break the agreements made with their tenants under a like agreement. The Act of 1920 tried to introduce protection, but the words it used are the words at the beginning of Section 8&mdash;&ldquo;Wherever any liability for rates was <Col N="2118" /> legally borne by the landlord.&rdquo;  The decision of the Irish Courts was that inasmuch as this was not imposed on the landlord by statute it was not a legal burden, and, consequently, the protection that was sought to be given by the Act was not afforded.  My amendment was intended to get rid of Section 2 of the Act of 1898, and to declare that, notwithstanding anything in that section that a contract transferring liability for rates from the tenant to the landlord should be valid.  Now, I understand that the contention here is that the substitution of these words in the amendment for &ldquo;paid&rdquo; has the same effect or, at any rate, <i>pro tanto</i>, the effect desired.  It does not seem to me that that was so because the word &ldquo;deduct&rdquo; is used. That proved, as regards some legal decisions, a very wicked word.  What I am not quite satisfied about is that the Irish Courts here shall not be obliged to follow the rulings of the House of Lords. We must not forget that in our Adaptation of Enactments Act, these decisions will still have the authority they had unless there is an express repeal.  I respectfully suggest that there is no express repeal here.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is right.  I think it does what the Minister for Home Affairs has stated, and I think he is right in confining it to the purposes of this Act.  The amendment of Deputy Magennis was, I think, intended to have the effect of repealing Section 52 of the Local Government Act altogether.  In my humble judgment, the Minister was right in declining to accede to such repeal.  The whole object of that Section, which was defeated by the landlords themselves, who entered into contracts in violation of the law, was to make people of this country take an interest in the election of those who were representing them on the local Councils, and who were expending the rates levied upon houses.  I think it is vital for good government in this country that people should have an interest&mdash; a pecuniary interest is one that affects <Col N="2119" /> them most&mdash;in getting good governors and good government in every branch of administration.</P>
      <P>Now we have a Parliament of our own.  We have for a long time had Urban and Rural District Councils and Corporations of our own, and it is vital that people who elect these representatives on those Councils should have some interest in seeing that they elect competent and trustworthy people, and make the people thus pay rates and taxes that are charged upon them by their governors.  That is the best way to make them take an interest.  Therefore in this respect, I think the amendment of Deputy Magennis went too far in the repeal of what, if it is properly enforced, is a valuable piece of legislation, and the Minister for Home Affairs has done full justice by seeing that those people who enter into contracts in violation of the law do not afterwards make money by breaking the contracts they made with their tenants.</P>

The underlying idea of the amendment seems to be that if the business premises element is predominant the rent ought not to be controlled at all, but the Bill provides that where you have the residential and the business element combined, that the house should be, in fact, treated as a dwelling-house.  That provision in the Bill is based on the report of the Committee. An amendment to alter that aspect of the Bill was discussed, and defeated in the Committee Stage.

    <P>We think that the Deputy's point as to hardship arising out of illness or other such cause is amply provided for in that Sub-section where the Court has power to take such action as will prevent the occurrence of hardship of that kind, and will give time to the tenant whom it feels is making reasonable efforts to clear off arrears and pay his rent.

It seems to me the general effect would be that a tenant, or a body of tenants, in possession of rooms in one of those houses that have a large number of rooms could not <Col N="2123" /> be put out, or have a decree for possession made against them, because the defence would be that they were not working, and that they were unemployed, and therefore no decree in such a case could be made against them for possession.

      <P>I bow to your ruling, A Chinn Comhairle.  I beg to move the following further amendment to Section 4 (8), to add after the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; on line 36,: the words &ldquo;but the Act shall apply in all cases where the employee is dismissed from his employment through no fault of his own, and shall apply in all cases during the continuance of a trade dispute.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Home Affairs and the Dáil should receive this amendment with open arms.  In the case of a trade dispute, where an employer had a large number of employees living in dwelling houses which he owned himself and which happened to be in the vicinity of the firm concerned in the trade dispute he could, under this Section, evict every one of the employees mixed up in that trade dispute.  This amendment was also intended to meet the case of men who, through no fault of their own, but because of the slackness of trade were thrown out of employment. I would remind the Minister for Home Affairs that a very learned K.C., a man who was one time a leading light in the English House of Parliament made a statement to this effect, that there was no Act of Parliament through which one could not drive a coach and four.  I do not want the present Town Tenants' League of Ireland to drive a coach and four through this Bill when it becomes an Act, and that is why I put forward this amendment. If you accept it you will be able to prevent that organisation, of which I am a member, doing that.  I am going to go against this Bill in every shape and form until, in the interests of the tenants, these amendments are accepted.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy may do in the future is a matter entirely for himself.  His amendment raises an interesting question as to what a &ldquo;fault&rdquo; is.  It says &ldquo;where the employee is dismissed from his employment through no fault of his own.&rdquo;<Col N="2126" /> This would be an impossible amendment to accept.  It puts on the Court the onus of deciding whether a particular employee has been guilty of a fault or not.  He might have been guilty of a lack of judgment, or guilty of avarice, but it is a difficult question to ask the Court to say in the case of a particular dispute between an employer and an employee, that the employee was or was not in fault.  This Bill is not a Bill for the regulation of trade disputes, and I submit that the amendment is not relevant.  Trade disputes, any that I have watched, generally ended by some kind of compromise, and the compromise generally carried with it reinstatement, a kind of <i>status quo</i> position. Presumably there will be no considerable departure from that in the future, but whether there is or not it is not a question that can be dealt with by the Bill. The Deputy scarcely realises the difficult role he will impose on Judges if this amendment were accepted.  They have got to say in every case of a trade dispute, in every case of friction between employer and employee, whether or not the employer was in fault in the particular instance.  The amendment has no proper place in the Bill, no real relevancy to the Bill, and I am not accepting it.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the mover of the amendment, but I cannot help feeling that he does not attain his object even if he gets the amendment passed.  Apart from the rather obvious fact that to attain his object it would require much more elaborate drafting than he has attempted, one may be permitted to point out to him that whereas the Section he wants to amend indicates that this Section shall not apply in certain cases, his amendment proposes to add to it, &ldquo;but the Act shall apply in all cases where the employee is dismissed,&rdquo; and so on.  The two things are totally different.  If the Deputy got his amendment passed the fact that the Act was going to apply to cases he specifies would in no way prevent this Section from not applying to them.  I think the Deputy has got himself tangled in the wording of a somewhat elaborate Bill, and if he looks at the matter he will see that it is utterly useless to pass the amendment, because to say that the Act is going to apply to certain cases does not get you out of the <Col N="2127" /> difficulty which the Deputy has in mind. It says nothing about individual Sections excluding certain cases that have been in his mind, and, consequently, to pass the amendment would be utterly useless.</P>

    <P>In this amendment I have in view the case of the house speculator who goes out to purchase a house and obtains possession of the house in the Court on the plea that he wanted it for his own use, and, probably, gets a decree for possession, dispossesses the tenant, goes into possession for a short time, and then sells the house at an increased price.  I ask the Minister to consider such a case arising in the future, and to make some <Col N="2128" /> provision before the final passing of the Bill, whereby such tenants would be protected from persons like that.  I think it is a reasonable case to put up, and I do not think that I am asking too much in asking the Minister to give it consideration.</P>

      <P>Frankly, I do not understand the amendment.  Section 4 deals with restrictions on the rights of possession.  The Deputy's proposal is that the provisions of Section 4 shall not apply to a dwelling-house or premises to which this Act applies acquired by a landlord since January 1st, 1920.  If the house was built since April, 1919, the provisions of this Act do not apply at all. If it was built before that date, if it was built in normal times&mdash;and this Act is intended to apply to houses built in normal times&mdash;then there seems to be no sufficient reason why it should be decontrolled because it had come into a particular person's possession since January, 1920.  If the Deputy sees such reasons, I would be glad if he would be more explicit in stating them.</P>

      <P>I imagine this amendment is going to defeat the mover's object utterly.  If it were passed it would simply mean that any house that has changed hands since the date mentioned&mdash;since the 1st January&mdash;would be free, and that the present owner could obtain any rent he likes.  It is a repeal of the Act in so far as it affects these particular tenancies.  Deputy Hennessy had got into his head that there are a very large number of tenants in the country who are living in houses on which there has been no increase whatever since 1914, and he is afraid that there will be <Col N="2129" /> a general increase on those tenancies. This Act will not cause the landlords to increase the rents, I think, inasmuch as they will have been allowed hitherto to increase them.  Judging by the argument that is used, I think that they are not likely to avail of it now, but the effect of this new sub-section suggested means that any person who has gone into a house since January, 1920, is at the mercy of the landlord, and that the protection that the Act is intended to apply will be lost. I do not think that was the desire of the mover, but that would be the effect of the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The landlord and the tenant may at any time, and from time to time by agreement (in this Section referred to as a temporary agreement) determine the rent to be paid by the tenant under this Act in respect of such dwelling-house, and in such case the rent so determined shall, until varied by a new temporary agreement, or by notice under this Section, be and continue to be the rent to be paid by the tenant in respect of such dwelling-house; Provided always that the rent determined by a temporary agreement shall in no case exceed the standard rent by more than the amount which at the date of <Col N="2130" /> such agreement is permitted by this Act in respect of such dwelling-house;</P>
    <P>(b)  if at any time the rent payable by the tenant, whether under a temporary agreement or otherwise, does not exceed the standard rent, or exceeds the standard rent by less than the amount for the time being permitted by this Act, the landlord may serve upon the tenant a notice increasing such rent to an amount not exceeding the standard rent by more than the amount permitted by this Act, and in such case such increased rent shall, until varied by a subsequent temporary agreement or a subsequent temporary notice under this Section, be and continue to be the rent to be paid by the tenant in respect of such dwelling-house;</P>
    <P>(c)  if at any time the rent payable by the tenant, whether under a temporary agreement or otherwise, exceeds the standard rent by more than the amount permitted by this Act, the tenant may serve upon the landlord a notice reducing such rent to an amount which exceeds the standard only by the amount permitted by this Act, and in such case such reduced rent shall, until varied by a subsequent temporary agreement or a subsequent notice under this Section, be and continue to be the rent to be paid by the tenant in respect of such dwelling-house.</P>

      <P>With regard to the wording, one matter occurred to me, to which I would bring the Minister's attention, and that is, (c) seems rather unnecessary in view of (a). <Col N="2131" /> If he will turn to the two he will see (a) concludes thus: &ldquo;Provided always that the rent determined by a temporary agreement shall in no case exceed the standard rent by more than the amount permitted by this Act.&rdquo;  (c) says if at any time the rent exceeds the standard rent by more than the amount permitted by this Act the tenant may serve a notice reducing such rent.  Surely this proviso in (a) renders the whole of (c) supererogatory, because if it is stated that it shall not be so, the tenant has a right to cause it automatically to be reduced to the legal requirements set out in (a), which is all that (c) intends to do. I therefore suggest that (c) merely is making assurance doubly sure by killing the fallen slain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, with all respect to Deputy Figgis, he is misreading the first sentence, because it says that the landlord and tenant may enter into a temporary agreement, and then the proviso is that &ldquo;the rent determined by such temporary agreement shall in no case exceed&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the limits of the permission are given in the proviso.  They may enter into an agreement which is not one putting the rent above the lawful increase prescribed by the Section (a), but, apart from the legality or permissability, the fact is possibly that the tenant might under some compulsion or coercion enter into an agreement of this sort, undertaking to pay a rent in excess of what is legally permitted under (a).  If that were so, the tenant can escape the obligation of that in Section (c) by simply having recourse to the Court, so that there is really no discrepancy between them.  It is due to the fact that the proviso is put in at the end of (a) instead of incorporating it at the beginning of (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>(c) refers to a &ldquo;temporary agreement or otherwise.&rdquo;  I would draw attention to the fact that the amendment may still leave it possible for a period to elapse between the time that the agreement is made and the later stage when the permissible increase is less than the amount of the agreement. The words are, &ldquo;Provided always that the rent determined by a temporary agreement shall in no case exceed the standard rent by more than the amount which at the date of such agreement is <Col N="2132" /> permitted.&rdquo;  An agreement may be made in January for payment of so much, including rent and rates.  The total might be £50.  On the 1st April there is a considerable reduction in the rates.  I wonder would that require that the tenants would then have to serve notice upon the landlord for a revision of the agreement?</P>

Section (a) refers to the date of the agreement.  Sections (b) and (c) start, &ldquo;if at any time,&rdquo; and so on.  Now the thing to remember is that the rent under the provision of this Act is not a static thing, but variable&mdash;that it varies, for instance, with a fall in rates, and the rates might fall between the date of the agreement and any subsequent date. With any fall it would be open to the tenant to serve notice of reduction, and that is where Deputy Figgis walked into it, so to speak.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment meets the points made on the last Stage very well, but I should like if I may, to suggest to the Minister that between this and the next Stage he might consider leaving out three words at the beginning of the section.  Sub-section (1) says: &ldquo;The rent to be paid by the tenant, who by virtue of the provisions of this Act retains possession of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies, shall be determined as follows.&rdquo;  I suggest for his consideration that it is dangerous to leave in the words &ldquo;by virtue of the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of drafting, and to avoid disputes in the Law Courts, it would be better to leave out those words and rely on the subsequent words, &ldquo;the position of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies,&rdquo; as being ample and sufficient. If you leave the words I object to in, you will have cases of people who would continue in possession by the tacit consent of the landlord, and it would certainly be open to argument that a tenant is not continuing in possession by virtue of the provisions of this Act.  I foresee there is a pretty field of controversy possible in words which, I think, if examined, will be found wholly unnecessary, as they are covered by reference to the Act in the <Col N="2133" /> third line of the section.  They are dangerous words, and are quite unnecessary. I do not ask the Minister to decide that now.  It is a matter that could be decided later.</P>

      <P>I will have the point raised by Deputy Gavan Duffy looked into, and if we find the words are wrong and that he is right, it will be easy to get the matter rectified in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Amendment, &ldquo;In page 8, Section 7, to insert after the word `applies,' in line 35, the words `shall not exceed the standard rent by more than the increase permitted by this Act, and subject to this limit' &rdquo; (Tomás MacEoin), withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: In page 9 Section 7, line 24, to add the following new Sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a landlord demands, whether in writing or otherwise, or enters into an agreement with a tenant for the payment of a rent exceeding the standard <Col N="2134" /> rent by more than the amount permitted by this Act, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds, unless he proves that he acted innocently and without intent to deceive.</P>
    <P>Those last words are taken from another Section of the Act.  The arguments in favour of this were stated very clearly and fully by Deputy Magennis. There is a danger of certain classes of landlords, house lords, house-owners, taking advantage of the fear of tenants&mdash; that they may be put out and that they may lose their houses&mdash;by demanding rents, frequently perhaps not by themselves but by their rent collectors&mdash;the kind of person they send around to tenements to collect rents and who make all kinds of threats.  It is to meet that kind of collector, or the landlord who employs that kind of collector, that this amendment was brought forward.  It seems to me that there is something required by way of penalty upon the landlord who is endeavouring to obtain money by false pretences&mdash;endeavouring to obtain rents which he is not entitled to.  On the other hand, it may well be that even the landlord may innocently demand more than he is entitled to.  The amendment, as drafted, would make it quite clear that no such person will be liable to this penalty.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>When we remember that this control is abnormal, it will help us to get a proper perspective with regard to the amendment.  The normal method would be to allow the free play of economic forces, to allow landlord and tenant to make their bargains on the basis of demand and supply.  But a situation grew up in which the scarcity of houses was such that it became necessary for the State to bring in a measure of control in alleviation of the position the tenants would otherwise be in. But to go further and suggest that the State, having interfered between two contracting parties, should proceed to impose penalties on the one for any failure on the part of the other to secure himself and to see that he got his full rights, is something which is not acceptable to us.  I wonder if the Deputy, before putting down the amendment, had considered Section 15.  Section 15 is put in to meet the object that Deputy <Col N="2135" /> Johnson aims at in his amendment. That is, I submit, as far as we could go in defence of one of the contracting parties, remembering that the situation which gives us any right or justification for interference between these parties is an abnormal situation.</P>
      <P>It is an elementary principle in business matters that people are expected to look after themselves.  It is for this purpose, for instance, that organisations such as Town Tenants Leagues exist, confer and get advice.  Cases are submitted. But for the State to undertake this onus of protecting one of two parties to a business deal is a principle that we are not prepared to accept.  Section 15 gives ample protection.  It provides for the recovery of sums wrongly paid, and it provides a penalty for any proved cases of fraud; of attempt to deceive by incorrect entries or otherwise.  But that is the maximum protection that we feel called upon to give to one of two parties who would normally be free agents and simply dealing on their own without control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will remember that in Section (b) there is a penalty imposed upon any landlord or householder who demands a premium, which is another way of entering into an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; anticipation of rent.  There is an old maxim, of which mention is often made, which says that he who proves too much proves nothing.  The Minister argues very properly that this legislation is to meet abnormal circumstances.  It does meet these.  To extend protection to the tenant is the essence of this Bill.  The essence of Deputy Johnson's amendment is to prevent beforehand, if possible, the necessity on the part of the protected tenant from having recourse to the remedies provided in the Bill.  That, I think, is the case for the amendment.  Undoubtedly Clause 15 protects the tenant from being forced to pay even where there is colour given to the pretence that he owes rent, that colour being secured through entries in a rent book.  But Section 13, which I quoted before, does not permit the landlord to exact a premium or fine or any similar sum, and not only that, but a person requiring any payment <Col N="2136" /> or the giving of any consideration in contravention of this section shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £100.  That premium or that fine is something more than a licence, so to speak, by the tenant.  It is also a kind of anticipatory rent.  It is a lump sum paid beforehand instead of being distributed as rent over a number of years.  The spirit of the amendment is precisely that which animates all the sub-sections of Section 13.  I quite agree that to-day, after the new wording of the previous section, by which we have permitted agreements to be entered into and then have restricted the character of these agreements, the necessity for a penal section of this kind has to a great extent disappeared.  That is how it appears to me, inasmuch as the agreement is permitted, which before was not permitted under the 1915 to 1920 Restriction Acts. It is undoubtedly the duty of the tenant to keep his eyes open in the framing of this agreement, or to have assistance of some sort, and whoever gives him that assistance will, of course, have in view the restriction of Section 7, and I quite see that the case might be made for the Minister that the number of times that this intimidation will be necessary will reduce almost to vanishing point.  Still, it does appear to me that the presence of a penal section of this kind adds to the completeness, and in fact makes for the perfection, of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree that to amend Section 7 again, perhaps, is necessary although I also think that Section 16 goes a long way to meet the point that Deputy Johnson has made, but that it does not go far enough.  The difficulty about the present amendment, as it seems to me, is that it will not hit the worst cases.  If one reads the words put down by Deputy Johnson, I think one would see that in the really bad case, where the rent collector had gone round getting more than he was entitled to, if you prosecute the landlord he will say, &ldquo;Oh, that was a shocking thing for the rent collector to have done.  I have never authorised him.  I get a lot of rents, and, of course, I did not notice that a little more was paid in this case than in the other cases.  This ruffian who was collecting rent for me did that off his own bat.&rdquo;  You cannot treat him as a criminal in a case of that kind, if the Court <Col N="2137" /> believes that he is not telling the truth, or, I should say, if you are not in a position to prove he is not telling the truth. The person whom the Deputy wants to hit&mdash;namely, the landlord who knowingly does these things&mdash;will wriggle out through his rent collector, because the amendment, as worded, does not hit the landlord&mdash;does not hit the landlord where he did it through the rent collector, and he can afterwards say, &ldquo;It is not my fault.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move: In page 9, Section 8 (1), (c), (i), line 53, to add after the word &ldquo;rent&rdquo; the following:&mdash;&ldquo;That where money has been paid by the tenant for repairs which have not been carried out by the landlord on or since the 3rd August, 1914, that the tenant shall be entitled to have refunded to him by the landlord all moneys paid by the tenant for said repairs.&rdquo;  I think there are many cases where tenants have paid in some instances 25 per cent. of an increase for repairs since 1914, and none of these repairs have been carried out. During that time the landlords were receiving something like 25 per cent. of the rent each year for doing nothing at all.  They carried out no repairs, and I think it is only just and fair that this money should be refunded to the tenants. The Minister may tell me that Section 15 deals with this also, but I do not think so.  If it does provide for it, I am <Col N="2138" /> willing to withdraw the amendment.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It is a deserving one, dealing with the case where people, I may say, get money under false pretences.  A landlord who gets money to carry out repairs and does not carry them out gets money under false pretences.</P>

      <P>The difficulty of accepting the Deputy's amendment is, it is so very retrospective in its effects.  I wonder if the Deputy adverts to the fact that under the 1920 Act it was possible for a tenant to get the landlord's 25 per cent. allowance for repairs and his 15 per cent. bonus suspended if he were able to satisfy the Court that the landlord was, in fact, not executing repairs. That remedy was there for tenants.  If it was not availed of, it is rather difficult to see that any other remedy would be availed of now.  It clearly was there, and this amendment, with its retroaction to 1914, seems outside the scope and purpose of this Bill, and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

Twenty-five per cent. is the figure recommended by that Committee, 10 per cent. being the figure for dwelling-houses. <Col N="2141" /> Everyone knows that shops make bigger profits now than in 1914.

      <P>Upon that motion I desire to say I take the view that the general principle of the Bill is quite a good one, although many of us differ from the Minister in many respects as to the details of the Bill.  I admire the Minister as the first who has stood over the recommendations of a Committee set up by himself, and I express the hope that it is the wish of Deputies that Ministers responsible for the setting up of Committees to inquire into questions of this or that kind should stand over the recommendations of Committees that must of necessity have gone more deeply into the matter than the Minister himself. We were used to the setting up of Commissions by the British Government for many years past, more or less for the purpose of pushing aside the agitation that might be going on in regard to any particular question.  Commissions have been set up by the present Government, and reports of such Commissions have been set aside by the present Government, and it is for this reason that I congratulate the Minister for having adopted the recommendations of the Commission here, although, as far as I am personally <Col N="2143" /> concerned, they may be different from my own views on matters in this Bill.</P>
      <P>However, I rise to take this opportunity of drawing the attention of the Minister to a delicate matter to which I have been urged to refer here.  The Minister has referred to the Town Tenants' League, and to the necessity of having such an organisation to deal with claims and grievances of people very much concerned with the terms of this Bill.  Now, I have been, in a representative capacity, associated with a particular dispute in a town in my constituency, which is also the one the Minister represents, regarding the activities of this All-Ireland Town Tenants' League.  A number a people promoted a syndicate, under the name of that particular League, and set themselves to purchase the Town Hall and the houses of people over the heads of the occupying tenants.</P>

      <P>I am drawing the attention of the Minister to these cases in the hope that, through this Bill, he might be able to control the activities of people who are interfering with the rights of tenants.</P>

      <P>It is a Bill to interfere with the rights of landlords. Its purpose is to restrict the increase of rent and mortgage interest. That is the precise definition of the Bill. I assure the Deputy that he is now advocating an entirely different matter.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to go into details.  The cases to which I am calling attention have cropped up in a town which the Minister and myself represent, and my object in referring to the matter is to prevent a recurrence of what has gone on there.  I realise it is a very delicate matter, and on your ruling A Chinn Comhairle, I do not wish to proceed further.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I gave notice of raising a question on the adjournment, but as the President has an important engagement to fulfil this evening, and will therefore not be able to be in attendance, it would be useless, I think, to proceed with the matter in his absence.  The matter that I wish to discuss was raised by the President himself on Friday night last.  In his absence I do not intend raising it until the motion for the adjournment is made to-morrow evening.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 20th June.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Mrs. Ellen Carroll, Cleveragh, Listowel, has not received any dependant's allowance in respect of her sons. James Carroll, No. 35443, and Jeremiah Carroll, No.. 32980, who joined the National Army on April 7th, 1922.  Will the Minister see that this woman gets the allowance due to her immediately.</P>
