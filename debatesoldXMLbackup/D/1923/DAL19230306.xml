      <P>To ask the President whether his attention has been called to the words used by the Minister for Local Government in this Dáil on Thursday, March 1st, 1923, to the effect that the damage done in O'Connell Street by National Troops in July, 1922, was technically a wrongful act, inasmuch as an Act of Indemnity would be required, and when it is intended to introduce such an Act of Indemnity, an Army Act, or other necessary legislation.</P>

An extension of these arrangements is not feasible, but it is hoped that claims will be discharged with little delay as soon as the Criminal Injuries Bill now before the Dáil has <Col N="2020" /> become law.

      <P>To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether, in view of a recent decision of the King's Bench Division, setting aside a decree of the Dáil Land Court, and in view of the large number of cases liable to be similarly set aside to the grave inconvenience and detriment of litigants, and in view of the excellent record of good work done by the Dáil Land Courts in times of great difficulty, he will introduce legislation as speedily as possible to give statutory protection to the decrees and orders made by the Judge and Appellate Judge of the Dáil Land Courts.</P>

      <P>I have given consideration to the decision to which the Deputy refers.  I agree with him that the Dáil Land Courts did excellent work and that their operations prevented much injustice, and, I have no doubt, saved many lives.  To do this the Courts had at times to go outside the existing law, a course which, in my opinion, was quite proper in face of <Col N="2021" /> the state of affairs with which they had to deal.  I agree with the Deputy that it would be serious if, at the present stage, there was any general attempt by interested parties to set aside these Courts' decrees.  The danger is, however, much less grave than the Deputy appears to think, seeing that practically all the decrees are now covered by assignments. The decree which was the subject of the recent decision was one of the last given by the Dáil Courts.  It attempted to settle a very embittered and long-standing dispute, and I have no reason to think that, in the interests of the lives and property of the parties concerned, any better solution could have been come to at the time.  I shall have inquiries made into the cases of the few decrees which are not covered by assignments, and will see that such steps are taken as may be found necessary.</P>

      <P>The collection of rates in the County Clare has been in a most unsatisfactory condition for a considerable time, but an improvement has recently taken place.  There is at present a total uncollected amount of about £200,000, including a large amount of the 1921 rate.  Owing to this state of facts the County Council have had difficulty in financing the public services of the county.  In some cases they have had to allow salaries to remain unpaid for nearly two years, and the various institutions have not received the full amounts required for their upkeep.  I <Col N="2022" /> am informed, however, that the County Council has at all times kept over 400 men employed on direct labour on the roads, and that the rate of wages paid has not been reduced by reason of the difficult financial position.  My information is that there is no such abnormal poverty in the county as would warrant the proposal to remit or postpone the payment of the rent of labourers' cottages. Cases have been reported of men who were in regular employment having sought to evade payment of the relatively small rents due by them.  It is understood that, with a return to satisfactory financial conditions, it is the Council's intention to greatly increase the number of men employed on road work.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence what period of training a recruit undergoes on joining the Army, and if this period is spent in a recognised training camp where the recruit is not liable for ordinary duty; and whether the <Col N="2023" /> practice prevails of sending recruits of seventeen years of age into disturbed areas within a month of their enlistment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has asked me to read the following reply:&mdash;Up to recently the general conditions as regards recruiting and working had been such that outside large centres such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Athlone, it could not be said that there was a definite period of training for a recruit.  A large number of men did, however, go through a purely training period of from four to eight weeks at the Curragh.  Once, outside the Curragh, the responsible officer in charge of his unit was satisfied that a man was fit to handle a gun properly, he was liable to be called on for ordinary duty.  Continual attention was, however, paid in the course of the ordinary day's work to the necessity for training, and no opportunity was lost to perfect this.  Only in large centres such as have been mentioned were there units recognised as undergoing a training course.</P>
      <P>The practice has not prevailed, and does not prevail, of enlisting youths under 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>Since the 1st March, 1923, recruiting has been put on a new basis, and all recruits accepted after that date are sent to the Curragh on enlistment.  They will spend at the Curragh a training period of, approximately, two months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished that the Minister has thought well to introduce the Second Reading Stage of this Bill by a mere intimation that he formally moves it.  I was hopeful, and expected, that we would have had a statement from the Minister explanatory of the special circumstances why such a Bill was necessary, and giving the Dáil and the country some explanation of the reason for bringing in this Bill.  I thought the Minister would have taken the opportunity to remind the Dáil of the special qualities of the man whose widow and family are in need of this special grant. It is somewhat a disappointment, I am sure, to the Dáil that the Minister has not thought it well to go into the matter in more detail, or at least in some detail, but, not having done so, I think it is necessary to say that the principle of the Bill is acceptable to the Deputies on this side.  We recognise the special circumstances, but, apart from the special circumstances, we recognise that the principle involved in this is an important one, inasmuch as it means that <Col N="2026" /> where a citizen has given his time and energy selflessly to the country's service without thought of personal gain or reward, that his family should not be allowed to suffer; and I would apply that principle to citizens generally.  We have a right to recognise that, where a man and a woman have given themselves and their lives to the country's service, the country has a reciprocal obligation to the dependents of these people.  That is the principle.  In the case of Arthur Griffith circumstances demand that special consideration should be given, but the same principle is at work.  Then the question arises as to the amount and the method, and it is as to the amount and the method of the consideration that ought to be given to the case of the dependents of the late Arthur Griffith that we should have had some explanation from the Minister in charge of the Bill.  Without that explanation I think the Dáil is very much tied, and I think perhaps it would be well if I said no more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGES</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join in expressing my surprise, rather from another point of view?  I thought that the circumstances which necessitated this Bill were more or less obvious and painfully well known; but I had thought that this occasion would have been taken advantage of to have used such speech as would have made this Bill an opportunity for celebrating a great and heroic leader of this Nation.  I know very well it could be replied that words of praise at this time are unnecessary, that the country knows exactly what this heroic man did, and they know what this heroic man gave, and that his place belongs to history.  That could very easily be said.  I think it is a right principle that has been taken advantage of on all such occasions, even though the words may appear to be somewhat unnecessary, even though they appear to be supererogatory, to give acknowledgment to those who have been selfless leaders of a Nation, and who have, in the truest meaning of the word, died in the Nation's service, and to take advantage of occasions like this for doing so.  I could wish that that had been done.  If it had been done, others could have followed.  Here this afternoon in this Assembly&mdash;the meeting which he never lived to see, but which is built <Col N="2027" /> upon the foundation which he put down, he more than anyone, he more than any combination of others&mdash;here in his absence, when we are taking advantage of the fact that we have come into the administration of the Nation's own moneys to make provision for those whom he left after him not only desolate, as I have heard it said, but destitute, we give him the meed of praise which, however unnecessary it may be, which, however supererogatory it be, is nevertheless due not to him, but to ourselves. We know well, and the Nation knows well, that Arthur Griffith, had he chosen to have served himself, with the rich gifts that he had, could have provided amply for those whom he would leave after him.  The fact that they are to-day in need is owing merely to the fact that he gave all of himself to this Nation's service, never once counting any attractions that might lure him aside from that single, steadfast, selfless purpose of his life.  We know that for many long years he found himself in a very small minority, and, being himself a man of intractable purpose, being a man of very stubborn faith and belief in his own convictions, it never once crossed his mind during all those years in which he found himself in that minority that he would, however much he thought himself in the right, make his own convictions upon that matter a subject of dictation to any others than to himself.  And I remember that when the debates were on in the Dáil as to whether the Treaty of peace should or should not be accepted, certain persons in that Assembly gave expression to the faith that representatives were not bound by their constituents' wishes.  I remember the horror with which that thought came before him and the indignation that he expressed.  His faith was a faith in the freedom of this people&mdash; the real, substantial freedom to do what it liked with its own destinies; and when others arose and stated to certain of their followers that Ireland was theirs for the taking and that they should take it, it was like his wit, but like his faith and principle also, to give a slight turn to that and to express the conviction of his days that Ireland was the Nation's for the making, and that the Nation should make it.  That was the principle of all his days, and I could have wished <Col N="2028" /> that the President of the Executive Council had expressed those things in chosen and fitting words, as he could well have done, and had made this occasion, when we are bringing in this provision for those whom Arthur Griffith left after him, a time when on the records of this Dáil would have been written exactly what those who have been returned here on behalf of the people of Ireland thought of one who is destined to take his place not only among the leaders of this Nation, but among the chosen handful of the elect leaders of this Nation.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 1, Sub-section (7), in line 23, to insert after the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; the words &ldquo;not being less than 4 per cent. per annum&rdquo;; and Amendment No. 2, in line 24, Sub-section 7, to insert after the word &ldquo;redemption&rdquo; the words &ldquo;at any time during a period not exceeding twenty-five years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2029" /> These first two amendments on the paper are in my name.  I do not desire to attempt to force the figures that are mentioned in them upon the Ministry. The object of the amendments is to obtain some statement from the Minister in charge of the Bill as to the nature of the security which is to be issued in part payment of the compensation under this section.  I judge from the Bill that the Government do not propose themselves to create a stock and to sell it in the market and to pay cash out of the realisation of that stock, but that the applicant is to receive in cash part of the amount of his compensation and the residue is to be given to him in stock or bonds or securities of some description which he must take at their face value for the balance of the compensation that he does not himself receive in cash.  If I am correct in that it appears to me essential that the Bill should contain some indication, or, rather, the Act when it becomes a law should contain some indication on its face of the nature of the security that is to be given to the applicant in lieu of cash.  If, for instance, he were given £200 of irredeemable 2 per cent. stock the effect of that will be that he will receive a thing which he could sell in the market at £30 or £40 at the outside, but which was issued to him, and which he was bound to take, as being worth £200.  Therefore, it appears to me, that in the Section which prescribes the securities that are to be created for the purpose of being handed over to an applicant instead of the cash to which he is entitled under the decree, there should be some figure or other from which he can form some estimate as to the amount that he is actually going to receive in cash or in securities which he can take into the market and commute into cash.  It is quite obvious that where a man gets a decree for something over £2,000, of which he receives part in money and the rest in stock, in many cases he will want to realise the stock he gets at once in order to rebuild, or reinstate, or furnish the place that he has reinstated, or that has been reinstated for him, and he will want, not interest upon a capital sum, but a further capital sum, which he can only obtain by realising the security issued to him by the Government.  That cannot be done <Col N="2030" /> unless there is some means of estimating what the probable value of that security is going to be, and that can only be achieved by letting the applicant and the public know what rate of interest this stock is going to bear, and what the period of its redemption is, if it is going to be redeemable at all.  I have put down two amendments on this matter. The first is that the stock should bear interest at the rate of not less than 4 percent. per annum.  At the present time the British Government, I think, is giving something like 5 per cent., and 4 per cent. per annum would represent considerably less, I think, than the face value of the stock, and it would be saleable at considerably less than the face value.  The market value of the stock will also depend on the period within which it was going to be redeemed, if it was redeemable at all.  I beg, therefore, to move the first amendment, that the securities that are issued to the applicants in lieu of the balance of cash that they are not to get, shall be securities bearing interest at a rate of not less than 4 per cent.  I suggest also that they should be redeemable over a period.  I do not really care what the period is, but I suggest 25 years.  Let it be 25 years or 33 years, or whatever period may seem advisable&mdash;I am quite willing to accept that&mdash;but that some period of redemption ought to be fixed for these securities is, I think, reasonable, clear, and just.</P>

      <P>Last Friday there was an amendment standing on the Order Paper in my name which was disposed of because I understood that you had called upon a subsequent matter, and I left the Dáil for an appointment.  I make no question about it having been gone back upon and disposed of.  I merely raise it in connection with these two amendments because the purport of my amendment had been to delete the entirety of Section 7, not because this matter should not be dealt with&mdash;obviously it must be dealt with&mdash;and in any Bill of this kind in any other country it would be automatically dealt with as it is being dealt with in this Section.  But we are a new State, and there are certain procedures that we have not yet established precedents for, and I feel, and I urge upon the Minister for Finance now, that <Col N="2031" /> it would be a better course if the whole of this Section were to be deleted and were to be made the substance of a further Bill altogether.  So that hereafter, when matters like this arise, in which the creation of stock that would have a quotable value and have to pass currency in the Stock Exchange, all that stock of the future, as well as these matters now, could be referred back to that Bill in which the stock would be given some definite name such as it would have in any country, and it would be known by its reference that it was a stock of, say, 4½ per cent. redeemable in 25 years, or such other stock or conditions as circumstances might seem to warrant.  I feel that is required.  I support this amendment of Deputy Fitzgibbon failing the other course, which I do think is better, and I urge the Minister for Finance that it would be better from the point of view of finance, and of the Ministry, and of the Dáil and subsequent legislation, if all these questions of the kind of stock it is to be, and the manner of its issue, could be taken away out of this Bill altogether and postponed to a subsequent Bill, in which it could be adequately treated.  In any case, I think the procedure outlined here, even with the changes suggested by Deputy Fitzgibbon, is hardly a desirable one.  It is stated: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may create such securities bearing such rate of interest, and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption or otherwise as he shall think fit.&rdquo;  And having come to that decision with the best advice at his disposal&mdash;executive advice, although this is primarily a legislative matter&mdash;that the Order there made should be laid on the Table of the Dáil, and could only be brought up and challenged if some member desires to raise it.  It does seem, as I said on the Second Reading, that this is a very haphazard and casual way of dealing with the first issue of stock in this new State, and, as I have said, it will be an exchangeable commodity in the Stock Exchange and Bourses of more than one country.  It will at least have a quotation, and should expect to have a quotation, in the Exchanges of more than one country.  I think in a matter of this kind it will be raising the credit of the country in a striking <Col N="2032" /> form.  It is one that should be carefully gone into by the Legislature, and if that course were adopted it would have this essential benefit, and subsequent legislation would be able to refer back again to the securities or bonds, or whatever name they are given, and it would necessitate that all issues of that kind would be according to the precedent now established in a separate Act of its own. I urge that that should be done as a matter involving the credit of this country, and involving the question of establishing a precedent in a very clear, definite form, as a result of a definite Bill brought before the Legislature and receiving legislative sanction.</P>

      <P>To come back to the amendment, the Deputy who moved it desires to have inserted the words &ldquo;that the interest shall not be less than 4 per cent. per annum.&rdquo;  The Bill as presented provides that the rate of interest &ldquo;shall be subject to such conditions as the Minister for Finance may think fit.&rdquo; I take it that the Minister, in introducing the Bill in this form, had in mind that he would occupy a middle position.  The Deputy who moved the amendment does not mind how high the interest may be. He wants to provide that it shall not be less than 4 per cent.  I would be inclined to say that it shall not be more than 4 per cent., and would endeavour to press the Dáil on that issue whether we should make 4 per cent. the maximum or 4 per cent. the minimum.  The Minister, as I say, steers a middle course, and wants the decision as to the rate of interest to lie with him.  As between the amendment and the motion, I will vote for the motion. If the amendment were accepted and carried I would endeavour to move a later amendment, altering the word &ldquo;less&rdquo; to &ldquo;more.&rdquo;  I sincerely hope the Minister will not bind himself, will not bind the country to pay a minimum of 4 per cent., notwithstanding what the credit of the country may be.  I do not know whether the Minister requires any urging upon this matter, but for fear he might be inclined to give way to the Deputy I would strongly press him not to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The second amendment specifies repayment any time during a period not exceeding 25 years. Well, I do not personally approve of either amendment.  If we were to adopt the first, and some general re-organisation and stabilisation of the Money Market were to take place, and if we could possibly borrow money at anything like the pre-war price we would be committed in that case to pay a percentage in excess of the normal amount unless we come here or get the Dáil to repeal, to enable us to pay 3 per cent. or a lesser sum.  And in the same way the 25 years being included might give rise to some idea that it was not intended to discharge the nation's liability in respect of this particular service for 25 years.  It ought to be, and we ought to work towards a shorter period.</P>
      <P>I must say I do not see any likelihood of issuing this money, in the beginning at any rate, at 4 per cent.  It would not be fair to persons who require to get a fair security for whatever sum is awarded, and 4 per cent. at present would not, in my opinion, get a market quotation beyond eighty, if it did get that far.  In that case a man getting a decree for £1,000 would in reality get securities negotiable only at £800.  The case made by Deputy Figgis comes to me as a surprise, as I understood that the Deputy was well experienced in financial matters, but his statement does not warrant that assumption on my part. I think it does not serve the purpose which Deputy Fitzgibbon has in view to put down these two amendments.  In the first place, it is not our intention to issue at 4 per cent.  It would not be just or equitable, and it is not our intention to give a period of anything like 25 years for repayment.  If we gave it it would, perhaps, mean binding us, and I do not think that that would be advisable.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with what the Minister for Finance has said, but it seems to me that the wording of <Col N="2034" /> the motion, as put forward by him, leads to something different from what he wishes to secure, and would effect something quite apart from the intention in his mind.  It seems to me it would give the Minister for Finance a power of really varying an award made, if it were made on a certain definite basis, because apparently it leaves the Minister for Finance with the right to say, after an award has been made, what the rate of interest on such securities should be.  I do not believe that that is in his mind at all, but unless some wording which would involve the principle at which Deputy Fitzgibbon was aiming, namely, that the securities should not be depreciated&mdash;unless some wording of that kind were put in, it would mean that an award in the first place could be made on some unknown basis, and in the second place, might be made to have a different effect to that intended.

      <P>I must say that I have a good deal of sympathy with this amendment.  The purpose that it is intended to serve is excellent.  I observe it myself; I find it rather costly, but I have observed it at any rate up to this. In this particular case I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.  It comes to this: that an amount of responsibility of one sort or another would be thrown on those two Ministers and their Departments for which there is no machinery at present available.  It would take some time to construct that machinery, which, if worked in the spirit in which this amendment is put, would necessitate the judge taking into consideration that fact, and possibly awarding sums in excess of the amounts that <Col N="2036" /> he would have in mind if he were to concern himself solely with getting the actual cost of the restoration of those particular buildings.  It may be said, of course, that you can exclude certain items; but if you do exclude certain items, does it not mean that the purpose which the mover of the amendment has in mind is not carried into effect?  Take slates, for example.  There should be slates supplied in this country for the buildings required to be constructed, and I believe they are not available.  It is well known that a good deal of activity was to be undertaken by local authorities for the last twelve months; still the slate quarries remain unopened.  There is not a corresponding cordiality between persons engaged in the supply of building materials which would justify us in adopting this amendment in the spirit in which it is moved.  It is now twelve months since the notice about slate quarries was given, and yet there is no indication whatever as to any activity in that direction; at least the last time I heard of it there was not.  I fear that the cost here would be prohibitive, and that in essence it would mean subsidising local industries or activities of some sort or another.  That, in our present state of national finance, is a thing which we cannot afford.  There must certainly be a contribution put up by local persons in these cases.  There must be a little harder work, there must be more self-confidence than at present exists, and a better appreciation of the Nation's burdens at the present time, together with a determination on the part of local people to do their duty in easing those burdens.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister picked a very unfortunate illustration when he mentioned slates.  I think it will be generally agreed that you will not get slates in Ireland as cheaply as you will get them from across the water.  What I had particularly in mind was cut stone for the front facings of buildings, and red bricks.  Take, as an example, the College of Science, which is at present in possession of the Government.  All the facings there are of Portland stone. Several of the buildings reconstructed in O'Connell Street following the fighting <Col N="2037" /> in 1916, and particularly the banks at the corner of Lower Abbey Street, are faced with Portland stone.  I believe you could get limestone in Kilkenny quarry and in other quarries throughout Ireland which would be as suitable as the Portland stone, and which, excepting a slight difference in colour, would look as well.  You can get red bricks in Ireland as cheap as, if not cheaper, than you can across the water.  I am sorry the President picked slates as an illustration. I do not admit that they can be got as cheaply as across the water, yet our aim should be to get as far as possible in Ireland the material that is required. We do not suggest native industries should be subsidised if they are not going on as well as foreign ones.  We all agree if you do not get them as cheaply in Ireland you should get them elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not read the amendment, I think.  It is:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister for Finance, with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may issue orders, and shall impose such conditions, exceptions, and limitations as he desires.&rdquo;  In opposing the amendment, the Minister has suggested certain exceptions and limitations. They could be put in an Order. If they are reasonable they are still in his hands to put in an Order.  This Bill purports to spend public money for the purpose of re-erecting premises which have been destroyed, and which will remain in possession of private persons. The Dáil also votes public money for public purposes to be spent directly by the Government.  The Government has accepted that within certain conditions, exceptions, and limitations, the public money shall be spent as far as possible on goods produced and manufactured in Ireland.  We are asking you to do with this expenditure of public money what you have already agreed to do with the expenditure of other public moneys&mdash;to impose, with such limitations and exceptions as you yourself prescribe, a condition that this money shall be spent on materials produced or manufactured within this country.  It is a reasonable condition.  The Minister will be the first to say that, legally, public taxation is not responsible for this expenditure, that it will have to come upon the <Col N="2038" /> local authority, which could not bear it. You are coming to the relief of the sufferers from this destruction.  You have a right to impose certain conditions, and they will be mild conditions, at the discretion of the Ministry.  A part of the reconstruction movement will be reconstruction and rehabilitation of industries, together with their encouragement.  This is one way&mdash;a very direct and non-punitive way of encouraging those industries &mdash;that you shall, as far as possible, spend the award which has been given to you for reconstruction of premises in the purchase of home-manufactured materials. Without such a condition there is too great a likelihood of materials being brought in, perhaps from Germany, possibly from Russia, but at any rate from countries which are able to produce goods cheaply, and where, owing to currency conditions, goods, and materials can be produced and poured into this country at a rate which cannot be competed against.  I recognise quite clearly that this question involves very many other questions, but it involves ultimately this problem, whether you are prepared to allow in all kinds of cheaply manufactured articles, produced under any conditions the producers are willing to suffer and simply pay in exchange grazed cattle.  Ultimately you have that problem against you, just as you have had it for the last seventy or eighty or ninety years &mdash;whether this country is going to be a cattle grazing country, and have a population which is serving cattle graziers directly or indirectly, or whether you are to have an industrial country.  The Bill that was introduced in the early stages of to-day's proceedings had relation to a teacher who insisted that there must be some positive assistance given to the revival of Irish industries.  Here is a very easy, obvious, and opportune way of aiding that revival.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The weakness of the amendment seems to me to lie in the fact that it is after a decree has been given that this particular order is sought, and that a Judge, in awarding a decree, may be asked by counsel&mdash;and reasonably asked&mdash;to advert to the possibility of such an order.  An able counsel could, no doubt, enlarge upon such possibilities, with the result that the particular award given would be increased appreciably <Col N="2039" /> You may say you have got to give this decree, remembering that it will be open to a Ministry, or to Ministries, to attach to it certain conditions, which may mean in effect and in practice that the value of the decree would be depreciated.  As the President (Minister for Finance) pointed out, that would work out in practice as subsidising of a particular industry, not in any open way where how much can be measured, and not by any protective policy, but without consultation, without discussion or mandate, and without being in a position to measure the extent of the subsidy.  It cannot be claimed that we have been unmindful of the necessity of fostering native industries. Even in difficult circumstances we have moved, and moved strongly and rapidly, towards the fostering of these within our own territories.  The Local Government Department, for instance, has taken a big step in its policy of inviting the local authorities to pool their contracts so that nascent industry or the enterprising business man contemplating the laying out of capital can be given an inducement that with reasonable energy and initiative on his part there will be a market on the collective demand of the local authorities for the particular article if turned out up to standard.  This question of fostering native industries by Governmental action by this particular method is of doubtful wisdom, and particularly doubtful wisdom when practically no steps are being taken to foster them by any other means. and when we are not even sure that the people themselves in an organised way&mdash; party organisations, even if I might say so, labour organisations&mdash;are not contributing their utmost to ensure that the products of the country will be bought within the country.  This, of course, is an easy way.  It seems a simple thing to put the onus on two Departments and say whenever a decree for compensation is given you can come along with your order and say, &ldquo;Only Irish materials are to be used in this reconstruction.&rdquo; Does it not point straight to the possibility of the value of an award being decreased, perhaps twenty per cent.?  It may be; there is nothing here to prevent it.  What a clamour would be raised by a particular industry if you say &ldquo;you must attach to the re-building award to which a reconstruction condition <Col N="2040" /> is attached, an order saying that only native stone or timber, and so on, shall be used,&rdquo; and it would be very hard to resist such an appeal.  It would be more practicable, I think, that party organisations and Trade Union branches should act, and non-governmental steps should be taken to encourage the purchase of native products within the country, than that the Government should be asked to take power to attach conditions of this kind.  If there is to be a protection policy in the country then let it be a declared protection policy; put the embargo or duty on foreign products, and let it be discussed openly, and all the consequences measured, but this is a subtle step in that direction without the fullest consideration of the consequences, and it would leave these two Ministries open to the charge consistently repeated, the recurring charge, that they were not using sufficiently the powers given by that amendment.</P>

      <P>The President undoubtedly, in this matter, and on a recent occasion, laid his finger upon what is a weak spot in most of our efforts to promote Irish industry by preferential methods, that is the unfortunate tendency of firms who produce to take advantage of the situation that they are to be treated preferentially and to charge accordingly.  As the Chairman of a publishing company years ago that advertised its policy of using nothing but Irish paper, I was made painfully aware of this, because the only firm that was capable of supplying the material that we used in very large quantities being aware of the situation applied the higher charge to us to enable them to compete by the cutting of prices with firms in Bristol and corresponding places in England. Now, as a member of the Council of the Dublin Industrial Development Association, I have since seen similar instances, or have become aware of them.  I would suggest that this vice of the producer should not be allowed to close the door against efforts at preferential treatment that would have a fostering effect upon Irish industry.  If firms can supply the demand of the country they ought to be encouraged to do it.  They ought to be encouraged to develop, and the proper check <Col N="2041" /> should be put, and could easily be put as a Ministerial check upon efforts in the direction of profiteering. This demand for the use of Irish material in building is not a new thing.  When University College, Dublin, was about to be built we had an insistent demand that only Irish materials, so far as these were available, for the purpose, should be used, and Deputy Nagle, in moving the amendment, might have mentioned the case of Ballinasloe limestone, and the beautiful effect of Ballinasloe limestone as a building material exhibited in University College, Earlsfort Terrace; and what is more beautiful, the bluish effect of the limestone in one of the most beautiful buildings in Dublin&mdash;the North British Mercantile Insurance Co.'s premises at the corner of Nassau Street and Dawson Street.  Now, as regards slate, we are very much inclined to keep on using materials simply because they have been used.  Slate is a primitive thing in comparison with the products of recent inventions.  There was a time when houses, particularly in exposed situations, were roofed with flags&mdash;they were practically of a thickness that would entitle them to be called flags.  Slate is only development of a thinner fabric. and is pretty much of the same chemical nature, but there are artificial slates, and anyone who recognises how the cost in building has been raised, because of the cost of timber, will be fully alive to this fact that when timber can be saved it is a very vital consideration, and timber can be saved in roofing if lighter stuff is used instead of slate.  And it is possible to produce in Ireland, not with Irish products at the moment, but with imported materials, artificial slates &mdash; asbestos material&mdash;which will last quite as well, and is quite as serviceable, so that the difficulty about slates does not arise. Furthermore, as I mentioned on another occasion here, it is possible to have cement of the highest quality produced in Ireland if only the capital were put into it, and the capital would be put into it if only the demands were forthcoming; and here is an excellent opportunity of creating the demand.  The Minister who has just spoken has pointed out an amendment, by implication, which, I think, would improve this.  The amendment on the paper is not imperative on the Ministry.  It empowers them to do <Col N="2042" /> this.  Now, they need not exercise this power unless there is a local demand in the district where the restoration is going on; the public bodies that are concerned in the raising of the rates may petition for it.  I hate to be returning to the subject of Art, but Art does enter into this consideration.  It is notorious that the countryside might be disfigured by the employment of building materials that are not in harmony.  There is a tendency to destroy the landscape in Ireland by houses with red tiled roofs, and buildings on the Swiss model, whereas if you look around and see where the local stuff is used, somehow the building fits into the landscape and is attractive; and, what is more, it has the additional advantage that it is adapted by its very materials to the weather that it has got to encounter.  Where this is a demand of the local community, the Minister ought to be able to put in operation a power of this sort which would compel the building to be not according to the fancy or the whim of the rebuilder, but in harmony with the requirements of the district.  Now, local quarries could be developed, and the almost lost art of masonry, which was once a very fine thing in the country districts in Ireland, could be revived, if we were insistent upon the reconstruction of houses in Ireland and factories in country districts with local material instead of imported steel, slate and concrete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of difference between the action taken by the Government in giving preference to local products and compelling the decree-holder to do so.  If the Department which is entering into contracts finds that materials are being imported in any way, it can immediately cease to give the preference.  The decree-holder would, under this proposal, be in great difficulties, and probably would find it impossible to get relieved of the obligations placed upon him by the Order of the Minister for Finance, although these Orders might involve him in very serious losses.  There is an aspect of this matter which, I think, goes outside the scope of this Bill, and may be lost sight of.  If this particular provision were to be adopted, it would apply largely to building materials.  I do not think, when it comes to the question of reinstating machinery, <Col N="2043" /> that very large quantities of the machinery for factories can be purchased here, and I do not think that in many such cases it would apply.  However, I would fear that this might have the result of keeping up building costs, a matter which is of very serious importance here, and which will have to be taken into account a little later when we are dealing with the question of our housing policy.  Housing in this country costs at least 50 per cent. above the British rate &mdash;perhaps a good deal more than 50 per cent.  This Dáil has been paying a subsidy to housing at the rate of about £500 per house.  If costs do not come down, there is no doubt that the solution, or anything approximating a solution, of the very urgent and vital problem of housing will be impeded, and for my part I would greatly hesitate to assent to anything that might provide a means of keeping up the present extravagant cost of housing, looking at it, not from the point of view merely of the social welfare of the people, but from the point of view of public health.  One of the vital needs of the hour, in order that houses can be built, is that the cost of building should be reduced to some sort of reasonable dimensions, and I think that any kind of regulation in regard to materials, which would no doubt be taken hold of by interested parties to raise further the cost of housing, will be very much contrary to the public interest.</P>

      <P>In discussing this question we heard Deputy Johnson indulge in his usual sneer.  I think it is impossible, practically speaking, where cattle are concerned for Deputy Johnson to refrain from such action.  We know that if Ireland has grown rich, or has any money behind it, and is in a sound financial position, it is because of her cattle and the farmers.  We are urged to make Ireland an industrial country.  How can Ireland become an industrial country if the people of the country do not want to take part in industry?  Does Ireland want to be continually subsidised in order that she may compete with other countries? Where is the subsidy to come from?  Is it to come from the clouds?  The moment Irishmen are able to compete with the people of other countries then Ireland has a chance of becoming an industrial country.  Until she is prepared to do that <Col N="2044" /> there is no use talking about industrial prosperity while we sit down and do as little as ever we can.  There is no use talking about it, unless the spirit of the people is right, and unless the spirit behind it is right.  I do think, and I know the country fairly well, that two or three of the items needed for building could be produced more extensively in Ireland than has been the case.  One of the reasons why slates are not quarried in the last two or three years, and especially in the last six months, is that the owners could not get powder, or get it in sufficient quantities, and they had no market. If they got a reasonable market, and fair protection, slates could be raised in my county in three times the quantities that are being produced at present.  And, I think, our slates are as good as those of any other country in the world.  If you want stone, God knows there is as much stone in Ireland as anywhere else.  We need not go anywhere for stone provided the people put their backs into the work. We want transit.  We have the canals to take stuff to the coast, but I am afraid the railways are out of the question.  The whole thing is a question of organisation. With that in an efficient state there are a whole lot of things that could be done. There is no use talking about timber. I do not think that native timber is the best, or that it is equal to foreign timber in durability or anything like it.  Bricks can probably be produced in sufficient quantities in Ireland, but cement can not.  Are you to wait until these things can be done and set going?  We are told that in order to provide cement and bricks, we must get a cement factory and a brick factory.  I think with proper organisation we should try and use the few things we produce in building, and it would do a great deal of good.  The stone is in the country, and all you want is people to work it at a reasonable cost as they do in other countries, and try and organise the transit.  These few things deserve attention.  Slates and stones are a practical proposition, but I am afraid that some of the timber will have to be let go by the board.  I think the Government would be well advised to try and work our supply of stone and slate by proper organisation; I do not ask them to spend any money.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the poor encouragement <Col N="2045" /> Ministers have given to this amendment. It seemed to us that while the amendment is not mandatory it gives the Government an opportunity of putting in a proviso in any compensation that may be awarded to encourage, as far as possible, the use of Irish material.  We have all been talking about encouraging Irish industry for twenty years but the time has now arrived that will enable us to put our professions into effect, and as far as possible we ought to do so. The President referred to slates, and what he said is quite true; that it is not possible to get slates.  Why?  Because the slate quarries only get occasional orders, and they are not producing the standard size of slate.  Apart altogether from the question of subsidy, the Government could do a good deal in organising and encouraging the supply of Irish manufacture.  I put it to the Minister for Local Government, who has been doing good work in organising supplies for local bodies, that he ought to take this question up in regard to building materials.  A great lot can be done in that way and in the way of procuring Irish slates, bricks, cement and joinery. I agree with Deputy Gorey that Irish timber is not suitable.  But the manufacture of timber could be carried on and all the joinery could be done on a large scale, if doors and sashes and so on were standardised.  I quite agree with what the Minister said as to the wisdom of not expecting the Government to do everything, and of relying upon other organization.  That, of course, has been tried in a good many respects and will again, particularly with the encouragement given by citing such authority as the Minister for Home Affairs on direct action.  The men who work at the various ports, who could do so much in regard to imports and exports, will not lose sight of the encouragement given by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, in response to Deputy Gorey's remarks, that we are proposing to do exactly what he says is necessary.  These industries have not been established, because there was no market.  We suggest how to provide the market&mdash;the home market, and that is the market you have to look to.  What we want to avoid, if possible, is the perpetuation of that <Col N="2046" /> state of things which relies upon what Deputy Gorey supports, and claims freedom to preach, simply following the trail of the highest price on the sellers' side, and the lowest price on the buyers' side. If we are going to follow that proposal through, as we have been doing, then I say you are going back to that stage in this country from whence we have been trying to move, where grazed cattle, being the cheapest and easiest wealth production, are going to dominate everything else.  I know Deputy Gorey does not take that view; he does not think that ought to be the case; he does not believe in leaving this country in the hands of the rancher simply because cattle grazing is the easiest way of increasing wealth, but although he does not believe it that is where his argument would lead us to, and that is where the policy of the Ministry, as expounded here to-day, would lead us to, though I am pleased to say that is not the policy they practise. I am convinced we must either voluntarily, or by some kind of Governmental pressure, put something in the way of this free competition&mdash;the competition of the cheapest product from abroad with the products of the home market. If we are going to rely upon this free play of competition, and simply provide the dearest market with the produce of Ireland's land, and let the recipients of that price in these foreign markets purchase the things they require in the cheapest market&mdash;it may be England, Germany, Japan, or China&mdash;then we are going to arrive at the stage when &ldquo;the fruitful mother of flocks and herds&rdquo; that we have heard so much about will prevail, and the possibility of industrial development will go by the board.  The purpose of this amendment, as has been pointed out, is merely to give an opportunity and the authority of the law to the Ministry to use its influence to promote Irish industries.  This amendment will assist them in relieving the unemployment that the destructive policy of the past few years has produced.  The Minister for Local Government deals with housing.  The suggestions made by Deputy O'Brien are put forward, and I hope will bear fruit at an early date, with the idea that there should be a policy of standardisation and production ahead on <Col N="2047" /> a large scale to meet the necessary needs of housing that will cheapen. to a very considerable degree, the cost of housing. The trouble is not a wage trouble; it is a trouble of materials more than wages, and of bad organisation.  If you think that the problem of housing is going to be met simply by driving down wages, then there is going to be more and more trouble, and we believe honestly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One matter that ought not to be lost sight of is this, that these reinstatement conditions are attached mainly to the reinstatement of factories, workshops and places of that kind.  The cause of a large part of the unemployment that exists is due to the fact that these factories and workshops are not running, and that the men who worked in them are idle because there is no place for them to work.  The only way to relieve that unemployment is to get these factories going again, and as quickly as possible.  If you are to wait until you get men of capital to set up cement and joinery factories. and other places, to supply the materials for building, the people who ought to be working, and <Col N="2048" /> working within six months from the time that the decree is given, will be on the road for years.  Another point is, that if you stimulate a series of artificial industries in supplying materials to rebuild these factories&mdash;work which will have to be done quickly, and done in a very short time&mdash;you will have a great rush of employment during a year or two, but as soon as the factories have been rebuilt, the men who have been drawn into these artificial and temporary industries will be thrown out of work, and you will be faced again with the old unemployment problem, just as happened during the war, when there was a great boom in employment, and then the slump after. Surely, it would be a great deal better to rebuild the factories, that we had and want to see reconstructed, as quickly as possible, in order to absorb the unemployment caused by the fact that they are in ruins to-day, instead of trying to create artificial and temporary industries.</P>

      <P>I think if Deputy Fitzgibbon looks around he will find there are not so many factories to be reconstructed.  There are shops, but his argument, I think, does not apply to this part of the Bill at all.  He will find, I think, there has not been a great deal of destruction of factories, machinery, or anything like that.  No one on this side of the Dáil suggests that there should be any delay, or anything that would cause delay, in such reconstruction.

      <P>I just wish to say, I think it is a very desirable principle that should be followed, whenever possible&mdash;that Irish material should be used.  In the present instance, I think, we must look at the matter from two points of view.  The first is the economic point of view.  I am afraid that Irish materials could not, in every instance, be employed economically in the process of reconstruction, admitting, of course, that the Order will be optional.  I still think there is an ethical point of view.  Presumably this compensation is given to parties because they have a right to it. <Col N="2049" /> Have we then any right to hedge in the injured party by restrictions, or limitations, in regard to his right to this compensation? I think that is a point that has been lost sight of in the discussion. I was rather surprised that Deputy Magennis did not refer to the ethical point of view.  I think there is a principle there.  If the injured party has a right to compensation, I think the utmost limits have been reached in the Bill, as it stands, in restricting him within his rights.  I would be altogether opposed to further restricting him.</P>

      <P>The reason such an amendment has been moved may be attributed, I suppose to one of three causes&mdash;either the employers, the employees, or the organisation; perhaps to the three of them altogether.  In a matter of this sort, if the Order were carried <Col N="2050" /> out in the spirit in which the amendment is moved, it would mean that each one of the three knows there is an opportunity for him of getting something that he is not honestly making his contribution towards.  If it be output that is wrong, we are going to continue it; if it be profiteering on the part of the employer, we are going to continue it; if it be organisation, we are going to continue that bad organisation.  Possibly the whole three of them are at fault.  If only two of the three, it means the continuance of it, and I am satisfied, from my experience of the business of the country, that unless there is an entire reconsideration of this problem these industries will go out of existence, and go out of existence through their own criminal fault and neglect in contributing to it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add the following Sub-section after Sub-section (11):&mdash;&ldquo;In every case in which a reinstatement condition is attached to a decree, the person to whom the compensation is paid or other the person who executes the work of reinstatement, shall observe the conditions as to the rates of wages to be paid and the hours of labour to be observed set out in the Third Schedule to this Act, as if he were executing the work in pursuance of a contract with the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very closely related to the one that has just been disposed of. It seeks to ensure that the Fair Wages Clause shall be observed in the expenditure of any awards granted by the Government. The Government accept as their duty to see that this is done in money expended on their own behalf.  As <Col N="2051" /> these are semi-Government funds, it is reasonable to expect it should apply in this case also.  The Third Schedule referred to in the amendment is now in operation in all the Government Departments. With that object in view I move Amendment No. 5.</P>

      <P>The same argument that would hold against the other amendment ought to hold against this.  It is imposing upon the people who get this money, not as a gift, but as a right, a condition that no man would agree to. This and the last amendment remind me very much of the effort to make the Government official handicappers in a race. They want to make it a handicap, and they want to handicap every horse except certain Irish horses.  This and the previous amendment are an insult to the Irish nation as a whole.  I am very sorry to see the nature of this amendment, and I would be sorry to believe there is a need for it.  It is an absolute confession that we are not honest in our efforts to build up this nation and to compete with every other nation; that we want some Garden of Eden, some special ground for ourselves, and that without that we could not exist.  I do not believe it.</P>

      <P>I would be very pleased <Col N="2052" /> to imagine that a suggestion that only Trade Union Labour be employed in any industry or business in Ireland would mean that we were keeping out an English worker or a German worker.  I would be very pleased if that were true. That is what Deputy Gorey suggested.  I would like to remind him that this does not, nor is it intended to apply only to Ireland, but that the Fair Wages Clause, as mentioned in the amendment, applies to practically all the work that is done by public bodies in Great Britain as well as in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to fix a Fair Wages Clause as adopted in Government contracts. I think that the case that has been made by somebody against this amendment, that we owe this compensation, and that we owe it free from any restriction is a good case.  We are certainly placing the maximum number of restrictions that we can possibly put on these people, giving them as little as we can, consistent with the national dignity, and to place any further restriction in their way would, I think, amount to a very serious interference with their liberty. There are cases, I am informed, in which it would be almost impossible to carry this out.  It would I expect, keep the Government departments busy in seeing whether or not the conditions were complied with.  In any case there might be a limitation with regard to competition which, I think, in the circumstances of the case we are not entitled to put in. As I understand the position it amounts to this.  The cost of building is practically 50 per cent., perhaps more, in excess of the economic value of that building. What is responsible for that?  There must be something.  Our duty, I think, would lie as much towards finding out what that is, and removing it as in putting in a Clause of this sort.  Building materials have gone down in price: wages, I am informed, do not really matter if there was output.  If the output be responsible for the shortage, or for the high cost, certainly I think that those who are interested in putting down this amendment ought to see to it.  I know one case myself where practically all Irish materials were used in building a small cottage which consisted of three rooms, a scullery and a very small hall, and the cost of building, left entirely to the workmen <Col N="2053" /> themselves and to their honour, and done under an architect, was £1,200.  Certainly, we could not possibly go on if sums like that had to be paid in the same circumstances by people who are going to get awards.  I admit it is an exceptional case; it is a case that occurred in the country within a couple of miles of the end of the tram terminus.</P>

That is the sort of case that would be put up to us, and that they would be entitled to put up to us, and that I had a certain intimate knowledge of.  That certainly would be unreasonable.  I am sure it is not the intention of the Party in the House, responsible for putting down this amendment that cases of that sort should be continued.  This, in essence, amounts to a restriction upon a person's rights and privileges, and I thought that we had reached the maximum of restriction when we insisted upon reinstatement, and when we decided only according as the building went up.</P>

      <P>Since Deputy Whelehan raised this ethical point the tendency has set in of working it to death.  I regret that the President fell a victim to the ethical Whelehan germ that Deputy Whelehan put in circulation.  No one was clearer than the President some evenings ago when he said with regard to the amount of compensation payable that we have to consider what the public Treasury could bear, that we could not propose or hope to give all the compensation that would be requisite in every case, but that the Legislature intended to do its best.  In doing its best those who are in charge of the taxpayers money are entitled to consider that the expenditure of the taxpayers' money will redound most to the advantage of the taxpayers as a whole.  I would urge that upon the President, and it does away altogether with this supposed ethical right that the recipient of compensation is to be at liberty to do what he pleases with the money he has received.  It is for the community that raise the money, in order to compensate him for injury sustained in conflict with the promotion of the interests of the community to determine how much they <Col N="2054" /> shall give, and under what conditions; and if it be thought to be the best public policy that the workman should receive a standard wage in all these things which are really quasi State operations, he should receive wages of the same standard as people under Government contracts, and I fail to see that there is any unjustifiable interference with the ethical rights of those who are compensated. Undoubtedly what has been before us so frequently is something that calls for remedy.  The cost of building in Ireland two or three years ago went up to an enormous amount.  It has gone down very considerably of late in England, but it has not gone down proportionately in Ireland.  In England workmen's houses that were built for £850 and £860 are now being built for £375 and £400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In Belfast they are being built for £535 and £600, and in districts in the South of Ireland they are still over £800.  The house that was built on the honour of workmen mentioned by the President was only £200 in excess of the price paid by local authorities for similar houses in the vicinity of Dublin, such as Dalkey township a few years ago.  It is not the payment of standard wages that is at fault; it is the amount of production.  A bricklayer ought to be paid, for example, a proper wage as calculated by the requirements existing in his district as regards the cost of living, and his own possibilities of human living.  Of course, we are entitled to ask the builder to lay a proper number of bricks, and when we consider the number allowed by the unions in different districts they vary to a lamentable extent.  Because there is one wrong there is no reason why we should leave another right unworked.  It seems to me that the requirements of a proper wage should be satisfied and pressure put upon the slacker among the workmen to get him to do an honest equivalent of his particular labour for the honest wages paid to him.  I am as much opposed as Deputy Whelehan or the President to restrictions upon liberty, but after all the very well-being of the community is based on restrictions upon licence to do what one wills.  Liberty is defined by Burke as the wise obedience to just laws. <Col N="2055" /> It is wittily defined in terms of restriction. Some people jibe at the present restrictions as an unwarrantable interference with individual liberty.  It is a warrantable interference with individual licence.  I think if the money payable is to be paid by way of compensation to certain men, and they are to be at liberty in expending that in building, that they are to be sweaters of labour if they please, that they are to buy labour under conditions that they can impose, and have it at the cheapest price, then that is not a proper return to the community that lays itself under taxation in order to requite them for the loss they sustained.  After all, we are not to be so tender to the injured receiving compensation as to forget that there are other people who might be injured by the repercussion of compensation, and we have to consider their well-being as well as the well-being of those to be compensated. It seems to me if we were believers at all in the rights of workmen to their trade unions, and if we believe the workman is entitled to the remuneration for his work that will enable him to lead a distinctly human life we ought not complain of asking an expression of that opinion in terms of legislation.</P>

      <P>It seems to me the last speaker while he would probably claim to be an advocate of the amendment has put his finger upon the weak spot in the amendment, and it is a very weak spot, indeed.  The case, I suppose, for a fair wages clause in a Government contract is, that the Government directly, at any rate, and theoretically&mdash;I am afraid it is very theoretically&mdash;has a certain control in the matter of output, and in deciding the manner in which the work shall be carried out.  We are asked now to put a fair wage clause in what has been rather subtly described as quasi-Government work.  It is not quasi Government work, and the Government could exercise no control whatever as to the output or manner in which the work should be carried out.  Therefore, you would have a one-sided business.  You would put on the employer the burden of paying a particular wage when you were not in a position to procure for him a standard output, or to control in any way the manner in which he shall be given value for that wage.  That is the weakness. <Col N="2056" /> We have not the right to step in on one side if we are not in the position to step in on the other side.  We have no right to say to a man, &ldquo;You shall pay out to the extent of blank pounds, shillings and pence,&rdquo; if we are not in the position to say to the man who is giving value, &ldquo;You shall give value to the extent of blank bricks laid per day.&rdquo;  We are asked to sanction a &ldquo;dogs-tied, stones loose&rdquo; kind of arrangement.  We are asked to step in in favour of one party to the contract while we have utterly no power to step in in favour of the other.  That is the weakness of the amendment, and the last speaker to the amendment has consciously or unconsciously drawn attention to it.</P>

My point is that we are not entitled to say to an individual, &ldquo;You shall pay wages not less than so and so,&rdquo; when we are not in a position to say to the people he employs, &ldquo;You shall give value not less than so and so&rdquo;; that we are not in a position to step in and say to the other party to the contract&mdash;because the employment is a contract&mdash;&ldquo;Your output or production shall not be less than a particular standard.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not a Government contract, you are at least insisting that contracts shall be entered into.  I <Col N="2057" /> differ from the President in saying that it is the final and ultimate condition that should be applied.  If you insist that contracts shall be entered into, or that certain buildings shall be rebuilt, you are fully entitled to say that they shall be rebuilt under certain conditions.  I wonder would the Minister object if coolie labour were brought in?  Would he say that was compliance with the conditions and that he had no right to intervene? For practical purposes we are not very much concerned except for the districts such as that represented by Deputy Whelehan, and I am going to ask him, for instance, and other Deputies representing districts where the bricklayer and the mason are not highly organised, and are not subject to alleged directions and conditions of output, why he does not, and why his constituents do not show the remainder of the country how to build cheaply?  There are houses built in Galway county, and the conditions that are alleged to be imposed on output&mdash;the limitation alleged to be imposed on output&mdash;certainly do not prevail in county Galway.  Now, there is an opportunity for the Deputies representing county Galway to show the rest of the country how to produce houses cheaply.  This story about output and a limitation of output is based upon a fallacy and ignorance of the conditions.  It is really based upon propaganda of the Association or Federation of British Industries, and it has percolated through all the newspapers that there are limitations on output imposed by the trade unions.  It is not true. I am putting forward this challenge, that in these districts of the country where they build houses, and can build houses, and where the building trades are not organised in the way that is suggested in other towns, that they should show us how to do it.  I make this challenge, and I say that if the building contractors can organise their business properly they will find that houses can be built cheaper than they have been.  It is their failure to organise their business and not the failure of the workmen to do their work satisfactorily.  There is another aspect to this, and it might even be considered pertinent to this question of conditions. Are you willing to build your houses in the Saorstát of the same quality as they are building them in England for £300 or £400, or as they are building them in <Col N="2058" /> Belfast?  Are you prepared to see built in this country the same quality of house as they are about to build at this low price?  Your Local Government Department, except in a few cases where the poor ex-service men are to be housed, have not consented to the building of that quality of house.  There is a lot of jerry property being put up to-day that will be slums in 20 or 30 years, decrepit broken houses which are being thrown at us as examples of how to build cheaply. True economy, as will be found, is to build a better quality of house for the working man to take some pride in their work, as they are doing now in the building trade in Dublin and in the South generally.  If you want machine-built houses I have no doubt you can find a way of doing it, but you will not get houses of the kind that you will be proud of in 20 years' time.  The amendment simply only seeks to ensure that the sweating conditions that may be imposed in districts of the country, where there are no trade union organisations, shall not prevail, and it is on behalf of these parts of the country in the main that this amendment is proposed.</P>

      <P>I do not like to rise and speak twice on one amendment, but a challenge has been thrown out by Deputy Johnson, and the reply is another challenge.  Is there a contractor in Dublin to-day building houses without a subsidy?  Is there a contractor in any part of the country, or a private individual, or a business man entering into a contract for building houses as a speculation? I know they are building all over England, as I was over there a fortnight ago and saw them building.  Why?  Because they can get some return for their money.  Building is a paying proposition there, and the thing is done on business lines.  There people are doing the possible and not trying to do the impossible.  In Ireland you cannot get that.  No contractor will get up here and put in a contract for building as a paying proposition. He could not do it, and I challenge the Labour men to produce such a contractor who is doing so even on a small scale.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Johnson has considered all the circumstances of the case.  He mentioned the builders being at fault and the organisation <Col N="2059" /> of their business being defective, but if my recollection is quite correct the Dublin Corporation handed over to a Building Guild in the city houses to be built in groups, and, as far as I know, the price was not much under the builders' price, if at all, so that the organisation of the builders must be efficient, considering they have to get a living.</P>

      <P>I do not know&mdash;I suppose they had to be bought&mdash;possibly the Corporation&mdash;but even if they did I expect they had to pay contract prices, so there was no extravagance as regards the price of materials.  The essence of the case is that private building has ceased. As regards what the Deputy says, &ldquo;Are we to be satisfied with houses such as are built in England or Belfast?&rdquo;  I say you are not rich enough to have better.  If you are looking to the State to provide better ones, I say you have not greater resources than the English Government, and you have nothing approaching the revenue that they have got.</P>
      <P>If it means that you are looking to the State to make up the difference, I may tell you, from an intimate knowledge of the finances of the State, it cannot be afforded.  It is out of the question.  I do not know exactly what is meant by sweating in the building trade.  I never heard the term applied to it; but I do say that something is radically wrong. It cannot be the builders; the builders could not possibly have 50 per cent. profit, and the houses that are being charged for at £1,000, or from £750 upwards, are, in my deliberate opinion, from 33? to 50 per cent. over the price they should be at.  No person would think at the present moment of investing money in house building. Although it was an investment in the pre-war period, it is out of the question now, and I would suggest to the Deputy that it ought to be considered very carefully by the people to whom a contract is given.  Otherwise it will come to this: that it would not be to the interest of any individual to put money into brick and mortar at present prices.</P>

      <P>I do not <Col N="2060" /> think we can enter into a general discussion on housing.  Deputy Johnson wandered very far from the amendment, and the President was entitled, perhaps, to make his contribution of disorder on housing generally.  This is a question of putting in a Fair Wages Clause into contracts entered into where a reinstatement condition has been attached to a decree.  I think we ought to keep to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there is a very great distinction between the private person operating with money derived from a decree, and the Government. Standard wages, arrived at as a result of the mutual pressure put upon workers and employers, having regard to the economic circumstances, to market conditions, and to outside competition.  Now, that mutual pressure will very frequently take the form of strikes and locks-out. The Government has the duty of keeping the ring and keeping peace when the mutual pressure becomes acute.  It is undesirable that the Government should be involved in the struggle, wherever it can be avoided.  It is undesirable that the Government as a party, or as an employer, should be directly or indirectly involved in disputes which have the effect of fixing and altering and settling from time to time what the standard wage in any particular case is to be.  If we tie up the private employer, who is not different from any other private employer, except that he has got the money which he is going to pay for the work as a result of a decree following damage to property, we are knocking out the machinery by which the standard wage is arrived at. It might be desirable to have other means of arriving at what will be the standard wage than simply by the pressure of employers and employed on each other. That is how it stands, and if we are to alter it, we ought to alter it with a set purpose, and by some deliberately conceived machinery.  It is not desirable that we should alter the conditions simply by following what I think is an entirely false analogy.  We are making certain private employers stand out from this process of mutual pressure, by which wages are altered as conditions alter. There is no reason why those employers, more than any other employers, should not have, if they wish, wages reduced and conditions of employment altered. <Col N="2061" /> There is a good reason why the Government should not do that.  Where a Government is a contractor, or where a contractor is definitely performing work on behalf of a Government there is no reason why that contractor should not be involved in the struggle in which the <Col N="2062" /> Government would be brought into to keep the ring.  That does not apply to the private employer, a person who has a decree for compensation, and who is building a structure for his own use, and not for the Government.</P>

      <P>(1)  The Council of every county and urban district in Saorstát Eireann shall in each of the five financial years beginning on the 1st day of April, 1923, the 1st day of April, 1924, the 1st day of April, 1925, the 1st day of April, 1926, and the 1st day of April, 1927, respectively, pay to the Exchequer of Saorstát Eireann in accordance with such directions as may be given for the purpose by the Minister for Finance, an amount equivalent to the produce of a rate of sixpence in the pound levied throughout the county or urban district.</P>
      <P>(2)  The amount required to be paid to the Exchequer under the foregoing sub-section shall be raised in the like manner as the amount of decrees awarded under the Criminal Injuries Acts are raisable by the Council of a county or an urban district.</P>

      <P>(4)  From and after the passing of this Act the Road Fund may, in addition to any other application for the time being authorised by law, be applied for repairing any damage (including total destruction) done at any time prior to the 6th day of February, 1923, to any road or to any bridge, viaduct, or sub-way over or under or supporting any road.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To delete Sub-section (1) and (2), and to insert in lieu thereof the following Subsections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Council of every County and County Borough, in each of the five local financial years, beginning on the first day of April, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, and <Col N="2064" /> 1927, respectively, shall pay to the Exchequer of Saorstát Eireann, in accordance with such directions as may be given for the purpose by the Minister for Finance, a sum equal to a rate of 6d. in the £ on the rateable value of such County or County Borough, including any urban districts therein at the beginning of each such local financial year, respectively.</P>
    <P>(2)  The sum required to be paid by the Council of a County or County Borough under the foregoing Sub-section shall be assessed and raised in the same manner as the amounts of decrees under the Criminal Injuries Acts, charged on the County at large, including the urban districts therein are assessed and raised.&rdquo;  The effect of this is to exclude from Sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 13 any reference to Urban Districts, and to substitute County Boroughs.  The reason is that the County Council in the ordinary course will collect the 6d. rate from the Urban District, and for that reason the Urban District should not be included.  On the other hand, the County Council will not collect from the County Borough, and it is necessary to include the County Borough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no amendment down to this, but I would like to direct the attention of the Minister &mdash;and it is probable that the attention of some of those who represent public bodies has been already attracted&mdash;to a matter in this sub-section that will, I think, have to be met by legislation.  &ldquo;The Council of every County and County Borough in each of the five local financial years, beginning on the first day of April, 1923, ...&rdquo;  That is, in less than a month from now they must raise a sum equal to a rate of 6d. in the £.  The rates for the financial year beginning on April 1st, 1923, have in accordance with law to be settled before the 1st March.  That is a day which occurred last week, and it will be necessary, either in this or in some consequential legislation to authorise public bodies to raise a supplementary rate, in order to meet the 6d. in the £, at least for the financial year beginning on the 1st April, 1923.  Their rates have been made, though not actually struck yet, but, in any event, it would be impossible for them to charge this sum of 6d. in the £ upon the ratepayers during the coming year unless they <Col N="2065" /> are authorised by some other legislation. The only other course that they could adopt, so far as I know, is by way of loans, for which they would have to get leave from the Local Government Department, and if it is intended that they should do it by loan I think the Statute should contain an authority to raise by loan, instead of by rate, this sum of 6d. in the £.  I think that probably it was supposed that this Bill would have become law at a date which would have enabled the public bodies to strike a legal rate for this 6d. in the £.  As that now seems to be impossible, having regard to the date on which, by law, they are bound to strike their rates, some section should be introduced on this, or a later stage, or possibly some supplementary Bill, to enable this to be done.  Probably some Deputies, who are familiar from practical experience with the work of public bodies, would be able to make some suggestion on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point of order which will, I am sure, be of interest to the President, inasmuch as he has insisted upon the necessity of having a Financial Resolution passed before the discussion on Second Reading of any measure which appropriates public money.  I think it is in his mind also that there must be a similar Financial Resolution before any Bill which makes a charge upon the public can be discussed in Committee.  Now, I submit that this section, or the sub-section under discussion, makes a charge upon the public, and there has been no authorisation by a Financial Resolution.  The only Financial Resolution that has been passed deals with the issue out of the Central Fund, not making a charge upon the public which will come into the Central Fund, and I draw the attention of An Ceann Comhairle to the point, and ask the President to take note of it.</P>

      <P>With reference to the point made by Deputy Fitzgibbon, I know that rates have been struck by various County Councils, according to law, before the 1st of March, and these rates are now in course of preparation. If this Bill goes through the Seanad, it will be, possibly, the 1st April before it will be a fact, and I do not know of any <Col N="2066" /> means at the disposal of the county bodies at present as to how they are to get the sixpenny rate for next year.  Of course, if the Bill becomes an Act it will be very easy for 1924 and 1925, but we have to get over the difficulty for the period from the 31st March, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924.  I believe, with Deputy Fitzgibbon, that some legislation will have to be passed, or authority given to the County Councils to enable them to strike a supplementary rate, or to borrow the money to pay for the forthcoming financial year.  I think the Government will have to make some arrangement, either before we are finished with this Bill, or bring in some legislation afterwards, to give the County Councils an opportunity of raising the money asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Fitzgibbon and Deputy Hughes have been before us.  We did not anticipate, when compiling this Bill, that so much delay would have occurred, and it is a difficulty that we are at present trying to solve.  We hope to be able to have a solution of it on the Report Stage, or to have some arrangement come to whereby the rate of sixpence in the £ can be struck this year.  The point has been before us now for the past week or so, but we have not had opportunities of giving much time to it, and we will be able to have something later on.  I do not think that the point mentioned by Deputy Johnson arises.  The authorisation to strike a rate and the striking of the rate is in itself a Financial Resolution, and as we do not raise the money for our own purposes, it does not really concern us.  It is not anything that we are spending.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that a Ford motor car was commandeered by Free State troops last autumn from Mr. Michael Flanagan, River Street, Ballinasloe, that after three months it was returned to him in a very damaged condition; that several applications have since been made by Mr. Flanagan for compensation for loss of his car and for cost of repairs, but that he has yet received no payment of any kind from the military authorities, and will he see that this claim receives immediate attention.</P>
