      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought that the reasons are very obvious. There is a heavy legislative programme awaiting the consideration of the Dáil and Seanad, and it is necessary to get through this Bill in order that other Bills may be brought forward for the consideration of the Dáil.  The reasons are just the same reasons as compelled us to sit late on Thursday night last&mdash; just the same reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that there are no reasons whatever.  The legislative programme that is before us is one other Bill, of which the Second Reading has been taken, and to which a very small number of amendments have been put forward.  That is the heavy legislative programme that we are asked to deal with.  When is the General Election? Is it next week or the week after, or three weeks or a month hence?  If not, where is the heavy legislative programme that demands a night sitting?  That is not the reason, notwithstanding what the Minister says.  I protest against what I consider to be very scurvy treatment of the Dáil by the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Thursday, we were here to discuss <Col N="834" /> business in the ordinary course, with the ordinary Standing Orders, having had the ordinary notice that the business would be conducted in the ordinary way. We have had, week after week, business coming to us, adjournments over several dates.  We have had men coming from the country for one day and going back again with no other business in hands. Then the Minister comes forward on Thursday, and tells us that we have to sit beyond the normal period.  He moved that we sit until 4 o'clock in the morning. On Friday we adjourned without any notice of any new procedure, of any suspension of Standing Orders, or any alterations in Parliamentary time.  The Minister comes forward to-day again at 3 o'clock in the day, and tells us that we are to suspend the Standing Orders.  He moves the suspension of the Standing Orders for the abolition of the time limit. I say that is scurvy treatment of the Dáil.  It means that in the minds of the Ministers this Dáil is merely a toy for them to play with.  We are to say &ldquo;ditto.&rdquo;&ldquo;What we have decreed, you are to obey.&rdquo;  I resent that kind of treatment.  I ask the Dáil to resent that kind of treatment.</P>
    <P>Ministers have been treated by the Dáil very fairly, and very reasonably, and with the greatest possible amount of consideration.  They have brought forward Bills here; they have broken their rules of order.  They have broken their Standing Orders time after time, and they asked for the leniency of the Dáil.  They do it time after time.  They have broken all the rules of order, and all the rules of debate.  Then they come forward to the Dáil and say, &ldquo;Here is a thing we want done.&rdquo;  They give the Dáil no consideration whatever.  They say, &ldquo;Because we have willed it the majority of the Dáil must follow us.&rdquo;  We have been given no consideration whatever.  That is scurvy treatment of the Dáil, and we resent it.  If the Ministers are going to treat the Dáil in the way they threaten they will get all the opposition they require. If they are going to destroy any as a toy, if they are going to destroy any attempt to make this Assembly worthy of the name of Parliament, if they are going to destroy this Dáil they are welcome to it, and they will get every possible amount of assistance.  They can easily do it.  If they are going to challenge us to bring this Dáil into contempt, <Col N="835" /> then they can have it brought into contempt.</P>
    <P>I say that the method of conducting business has been a scandal and a shame, and this procedure of trying to rush a Bill of this kind through in the small hours of the morning, and coming here in the afternoon of the day and asking for the suspension of the Standing Orders so that we shall be here again all night, is treating the Dáil scurvily, and without any of the reasonable amount of consideration with which men should be treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the motion for the suspension of the time limit.  It is a motion at any rate that is provided for, and for which the Standing Orders were specially adapted to make provision. The Deputy says we have not good reasons for this particular proposal.  I gave the reasons on the last day, the first day that we moved to sit late.  The reasons were, first, there was a considerable amount of business, and I adhere to that statement.  There is a considerable amount of business.  Some thirteen estimates have not yet been passed, and when they are passed an Appropriation Bill will be necessary, and it will have to be dealt with before the first of August. In addition to that there are other Bills practically ready for introduction, but we must clear the way with regard to this particular measure.  The question is: is this Bill that is now presented a Bill of any importance?  Is it a Bill of urgency, and is it a Bill in connection with which the Deputy, if he were here on these Benches and in the same position as we are, would be free to say &ldquo;I will not have this Bill.&rdquo;  Everybody in the Dáil, and nobody better than the Deputy, knows that if he were here he would have to introduce a Bill not having, perhaps, all the attributes of this particular measure; at any rate he would have to introduce a <Col N="836" /> Bill similar in its main functions, having the same character and embracing the same provisions as there are in this one. If other business be tabled it will delay the passing of this Bill, and the passing of this Bill cannot be delayed.  I quite admit the Dáil has treated the Ministry with every consideration; I have admitted that more than once.  I have admitted that as far as the transaction of ordinary business is concerned, we have been facilitated in every way at any time that we asked to be facilitated.  Deputies are certainly aware of the fact that we had not a free hand with regard to many measures that were brought forward. Some had got to be considered before a certain date; other matters of considerable importance had to be brought forward before they were considered; and there were occasions when we had to ask for special consideration owing to the circumstances of the time.  We are not living in normal times; everybody knows that.  There may be people who say that we are approaching normality.  I quite admit that.  We may have normal conditions now; but, the setting up of a Government to arrange for the laying of a foundation for the future convenience and stability of the State, is a matter of no small difficulty now as compared with a normal period.  While Deputies are perfectly entitled to criticise the Ministry, the Ministry's time has not been sufficient. Twenty-four hours in the day are not sufficient to enable us to deal with present legislation.  The setting up of services required considerable attention. Some had to be constructed from the very foundations, and that work had to be carried on together with the ordinary transaction of the affairs of Government. During that period there have been continuous communications in regard to the financial adjustments and otherwise between the British Government and this country.  I am positively certain that for some time to come, even when a new Government has been elected, such delays are inevitable until really normal conditions are restored, and by normal conditions I mean normal conditions of government, in which it will not be necessary to take up these temporary financial adjustments that have to be made.  The Deputy asks when will the General Election take place.  I can assure him that I am not in a position to say when the General Election will be. <Col N="837" /> I am not in a position to say for two reasons, one of which is very material to the issue.  I do not know at this moment when exactly the Register will be available. We cannot decide when an Election will take place until we have that information.  The other reason is that there are certain Bills to be considered before the General Election.  I do not know that I could give any more satisfactory answer than that, and it does appear to me while the Deputy may feel annoyed, that we have not resented very lengthy discussion on this particular measure.  We have not introduced the closure on this or on any other measure.  I explained that if we did that it would not be necessary for us to ask for those long sittings.  We wish that to this and other Bills the greatest consideration and the most lengthy consideration should be given by the Deputies.  I am sure Deputy Johnson will admit that so far as this is concerned what I have stated is exactly the case.</P>

      <P>The President has asked whether the measure before the Dáil is an important one.  It is. It is so important that plenty of time should be given for its discussion.  What are the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was introduced without half as much notice as any other measure that has been introduced.  It went through its first and second stages.  It came forward for Committee on last Monday, and, as everybody in the Dáil is aware, when it came before the Committee last Monday the Dáil had to adjourn until Tuesday because sufficient notice, even according to the Standing Orders, had not been given for its consideration.  In other words, Monday, legislatively, was largely lost.  I am not attributing blame in any particular direction for that, but nobody knows better than Ministers that three or four weeks ago the Dáil adjourned for two or three days.  No. I am not going to object to an adjournment of that kind, but if there was need for such desperate haste and desperate urgency in the consideration of all these things why not make a better use of the time at the disposal of the Dáil?  I remember that the adjournment was moved on the night of the Second Reading of this Bill, and it was moved for a certain purpose; that purpose was achieved after two days, namely the <Col N="838" /> second two days of the races at the Curragh. There still remained one further Parliamentary day, and it would have been quite possible for the Dáil to have dealt with its legislation on that other day. The consideration of further Estimates was before the Dáil at that time, but they were not reached and we are now told that they must be got through before a particular time, but the Dáil at the request of the Ministry wasted its time, and declined to meet at a time when, according to the opinion of the Ministry, it ought to have met.  Whose fault was that?  Certainly not the fault of those who were endeavouring to carry out their duty by criticising the Bill. With the exception of six or seven people on this side of the Dáil and two or three elsewhere, apart from the Ministers concerned, the Dáil has given little or no consideration to the Bill.  It has simply taken it as it was put before it and it is prepared on the whole to do the same for the future.  Why exactly is it necessary that this thing should be done to-night and at such short notice? Why must you have the measure pass its Committee Stage before to-morrow morning?  What is the business before the Dáil to-morrow?  The talk on the last occasion that this step was taken about the necessity for doing this in a hurry was largely fudge, because no matter how much we hurry the matter here it has still got to go through the Seanad, and the Seanad is not meeting within the next two or three days.  We have got to have the Report Stage before that and also the Final Stage.  You did get two or three days' work squeezed into 21 hours on Thursday night and Friday morning, but I hope that this Dáil will never put itself in the position in which the Seanad has put itself when it squeezed three or four weeks' work into twenty minutes.  The thing is a scandal.  You have got already, and I suggest you take full advantage of it, a docile majority that will vote here whatever the Ministry puts before it without question.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  There has been no attempt unduly to prolong the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have taken some pains to look over the time spent by the various speakers in criticism of the Bill.  I find invariably that they had not taken the full limit of time allowed by the Standing Orders. <Col N="839" /> Those of the Deputies who attend the debates while they are going on know perfectly well, and no one knows it better than the Minister, that those who have been opposing the measure could work out the full limit.  They have not done so; they have confined themselves to speaking at such length as they think necessary for dealing with particular points.  I do not want at all to discuss the Bill or any of its provisions now, but I suggest that it is just as unnecessary to rush this Bill as it is unnecessary to put certain exceptional provisions into the Bill.  On Thursday night the Ministry thought, I presume, that by having an all-night sitting they could wear out the opposition to the Bill, and that legislative consciences were so elastic that after three or four hours' discussion we would be as tractable as the Government majority in the Dáil.  We were not. We were sent here to perform certain duties.  To the best of our ability and judgment we have been performing them and we shall continue to perform those duties, but if there is anything to the discredit of the Dáil, that discredit will not fall on the opposition to the Bill, but will fall on the majority supporting the measure.  Again and again we have noted that the greatest weakness and the biggest fault of this Dáil have been the docility of the majority of the Dáil in regard to whatever is put before them. They consider themselves simply little more than a mere registering machine.</P>
    <P>Long ago, at the height of your crisis, when you were threatened with the overthrowing, not only of this Dáil and of this Ministry, but with the overthrow of the Treaty which brought this Dáil, this Ministry and this Free State into existence, you did things that we had occasion to oppose.  I want to say that, in spite of the bitter opposition on many things we had to give you then, we had such a keen realisation of our duties that, whether personally, politically, or collectively distasteful to us, we took our stand on certain things.  We continue to take that stand, and in the deliberate judgment at least, of one of us, we did a great national service to this State by doing so, because at any moment had we chosen we could have let you remain simply a registering machine&mdash;not a mutual admiration society exactly, but a body that would not even have the <Col N="840" /> courage to be a mutual admiration society, but that would come here day after day, hour after hour, and rush indecently without any consideration, except the consideration given by draftsmen and Ministers, every measure. We did not choose to do so; we took a different line.  We thought it was the duty, at least, of somebody in the Dáil to subject measures that came before the Dáil to scrutiny and examination.  No Minister, and no Deputy supporting the Government can deny that if there came helpful suggestions, if there came useful hints from any side of the Dáil outside the Ministry, they came from those who are opposing this measure, and they only came because those opposing this measure now, and who were criticising and examining previous measures, gave thought and consideration to those measures, examined them line by line, picked out what they thought were their weaknesses, suggested changes that they thought would be useful, helpful, and strengthening to those measures.</P>
    <P>We have done the same with this measure.  We have tried to change it; we have not asked for anything except ordinary consideration.  We have only asked that the Dáil should be treated as a legislative assembly, purely and simply as a deliberative and legislative assembly. If you want it to be something less than that, something quite different, then in honesty and decency you ought to say so, and if anyone has an objection to your change of mind, to your change of policy, to your new conception of what the Dáil ought to be, then those who have such objections can consider their position and decide whether they will or will not support you by continuing to take part in the proceedings.  In theory you have deliberately chosen that this should be a deliberative and legislative assembly.  We have endeavoured to help in making it so, and now, because you are piqued, because you are disappointed and vexed like children at school, because you cannot get your own way in everything, then you must have all night sittings.  Perhaps it is not so much that we would object to you voting as a block; you are quite entitled to do it.  It is the custom, more or less, and the practice of such assemblies as this to do that.  But your greatest sin in this Dáil has been your absolute indifference to discussion.</P>

      <P>The greatest sin and weakness of the Dáil has been that Deputies have refused to discuss certain things.  Certain things were stated in the Press about the last all-night sitting, many of them incorrect.  Can anyone deny that throughout this discussion you were not engaged in deliberating at all until the division bell rang?  If you desire that there should be no division bells rung, that the Ministry should be allowed to do just as they please, if the Dáil desires that that should be the state of affairs let the Ministry say so, and some of us, at all events, will do our best to accommodate them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken seems to take so much delight in bouquets being thrown that, in default of their being thrown by others, he throws bouquets to himself and to his Party, and it would be a pity not to add to his gratification by throwing a further bouquet from the Independent benches.  It is true that, in these days of strain to which he refers so feelingly, it was unnecessary to force attendance in the Dáil during the long sittings, because in these days the patriotism of the Deputy and his Party exhibited itself conspicuously.  There was no attempt to speak out lengthened speeches in wearisome detail, but there was a desire to be helpful, and to make the proposed measures more useful and more effective for their intended purpose. I was present throughout the greater part of the sitting of Thursday night and Friday morning.</P>

      <P>I was present. Does the Deputy suggest that my mind was not working?  He went out of his way to be offensive to many of us, and declared that, because we did not join in the childish amusements in which he indulged himself, that therefore we were not taking a serious view of the position. He spoke just now of &ldquo;We.&rdquo;  Nothing amazed me, who sat through that nightlong debate, so much as the word indicative of unity regarding his Party.  A little after 5 o'clock in the morning on Friday the Deputy himself <Col N="842" /> was engaged in the rôle of enacting the &ldquo;fat boy&rdquo; from Dickens, trying to make our flesh creep with the details of the horrors and the agony of whipping, as described in some book which he read, and, only a little time before, his ostensible leader was reading from another book a passage to show that the Recorder of Liverpool had found, by experience, that instead of whipping being mediæval without chivalry, that it was a punishment which held so little dread for those who were expecting it, that they asked for it in preference to lengthy terms of imprisonment.  The leader of the Party told us that the attitude of the expectant convict was pretty much that of a child towards cod liver oil as we see it depicted in newspaper advertisements.  The children look at it, and ask for more; and &ldquo;we,&rdquo; the same Party, ask us to believe that this is such a horrible, barbarous, and nefarious punishment that it is a disgrace to civilisation to attempt to impose it upon men who have as little regard for civilisation as they have for their parole.  Deputy Johnson says we have no need for haste.  I speak for myself, personally, and as they have advanced their considerations for personal comfort without stating it explicitly, I advance mine.  I want a summer holiday, and I do not see why I should be obliged to sit here, day after day, and week after week, listening to Deputy A. proposing that the figure 21 should be changed to 23, and then when that is defeated, another member of his Party, after speaking for the third time for 10 or 15 minutes, proposes that the number should be changed to 19.  There ought to be some consideration not merely for the members of the Dáil, but for the discharge of public business.  It was a Deputy in the front benches of his own Party who proposed that we should sit to 8 a.m.  We all rose to the suggestion.  No sooner did he indicate the desire of his Party to sit until 8 a.m. than the majority immediately voted to sit until that hour. Now, he complains that it is an effort to wear them down.  There is the legislative programme to be considered.  We have been promised a Bill to which I am looking forward with great interest, and I would prefer to go without a holiday than to miss that Bill&mdash;the Ministries' Bill.  That has been dangled before our eyes for quite a considerable period, and we are living in expectation of it.  There is also the Bill to deal with the Constitution <Col N="843" /> of the Judiciary System.  Then there is the Army Bill, and several other Bills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is absurd&mdash;I have already called it offensive&mdash;but it is absurd to suggest that those of us who voted for this measure voted with blind acquiescence, that we did what we understood not.  Deputy O'Shannon complained that I was silent.  Would anything that I could have said have altered his vote or the vote of any member of his party?  The fact is that we are all quite alive to the necessity of getting this Bill passed, and the fewer speeches made upon it the better where they are merely damnable reiteration, to quote a famous eighteenth century phrase. For my part I am prepared to remain for four or five consecutive all-night sittings rather than have the Bill blocked by lengthy discussion of immaterial details.</P>

      <P>I am afraid my friend, Deputy Magennis, has attached too much gravity, and too much seriousness to the situation.  I am quite sure Deputy O'Shannon did not intend to be taken seriously when, in the words of Deputy Magennis, he presented himself and those acting with him with a very elaborate bouquet.  It is some months ago since I complimented Deputies on the other side in belonging to the legitimate section of the opposition of this assembly, and I see nothing in the recent discussion that would induce me to qualify that compliment.  We have been told on this side of the Dáil that we vote in block.  The proceedings, especially on the discussion of this Bill, will show where the best examples are to be found of voting in block.</P>

      <P>I am quite willing to give way to the Deputy if he wishes to make another speech.  I do not know whether, in any dictionary of the English language, it will be found that the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;deliberation&rdquo; which have been used in regard to this Bill contain anything, in their definition, to indicate that they consist in making speeches. Certainly for my part I find I can consider best when I am silent, and I often consider better, than otherwise, when other people are silent also.</P>

      <P>The same, I think, applies to &ldquo;deliberation.&rdquo;  I am not going to deny that it is possible to think that all the things that the section on the other side of the Dáil have said are true, and that they have all the virtues, as we are told, and that we have all the vices.  It is possible to think of the meaning of the things that they say; but the suggestion before us now is that if we had a day's interval, upon each occasion, so that by this time to-morrow we would have fully appreciated the weight and the merit of the things Deputies have said to us to-day, then we would have proceeded with due deliberation; but that it is impossible to come to a conclusion on the same afternoon on the merits, or, at all events, if we sit continuously for an evening, it is not deliberation, whereas if we break up our discussion into junks of three or four hours it would allow ample time for everything to sink deeply into our minds, and that that is deliberation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we are told we are proceeding with undue haste, which means that we are not allowing the arguments presented to us to sink into our minds.  Some further things have been suggested.  It certainly has been suggested in some of the interruptions, if it has not been suggested in any of the responsible speeches made on the opposite side, that the Ministry, in some way or other, has been introducing deliberate delay <Col N="846" /> into its legislative programme.  We have been told, in an interruption, that certain things brought forward in the legislative programme were not intended to be passed before the elections, and in another interruption that they were being dangled.</P>
      <P>We have not been told in any responsible speech, nor has any responsible speech been made from any quarter of the Dáil that the members of the Ministry here were wasting time, that they were delaying legislation, that they were deliberately imposing obstacles or delays in the way of their own legislation.  If we were told that, I think we, and every person who has a true appreciation of the facts, would receive the suggestion with amusement.  Only one other point in regard to what the Deputy said.  He made a further suggestion&mdash;I will not deal with the things which I hope were not said with any view to provoking acrimony &mdash;a suggestion that the only people who think, who deliberate and consider, are those who presented so frequently on the last sitting on this Bill, the number thirteen in the divisions.  Those are the only people in the Dáil who think, who deliberate and who consider, and the people who sit on this side of the Dáil are a docile flock who vote <i>en masse</i>, who do exactly what the Ministry desire, and whom I suppose the Ministry never consults on any point.  The other suggestion which brings me to where I began&mdash;that Deputy Professor Magennis has taken the matter far too seriously&mdash;was the suggestion that in making the proposal to have a prolonged sitting, on the previous occasion, or on this occasion, our object is to wear down the opposition.  I am one of the oldest men in this assembly.  I do not know, looking around, that I could count on the powerful physique on this side of the Dáil wearing down the puny material resources of, shall I say, Deputy O'Connell, or Deputy Davin.  I do not know that we could count on our powers of holding out against the miserable resources that are at the command of these gentlemen.  I wonder really whether Deputy O'Shannon meant that to be taken seriously, or whether Deputy Professor Magennis was justified in taking that and some of the other remarks he made quite so seriously as he did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather refreshing to find that the silence of Deputy Professor <Col N="847" /> Magennis has been broken at last, by giving expression to the opinion that the speeches on this side of the Dáil were damnable reiteration.  If they were of such a character as Deputy Magennis describes them, I wonder how he can explain that the records of that particular debate show that 17 amendments had been accepted from this side of the Dáil, and several others had been promised consideration.  That is proof, at any rate, that the first statement made by Deputy Professor Magennis is not altogether correct.  The President has asked whether or not this is to be considered as a Bill of importance.  It certainly is not one of the fourteen Bills that he handed to us in a list some considerable time ago.  Many of the Bills which were on that list have been pressed for by various members of this Dáil, as being important and meaning a good deal to many people outside.  The President's question is answered by the fact that no speeches have been made from his own side of the Dáil in support of the Bill, or against even any amendments that have been put up.  When the first all night sitting was proposed, Deputy Sean Milroy suggested that it was inhuman to make any such proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement he made was that human nature could not stand it.  I remember distinctly sitting here for hours during that long night and seeing the effect of the all night sitting on Deputy Sean Milroy, that he anticipated. I think that could be said of others of Deputy Milroy's party, and the proportion who suffered in that way was considerably more than those who suffered on this side of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the pleasure of hearing the interruption. I suppose it is an attempt at a joke, on account of the smiles on the faces of the people who sit around Deputy Whelehan.  I think it has not been contended, even by the Minister, who has <Col N="848" /> been the only member of the Government party who has taken any strong line of action in opposing the amendments from this side of the Dáil, that the amendments were ridiculous.  They have at any rate, so far as we are concerned, in the most important Bill that has been introduced, been put up in order to make the Bill more acceptable than what we thought it was when presented with the backing of his own party.  I am quite certain that the Bill is not being rushed for the purposes of giving an exhibition of flogging, because the Recorder of Dublin has provided for that by a decision he gave in a case on Friday last.  Therefore, there can be no suggestion that there is any hurry from that point of view, as the existing law makes provision for dealing with people committing the offences that are mentioned in the particular Clause of the Bill.</P>
      <P>After all, Deputies on this side of the Dáil, though they may be few, are entitled to some consideration with regard to the effect of several all-night sittings.  They should be taken into consideration by the Committee on procedure, or by whatever other Committee is responsible for the arrangement of these Bills, before a motion, such as is now made by the Minister, is sprung upon them.  Some Deputies live a long distance from these premises, and they should be made aware before they come here that they will be expected to sit out the night.  This information is only given to the Minister's own colleagues and those who sit behind him.  Some provision should be made by which notice would be given of a motion of this kind before we are asked to vote for it in the hurried way in which it is now presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEAN MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct a statement made by the last speaker.  He said that the motions are known only to the Minister, and those who sit behind him.  I happen to sit behind the Minister, as well as stand behind him, and I had no more knowledge of this proposal than the Deputies on the other side.  I am not making any grievance of it, but before I proceed further I would like to call the attention of the Dáil to the very generous tribute which the last speaker paid to the Government. He said the Government had accepted 17 amendments from their side, and promised consideration to others.  Is that an attempt at ruthless legislation? <Col N="849" /> Does that not indicate that the Ministerial mind was open to receive any helpful suggestion made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I made the statement referred to in order to prove the necessity for putting up these amendments.  Some of them were not accepted until they had been spoken to three times from this side of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows that the Ministerial mind is not so impervious to arguments as some of the Deputies have been trying to prove.  I think a party that can succeed in getting 17 amendments accepted by a Minister in the short time this Bill has been in Committee must be a party that can congratulate itself on its legislative powers of persuasion.  The Deputy made some allusion to the statement I made the last day.  The statement I made that day I do not wish to retract.  The original motion was, I think, that the Dáil should sit not later than 4.30 o'clock.</P>

      <P>The motion of Deputy O'Brien, without any suggestion that the Deputies should get overtime, was that the hour be extended until 8 o'clock. I think in this matter we have even a greater grievance than the dockers who have gone on strike to-day.  What occurred to me, under those circumstances was, that having secured an extension of four hours in the morning, the suggestion of Deputy Johnson to adjourn prior to the discussion was not one of an extravagant nature.  But the Ministry know their legislative time-table, and they know their position with regard to the matters they want to get through, and I bow to their decision.  There is no doubt at all about the urgency of this Bill.  If those phases of the Bill that have evoked torrents of denunciation from the other side of the Dáil are so heinous, then I want to know why some Deputies on the other side of the Dáil have not risen to move the adjournment or given notice to raise on the adjournment a question calling attention to the decision of the Recorder the other day.  That has evoked no horror&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to be out of order.  Another argument has been put forward by another opponent of this motion.  The Deputy who spoke last said he saw evidence of the fatigue of the last night's sitting upon myself.  Undoubtedly. It took me a good while to recover from the fatigue of that night, but I do not regret having sat here if it expedited the Bill.  I am prepared to indulge in twice as much fatigue to-night if necessary. The Deputy also made an interesting point which I would like to emphasise&mdash; that this is an attempt to wear down the other side of the Chamber.  He simply endorsed the observations of Deputy Professor MacNeill, the Minister for Education.  He said although he saw evidence of weariness on this side of the Dáil there was no evidence of weariness on the other side.  Evidently it is impossible to do anything to wear down the Deputies on the other side, and, therefore, they have adduced no argument to show that this proposal is an undue strain upon them, whatever it may be upon the delicate physique of the Deputies who are sitting or standing behind the Government.</P>

      <P>The sum and substance of the objection by Deputy Johnson to this motion was that it was brought forward without due notice to Deputies.  When we came here on Thursday we were told that there would be an all-night sitting.  That was the first of it that the Deputies on this side heard and from the statement made by Deputy Milroy that was the first other Deputies heard of it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we went through that all-night sitting and we met here on Friday.  On the occasion of the adjournment on Friday there was no word and nothing to indicate that there would be another all-night sitting to-night.  Why was it not moved then that there should be an all-night sitting to-night?  If that were done, as far as I am concerned, it would remove a considerable portion of my objection.  I do not like to be brought here, having arranged for other business, as many of us have to do, after <Col N="851" /> 8.30 p.m., and then be told on coming here that we will have to sit until 6 o'clock in the morning.  If I was told to-day that there would be another all-night sitting to-morrow night my objection would not be so strong as it is to this motion.  We heard three Ministers and two or three other Deputies speaking in favour of the motion, but <Col N="852" /> one and all kept clear of that point, the sum and substance of Deputy Johnson's objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Section, as drawn, appears to me to be somewhat vaguely expressed.  I may say that this is one of the few sections of the Bill with which I have sympathy, understanding as I do that it is directed against looters, and I appreciate the propriety in present circumstances of putting upon the looter, to some extent, the onus of proving his innocence instead of following the ordinary method. But the actual wording which has been adopted will leave the law very uncertain, and if it is necessary in normal times that the law should be certain, it is much more necessary when exceptional powers are being taken that those powers should be very clearly defined.  The Dáil is asked to agree that every person charged before a Justice with having in his possession or on his premises property which may reasonably be suspected of having been stolen, or unlawfully obtained, should give an account to the satisfaction of the Justice of the manner in which he came by the same.  A subsequent amendment proposes that the prosecutor should prove certain essentials first, before the alleged delinquent is called upon to prove anything.  I have, however, been obliged to put this amendment in before the next one because it deals with wording which comes earlier in the Section than the words after which I propose to put the other amendment.  To say that a District Justice must be satisfied as to how A.B. came by certain property is to say a thing which is very vague and indefinite.  One District Justice might interpret &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; in one way, another in another.  The District Justice, be his intentions what they may, is not given any precise direction by the law as to what his duty in the matter may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The satisfaction of the District Justice.&rdquo; The Dáil will see at once that that is a very wide term and capable of varied interpretations.  I ask the Dáil and Ministers to agree that it is not reasonable that the matter should be left in language so loose as that.  The Dáil will see at once that the wording of the Section as drawn lends itself to a further objection.  I do not know if it is intended that the alleged delinquent should have the power to appeal. He certainly should have, because it is desirable that the general law in these matters should be departed from as little as possible, and the stolen property will already have been reconveyed to its owner under Section 7, so that when Section 9, with which we are now <Col N="855" /> dealing comes into operation, the only question will be whether or not the alleged delinquent is the guilty party.</P>
    <P>There can, I think, be no reason why there should not be an appeal from the decision of the District Justice as in other cases.  The wording adopted by the mover of the measure seems to me to go a long way to take away that appeal because the appellant is likely to be told that the Appeal Judge cannot inquire as to the &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; of the District Justice.  That is a subjective matter, in the same kind of way as if a matter is left to the discretion of a court, and there can be no appeal from that discretion. I want to put in words which will make the matter of decision objective. I fancy it will be agreed that precisely the same result is obtained by saying that the alleged delinquent must adduce satisfactory evidence that he had no intention to defraud.  The question on appeal, as to whether or not the evidence which he adduced proved what he wished it to prove, to entitle him to get off, is an objective question upon which a court would be entitled to pronounce. I think that will be clear to anybody who has compared the two phrases.  Therefore, for those two reasons, which I need not go into at any great length, I greatly hope that the amendment will be accepted to the objectionable wording, that the alternative will be accepted&mdash;first, because the original wording leaving the matter to the satisfaction of the District Justice is clearly too vague for a punitive law, and secondly, if there be, as I submit there should be, a right of appeal, the test upon the appeal should depend on some such subjective matter as the character of the evidence adduced, rather than upon the District Justice's opinion of the evidence given.</P>

      <P>The wording of this Section is taken from the Dublin Police Act, and I submit if the wording is bad, the Deputy's amendment does not improve it; it does not improve it even from the point of view of the argument which he has himself adduced in support of the amendment.  It is objected that the present wording leaves the matter subjective&mdash;&ldquo;shall not give an account to the satisfaction of such District Justice&rdquo;&mdash;and that in the Appeal Court they could not inquire into the question of whether the District Justice was satisfied <Col N="856" /> or not.  The use, in the amendment, of the words &ldquo;satisfactory evidence,&rdquo; is open to the same objection.  &ldquo;The evidence is to be satisfactory.&rdquo;  Satisfactory to whom?  Satisfactory to the District Justice?  I am not disposed to accept the amendment.  The present wording is contained in an Act which has been in force for a long time, and which has been found perfectly satisfactory.  It has passed the test of our own experts in drafting it, and I see no reason to change it.  Even on the grounds that Deputy Duffy has himself advanced, the amendment is not an improvement on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Satisfactory <i>in se</i>.  The Appeal Court will judge.  Under the Dublin Police Act there is an appeal.  I invite the attention of the Attorney-General to the considerable difficulties that have occurred in deciding whether or not there is an appeal in statutes passed subsequently, where the statute itself says nothing about an appeal.  That particular matter runs right through the Act in the penal sections.  The question as to whether or not it is intended the District Justice's decision should be final is not made clear, and if an appeal is intended I suggest it is very desirable that it should be made quite clear by express wording.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Duffy suggest that a District Justice is a peculiar type of magistrate who would be satisfied by something that falls short of satisfactory evidence?  The distinction that he has drawn between what is satisfactory to a particular individual and the more objective thing called evidence which would be deemed to be satisfactory to every right-minded and dispassionate man is undoubtedly a valid and well-known distinction.  But to apply it here, I suggest it would be necessary to show that the words &ldquo;to the satisfaction <Col N="857" /> of the District Justice&rdquo; include, and could be permitted to include, some sort of subjective appeal, something which would influence the mind of the particular District Justice and would, of its nature, be inoperative with regard to any other hearer of the case.  Those words &ldquo;to the satisfaction of&rdquo; occur in many statutes, and are always deemed to mean precisely what Deputy Duffy says in more explicit language.  The magistrate is to be satisfied by evidence, and the evidence which is good for him would be good for any other person presiding over a tribunal.  It seems to me that while, from the point of view of a metaphysician, the words of Deputy Gavan Duffy are better, yet through old-established customs and practices, as there is no ambiguity in the phrase which he seeks to amend, possession being nine-tenths of the law, the phrase ought to stand.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that, before any person charged under this section shall be required to adduce evidence on his own behalf, it shall be incumbent on the prosecutor to prove (a) that the property, the subject of the charge, is of the value of £10 at the least; (b) that there is reasonable ground for believing that property to have been taken by way of loot or plunder since the 1st day of July, 1922; and (c) that the said property is, or has at some time since the time when it is believed to have been taken, been in the possession or on the premises of the person charged.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a further attempt to improve the section, which I say is one with which I have sympathy.  Now, there are three distinct things there which I seek to have put upon the prosecutor as matter to be proved before ever he calls upon the defendant to go into the witness-box.  First of all, that the property is worth £10 at least.  Why? Because we do not want people to be harassed with trivial prosecutions on allegations of loot.  We do not want, and I hope the Dáil does not want, to see this exceptional procedure adopted at all except in cases of a certain seriousness.  I should myself have been inclined to put a higher figure than £10, but I put £10 in the hope that I might the more easily get some assent to the proposal.  I think <Col N="858" /> it must be generally agreed that for trivial items of loot it is not worth while to be putting into force a section of this kind.  Secondly, one does not want to infringe upon the very proper and necessary principle that the onus must be on the prosecutor, except in the least possible degree, and even when you are charging an assumed looter there is a risk that the charge may be unsustainable.  I want to guard against the possibility that your ordinary thief, who steals because he is starving, may be prosecuted under this section.  As the sole justification for the section is the necessity of dealing with loot by special means, I ask that the prosecutor should be compelled to prove that there is, in fact, reasonable ground for believing that the property in question had been looted since the civil war began. Lastly, it is also right that the prosecution should prove affirmatively that the man whom they charged with loot has in fact at some time since the property disappeared been in possession of it or had it on his premises.  If those three items are conceded, I speak for myself in saying that I am quite in sympathy with the proposals that the looter properly so-called shall be made to discharge the onus which then properly will lie upon him. If those concessions are not made, then I think the section is objectionable, because it is too liable to be used against persons who are not looters properly so-called, and it does not put upon the prosecutor the onus which I think ought to be undoubtedly his in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to accept the amendment.  The Deputy says that if the amendment were accepted he would be in complete sympathy with the section.  But in fact the amendment conflicts rather radically with the whole tenour and purpose of the section by shifting the onus of proof quite definitely to the prosecutor, whereas the object of the section is, where there is suspicion that a particular piece of property is not properly in the possession of the person, that such person should be asked to state in what manner he came by it, and he should be asked to give a satisfactory account of his possession of that article of property to the District Justice.  It is, as I say, only an extension to the country of something that has been for a long time contained in the Dublin Police Acts.  The Deputy's amendment demands that there should be a <Col N="859" /> limit to the value&mdash;that below a minimum of £10 there should be no action taken under this section.  I do not know what the Deputy's standards are, but it seems to me that £9 worth of loot is not exactly a trivial matter even in those days when loot has been carried on in the grand manner, and I see no sufficient reason for accepting a value limit at all, whether £10 or £9 or £8 or £5.  It is a time when there has been a good deal of indiscriminate looting.  An article worth £2 or £3 taken from a poor man's house is not a trifling matter, and it certainly is not so trifling that the State ought not to take the fullest measures and the strongest steps to trace it, and, if possible, to restore it.  Now, the next thing asked in the amendment is that the prosecution should show that there is a reasonable ground for thinking that that property has been taken by loot, plundered since July, 1922.  In that portion of the amendment there are two grounds asked&mdash;reasonable grounds for satisfying that the property was taken by loot, and a time limit back to the 1st of July last year.  We would not accept that portion of the amendment, because reasonable ground for belief falls little short of proof. If the prosecution has to show in Court that there are reasonable grounds for belief, and if it is able to show it, then there is little reason why proceedings should not be taken under the existing code&mdash; under the Larceny Acts.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should visualise the situation in the country that we are attempting to cope with. In certain counties a great many residences were burned.  Somehow it became known before they were burned that the burning was about to take place, and they were broken into and indiscriminately looted.  This section is meant to cover the case where a man is found to be in possession of property out of all proportion to his means and to his circumstances of life, and it asks that in a case of that kind that it should be possible to demand that he give a reasonable account of how he came by such property. I gave instances here in the Dáil <Col N="860" /> of people whose houses were visited, people in a humble way of life&mdash;cottiers &mdash;and costly candlesticks, trousers presses, gilt mirrors and articles of that kind were found in the houses.  We should have power in a case of extreme suspicion to ask how that property came into the possession of the holder.  That is what that section does.  I do not feel that the limitations which the Deputy asks for in his amendment are proper or ought to be inserted, least of all the one dated back to July, 1922.  If there is to be a time limit it ought not to be July, 1922.  In fact, there was probably more loot in the first six months of last year, before we came to the decision to grapple with the situation, than since July, 1922.  Whole areas in the country were effectively in the occupation of the Irregulars.  They were supreme there.  Their will, supported by their guns, was unchallenged, and areas like Tipperary and certain areas in Connaught suffered very severely during that period, and there was a great deal of property stolen.  There can be no question of placing the time limit back to the 1st July last year, and I see no sufficient reason for accepting a time limit at all.  It would be impossible, if one came across a case of a man in very humble circumstances in possession of a particularly elaborate piece of property&mdash;perhaps a piano or, as I say, one of these gilt mirrors&mdash;even approximately to place the date at which that was looted or stolen, while there would be, of course, a reasonable suspicion that it had been looted.  It is setting too big a task to a prosecution to say that they must advance reasonable grounds for saying that it was stolen since the 1st July last.  I am afraid I do not quite catch the drift of (c) in the amendment, because action of this kind would be taken only against a person in whose possession property was actually found.  I think I would ask the Deputy to give me some further enlightenment on the effect of (c), and in what way it supplements the section I am moving.</P>

He is entitled to stay there and to say to the prosecutor, &ldquo;Prove your case.&rdquo;  He cannot be made to go into the box and be submitted to cross-examination except under this new method of putting on him the onus of proving his innocence, and, in endeavouring to prove his innocence of the particular charge against him he lays himself, under cross-examination, open to some other charge upon which he can be indicted on his own evidence.  That seems to me to be going very much too far.  He is not only compelled to prove his innocence under this Bill, but his very endeavour to do so may result in a prosecution against him on some other charge.

It is then discovered that he was in that place on that date, and then he can be indicted for some other crime, and the evidence which he has given can be used against him to prove that he was in that place for the purpose of the other crime, and to prevent him from giving evidence of an alibi or something of that sort, and saving themselves the trouble of proving that he was there.

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Gavan Duffy will make his case, and then I shall finish.  My difficulty is, the Deputy accuses me of contradicting myself in effect, and without his assistance I cannot see that.  I say when in ordinary administration an accused person taking up the position of a witness is not obliged to commit himself, I say when you apply that doctrine, which is a reasonable humane doctrine, to the type of case for which this legislation is meant, you are qualifying it with an element of humanitarianism.  Does Deputy Gavan Duffy dispute that?  I hold in those special circumstances that that element of qualification should be omitted.  I think, however, the two Deputies have in their own minds a case they have not stated.  I can conceive two different positions here.  &ldquo;A&rdquo; volunteers to give evidence. He is a prisoner; the ordinary operation of the law of evidence would not be used against him in a further case. Now we pass to the emergency legislation, and we will assume this is an Act, and that a man is being charged before a Court or District Justice with having in his possession or on his premises, with his knowledge, something reasonably suspect of being stolen or being unlawfully obtained.  He is called upon to give a satisfactory account of how he came to be in possession of this.  Suppose he is found guilty, that is one case.  Suppose he proves his innocence, that is another case.  Supposing, in proving his innocence of having stolen something, he allows something to transpire which is capable of being employed against him as evidence later.  Deputy FitzGibbon considers that that is objectionable.  Suppose, however, the evidence he brought forward did not clear him of the charge under Section 9, and that notwithstanding the evidence he gives he is found <Col N="865" /> guilty of being in possession of loot. Now, I would like the Deputy to address himself to this question.  Is the evidence not fairly to be used against him on a further charge of further guilt?  Why are we to have such soft hearts for criminals in this particular conjuncture?  I have some sympathy with a man who, when he is charged with the offence of being in the possession of loot, not only having loot in his house, clears himself of that charge and escapes imprisonment for twelve months, with or without hard labour, by evidence he adduces in his own favour.</P>
      <P>If that evidence would have the effect of involving him in further punishment, having escaped by virtue of the present punishment, I could have some sympathy with him.  But suppose, as I have already put it, that, notwithstanding the evidence he has adduced, and, I assume it to be true, he is found guilty of this charge, I see no reason why, because he is found guilty of this charge, he should not be found guilty of other charges.  In other words, I think if a man is found to be possessed of loot, and renders himself liable under this emergency legislation to this punishment, he <i>ipso facto</i> divests himself of any sympathy or to any application in that special sense of mercy that I have used on the part of the District Justice.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything in favour of my own amendment, because I feel it is utterly useless to argue any of these matters in this Bill.  Surely it is plain to anybody who considers the matter that it is not fair or ordinary justice to compel a man to go into the witness-box, on pain of being sent to prison, because he is suspected of having a piano or a chicken, and when you have got him there to prove himself completely innocent of the charge, counsel for the prosecution cross-examines him, and in the course of cross-examination discovers he is guilty of aiding or abetting, assisting, or in any way encouraging the commission of one of the numerous offences set out in this Schedule, then you prosecute him with a view to flogging him or with a view to sending him to prison under Schedule 1, or under any one of the other sections of the Bill. You put him in the position that he himself must go into the witness-box and expose himself to your cross-examination, and having extracted from him proof of <Col N="866" /> his own innocence upon a charge, you will be entitled, according to this law, if it becomes a law, to say, &ldquo;Now that we have it out of your own mouth that you did something else, we will rely upon your <i>ipsissima verba</i> to prove you guilty of the charge.&rdquo;  What is his answer?  He has got none.  If the Minister thinks that fair, then he should have the same clause in every one of the previous sections dealing with arson, or else say, in connection with every offence, that each person shall be presumed to be guilty until he proves himself innocent.  If that is the law, let it be stated openly.  I cannot see any reason why you should not have an identical provision, or sub-section, in every clause of the Bill imposing a penalty. If it be right to make a man go into the witness-box where he will be subject to cross-examination just because he is suspected of having looted property, and then to use what he says in the witness-box, where he is under compulsion, against him on any conceivable charge, just because it is called loot, then it is equally right to make him go into the witness-box first before you prove anything at all against him on any other charge whatsoever.  If I am wrong, I should be very much interested to know where the subtle distinction lies between what is right in one case and not in the other.</P>

We cannot accept that.  The Deputy said Deputy Magennis was contradicting himself.  There seems to be an epidemic of this sort. The Deputy's amendment is to the effect that no statements made by a person under this section shall be used against him in any subsequent criminal prosecution, but in the next breath he says he may be prosecuted for perjury.

      <P>Then I take it we are to accept this rather startling proposition&mdash;I merely asked that it be noted for record&mdash;that the Ministerial view is that any man charged upon suspicion is a man who ought to be presumed guilty until he proves his innocence.  Any man charged on suspicion under this section will be presumed to be guilty until he proves his innocence; ergo any man charged upon suspicion of an offence, under another section, should likewise be presumed to be guilty until he proves his innocence.  I challenge the Minister to put that plainly into the Bill at its next stage.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Gavan Duffy would glory in the result if the Ministry were to write themselves down as hopeless imbeciles.  That is the usual trick of the <i>nisi prius</i> performer. Why is the doctrine of Section 9 to be made law universally?  This section deals with the commission of one particular form of crime which has become very prevalent in the country of late. One man loots a house and takes possession of the loot before another man burns it.  &ldquo;A B&rdquo; is charged with being in possession of property reasonably suspected of being looted, we know very well what these words connote.  We know very well what the people living in the district mean by an expression of this sort: &ldquo;That is my piano, that is my mirror, or that is my armchair, and I recognise it.&rdquo; How are you, in the special circumstances which prevail in the district where looting was prevalent recently, and arson following on the looting which preceded it&mdash;how are you to prove by witnesses who will not come forward, as they used to in the ordinary course, these things in view of the fact that we have recently the evidence of Captain McGarry that he could establish certain things only that the witnesses dare not, for fear of their lives, come into Court to give evidence? When these are the regnant circumstances of the times, how are the ends of justice to be met?  Let a man who has property deemed to be loot in his possession show either of two things&mdash; that it is not in his possession as loot, or <Col N="868" /> that it came into his possession in some way that left him innocent, in view of this emergency legislation.</P>

      <P>I rise to a point of order.  We have already dealt in two previous amendments with the matter to which the Deputy is now addressing himself.  I submit, with all respect, that the matter that was before the Dáil, and is still before it, is whether or not a prosecutor is entitled to use, on a subsequent trial, evidence given by a prisoner in a previous trial under this sub-section, and not the question whether the machinery provided by the section is correct.</P>

      <P>The point under discussion is Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment, and the egregious thing which he alleges, by way of argument, in support of it.  I submit that that is the subject which is under discussion&mdash;Deputy Gavan Duffy's proposed amendment in the interests of humanity, justice, fair play, and all the fine things for which there would be applause outside.  I am entitled to show that the purpose of this Bill, and particularly of this section, would be defeated by an amendment of this type if it were made operative. When the onus is put upon the man charged to show that he does not come under this section, in his effort to clear himself he may make it obvious that he is guilty of some other offence.  According to Deputy Gavan Duffy, the law is to be applied to him as it used to be in the case of a dog.  The dog was allowed one bite, and somehow this man is to be allowed one offence.  The State would never have found out that he was a guilty man only that he happened to find it necessary, in his own behalf, to inform them of the fact, and because in his own interest, in his own defence, he informs the State of the fact that he is guilty of such and such an offence, the State is now asked to say to him, &ldquo;Because you have so informed us, you may go free.&rdquo; We hear a lot about childishness and puerilities, but surely that argument is to expect us to declare, in favour of this Bill, that it is something of emergency legislation called for by a particularly objectionable state of affairs regnant in the country, and then to turn around and make it ordinary procedure of ordinary normal, quiet, law-abiding times.</P>

      <P>(1)  If and whenever an Executive Minister shall satisfy a District Justice that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that any sum of money standing to the credit of any person in the books of any bank or similar institution is, or represents, or is directly or indirectly derived from</P>
      <P>(a)  any stolen property or funds; or</P>

      <P>(2)  Whenever an order is made by a District Justice under this section prohibiting the dealing with any sum of money, the Minister for Finance shall give public notice by advertisement or otherwise of such prohibition, and unless within a time to be limited by such notice (not being less than one month) or such extended time as the Minister for Finance shall allow, some person proves to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that such sum of money belongs to him and is not and does not represent and is not directly or indirectly derived from</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  If within such time or extended time as is mentioned in the foregoing <Col N="871" /> sub-section any person proves to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance the matters mentioned in the foregoing sub-section, the Minister for Finance shall certify in writing that the order made by the District Justice under this section in respect of such sum of money may be discharged, and upon production of such certificate to a District Justice such District Justice shall discharge such order.</P>
    <P>(4)  A certificate given by the Minister for Finance under this section certifying the forfeiture of any sum of money shall operate to vest in the Minister for Finance, as from the time of the production of such certificate to the bank or institution in whose books the sum of money aforesaid is standing, the whole of such sum of money.</P>

    <P>The effect of the amendment is that money can only be forfeited on the certicate of the Minister for Finance.  In the clause it is provided that, on the certificate or order of the District Justice, the money shall be transferred to the Minister for Finance.  The effect of the amendment is that the order of the District Justice will only have the effect of holding up the money, so that it could not be finally forfeited without the certificate of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down some amendments to the Clause as it originally stood, and they will substantially fit in with the newly-drafted Clause.  The object of them is to get the District Justice out of the matter altogether, and for this reason.  The great charge always brought forward against Judges of all ranks, and particularly against those of the lower ranks in the Judicial hierarchy, in the past was that they were the tools, and very often the willing tools, of the Executive of the day.  You have set up a system of District Justices which I have heard from various parts of the country is working very well, because it has the confidence <Col N="872" /> of the people.  I fear that if this section were passed in the form in which it is drawn you would bring upon these very Justices, who are now doing well, the very charge that used to be brought against their predecessors, that in certain cases they are nothing but the tools of the Executive.  I am quite certain that when the farmers of this Bill put in the beginning of this section that it should be the duty of the Executive Minister to satisfy the District Justice that there was reasonable ground for suspecting that money standing to the credit of any person in a bank represented directly or indirectly money derived from stolen property, their object was to interpose, between the Executive and the subject, the action of a &ldquo;Judicial Officer.&rdquo; That, I think, was a very high-minded and proper attitude for them to take up, but I am asking them to delete the &ldquo;Judicial Officer,&rdquo; because on reflection I think they will see themselves that he performs no Judicial office at all; he merely registers the will of a particular Executive Minister, and for this reason he has no right to hear the other side.  He has no right to cross-examine the Executive Minister who makes the case before him, and therefore he will, in fact, merely register the will of the Executive Minister.  The Executive Minister will come before him with a statutory declaration, affidavit or report, or whatever the proper procedure may be, and the District Justice will read it, and it will be his duty then to make the order asked for by the Minister. There is no appeal to the District Justice.  If that order is accurate, if anyone wants to challenge it, it is to the Minister they must go.  They do not come back to the &ldquo;Judicial Officer.&rdquo; The Minister merely appears before him and goes through what, in the ordinary Police Courts, would be the swearing of an information, and the order is made accordingly and is issued at once.  If District Justices are compelled to do that they will be held up through the country as merely the tools of the Executive, and I ask the Minister not to put that upon them.  The amendment that I put forward does not embarrass the Minister at all; it merely enables the Executive Minister to make an order himself without going through the form of applying to the District Justices.  It is the merest form in the circumstances, and therefore the amendment that I <Col N="873" /> move is to leave out the words &ldquo;satisfy a District Justice,&rdquo; and simply say that if and whenever an Executive Minister shall be satisfied that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the money is stolen money, he may make an order himself, and then, when he has made the order, there shall be the usual advertisements as to appeal, and the appeal shall come before the Minister for Finance as the section as it stands provides.</P>
      <P>All that I want to do is to try and get your new Judges out of the unfortunate position of being merely the registering officers of the will of the Executive Minister. I do not want to interfere in any way with the powers of the Executive to confiscate stolen money any way they please, but I do beseech them to keep the judicial administration out of what is really Executive action.  If the Judge really had any duty to perform I would welcome it, but it is because he must act <i>ex parte</i>&mdash;upon the statement of one side only&mdash;that I think the Minister who calls upon him to make the order ought to be empowered to make the order himself without going through the form of getting the District Justices to countersign it.  When I saw the newly-drafted section I handed in amendments, applying my amendments, 69 and 70, to the section as newly drafted.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGibbon's suggestions with regard to this section have been very carefully considered, and I am advised that it would be undesirable to delete the reference to the District Justice in the first portion of Deputy Duggan's amendment.  There is a judicial function involved; there is a discretion which ought to rest with someone other than the Executive Minister of granting or withholding an injunction. The reference further down to the District Justice we will be prepared to reconsider, and we would be prepared to agree with the Deputy and to meet him on the point that the Executive act of forfeiture ought to be the act of the Minister.  But I submit that in the first section the procedure involved is very much the same as the granting of an injunction by a Court on <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  If and whenever an Executive Minister shall satisfy a District Justice that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that any sum of money standing to the credit of any person in the books of any bank or similar institution is, or <Col N="874" /> represents, or is directly or indirectly derived from</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  any stolen property or funds; or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  any public funds or funds which ought to be in the custody or under the control of a Minister or a Government Department, the District Justice shall by order prohibit any transfer of or other dealing with such sum of money or any part thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy, I think, indicates the view that is very much the same as the granting of an injunction on an <i>ex parte</i> representation. My advisers are of opinion that there is a proper function there in the first portion of the amendment for a District Justice to discharge.  We are prepared to reconsider that portion of the amendment which places the actual forfeiture on the District Justice rather than on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>The forfeiture is not in the District Justice in the new section. In the old section it was.  In the new section it is in the Minister for Finance.  My reason for saying that this differs from the granting of an injunction on <i>prima facie</i> evidence is this: An application is made to a Judge on <i>prima facie</i> evidence for an injunction, which he grants <i>ex parte</i> to the next day or until notice can be served upon the other side to come in and discharge it.  But he discharges it.  It is merely granted to preserve property for the moment, until the other side can be brought in, when he hears and discharges his own order.  An <i>ex parte</i> injunction is in all urgent cases invariably granted, without any hesitation, because it is only granted until the following day, or perhaps for 48 hours, until the other side has time to be brought in.  Once the District Justice has made the order he is <i>functus officio.</i>  No one ever comes near him again.  His order lasts till the end of time, not until an opportunity has been given to the other side to be heard, and he must make the order upon the declaration by the Minister, because he is bound to accept the declaration of the Minister.  No District Justice who had a statutory declaration before him by a Minister that he had reasonable grounds for believing such property was stolen could for a moment refuse such an order.  It is for that reason I suggest that he is not in the same position as the Judge who grants an <i>ex parte</i> injunction, which he may discharge <Col N="875" /> himself the next day.  He is in substance the mere formal tool of the Minister who applied to him to make the order.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is, perhaps, overstating the case when he says if an official of the Ministry of Finance were to make representations to the District Justice to the effect that there was reasonable ground for suspecting that a particular sum of money represented stolen property, that the District Justice would have no alternative but to grant the order.  The amended section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If and whenever an Executive Minister&rdquo;&mdash;which, in fact, means an official of his Department&mdash;&ldquo;shall satisfy a District Justice that there is reasonable grounds for suspecting,&rdquo; etc.</P>

      <P>Nicely said, sir. The Deputy's contention is that there is no judicial function in fact&mdash;that if such a representation is made, the District Justice is the merest automation.  I think it right to have a check, and that a person in a judicial office must at least be satisfied that there is reasonable ground for suspicion in regard to those funds before an injunction is granted closing down on them or transferring them temporarily to the Minister for Finance.  It may be said that it is not a very substantial check, and that the tendency would be for the District Justices to accept, with the minimum of critical examination, the grounds put forward by the Finance Ministry or any other Ministry.  But it is a judicial function.  To completely eliminate the District Justice and state that a Minister or Ministry could close <Col N="876" /> down on any property or any funds on suspicion would be rather an extreme course to take.  There should at least be an examination of <i>prima facie</i> evidence by some judicial person and some person who can approach the matter with a detached view.  The District Justice is the best person we could find for that purpose. If I might add, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in Sub-section (1), Section 11, while it seems mandatory, is of course qualified by &ldquo;if and whenever an Executive Minister shall satisfy a District Justice.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 80, which is designed to ensure that this Bill shall be submitted to a referendum before it becomes operative.  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (2) to insert after the word &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; line 26, the words &ldquo;shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people and shall require the assent of a majority of the votes recorded on such referendum before it shall become operative; it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motive for the amendment is this. In this Bill the Executive Council is proposing drastically to amend the Constitution not in favour of liberty, but against it.  I hold that no Executive Council, however powerful in this Dáil, has any moral right to uproot the Constitution passed last November unless they are certain and can prove beyond yea or nay that in so doing they have the assent of the Irish people.  It may be that a majority of the electors would vote in favour of this Bill.  I emphatically believe that a majority would vote very decisively against it.  But if the Ministry believe, as they profess to believe, and as they claim, that they are carrying out the will of the people, of which we have heard so much, they must be the very first to welcome an amendment which will give them a magnificent opportunity of showing that the people are solid behind them. I apprehend that the people who supported the Ministry throughout the more difficult times will be found, when they are consulted, to declare that they emphatically dissent from this Bill as being the wrong remedy for the present state of affairs, and as being designed not to bring about peace, but to bring about further turmoil.  If I am wrong the Ministry can prove it very easily by accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the Dáil consider how, in fact, it is proposed radically to alter the Constitution passed here.  Can it be said radical alterations should be passed without the assent of the people?  No one can suggest that this Dáil was elected to amend a Constitution which did not exist when <Col N="878" /> the Dáil was elected.  It is proposed to do away with <i>habeas corpus</i> in the case of these prisoners.  It is proposed to do away with the Article in the Constitution which declares that judicial power shall be exercised and justice administered in the public Courts, and to substitute the back chamber of a Minister, in which he receives reports from his agents, for the public Courts of this country.  It is proposed to overrule the emphatic Article of the Constitution which declares that extraordinary Courts shall not be established. It is proposed to do away with that first principle of criminal law whereby the onus is always laid upon the prosecution in the first instance.  It may be that the people of Ireland are so disgusted with the proceedings of the last twelve months that they will tell the Ministry that they are right.  It may be, but they are entitled to be consulted and to be asked their opinion before you commit them to so drastic an amendment of the Constitution and so emphatic an annulment of many parts of the Constitution as this Bill provides.  None of us was elected to this Dáil to pass the present measure; none of us was elected radically to change the Constitution. Ministers are quite entitled to say that the only way in which they can find it possible to deal with the present situation is to pass such a Bill as this.  They are entitled to say that if that is their conviction, but they are aware that there are other ways in which the matter might be approached.  They are aware that the people are not unanimously behind them on this measure, and I put it to them that it is their duty to make certain whether or not the people approve of the measure before forcing it into law with a majority not elected for any such purpose.  It is one special way of dealing with the present difficulties&mdash;some of us think an exceedingly bad way.  Why should it be forced upon the country before the country has an opportunity of saying whether it is or not a method which it desires to see adopted?  I may be told that there is urgency; let us consider that.  Is there urgency?  The Courts of this country have so far humiliated the law and the respect in which law should be held as to intimate that there will be a state of war in the technical sense in this country so long as the arms are not surrendered. That, I think, is a fair paraphrase of the judgments that have been given.  Very well.  If that be the case a month or <Col N="879" /> two months hence I presume it is probable that the Courts will still be refusing <i>habeas corpus</i>, and if a referendum took a month or six weeks the Ministry would not be greatly damnified by the delay. They would be in exactly the same legal position at the end of that time as they are now.  I do not think that urgency can be pleaded.  So long as Courts are going to justify the Executive in their present action on the ground of a state of war, urgency is not an answer to a demand for a referendum before you change the Constitution radically in those things which most closely affect the liberty of the subject.  I suppose I shall be told, as I was told by a Deputy just now, that an amendment of this kind is electioneering. No doubt.  If the Ministry are right in assuring us from every platform up and down the country that they, and they alone, represent the will of the people, the very best electioneering for them is to prove it by getting a magnificent majority on a referendum in favour of this Bill.  They know, and every Deputy knows, the horror which this Bill has excited. Everybody knows it.</P>

      <P>Those who do not know it will discover it at the forthcoming General Election.  People are perfectly entitled to their views, however insane, on the best way of dealing with the present situation.  But if your views require that you should uproot the Constitution passed by yourselves a few months ago in the middle of a civil war&mdash; passed at a time when everything that has happened could have been foreseen&mdash;if your views require such amendments as that to the Constitution, I submit that it is the clear duty of the Ministry and of the Ministerial majority to see to it that before such amendments are placed upon the Statute Book to disgrace our Constitution, that the people should have the right to say yea or nay to the question: Is this the way in which you wish this problem to be dealt with?</P>

      <P>Champion of liberty of the individual.  No doubt he feels the blood of the signers of the Bill of Rights boiling in his veins.  We have a certain responsibility to the people, and we have put a clear, plain interpretation on that for the last year.  In a couple of months' time we will go to the people and ask whether we have discharged our trust in the manner in which they wished us to discharge it, and the people will decide. We are not greatly troubled about that prospect.  We have not begun to lose any sleep about it.  If the people decide to give a mandate to others than those who have held it for the last ten or twelve months, it will be simply one more proof of their sovereignty which has been vindicated&mdash;which was challenged, and which has been vindicated.  Now, as to the Bill.  I am not aware that there is any clamour or anxiety in the country for the release of 12,000 or 13,000 men in view of the fact that arms and explosives are secreted throughout the country.  I think the people understand that to hold any of the prisoners it is necessary to get powers to hold all, and to use judgment and discretion and caution in the matter of any releases.  Neither have I found throughout the country that there is any protest against the proposal to use against the crimes of arson and robbery with violence the most effective means, to use a familiar phrase.  The people have a right not to be robbed; they have a right not to have their houses burned; and they have a right to demand that their Executive Government will take all possible steps to stamp out these two crimes, which menace all society, all stability and all prosperity.  I have found through the country&mdash; and I have been through the country more than the Deputy&mdash;no feeling against this Bill, and no feeling against that particular Section of the Bill which Deputies here profess to make most cry about.  If imprisonment is, as we believe, inadequate to check robbery with violence and arson, then the people demand that we will use whatever methods will check those crimes.  Robbery under arms and arson, these may be said to be the main features of the Bill.  There is another feature, the methods by which it is proposed to meet agrarian anarchy.  Now, I have found a <Col N="881" /> very thorough appreciation through the country of the fact that agrarian anarchy cannot be met by prosecutions before a summary court for trespass; cannot be met by the law which was intended to meet mere cases of accidental or casual trespass. People realise that this particular form of anarchy requires very drastic treatment to check it and that you have to treat the cause.  The cause is, and has been, agreed, and you will only meet and beat that particular offence by setting off against the greed, against the desire for illicit gain, the rather certain prospect of loss if that line is adopted, that is the line of driving one's cattle into a neighbour's land and removing your neighbour's landmark.  These are the main features of the Bill: the intention to hold those of the prisoners whom it is thought unsafe in the public interest to release; the intention to apply very special and very stringent penalties to robbery with arms and violence, and arson: and the intention to meet agrarian anarchy; the confiscation of one's neighbour's land, by confiscation of the trespassing stock that are driven in, in direct challenge to all that law, and to all those principles upon which civilised society rests.</P>

      <P>We make no apologies to the Deputy for this Bill or to any Deputy and we made no apologies through the country.  On the contrary we would feel that we should be apologetic through the country, to the people, if we had shirked or shrunk from taking all the steps which in our minds and in our own consciences we believe to be necessary to deal with the situation with which we have been confronted, and with which we are still confronted. There is no intention of accepting the Deputy's amendment, to submit this Bill to a Referendum.  In a few months' time the people will decide on this and on other matters that have occurred within the last 12 months, and we are not afraid of that decision, and we are not worried about it.  We will simply go honestly and in a responsible spirit before the people and state what the situation was and ask them to decide. As I say, if they decide against us and give a mandate to others than those who have been conducting their political affairs for the last 12 months, it will <Col N="882" /> simply be another proof of their sovereignty and we will not go out with arms or with petrol cans or land mines to challenge the people's will.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, I have stated the position.  The Bill is an urgent one, and the question of its consideration next week in the Seanad depends largely on its being taken on Friday, if at all possible, and I think that Deputies should realise that a Bill having been in their hands for 10 days or a fortnight, and having been very thoroughly considered in Committee, it is not unreasonable to ask that the interval as between Monday and Friday should be sufficient between the Committee and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>My own impression is that if you have deferred Estimate 55 that all Estimates dealing with the Department ought to be deferred also for this reason.  I hope I am in order in making the suggestion.  What I wish to say is that before you come to deal with the particular items in an Estimate that the whole general survey of a Department ought to come under review before we come down to generalities and details, and I think if, under such an Estimate, such a discussion is at all in order it would come under No. 55 rather than under this sub-head or minor phases of the working of the Department. I certainly think, as I have said before, that this is one of the most vital phases of administration and it is hardly sufficient, I think, simply to discuss these things in detail without first having a general survey of the whole work of the Department.  I think if No. 55 is to be deferred to a later date every matter that comes under this Department ought also to be deferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt Deputy Milroy is very interested in the Estimate for the Ministry, and he has been good enough to give me notice that he is so interested.  I can assure him that when the general vote of the Ministry comes up to-morrow he will have full facility for discussing it.  I shall provide him with information on every possible subject that can be raised, and which I hope he will find quite satisfactory, but I think that we ought to proceed with the Vote, if the Dáil wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Milroy in his suggestion, in as much as <Col N="890" /> this Vote says quite distinctly that it is for the Transport Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It may well be that some of these items of salaries may have to do with the Transport Department; we do not know. We accept your assurance that it is not, but if we had the names, offices and salaries before us, we would understand exactly.  At any rate there is an Assistant Secretary in this Department, and there may be a Secretary over the whole Department, whose policy might come under consideration, and, therefore, I think, as the Vote on this Department of the Ministry has to be considered to-morrow, Deputy Milroy's point is a good one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is really a criticism, although a friendly criticism, of the way in which these Estimates are prepared.  You have the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, then you have the Transport Department, and you have then the Marine Service, all phases of the one Department. Now, I contend that an opportunity should be given by which a comprehensive criticism and discussion of all the different phases of that Department should be in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be in order on the Vote for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume, that would be the only occasion in which it would, but if we defer that and proceed with the Transport Department or the Marine Service Estimates, when we come to raise matters that arise out of these Estimates on the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, we may be informed that those things are already discussed; and that we must confine ourselves to the details in the particular Estimate.  I think to defer this No. 55, and to proceed with the others, 56 and 57, is really putting the car before the horse, and would lead to confusion in the consideration of the working of the service and administration of this Department.  I would certainly urge that if we defer 55 we ought also to defer this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the future organisation, or reorganisation, of this particular Department depends to a large extent, perhaps, on the policy of the Ministry, or any statement the Minister <Col N="891" /> may have to make regarding the future of the railways.  I think we are entitled, in view of the promises made many months ago, to hear from the Minister, or the Ministry, or the Executive Council, some statement regarding the present position of the railway companies, and their agreement or failure to agree regarding the grouping scheme, or the policy of the Government in spite of such a failure, if there has been a failure, and as to whether there will be a grouping up in the future of this Department, its enlargement or otherwise.  For that reason, and by reason of the fact that it is a subordinate Department of the Ministry, the two Departments ought to be taken together, or one after the other.</P>
