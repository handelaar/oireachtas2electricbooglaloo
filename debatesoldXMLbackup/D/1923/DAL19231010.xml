      <P>The answer is in the negative.  The Deputy may not be aware that a Committee of both Houses was formed during the last Dáil to put up proposals on this matter, but they failed to come to any agreement, and the question has been left in abeyance since then.</P>
      <P>It is my intention so soon as the exigencies of the situation permit to take up the matter again.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are not quite as stated.  It was not the shortness of time that was responsible for the Committee not coming to a decision as far as I am aware, because the time was extended and I was informed that there was very little likelihood of any report being presented.  That was backed by a majority of those forming the Committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the British War Pension Department have reduced the pension paid to Mrs. Gertrude Guerrine, 5 Charlemont Mall, and her child, from 11s. 6d. weekly to 3s. 6d. weekly; whether he is aware that this woman's husband, Geoffrey Guerrine, served in Mesopotamia, India and Palestine, for four and a-half years, and was discharged suffering from malaria and bronchitis, and is now in Grangegorman Mental Hospital under the care of Doctor C. Costello, Assistant Medical Officer, who certifies that Geoffrey Guerrine is suffering from &ldquo;Acute Melancholia, following on the stress of War Service&rdquo;; if he is aware that the Pensions Appeal Tribunal have rejected the appeal against the reduction; to ask that steps be taken to protect this woman and other citizens of the Free State similarly treated.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a question asked by Deputy Byrne on the 25th September, the administration of British Military pensions is not a matter in which the Government of the Irish Free State is officially concerned.  The general representations then made by the Deputy on the subject were duly brought to the notice of the British Authorities in accordance with the undertaking which I gave to this effect.  It is not possible for me to pursue inquiry in individual cases affecting a branch of administration for which I am in no way responsible.</P>

I cannot, however, promise that the part of the statement which will deal with the estimated cost of the proposed future system will be detailed.  The Deputy will realise that it is a sufficiently difficult task to forecast, with precision, the future cost of even an existing system: the difficulty is, of course, very much greater when an attempt is made to estimate for a totally new system. A rough estimate has, however, already been made from which it would appear that the new system will be substantially more economical than the present system.</P>

      <P>Tenders were invited by advertisement for supplies to that barracks and were received, but as the Quartermaster-General was satisfied that tendering was not free and unrestricted, no tender was accepted, and he considered it advisable for the time being to supply meat from the Army Abbatoir.

      <P>Before we enter upon the Orders of the Day, there is one matter I would like to raise which would be for the convenience of the Dáil, I think.  It will be in your memory that I raised the same matter in the last Dáil on one or two occasions. On to-day's Orders I notice that item 5 deals with the Governor-General's address&mdash;there is a motion for a resolution of thanks &mdash;and then there are various matters in connection with the Courts of Justice Bill.  Inasmuch as there is no definite information before the Dáil as to how long item 5 will occupy our time, Deputies have no method of ascertaining whether items <Col N="185" /> 6 or 7 are likely to arise.  Would it not be convenient to enter upon item 5 at, say, about 4 o'clock, and deal with the other items later?  A time could be arranged so that whether this earlier business has or has not been concluded, it can be postponed.  Then Deputies would be able to know at what hour certain business in which they are interested will be entered upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice up to this to suit the convenience of Deputies with regard to the Agenda, or any business that has been brought forward.  For example, it will be within the recollection of Deputies that certain votes were postponed or allotted to certain days in order to suit the convenience of Deputies.</P>
      <P>In that case, unless there was pressing Government business, business pressing by reason of special circumstances, it was not insisted on taking the Agenda in the order in which it was arranged.  It was left generally to the Dáil, but, personally, I would prefer if the item on the Order Paper, No. 5, came before the Dáil that it would be only for a short period, limited, say, to half an hour, and that we should then take up item No. 6, or what Deputy Milroy calls the more serious business.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

I am merely raising it now because this is the first time in which this has occurred in this Session.  I, therefore, suggest that certain definite business should be set down on the Orders for the Day at a certain time, and if earlier business has not been disposed of at such a particular hour, then we would be in a position to know exactly at what hour of the day certain definite business is to be entered upon.</P>

To suggest half an hour for a discussion on such a motion strikes me as rather slighting both the Governor-General, the mover of the Address, and the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I did not mean to limit the discussion on that particular subject to half an hour, but I think Deputy Johnson will recollect that last year it formed the subject of business for a considerable number of days, and it is our intention to allot ample time for discussion on it.  The other matter is one of pressing importance, but there is no desire to bring it into relative comparison, in the matter of importance, with the motion of thanks on the Governor-General's address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask for permission to make a short statement on the industrial situation.  As I stated at the last meeting of the Dáil, we have been engaged for the past week in investigating, with those qualified to advise us, remedies for our present industrial difficulties.  We have found that the matters to be considered are very wide in scope and that strong opinions are held on them by the various parties whose interests are affected.  It will be necessary to devote more time to this question before a definite solution is achieved, but we have already progressed towards an understanding, and I am confident that peace and moderation will before long prevail.  Special attention is being paid to the problem of the cost of living, <Col N="188" /> particularly in the larger towns and cities, and it is evident that all parties recognise this to be one of the essential points on which adjustments are necessary.  Recently the price of bread in Dublin has been reduced, and I am hopeful that reductions in the prices of other essential commodities will shortly follow.</P>
      <P>In all the consideration we have been giving to the industrial position, one great obstacle to an early adjustment has presented itself, and that is the trouble at the ports.  This stoppage of work has had a paralysing effect on trade, and until the ports are again fully open no settlement designed to promote commerce and industry can take practical effect.  The position at some ports is worse than that at others. Where the position is exceptionally grave various intermediaries, members of the Dáil and others, have exerted themselves to bring about a settlement that would relieve hardship and distress. They report, however, that there is little prospect of progress being made at present except on a national basis, and so the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in view of the information he has received and with grateful appreciation of the services of those intermediaries in the cause of peace, is communicating to both parties to the dispute a proposal designed to secure an immediate opening of all the ports and a detailed investigation into this question of dock labour in an atmosphere conducive to reliable conclusions.</P>
      <P>The proposal which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is making is, briefly, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  That on resumption of work there should be a reduction in wages of 1s. per day, with consequential reductions in tonnage and overtime rates and in the wages of men who have previously followed the settlements relating to dock labour.</P>
      <P>2.  That the Minister, in the exercise of his powers under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, should, as soon as possible after the resumption of work, set up a Court of Inquiry to report on this question of dock labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> The proposal to set up a Court of Inquiry is particularly appropriate, since I understand that the practice under which questions relating to dock labour are now dealt with on a national basis originated from the report of a Court of Inquiry which sat in London some years ago.  We are now independent of Great Britain in these matters, and it is right and proper that we should now adopt our own enquiries for ourselves with a view to such arrangements as the circumstances of our own case require.</P>
    <P>If these proposals are accepted, they will re-open the ports and enable our Christmas trade, which is soon beginning, to be conducted in a normal way. For the future, the Court of Inquiry may be trusted to make such recommendations as will safeguard the interests of all concerned.  I would deprecate any detailed discussion of the matter now, but I trust that the feeling of the Dáil is in favour of the Minister's proposals which I have outlined and which, without any excessive sacrifice on either side, will terminate a deplorable situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Chairman of the Committee <Col N="192" /> whether it is his intention in moving the adoption of the report that the names of the four Ministers proposed should be taken together, or whether each should be proposed separately.  I think the previous procedure was that each name was submitted separately, and I think it might be better to continue that procedure.</P>

      <P>Before this motion is disposed of I would like to make my own position perfectly clear. I was elected a member of this Committee of Selection for the purpose of selecting external Ministers.  I want it to be clearly understood, as a member of the Committee, that I accept no responsibility whatever for the nomination of these gentlemen.  The Committee was elected on the principle of proportional representation.  Of course, the Government, having a majority in this House, naturally had a majority upon the Committee, and, therefore, I want it to be realised that these gentlemen, strictly speaking, are Government nominees.  Now I regret, very much, that the Committee and the Government did not see their way to take advantage of the Constitution whereby they could have appointed gentlemen who are not members of the Dáil, but who might be experts in the various Departments over which they might be called upon to preside.  I think that is a pity.  However, the Government have a majority in this House, and the Government had a majority on this Committee, and the Government are perfectly entitled to make whatever choice of Ministers they choose.  They have made their choice; the responsibility is with them; and I want personally to disclaim, and to dissociate myself from any responsibility for the Ministers who have been nominated.</P>

      <P>I would like to say I do not accept that interpretation of members duty in this Dáil, nor of members of a Committee of this Dáil. As I understand public business&mdash;and I presume I have some experience of it outside of this House in other institutions than this&mdash;I understand a member's duty is not to wash his hands of every responsibility that comes before him, if he has not got a majority, but on the contrary to table better proposals, and, in this case, to have tabled the names of persons he considered more expert in the discharge of the administration of these positions than those who are named here, and then to come along here if his proposal was not accepted in the Committee, and say to this House: &ldquo;We put on the paper <Col N="194" /> the names of better people for consideration than those who have been selected, but we have been beaten because the Government have a majority, and we have been beaten because they are filling up positions with the aid of their majority, and so on.&rdquo;  But what has occurred here?  Not a single suggestion is made; no constructive proposal whatever is put forward, but the Deputy simply comes here and says: &ldquo;I wash my hands of all responsibility in this matter.&rdquo;  That is not my interpretation of the duty, or the responsibility of a member of this House.</P>

      <P>The remarks I want to pass on this motion are somewhat different from those made by Deputy Redmond.  I want to express my regret, and to enter a protest, that the spirit of the constitutional provision in respect of the appointment of external Ministers was not entered into in the discussion in the Committee.  The object, I understand, of this particular provision was to make possible, the appointment of Ministers for certain offices who would be outside the ordinary political parties, and their operations and jurisdiction.  It might have been possible, no matter what enquiry had been made, or what examination there had been of possible Ministers, that the same four names would again have been recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection that I make is that there was no pretence or no attempt even to consider qualifications; there was no attempt at enquiry into possibilities. The decisions were made at Party meetings beforehand and the names were tabled.  Of course the rights are there for the majority and the minority have to accept the decisions of the majority.  The point is rather that the intentions of the Constitution were not carried through, and if the same procedure is to be taken as a precedent for future action, then I think that the provisions of the Constitution in this respect are entirely misapplied, and the responsibility for nominating Ministers for these External Departments ought to be, as is the case with the Executive Council, upon the President of the Council.  If that responsibility is to be taken by the Dáil under the <Col N="195" /> terms of the Constitution, then, at least, some examination should be made by the Committee of the possibilities and Party decisions that have been come to beforehand ought not to be applied.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Sub-Committee, I was surprised to see two red herrings drawn across the track.  Generally one red herring is sufficient, but we have here two red herrings drawn across the track of what happened in that Committee.  The Committee were perfectly prepared to listen, however much they might have disagreed by a majority regarding the other nominees, but practically no names were brought forward.  It was destructive criticism.  It was not constructive criticism.  It was a distinct attack made by means of these unfortunate red herrings as to the procedure we should adopt.  Certain names were proposed.  I had the pleasure of proposing one name myself.  I heard a murmur, a wave of dissent, with regard to the Deputy I proposed, but no better man was proposed.  In fact, no name at all was proposed.  The red herrings remained. I think under those circumstances we will all agree that unless better men are proposed the men who are proposed will be generally accepted by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Committee, I desire to protest against the procedure that was adopted by the Government Party in regard to the selection of their nominees.  It was quite apparent that a Government Party meeting was held and that certain selections were made.  That may be quite right in its own way, but on the morning of the day that Committee was summoned to meet, on very short notice, the newspapers that had the ear of the Government side published the names of the selected nominees of the Government Party.  I suggest, with all respect to the Ministers, and with all respect to those who were responsible for giving that information, that it was very discourteous treatment of the members of the Committee who did not belong to the Government Party.  That is my protest in the matter.  I think it a very discourteous way for the members <Col N="196" /> of the Committee to be treated. The names selected by the Government Party were published on the morning of the day of the meeting and in that way prejudiced the decision of the Committee. I hope those who are elected to serve on any such Committee in the future will not be treated in that discourteous manner by the Government Party who are responsible for giving away that information.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse what the President says.  This is absolute hypocrisy.  No suggestion at all came from the other members of the Committee.  They had no other candidate to put up.  We put up our candidates, we voted for them and they were elected and they come before the Dáil now.  They want to wash their hands of it.  Why did they not put up their nominees?  I think the members of the Government Party who were on that Committee were open to examine any nominations that were put before them.  They did nothing of the sort, but they now come to the Dáil and say we have nothing to do with this.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has misrepresented what happened, because I put up an alternative name for one of the Ministries, knowing full well that no matter what particular qualities the member I nominated had he had not the slightest chance of being accepted. However, to try the thing, I put him up and he was turned down, and I take it what happened in that case would happen in every other case.</P>

He put up a name and when he was asked if he had the authority of the man whose name he put forward he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  If he had persisted a vote would have been taken, but the Deputy withdrew his name rather than have a vote taken.  I do not like this kind of thing, that men should sit down, come to a decision and then try to wriggle out of it.  I do not think that it adds to the dignity of the Dáil or the dignity of those who undertook public responsibilities.  It is what you might call &ldquo;sharp practice.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is not a shadow of doubt about it.  I am particularly surprised at Deputy Redmond, who has had so much experience in that direction, coming here and catechising us.  Our memories are not so short as to forget when it was a political sin to rebel against the Irish Party or against a nominee of theirs. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  To the victors the spoils of war.  The Government Party has only done in this case what the high priests who are condemning them, in all the moods and tenses, would do if the same opportunity turned up for them.</P>

      <P>As one member of the Committee, I would like to say that I have heard a good number of inaccuracies, even from the gentleman who was Chairman of the Committee.  He said that Deputy Wilson withdrew his nomination.  That is not true.  As a matter of fact, a vote was taken.  I think the Minutes will show that ten were for and three against that motion. I only intervene on a question of accuracy. I have nothing to say to the decisions that were made.  Deputy Redmond did not vote on this particular division that was taken.  We admit that we had not alternative names to put up.  The thing was rushed, at half an hour's notice.  As a matter of fact, we were sitting there and we did not know that the meeting was to go on, and it would not have been held only that Deputy Beamish was fished up in some part of Dublin.  By fishing him and hooking him and landing him at the table the meeting was able to go on.  I knew the decision of that meeting would be the same, in any case. I hope Deputy Hughes will accept my statement that a vote was taken.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I moved this gentleman's name.  The nomination was not withdrawn.  There was a vote. The decision of the Committee was that the matter was not to be published in the Press, that it was to be recorded in the Minutes.  I wish to ask the Ceann Comhairle in what part of the Constitution it is specified that where a member of the Selection Committee puts forward a name he must get the consent of that particular candidate. How can we get the best men in Ireland, if, say, we had to go down to Cork, where all the good men come from, and ask for their consent?  The thing is impossible.  We did the best we could in the circumstances.  The nominations are practically the nominations of the Government, and they must accept responsibility.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wish to deal with the suggestion made by the President that the names here having been proposed, alternative suggestions may be put before the Dáil.  I suggest that the Constitution clearly does not permit of any such course of action.  The Constitution definitely states that each such Minister shall be nominated by Dáil Eireann on the recommendation of a Committee chosen by Dáil Eireann. That means that every nomination must come through the Committee and <Col N="199" /> cannot come before the Dáil in any other way.  I ask if that is not the case, according to the Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that under Article 55 of the Constitution, the report may be accepted or rejected, but it is not in order for any other name to be placed before the Dáil except such name comes from and through the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>When I move that Deputy Hogan be elected, it should be open to an intellectual prodigy to select a better man, and back that up with reasons as to why a better man should be selected.  If Deputy Hogan's nomination is turned down, all this pabulum goes to the Committee again, and they will have to select another name and get a man who will be up to the standards that have been set by some of the critics of the proposals which have been made. I think the Constitution will permit of that.  I think it is within the knowledge of Deputy Figgis that a course of that kind is open under the Constitution. If Deputy Figgis extended his view somewhat and took a larger outlook on broad constitutional questions, I think the Dáil and the country would benefit, and we would make some progress instead of showing up and exaggerating the little infirmities that are in our character and the little mistakes that we make now and then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking to this particular motion, that Deputy Hogan be elected, I have to say that from my experience of something like twelve or eighteen months, that he held the position of Minister for Agriculture, I am perfectly satisfied that if left to the free vote of the people concerned&mdash;in this case the farmers of the country&mdash;Deputy <Col N="200" /> Hogan would be their nominee.  I think it is right Deputy Redmond should know that.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. I think it is within my right.  I took the same action at the Committee, and I am proud to take the same action here.  I do not desire to make a speech, but Deputy Hogan has filled the office of Minister for Agriculture and has administered it as it should be done. His ability has met with the approval of the farming community.  We differed with Deputy Hogan in connection with some matters under the Land Bill, but that was an honest difference.  We recognise his abilities and we recognise that there is no man in the Dáil able to take his place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the President rather misunderstands my attitude.  My attitude is in no way an objection to the personnel of the nominees, but my attitude is to make it perfectly clear to the country, beyond all sham, that these are the Government nominees, and that it is the Government who are responsible for them.  I do not think it is very dignified or worthy of a Government to be endeavouring to shift its responsibilities on to others.  Deputy Hogan was proposed at this Committee meeting, and, like Deputy Gorey, I signified my assent because, strange as it may appear to the President, I had heard of Deputy Hogan before.  I had heard also of the esteem and regard in which he is held by the agricultural community. But, apart altogether from Deputy Hogan's character and his ability, the point that I want the Dáil to understand is that these gentlemen are the Government nominees, and that it is the Government, who have the majority here, and who have the majority on the Committee&mdash;and who are entitled to have the majority on the Committee, and who are entitled to nominate their own Ministers&mdash;it is they, and they alone, who are responsible <Col N="201" /> to the country for the nomination and support of the Ministers whom they have named.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): This is the right time for me to make a speech, and I make it apropos of the statement Deputy Redmond has just made now.  This is a storm in a teacup from start to finish.  I think I am expressing the truth when I say that the Government and the Government Party did make up their mind as to whom they would propose for certain offices.  That is the truth.  I think it is equally true to say that not a single Party in the Dáil wish to take the responsibility of putting forward a nominee for any of these offices.  I say &ldquo;wish to take the responsibility.&rdquo; I do not think the Labour Party wanted to fill any Ministry and stand over that Minister and his policy for the year.  I have never been told that they did or that they did not, but I think what I have stated is the truth, and that the Dáil will realise it is the truth.  I do not think the Farmers' Party wanted to take the risk of putting forward anyone for any particular Ministry, and standing over the policy and taking responsibility for the Minister for a year or two.  It is not going to be a bed of roses.  I do not think that the Independent Party desired to do so either.  That is the spirit of the Constitution. The spirit of the Constitution is not so much that a number of men should be chosen from any one Party for any one office, but that the various Parties in the Dáil should put forward men representing their point of view.  That was never done.  There is no use disclaiming responsibility at this stage.  The Government Party took the responsibility of making certain suggestions.  The other Parties did not wish to take the responsibility of nominating any members of their own.  What is happening just at the moment is that the other Parties see a chance of getting a score and they are making a virtue of necessity.  Every Party in the Dáil knows that if we offered them Ministries at present, they would not take them.</P>

      <P>I think it is necessary to say that there are different interpretations of the intentions of the Constitution from those mentioned by Deputy Hogan.  Everything that was said in respect of the method of appointing Ministers who would be responsible to the Dáil and not to the Executive Council, and who would not go out of office if the Executive Council lost the confidence of the majority, suggests that the appointment should not be a Party or a group appointment. It was possible to examine the qualifications whether members were in the Dáil or outside the Dáil.  That is the intention of this clause, and it is quite apparent to everyone who was present when this discussion took place.  Deputy Hogan, however, tells us that this is, and ought to be, a Party question, and that the names ought to be put forward as Party names&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no question of the responsibility of Party at all. Deputies go to this Committee to make a selection and presumably to discuss the merits and not Party allegiances. When we were approached on the necessity of such a meeting we were informed plainly by the majority that it would be over in half an hour.  There was no question then of considering the merits of any nominee or any Party or individual.  A decision had been made and the Committee was a farce.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I should go into details about this question. This is one of the Ministries that a vote was taken on, and a good deal of discussion has been raised here about the motion and as to why members of the Committee did not put up candidates or did not nominate men for the position.  As I said earlier, as a matter of hard fact, the Committee did not know it was going to meet until half an hour before the actual time of the meeting, and then when the Committee had met, it did not know it was going to do any business until ten minutes before the nomination was made.  So I think that point should not be laboured at all.  With reference to this question of the Ministry of Fisheries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think our people cannot consent to an appointment at all unless with the addition of an Advisory Board.  This is not like Agriculture.  It is not like Trade and Commerce.  It is not like any of the beaten tracks or departments that have been in existence <Col N="204" /> and whose lines are definitely marked. The fishery industry is one of the things that is, practically speaking, unknown in this country or in the Dáil. I do not think we have an expert within the walls of this Assembly this evening, and we need an expert.  If expert advice is going to be given us, if the money expended on this Ministry is going to be of any use at all, it can only be of any use by being intelligently applied.  It can only be of any use when the two great questions in fisheries are going to take effect&mdash;when we have experts on propagation and protection.</P>

      <P>It would be no harm to tell the Deputy that when the Ministries Bill comes up for consideration it will be open to him to raise the particular subject he wishes raised now.  And that is whether we ought to have a Minister for Fisheries at all. I have intimated to my friends that if any Ministry was not continued we would expect that the Minister affected would retire.  Under the Constitution he could hold on to the end of the period, but I think you may rely upon it that in the case of any of the four Deputies now nominated, should it be decided to abolish the Ministry to which any of them is assigned, the person so assigned will retire then.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that Seamus de Burea be nominated Minister for Local Government.  This particular post is one that will require very great attention from the person appointed, and while it may be urged that Deputy Burke has not had much association with the administration of Local Government, he has been a member of the Dáil since 1918.  This office, and indeed most of those offices, during the next couple of years will depend very largely upon the individual appointed and upon the policy of the Government.  Local Government itself will require, perhaps, the most attention of any of the Ministries for some time to come.  There has not been any great development in the last year or two, so far as able and capable administration are concerned, and it will be the study and the work of the persons who are appointed to try and mark some improvement in regard to this particular Ministry in the years to come.  A considerable amount of arrears is outstanding in rates in the country, and the rates generally of local authorities are more than the people can bear.  In a sense it can scarcely be urged that that is a responsibility of the Ministry, but I take it that the Minister, while concerning himself with that particularly in future, will see that particular service will be conducted throughout the country in such a manner that the ratepayers will get full value for their money.</P>

He risked his life and lost his liberty and his employment.  These, though they may be strong recommendations in his favour, would not be recommendations that should absolutely impose him on the Dáil if he were unfitted for the position; but what stands most in his favour is that the Dáil and the country have had experience of his administrative abilities as a Postmaster-General.

      <P>I rise to support this proposal.  I think the pleasant recollections that Deputy O'Mahony referred to are not the pleasant recollections that I have experienced.  I have had pleasant recollections in my time, but certainly one of them was not the cutting down of the daily delivery and collection of letters to three deliveries and collections in the week, as has been done in the rural districts all over the country.  That is not a pleasant recollection.  It is done at the expense of the rural population.  We hear of two and three day deliveries in the towns, but in the country, where the people bear as much of the taxation and the burdens of the country as anyone else, it is not pleasant to be told that they would get fewer deliveries than they were previously accustomed to.  It is not pleasant for people to have to pay porterage on every telegram they receive.  I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that the rural population is not victimised and that the people in the towns will not be made parasites on the rural population. A citizen ought not to be penalised by the fact that he lives a certain distance from the post office.  If that is to be the basis of Government it will not be satisfactory.  I have great pleasure in supporting the nomination.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.  This Bill is short and simple, and very necessary.  It is a temporary Bill, its object being simply to see that no technical difficulties shall prevent the present County Courts from proceeding with their functions, pending <Col N="210" /> the re-organisation of the Judicial system under the Bill that is at present before the Dáil.  Section 1 provides that a Court may be held anywhere in a particular county and not necessarily at what was the Statutory court of assembly.  The necessity for this arises from the fact that many courthouses throughout the country are in ruins, or otherwise unfit for use.  Section 2 gives to the Judge discretion to waive the usual formalities with regard to the service of documents, summonses, etc., provided he is satisfied that the service was, in fact, effective. Deputies will understand that, in some areas through the country, it has not been possible to serve documents of that kind personally.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill I will ask for permission to insert a Section to get over another difficulty arising out of the fact that Jury Lists, in some counties, are out of date.  Section 3 of the Bill is merely a definition Section, and Section 4 gives the period, or the lifetime, of the Bill.  The Act shall be deemed to come into force on, and shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of September, 1923, and the Act shall continue in force until the 31st day of August, 1924, and shall then expire.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that this Bill be read a second time.  This Bill is also short and is necessary to get over certain technical difficulties arising out of the disturbances in recent years.  It is not a comprehensive Licensing Bill, but a Bill confined simply to the question of the renewal of licences.  In many areas through the country there were not available a sufficient number of Justices to deal with the question of the transfer of <Col N="211" /> licences, and the annual licensing sessions were not held.  Owners of licensed premises continued to trade in spite of the fact that they did not hold a certificate of renewal of their licences, but they continued to pay the Excise duty.  The police then, in these circumstances did not interfere with those who had done that, but the District Justices found that they could not legally renew these licences.  As there was no licence renewal, the licences lapsed.  It would have been legally possible for the owners of these premises to apply to the Quarter Sessions, but that would involve considerable expense upon them and the Court might possibly refuse the application. This Bill, then, is simply a Bill brought in to remove these hardships and provides that in such a set of circumstances the licence shall be deemed to have been renewed, and to be in existence up to the present.</P>
      <P>There is one other point dealt with under Section 3 in the Bill.  Certain premises throughout the country were burned down, both in the struggle with the British and in more recent times, and it is proposed to provide that an owner opening his business in adjacent premises, provided he pays the licence duty in respect of them, in such a situation the District Justice or the Quarter Sessions shall have power to grant him a licence in favour of the new premises.  This difficulty is dealt with in the Bill, and the licence is deemed to be transferred to the new premises provided that they are in the same town or village as the old premises, and provided also that any necessary alterations to the new premises requiring to make them fit for the purpose, are made within twelve months.  It is our view that there is scarcely material for contention or opposition to this Bill.  It is simply a measure of justice, and raises no point on which there can be any serious contention. I now beg to move the second reading of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one remark that one might make in opening this discussion, and that is that in drawing up the Address the Ministry apparently did not desire that this session should be behind the last in legislative output, and that the record of about one Act per week ought to be reached in this coming session.  The Dáil will have no fear of unemployment if the proceedings suggested, and the Bills suggested in the Address are to be carried through and fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many points that might be raised, and which I have no doubt will be dealt with by various Deputies, that I propose to confine myself mainly to one paragraph, prefacing that by expressing my regret that the reference to the possibility of the release of the prisoners shows so little confidence in the ability of the Government to bring about a state of peace as is suggested. &ldquo;It is hoped that it may be found compatible with public security, gradually to release the majority of those persons at present detained for the public safety.&rdquo;&ldquo;Gradually to release the majority,&rdquo; and there is still only three or four months to run before the extension of the present powers of detaining prisoners without trial will have expired.  The suggestion that you may gradually release the majority carries with it the complementary suggestion that the minority have no right to expect or hope for release within the period dealt with in this Address. That, I think, is very unsatisfactory, indeed.  I propose to leave Deputy Alfred Byrne to follow the discussion upon this matter, inasmuch as he has interested himself very heartily with the case of these interness.  I intend to deal with the succeeding paragraph, <Col N="213" /> or the paragraph dealing with unemployment, and the general industrial economic condition of the country, and while one may express one's pleasure at the announcement that the Government is paying very, very close attention to this problem; that they are confident that stable conditions and enterprise will find many opportunities, one cannot but feel regretful that the Government is not taking the problem in hands as seriously as I think the problem warrants.  We are told that developments are at present hampered by disagreements between employers and employees.  Undoubtedly that is so, but it is to be regretted, and it is a great pity, indeed, that at the time when peace had more or less come upon the country, that employers should have insisted upon destroying the peace of the country by promoting these disagreements which have occurred and which have hampered developments, and that they should have insisted upon certain changes in the industrial arrangements as to impose these impediments in the development of the peaceful character and prosperity of the country.  We know that it is commonly spoken and written that the men who are in disagreement with their employers or with the terms of their employment are to blame for not accepting the prices which the employers have offered.  That runs through every speech, every advertisement, every leading article in all the newspapers, forgetful, as it seems to me, that the active agent in promoting these disagreements has been, not the men, but the employers.  We do not blame the merchant or the manufacturer when he offers an article to a customer at a price, and the customer refuses to take it at that price, we do not blame the seller for the discomfort that is entailed by his refusal to sell at that price, but that is what is done in the case of the men and the employers. We are told it must be recognised that the condition of the times prohibits the maintenance of the inflation caused by the European war artificially prolonged by our domestic strife, and that high profits and high wages can no longer be sustained by a country whose economic life has agriculture as its basis and foundation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I am glad to recognise in this sentence that the Government is impressed with the fact that the economic life of the country has agriculture as its basis and foundation.  I am sorry to know that the assertion of high prices, high profits, and high wages does not include in this Address high interest charges, which were included in the items referred to by the President in the speech he made in the Dáil a week or two ago.</P>
    <P>I hope there is no significance in the omission of that.  We are told that a recognition of facts is of the first necessity if industrial friction is to be allayed. I am very anxious that the facts should be laid before the Dáil and before the country, so that they may be recognised as facts.  It is not enough to produce a few figures, publish advertisements in newspapers, and treat them as facts, and the only facts.  It is not enough only to take the immediately obvious facts and treat them as though they were the only facts.  There are mountain ranges behind the hills that are immediately within our vision. There are things that we have experience of that are not the things that are only now coming into notice.  You cannot form a right judgement on a question if you are only to consider those facts which are of immediate moment and which appear to be the only ones that are causing action to be taken. There are other facts.  I submit that it is not only the facts of to-day that have to be taken into account; you must take into account the facts and the conditions of five years ago, ten years ago, fifteen years ago, twenty years ago.  I want to ask the Dáil to bear with me when I put some of the facts that are not frequently dealt with for their consideration. If we are to be persuaded that high prices, high profits, and high wages cannot be sustained then I suggest that as many facts as can be gathered together ought to be made public and placed before the country and the Dáil.  The case is made&mdash;it is even made in the statement made by the President a little while ago&mdash;that there must be reductions in wages.  He is proposing to submit suggestions about a reduction in wages of 1/- per day, and consequent reductions to pieceworkers and the like.  I am not going <Col N="215" /> to prejudice that proposal in any way, but it seems to me unfortunate that the proposal should be to reduce wages by 1/- a day and then to set up this Court of Inquiry to deal with one particular class of employment.</P>
    <P>We are told very clearly by those speaking on behalf of one of the Parties to these disagreements that costs of living have no relation to the prices in the market and ought not to be considered in fixing the rates of wages.  I hope I am not overstating the proposition that was made a few days ago and assented to by Deputy Hewat with enthusiasm.  But the point was made, to which he assented, that the price in the market, the price to be got for products, was a factor that ought to be taken into account in fixing wages, not the cost of living to the workman. I wonder will it be conceded to the workman that in that which he has to sell he has to take into account the cost of living.  This whole question seems to me to require some kind of an assent to a proposition that human labour must not be treated in the same way, and by the same logic, the same arguments, as an ordinary marketable commodity. We have the very highest authority for disclaiming any such way of looking upon human labour.  It must not be treated as a commodity in the market, to be bought and sold as ordinary marketable goods.  If we are to proceed, as one would gather from the speeches, leading articles, advertisements and letters that we read, on the assumption that what are called &ldquo;inexorable economic laws&rdquo; are to prevail in dealing with the price of human labour, the wages paid to the men for their work, so-called laws which are only valid if we accept the proposition that the dominating factor in economic life is human greed and acquisitiveness&mdash;if we are to accept any other assumption than that then we have no right to consider the price of labour in the same category with any other commodities that are bought and sold in the market. I believe that we ought to have an understanding of our respective positions on that question.  If we are to deal with these problems in that light as though human labour is to be considered as boots or pig-iron, supply and <Col N="216" /> demand determining the price to be paid for it, then we know where we are, and I suppose we have to fall back upon the usual methods of getting the most you can at the opportune time, taking advantage of any opportunity, whether buying or selling.</P>
    <P>If that is to be the position, then, of course, the moral factor does not enter into it, and we are forced back upon the &ldquo;dog fight,&rdquo; as somebody called it&mdash;the scramble in the attempt to hold what one has in any circumstances, except fear or hunger, no other considerations being taken into account.  I wondered, when I read the reference to the necessity for deflation&mdash;presumably not referring to currency, but to high prices, high profits and high wages&mdash;I wondered whether the agriculturist would accept the proposition that high prices could not be sustained, and ought not to be.  Is it to be accepted generally that the price of wheat or beef, or bacon or butter, ought to be brought down still further, and that the high prices of those products are bad for the country, because that is the proposition in this address?  I have had my attention called to one firm's interest in the question of high profits, and I am going to ask the Dáil to listen to a few figures.</P>

      <P>A factor of very considerable importance in this matter is the price of the produce of Guinness's brewery.  I find that, for the years beginning 1918 and ending 1922/23&mdash;for those five years&mdash;the net profit of that firm amounted to £14,497,450&mdash;roughly, fourteen and a half millions&mdash;on an actual capital of two and a half millions.  Of course, that is not the present nominal capital.  It has been increased.  It was doubled in 1908 by the capitalisation of reserves, and it has again been very greatly increased.  But when one thinks of a net profit of fourteen and a half millions in five years out of the barley growers and consumers, one thinks there is need for a reduction in high profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make bold to say that a reduction in the price of porter and stout would <Col N="217" /> have an effect much greater than a similar reduction in the case of any other commodity.  In fact, I am rather dubious of the prophecies about reductions in retail prices as the result of any reasonable reduction in wages that might, by any means, be brought about.  Our friends, the Cork employers, for instance, told us that the total wages paid by the grocery establishments in Cork averaged only eleven per cent. of the price.  A reduction of ten per cent. &mdash;or, shall I say, twenty per cent. &mdash;in wages in those establishments could obviously only mean a reduction in retail prices of 5¼d. per 20/-. From enquiry into the cost of flour-milling and bread-baking and selling, I find that, taking the wheat from the ship's side, the milling of the wheat, the carrying of the flour to the bakery, the baking of the bread, the wholesale distribution of the bread and the retail distribution of the bread&mdash;taking the whole process from the wheat at the ship to the bread at the consumer's house&mdash;the total of the wages expended, according to the figures provided by the employers, was twenty-seven per cent. of the retail price.  I am giving these figures because I am rather hopeful that when we are asked to recognise the facts we shall be provided with the facts from all the various industries in which there are disagreements or where disagreements may be possible.  A recognition of the facts is very, very important, and a disclosure of the facts is equally important.</P>
    <P>I have, for instance, certain figures, which are not very recent, regarding an industry, but they will illustrate what I am trying to persuade those who may speak on behalf of employers to do for their industries.  A certain inquiry was made by a very competent expert accountant and statistician some years ago&mdash;pre-war&mdash;as to the costings from beginning to end of a certain production, and the segregation of those costs to the various heads.</P>
    <P>The result of that analysis was as follows:&mdash;£60,200 worth of wearing apparel was taken into account, and this particular class of wearing apparel was produced entirely in this country, except the seed from which the flax was grown.  The flax was grown, pulled, retted, scutched, and put through various <Col N="218" /> processes and carried from one operation to another, and all the processes were analysed.  Taking into consideration wages, salaries, rentals, interest and all the miscellaneous costs right to the preparation of the cloth into articles of apparel, the articles cost, retail, as I said, the sum of £60,200.  An analysis of this kind is very important, and it is very important that analysis of this kind should be divulged.  In this case the percentage allocated to wages paid to workmen right from the sowing of the seed to the handing over the counter of the finished article, was 36 per cent. of the retail price; salaries and commission, 17.5 per cent. of the retail price; rent 5 per cent. of the retail price, and interest charges 15.6 per cent. of the retail price.</P>
    <P>I would like to invite the representatives of some of the other industries of the country to allow analysis of this kind to be made and published so that the facts that we are asked to recognise may be made available.  We are told very often, and I think quite rightly and wisely, that we should look to Denmark for an example of how to carry through certain agricultural operations, or at least certain operations regarding the preparation and marketing and sale of agricultural produce. They have done extremely well. They have improved the country in a manner which is an example to the world, and it is important to bear in mind the conditions in Denmark, because of the very fact that it is Denmark which may be said to be the keenest competitor with the Saorstát in the chief market.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Hewat told us that the whole prosperity of the country lay in our export trade.  Ireland, he said, could live only on its power to export produce, and he said they would have to get down to principles and recognise that an agricultural country exporting its produce could not live and pay a rate of wages in excess of that paid in competing countries.  It is a country very like Ireland, inasmuch as its population is, to a very great preponderance, agricultural.  It has a few towns just as Ireland has, and some industries; it has more industries, in fact, than Ireland has, of a productive <Col N="219" /> character.  Nevertheless, it is perhaps as good an example for comparison as any other country that could be found, and it is more appropriate for a comparison because of the fact that so large a proportion of its agricultural produce is sold in the same market as our agricultural produce is sold.</P>
    <P>What are the facts in regard to urban rates of wages in that country, which is the competing country, bear in mind? The Dublin Employers' Association published a table&mdash;perhaps I may be wrong in that.  The table was published in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; a week or two ago, and it contained a comparison of the wages and hours of unskilled labour in Dublin, Northern Ireland and England.  The table was forwarded to the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; for publication.  It may not be the Dublin Employers' Association which is responsible, but we will take it that the figures are fairly accurate.  I have not got a close comparison of the various classes of employees in Denmark or Copenhagen with all those on this list, but I have some, and I think they are very important and worthy of consideration, especially in view of the statement made by Deputy Hewat regarding the impossibility of an agricultural country exporting its produce and paying a rate of wages in excess of those in competing countries.</P>
    <P>The building trade is often held up as a flagrant example.  Skilled workmen in Dublin in 1914 earned 38/-; there were some slightly more, but the general rate was about 38/-.  Six months ago to-day their wages were 82/6.  In Compenhagen, if we assume the same rate in 1914, and the rate of the increase to-day as compared with 1914, as against 82/6 to-day in Dublin you would have, for bricklayers, £5 3s. 7d.; the actual rate would be £5 5s. 7d., taking the current rate of exchange of a few months ago.  The case of carpenters is not quite so strong to my argument, but whereas in 1914 carpenters received 38/- and now receive 82/6 in Dublin, the present rate for carpenters in Copenhagen is £4 10s.  Let us deal with the labourers, which is the class of employee dealt with in this table.  We have in the table engineers' wages for 1914, 20/-; that is, I take it, <Col N="220" /> engineers' labourers.  In 1923 it is 53/-. The Copenhagen rate of wages paid six months' ago was 58/6.  Builders' labourers in 1914 in Dublin were 20/10, to-day it is 55/-, while in Copenhagen it is 82/-.</P>
    <P>Labourers in flour mills in 1914 were paid 18/-; in January, 1923, they were paid 57/-; in March, 1923, it was 54/6. The increase in Copenhagen, taking 18/- as the base, was to 54/6, which is practically identical with Dublin rates. The bakers' rate has risen from 34/- in 1914 to 94/- in 1923, in Dublin for skilled men.  The equivalent rate in Copenhagen was 91/8, a slight advantage from the employers' point of view over Dublin.  I have quoted this to show that notwithstanding all that has been said with regard to the rates of wages paid in Dublin, in the country which is quite acknowledged to be that which is in strongest competition with Ireland in its capital, the rates of wages are even higher on the whole than they are in Dublin, and the increase since 1914 has been higher than the increase over 1914 in Dublin.  It is well, therefore, to bear in mind that there are other facts to be taken into account than those which are made much of in the newspapers.  Those seem to be very striking to the uninitiated.</P>
    <P>I have desired in dealing with this matter to-day and at other times that we should try to avoid, if we can, or rather we should try to get away from the proposition which has been generally accepted, or acted upon at any rate, that conditions in Ireland must be determined by the conditions in England, and that we have got to think in circumstances in this country as far as possible in a detached way. I see signs that there is a pretty widespread reaction growing against the very idea of nationality and that the movement towards national freedom is to be undermined by forcing people to consider economic affairs in the light of British conditions.  Now I think that if we are to be carried away by that thought, then the last state of this country is to be worse than the first. There were certain advantages perhaps for urban interests at any rate, in thinking of this country's economic life as being part of the economic unit of Great Britain and Ireland, and we see <Col N="221" /> evidence of that reaction in the discussions that are centring round the Judiciary Bill, the salaries that are to be paid to Judges, and the necessity for keeping up certain standards.  I am very strongly of opinion that standards have to be readjusted.  There has to be a revaluation here, and I believe that if with the revaluation standard the adjustment of people's thoughts in regard to their relative positions were to be made, taken in conjunction with the proposition with which I started, that human labour must not be treated as a commodity in the market, then we can discuss the matter with some hope of finding a point of agreement.  Without that preliminary acceptance I do not see where there can be any point of agreement, and I can only see in front of us a continuous turmoil with each side trying to take advantage of its immediate temporary advantage.</P>
    <P>I take the view that the country is, as a matter of fact, top-heavy in the sense that there is altogether too large a proportion of the population engaged in non-productive services or engaged in no services at all.  I believe it is quite wrong and quite unjust that urban conditions should be so modelled, or attempted to be modelled, on urban conditions in England, which is an industrialised country.  I believe it is wrong that we should attempt to fashion our lines upon an industrialised country, or that the relations between urban and rural Ireland should be fashioned upon the relations between urban and rural England.  I think it is wrong that the agricultural producer should be placed in a disadvantageous position, economically, from the urban producer.  I believe also it would be right and proper for the community, urban and rural alike, to set itself the task of ensuring the agricultural producer against loss owing to causes over which he has no control.  These things are done, and can be done, provided the burden is fairly evenly adjusted; but when we are compelled, as we are by the attitude of mind and the arguments that are used in favour of a reduction of wages, to conclude that it is only because of certain temporary disadvantages that the workman is under, or certain inabilities that the employer is under, inabilities to make a sufficient <Col N="222" /> rate of profit to keep things going, that when it is only these arguments are used in favour of any change in wages or in economic relations, then we are forced to conclude that we simply must make the best of our chance and resist change as long as we can resist a change.  I submit that this whole question has been dealt with from the wrong angle.  It would have been a much wiser proceeding if employers had set out to say: &ldquo;We are prepared to maintain the present rate of wages and conditions, but give us greater effort and we will join with you in giving our minds and our hearts to the work of organising production and in improving output by one means or another, with better organisation and even better human effort.&rdquo;  If the whole problem of economic disadvantage had been approached in that way, in my opinion it would have led to a very much better result, and with more of a chance of success and less risk and danger to the State.  I said before that I have not been disabused of the fear that the future was dark enough&mdash;as dark as one could imagine a country of this kind could go through and as it has gone through&mdash;if we are simply to go ahead on the road that we have travelled in regard to economic relations. &ldquo;The resources of the nation are limited and the needs of many of its members great,&rdquo; the Address states. &ldquo;It is hoped with confidence that each citizen will take a full measure of the present burdens and expend a full measure of his or her energy or powers in bringing success to the efforts of the Government.&rdquo;  I fear that the method of approach that the Government is bent on is not calculated to bring that desirable end.  I would say that the facts that we are asked to recognise should be made known, that there should be an appeal to all sides to state fully and frankly and fearlessly everything they know about their business, about the prospects of their business, and of the risks that there are to the State and of the economic life of the community, and that the appeal should be made having divulged the facts and having made known the dangers, if there are dangers, and if these dangers can be proved with reasonable satisfaction. Then, I say the appeal should be <Col N="223" /> made for the co-operation asked for in this final paragraph of the Address. I do not believe that the support that was asked for is likely to come by any piece-meal attempts to settle the present disputes.  We have been told too often in everything that has been said on the one side, perhaps also on the other side, that those who have taken the initiative in driving down wages supported their action by the argument that wages must come down because they say their business will not stand the present rates.  We are told on the one hand that because costs of living have come down, men should be willing to accept lower wages, and on the other hand we are told that costs of living have nothing to do with it&mdash;that it is the cost of the article in the market which is the factor that determines and must determine the rates of wages. When the employers' side in these discussions takes two divergent views we are naturally led to the conclusion that, quite apart from the merits, the object is to get down wages at any cost, and with any argument and for any purpose. I ask for a presentation of the facts and I ask for the appointment of a court, such as is suggested, to deal not with one enquiry only, but to deal with all the trades that are in question. I believe if that proposition were acceded to and if matters were held in abeyance for a while until such courts could pronounce upon the position, the very fact of the enquiry pronouncing, without any question of compulsion, would be sufficient to satisfy all those engaged in the operations concerned. I believe further, and I suggest to the Dáil, that that being done, that there should be set up a Ministry or a Committee of a Ministry of Reconstruction and Development which would be composed, say, of a Minister as Chairman with two or three or four others to act with that Minister, such body having considerable powers to proceed with the necessary work of development and of restoration, or rather to proceed with the stimulation of that work.  That Ministry should also have considerable powers, if it has not got them already, to deal with over-charging, or profiteering as it is called, where flagrant cases can be shown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> I am glad to hear that the Minister is moving in that direction and that it is proposed to use such powers as he has.  As I said earlier, I am not quite so confident of the effect upon retail prices as the Minister seems to be and as the public is, but there are, no doubt, very many flagrant instances of over-charging, and still more instances of uneconomic methods of distribution. I feel that the conditions which we deplore&mdash;the unemployment of forty thousand people recorded, and one does not know how many more unrecorded &mdash;is not going to be met by the programme outlined in this paragraph.  I would like to see the whole question dealt with very much more radically than seems to be suggested in this paragraph.</P>
    <P>I hope my pessimism will prove to be unfounded.  No one would be more delighted if that were so than I.  I would like to see the basis of this hearty co-operation which is suggested laid by a full and complete disclosure of the financial needs of the country, the prospects before the country, the prospects before industry, the prospects before agriculture, and the prospects before the working men, if the evils which I fear do come into effect, and I am sorry that the paragraph in question does not give more promise of the improvement which I would like to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was relating to Leas-Cheann Comhairle the point I have already mentioned to you that the word &ldquo;Resolution&rdquo; in the Standing Order there, not merely by interpretation, but by previous practice, means some legislative Resolution, and not a Resolution applying to the business of this House.  I was about to draw his attention to the fact that on two earlier occasions Resolutions of this kind were before the House, one in the name of Mr. Gavan Duffy, who was then a member of the Dáil, and the other in the name of Deputy Seán Milroy, one of which was defeated and the other accepted, but they were both allowed and this rule was not used against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could quite clearly be interpreted that that rule would apply to a resolution of this kind, not a resolution <Col N="226" /> touching legislation, but a resolution definitely affecting the business of the Dáil.  The point I am putting to you now is a point of ordinary fairness, because when my resolution was handed in ten days ago there would then have been an opportunity for me to have got the requisite number of signatures, or to have attempted to have got the requisite number of signatures, but when you drew my attention to this possible interpretation of this Standing Order in spite of the previous practice of the Dáil, it was then already after half past one to-day, and very little opportunity was given me to comply with the Standing Order, as you yourself very fairly and courteously acknowledged.  I am, therefore, submitting, if this is to be the interpretation to be given to the Standing Order, that the interpretation should be given after to-day and not on this occasion, when obviously I could have no opportunity to have complied with the Order, inasmuch as my motion was handed in ten days ago and accepted by you, and put on the Orders of the Day, without drawing my attention to the fact that Article 38 would be likely to be interpreted now and in the future in a sense different from the interpretation placed upon it in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we can be absolutely held to our previous practice in all matters, because obviously we were learning a great many things, and our practices and our decisions when we look back upon them enable us to see that possibly we may have made mistakes.  It appears to me that in the case of Deputy Gavan Duffy, I allowed him to move a motion such as Deputy Figgis desires to move now.  In the case of Deputy Milroy, Deputy Milroy was the promoter of the Bill in question, and I think a certain amount of latitude should be allowed to the promoters of a Bill in endeavouring to persuade the Dáil to adopt a procedure different from the procedure which had already been agreed upon.  In this case, Deputy Figgis desires to alter the procedure which the promoters of the Bill desire to follow.  It seems to me that unless there is a reasonable prospect of <Col N="227" /> his succeeding the time of the Dáil should hardly be occupied with the discussion of such a motion.  It was with that in view that Standing Order 38 was originally framed, so that a motion to rescind a decision already come to would have to have the support of 25 Deputies, indicating that it had fair support in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In this particular case I am prepared to agree to a decision of the Dáil in the matter, but I think it is only fair that a certain number of Deputies should support the idea of discussing this motion before we allow it to be discussed. I would be inclined to waive the matter of the twenty-five names in writing, and to say if 25 Deputies supported Deputy Figgis in his desire to have this matter discussed it may be discussed.  It is merely a matter of preventing the Dáil being occupied with a debate which could have no useful conclusion.  If we adopt as a practice that when we decide to consider a Bill in Committee of the whole Dáil, a Deputy can give notice to rescind that decision, it is obvious that two Deputies could occupy us for a considerable time on practically every Bill. It is in order to avoid such a contingency that I think some stop should be put to such procedure by insisting that the motion should have a certain amount of support before it could be discussed.</P>

      <P>There were just two points, with your permission, sir, that I would like to put before you, and with your further permission I would like to put them in succession, because what you have to say on one will affect the other.  My friend, Deputy Wilson, had drawn my attention to the fact that Standing Order 38, to which you referred, does not say that the matter shall not be discussed. Standing Order 38 does specifically say that it shall not appear on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to remedy my own defects. <Col N="228" /> Standing Order No. 80 specifies that &ldquo;a Bill which has passed its second reading shall, by motion made without notice of debate, be referred to the Dáil sitting in Committee, or to a special Committee for detailed consideration.&rdquo; The Bill was referred to the Dáil sitting in Committee.

The only point I would like to put to you, and I appeal therefore to your impartiality, is that I have spoken to one or two Deputies since you drew my attention to Standing Order No. 38, and their reply was that they presumed that I would be setting forward the reasons behind this resolution in moving the resolution. Within a matter of a few moments, without the reasons having been stated and made apparent by their statement, I suggest it would be hardly fair to call upon Deputies, without having heard reasons, either privately or in the Dáil, to express their consent before this resolution be proceeded with.</P>

What I have said in regard to this Section would also apply to Section 5.  It is only right, in my opinion, that Irish titles should be given to all the Judges in the Courts.  It is within our knowledge that the title Dáil Eireann, is now not looked upon as a translation of anything.  That is because it was adopted right from the beginning.  We have a case in point in the Gárda Siothchána.  We hear people talking about a force called the Civic Guard, which does not really exist.  I suggest that if we put in here the Irish titles and use them right from the beginning, they will come to be known and to be used by everybody as a matter of course.  I do not presume to suggest what the titles should be, but I would urge the President to refer the matter to some of the Irish scholars whom he has at his disposal here, and to look into the question as to whether or not Irish titles for all the Judges of the Courts should not be designed and used right from the beginning.</P>

      <P>I would like to put one question, with regard to Section 4, that is more or less applicable to many other parts of this Bill. The Bill has been drafted upon the report of the Judicial Committee and, unfortunately, the drafting in connection <Col N="231" /> with the Bill is so nearly like, in general essentials, the report itself, that fundamental matters that ought to be provided for are not provided for at all.  I take this Section 4 as an instance of what prevails in many other parts of this Bill (Section 4 quoted).  The moment this Act is passed the old Judges cease to exist, because there is no Court in respect of which they can continue to exist until all of them, or some of them, are transferred to the new Court that has been created.  But it is equally true that all the other officers of the Court are dispensed with.  This Clause creates a new Court and attaches to it six judges, but attaches to it no other officers whatever. Neither the Registrar nor any of the other permanent officers is provided for.  Of course, it will be said that rules of procedure at some subsequent date will provide the officials, but between the enactment of this Act and the adoption of these rules of procedure, there will be no officers for these Courts whatever.  That is a fact that, I think, Deputies here little suspect. I think I am correct in saying that this matter was drawn to the attention of the Ministry in the last Dáil by Deputy Fitzgibbon, who intended to have raised it very forcibly on this occasion.  Not only will there be no officers, in the ordinary static meaning of the word, but no officers in the general sense in which solicitors are officers of the Court.  No provision has been made for them.</P>

      <P>It may have <Col N="233" /> come under the notice of some Deputies that by an oversight I tabled an amendment which was, of course, out of order, dealing with the later section setting out the remuneration of those Judges.  That was, to be more accurate, Section 14.  The purpose I had in view in that amendment was not so much the fixation of a salary as bringing under notice a doctrine.  It occurs to me that that doctrine could be brought under notice quite as effectually as a criticism of Section 7.  We have here two orders of Judges of the higher jurisdiction.  One of them is, in a sense, an inferior order to the other, and yet the onerous and highly special duties of the higher orders, to wit, those of the Supreme Court Judges, are to be discharged on occasions by Judges of the High Court, by Judges of the Court of first instance. There is to be a distinction between them in regard to salary and also to precedence, and yet it is contemplated that they may discharge the same duties under the same responsibilities. I would respectfully suggest that it would be a slight improvement of a very admirable measure if the Judges of the Supreme Court were kept apart and their duties reserved to the Judges of that special class.  Two very different sets of endowment or human quality are called for in regard to these two orders.  A Judge of the Court of first instance is largely dealing with juries, dealing with counsel who are arguing matters of fact as well as of law in the presence of juries.  His knowledge of human nature enables him to appreciate by the demeanour of a witness under examination the credibility or otherwise of the testimony submitted, the power of handling counsel, and of discharging some of those duties, which you yourself, Sir, so excellently discharged&mdash;these call for a particular kind of training, and they are looked for in an advocate in the Courts.  On the other hand, special aptitude and experience in the procedure of the Supreme Court are required to deal with more abstract things and with critical questions of law and the interpretation of law. The type of training and experience that fits a man for the position of a Supreme Court Judge is very special <Col N="234" /> and this interchangeability of the two seems to me to be somewhat of a blot on the Bill.  A Judge of the Court of first instance might very well be a part of the constitution of the Court of Appeal, but that he should, under certain circumstances, officiate as a Judge of the Supreme Court seems to me to be highly undesirable.  I would press that upon the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bill in the hope that the matter will be re-considered.</P>

      <P>The justification for this arrangement is that we cannot afford to set up a larger Court of Appeal. If it were possible it would have been desirable to get a Court of Appeal quite independent from what the Deputy calls the inferior Courts by having a larger number of ordinary Judges.  This particular practice is not unknown in this country.  It may not be at all necessary to resort to it, and I should say, from all the expressions of opinion which we have got on this Bill, there must be a plethora of useful material out of which it may be possible to man the Bench, and if it is well-manned in the inferior Courts the necessity for an appeal to the Superior Courts may not arise so often in the future.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;In line 47 to insert after the word `addressed' the words `officially by titles in Irish'.&rdquo;  I have been anticipated by Deputy O'Connell to some extent in the idea and spirit of this amendment.  My purpose was to draw attention incidentally to the letter addressed by the President to the Judicial Committee on whose report much of the present Bill <Col N="235" /> was founded and, if you will permit me, I will read it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the long struggle for the right to rule in our own country there has been no sphere of the administration lately ended which impressed itself on the minds of our people as a standing monument of alien government more than the system, the machinery, and the administration of law and justice, which supplanted in comparatively modern times the laws and institutions till then a part of the living national organism.  The body of laws and the system of judicature so imposed upon this nation were English (not even British) in their seed.  English in their growth, English in their vitality.  Their ritual, their nomenclature, were only to be understood by the student of the history of the people of Southern Britain. A remarkable and characteristic product of the genius of that people, the manner of their administration prevented them from striking root in the fertile soil of this nation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Our determination was to keep Ireland Irish and, just as a beginning has been made in the Dáil and had already been made in the University by promoting, or attempting to promote, the general use of the ancient language of the country, it is desirable that in the law courts especially a beginning should be made to use the national language for business purposes.  It will be in the recollection of Deputies that not very long ago one of the Courts refused an affidavit in Irish unless it were stamped again, and we had a debate on the subject in the Third Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what I said then, but I may briefly say that I drew a parallel between the situation here and what was the case of the Anglo-Saxon under the Norman settlement. All the respectable people during the Norman period used Norman Franch. It was the language of the higher clergy.  Above all it was the language of the Law Courts.  In that way the native speech of the people was supplanted. It is most desirable that in the education of the barrister and solicitor, Irish should be included, and as an inducement to that the purpose here was to set up the practice, a very small thing, of addressing Judges by Irish <Col N="236" /> titles in terms of respect of Irish character.  On consideration of the amendment I feel satisfied that, inasmuch, both in the recommendation of the Judicial Committee, and further in the later section of the Bill setting out the constitution of the rule-making authority and the matters to be dealt with by the rule-making authority, there is provision taken which ought to be deemed sufficient provision for arranging under the form of rules and regulations the title and mode of address. Therefore, I would ask permission to withdraw this amendment inasmuch as it is unnecessary for no other purpose than the purpose of propaganda, the purpose for which I used it just now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I may seem, by the repetition of this amendment through the three parts of the Bill, to be particularly bent upon the administration of an oath.  My objection&mdash;I should put it in this way&mdash; is rather to the precise form of declaration, inserted in the Bill.  I want something which will mark the solemnity of the appointment of a Judge, and in that way shall be indicative of the high responsibility attaching to the office, something to impress the popular imagination with the character of the Court as the administrative instrument of law and in fact as the protection of whatever of civilisation we can achieve. With all respect I submit that this declaration savours rather of the kind of formula which anyone appointed to a minor office might repeat&mdash;his undertaking to do his best while in office and that at the end of the term it shall not be a reproach against him that he did not do his best.  I shall be told, no doubt, that the whole trend in recent years is against the taking of an oath on the assumption of public offices.  That is a fact, I know, but it is precisely because it is a fact that I wish to resist the tendency in so far as regards Ireland at any rate.  In England the so-called education that prevails there has been productive of an attitude of mind which is now politely called agnosticism.  People have thrown over religious beliefs, and politeness requires that those who still cling to religion in some form or another should speak as if they had none.  If we are casting away English traditions in other respects why should we go out of our way to adopt them now?  We are doing away with the old Courts and old procedure.  Is it not more in consonance with the tradition of our own past that God and His government of the world should be recognised on solemn occasions such as are dealt with here?  No doubt men will take an oath <Col N="238" /> intending to interpret it according to their own peculiar fashion.  There is no binding declaration that could be framed that would have a coercive force over those who are unconscionable. On the other hand it will have a binding force.  It will have even a useful force inasmuch as those who listen to the judgment of a Judge will remember that he has solemnly called upon God to witness that he administers the law of the land without fear, favour or affection between all the citizens, and they will recognise at any rate in some measure that he is there not as the mere private individual they know him outside the precincts of the Court, but officially clothed with more than ordinary office and discharging in the name of the State one of its highest functions as a sacred trust. It is as part of the ritual and impressiveness on the part of public imagination that I contend for this and not because I conceive that any Judge who would be disposed to abuse his high office would be restrained by the fact of having an oath of a different form administered to him.</P>

      <P>On Section 14 I would like to say, in conjunction with my friend, Deputy Magennis, that I had an amendment down which was distinctly out of order but which, at any rate, showed how we stood in regard to the proposed salaries of these Judges.  What I would like the Committee to understand is that my view was not so much that these salaries should be increased, but rather that the practice adopted elsewhere should be put into operation here, and that is that all Judges should be placed on an equal footing with the exception, perhaps, of the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  That is a practice in operation in England to-day.  It works very well there, and we have just passed Section 7, which renders it possible for the Chief Justice to obtain the assistance of the Judges of the High Court.  Therefore, they are to that extent interchangeable, and I think that it would be advantageous to the State if it could be possible to have all Judges placed upon an equal footing, with the exceptions that I have mentioned, and I would ask the Government to take this suggestion into their consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has seen the Report of the Judiciary Committee. There were two or three Judges on it, and one of them an ex-Lord Chancellor, and the Bill contains their recommendations. On page 23 the Report <Col N="240" /> states that the salaries of the members of the Supreme Court be as follows:&mdash; The President, £4,000, and each Judge £3,000 per year.  On the previous page the salary for the President of the High Court was £3,000, and of the other members of the High Court £2,500.  On this Committee there was certainly a large majority of the legal profession, and ordinarily one would expect that they would make recommendations which, in their opinion, were fair recommendations. We know that Judges are paid much higher salaries in England than here, but this is certainly a country which cannot compete, I think, even in such an important profession as the legal profession, with the salaries paid in England, and I should say that I think, on examination, it will be found that in other countries they are not so well paid as in England.  It is a time for economy.  We have very, very large sums to meet under Article 10 of the Treaty, and even if the sums were inadequate&mdash;and our advice is that they are not; that they are fair&mdash; we are certainly approaching a period in the history of our country when economy must be practised, and I think that the Deputy ought not to press his recommendation in this case.  Generally speaking, these salaries compare favourably with the salaries that were paid before, and having regard to all the circumstances, I do not know that there would be any justification for the Government to recommend to the Dáil higher salaries than the Committee recommended, so that I am afraid I cannot undertake to give favourable consideration to the recommendation made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The President has not quite met the case that Deputy Redmond put in one respect.  I am absolutely certain that the Government wishes to do what is fair to the Judges, but he has not met the case.  We think that they should get equal pay for equal work.  Certainly I do not wish to increase the salaries of the Judges of the High Court, and I would rather reduce the salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court, but as long as there is the possibility of promotion for a Judge that Judge to a certain extent loses his independence, and for an extra <Col N="241" /> £500 a year a man might be inclined to become what people might think to be unduly subservient to the people who have it in their power to promote him to an extra £500 a year.  That is why I should like to see all the Judges placed on the same level.  I think the principle of giving Judges employed on similar work a similar rate of pay is a sound one on the whole, and I wish the President would consider whether something could not be done on the Report Stage or in another place.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has stated what I was about to state, that the President has entirely misconceived Deputy Redmond's point.  I only wish to add that there should be nothing that would induce the question of promotion from the High Court to the Supreme Court being considered except on the one question only, the fitness of the Judge for that other kind of work, and no question of promotion with regard to salary.  I think it is a principle that has been generally adopted in the other countries to which the President has appealed, that Judges ought to be paid on an equal basis.  It does not necessarily mean any extra expenditure.  It might mean a reduction in the expenses, but it does enforce a very salutary and very wise principle.</P>

      <P>In considering this matter the Committee gave very great consideration to the question of the Judges' salaries.  The point that has been raised that they should be all equal would, I think, be wrong, because the different Courts are on a different level, and must be so in the ordinary administration of justice.  The amounts put down as salaries are not as high as in Great Britain, but I think that that principle, and the President's remarks on that, apply a great deal more widely than in this case.  In our Free State we cannot aim to give any men the enormous salaries they get on the other side of the water.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to explain that I never suggested for a moment that Irish Judges should be paid a salary equal to that of English Judges.  What I was suggesting was that the system which was in force there, namely, that all Judges, with the exception of the three I mentioned in England&mdash;and it may be two in Ireland&mdash;should be placed on an equal salary, and on an equal footing.  All Judges in England are paid £5,000 <i>per annum,</i> with the exceptions I have mentioned.  I have never suggested and would not dream of suggesting that any Judge in Ireland would be paid that sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Cooper's and Deputy Figgis's criticism of my statement. This Bill represents as nearly as it is possible to represent the opinions presented to us by the Committee asked by us to advise us on this matter. These recommendations are their recommendations, and if Deputy Figgis has any misgivings about it, if he looks up page 23 on the constitution of the Court, he will find that one or more Judges, on the invitation of the President of the Supreme Court, may act in the Court of Appeal, and immediately underneath that the two salaries are mentioned, and on the preceding page £2,500 a year.  If that has not a bearing on the question raised I do not know what would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we are not going to start on such business as this on the principle and on the general line of argument that because a certain recommendation has been made in a certain way by the Judiciary Committee, that, therefore, we as a legislature are rendered helpless in face of that suggestion.  We retain, surely, our rights here as a legislature.  I know from members of the Committee that it is not their desire <Col N="243" /> that they should be used, or that their report should be used, here in any way as a cudgel.  The principle is not the question of the size of the salaries, whether they be large or small. The principle that has been stated is the principle that has been adopted as a result of experience in other countries, and that principle is that all Judges in the Central Courts of the State should be placed upon an equal level.  If the President states that the country cannot afford high salaries very well, let the Supreme Court Judges be reduced to the rate of the High Court Judges, but at least keep them on the same basis.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies who have spoken would suggest that the salaries should be £2,000 a year for all the Judges, I think they would have the support of the Deputies on these benches.  It would be something definite, at all events, to go upon.  I do think, though, that it makes for fair administration and that the Judges would be more independent of the Executive by putting them on the same level.  I think that is the point that Deputy Redmond makes, and it would appeal to most people.  I will not agree if they are going to be raised to the Supreme Court standing.  I think the point put forward is a sound point, and would make the Courts of Justice more independent of any Executive that might be, and that they would not use their position to please the Executive in order to get promotion.  That, I think, is the point made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was tabled at the special request of the representatives of the Bar Council of Ireland, and the case as presented by them to us who tabled the amendment, which was out of order by the way, was that through their experience of the past history of the Bar in Ireland there were men of this temperament, that so long as there was a salary higher than that of which they were in receipt their energies will be devoted by intrigue and by every variety of device that they could encompass to secure that high salary, and that that was not a healthy <Col N="244" /> spirit to develop in the future Bar. They pointed out that the representation that the money would come out of the taxpayers' pocket was a mistake, that a large part of these expenses are defrayed out of the litigant's pocket. There is scarcely a step that a man engaged in litigation can take in which he is not called on to disburse heavy fees, stamp duties, and what not, and it is from these well-springs of finance that the monies are procurable, and that, therefore, it is the interest of the litigant who has to pay through the nose for the law he receives to have the highest and best type of Judge that the money is able to secure.  It is true that the Judges in Great Britain receive a uniform salary of £5,000 a year, and that is spoken of as if it had no influence on or no relation to our present problem, at the very moment when the cream of the Bar, or a large part of it at any rate, is migrating to the other side.  From the very first moment that Irish independence was in the air distinguished members of the Bar began to get called to the English Bar, and have taken up residence there. and everyone has to admit that the attraction of higher emoluments, and of greater dignity held out within two and a half hours' steaming of where we stand, has an important effect, and will, in spite of patriotism, continue to have an important effect in diverting from the service of the Free State the better legal brain.  Whether we like it or not that is a fact we have to face. Are we going to retain in the service of Ireland the best legal minds and training and experience?  I have no doubt we shall be told this represents something like the average of the highest incomes at the Bar in Dublin. It possibly does, but let us remember that in the past, and more particularly in England, men in receipt of huge incomes at the Bar did not take judgeships until they were considerably advanced in years, until their medical adviser had told them they could no longer endure the strain of the work that was necessitated for the earning of these incomes, and that the medical practitioner would not be responsible for their health unless they went on the Bench.  Then you had the spectacle of very ancient lawgivers, on the <Col N="245" /> Bench, with criticism in the Press and Parliament with regard to their mental incapacity.</P>
      <P>Again I say, let us not follow British traditions in these things, but let us try to get younger judges from the beginning, men who are in the prime of life, and who are able to give their best.  With a view to that, which I think is a laudable object, we should have the remuneration of the High Court Judges something which has a real relation to the amount of income that it is within the competence of such men to earn.  There is another thing, too, which will arise later on, by which this matter can be prejudiced, to wit&mdash;the relative position of the Circuit Court Judge and the Judge of the Higher Judicature Court.  £2,500 for the High Court of first instance is, I suggest, at any rate as a venture, by way of a guess, arrived at, as Deputy Hewat himself almost told us, in order to have something for the Circuit Judge to move up to in his ascent by way of promotion. I shall have something to say, later on, with regard to the salary of the Circuit Judge, with a view to showing that it is not such as to secure the services of the men we wish to secure.  You will not be able to take away from the practice of the Bar the man whom you would like to seduce from practice, and to put on your Bench.</P>
      <P>Why not meet the equities of the situation by increasing their salary in the inferior courts?  I use the word inferior, I would remind the President, in its technical sense in regard to the Court below.  I am not disparaging it in any way.  I think in many ways it is the more valuable court.  You must have some distinction between them, and if £2,000 and allowances for expenses were an equitable salary for a Judge in the Circuit Court, then there is no reasonable relation between that and the £2,500 set down here.  These are some of the considerations that weighed with members of the Bar.  No doubt all this seems pleading for one profession.  It looks like an attempt to raise the wages on behalf of a trades union.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But on the other hand, remember that by a very natural propensity the member of the Bar is anxious to have an income comparable with that of his rival in medicine or in trade and commerce. There is the public advantage or utility to be considered also, and I have tried to impress upon the Dáil, as far as I could, that point of view.  I do not care personally whether the remuneration of the Bar be high or low.  It does not concern me as an individual.  But, looking at it from the point of view of how it affects the State, I do suggest to you that personal ambition, personal striving, men's sense of their value ought to be taken into account when we are considering legislation with the idea of doing the best for the country. £2,500 for one set and £3,000 for another set, and yet the Judges who are to receive £2,500 are to be in their own sphere like the British Jack-Tar who is soldier and sailor, too.  They are to be Judges of the Supreme Court and to officiate in the Courts of Appeal as well. Yet prudence and status are to be determined, and one of the factors must be salary.  Therefore, for all purposes they are equal except for the purpose of remuneration.  When it comes to be a question of the pay they are to receive they are inferior judges; when it comes to the question of the discharge of duty to the State, they are superior judges.  That seems to me an anomaly.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That Section 14 stand part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 15.</P>
      <P>There shall be granted to each Judge of the High Court and the Supreme Court who retires after 15 years' service or upwards in the said Courts or either of them, or vacates his office owing to age or permanent infirmity, a pension to be continued during his life of two-thirds of his salary at the time he ceases to act as judge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In line 25 to insert after the word &lsquo;retires&rsquo; the word &lsquo;voluntarily&rsquo; and to delete from the words &lsquo;or vacates&rsquo; to the word &lsquo;infirmity,&rsquo; lines 26 and 27, inclusive.  And at <Col N="247" /> the end of the section, line 29, to add the words `any Judge, however, of the said Courts, or either of them, who by reason of age or permanent incapacity is obliged to vacate his office shall be granted a pension according to a scale to be determined by Rules to be made under this part of this Act, and sanctioned by the Minister of Finance'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first part of the amendment is a very small thing.  It is a proposal to introduce the word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;retires.&rdquo;  The only reason for that is that a Judge who has retired is retired, but the Judge who has retired is not eligible for this Superannuation Allowance, and, therefore, for the sake of greater clearness and unmistakeability, I suggest to make the reference to the Judge who voluntarily or spontaneously withdraws from office.  It is not of great consequence, I must confess.  But the second part of the amendment is one for which I do claim more value inasmuch as, unlike the contention of the Bar Council of which I made myself the mouthpiece in the last Section, this is an effort to save the public purse.  It is obvious to anyone that a barrister might be elevated to the Bench and then within a few years, possibly within a few months, may develop an incurable disease.  He might have paralysis or might suffer from dementia, or he might be incapacitated in some other way, and under this provision as it stands he would be eligible for a retiring allowance of two-thirds of his salary.  Therefore, I propose that the retiring allowance in such cases should be calculated and should be determined upon some scale, and I suggest that that scale should be drawn up by the Rule-making authority.  I do not know that the amendment is in the best possible form, but I recommend the idea of it at any rate to the acceptance of the Minister.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;If in any case not expressly provided for by this Act a liability to any duty or any authority or power <Col N="252" /> not incident to the administration of Justice in any Court whose jurisdiction is transferred by this Act to the High Court or to the Supreme Court respectively shall have been imposed or conferred by any Statute, law or custom upon the Judges or any Judge of any such Courts, every Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court as the case may be except where otherwise expressly directed by this Act shall be capable of performing and exercising and shall be liable to perform and exercise every such duty, authority and power in the same manner as if this Act had not passed and as if he had been duly appointed the successor of a Judge liable to perform such duty or possessing such authority or power before the passing of this Act.

    <P>The members of the Committee may think that this is a very formidable Section, but in reality it amounts to very little.  Words, they say, sometimes are given to us to conceal our thoughts, but in this case the thought is a very simple one.  This Section is really only a continuing Section.  It proposes to continue certain powers that are already conferred by former enactments on holders of high judicial office, such as the present Lord Chief Justice and the present Master of the Rolls, and to continue those powers to their successors.  The present Master of the Rolls, for instance, is ex-officio head of the Charity Commissioners and I should think it would be most desirable that his successors should occupy the same position.  He is also Keeper of the Rolls.  The Lord Chief Justice of Ireland is ex-officio the Governor of several public institutions. Among other positions he occupies is that of a visitor to Trinity College, and, I am reminded by Deputy Sir J. Craig, the College of Physicians.  The new Section that I propose means merely that these powers which are <Col N="253" /> not exactly incident to the administration of justice in the various Courts should be transferred to the successors of these existing judges.</P>

I presume these offices were filled in an ex-officio capacity by resolution of these bodies, and they appointed the Lord Chief Justice or somebody else as ex-officio members, and the appointments were not made by the Dáil or its predecessor in any Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>The arguments used by Deputy Hewat do not apply as far as some institutions are concerned, because under the Act of Parliament, in connection with Trinity College, and under the Act of Parliament in connection with the College of Physicians, these men are appointed <i>ex-officio</i>&mdash;the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls.  If disputes arise they have to go before these gentlemen, and also questions of finance, for instance, in the case of the College of Physicians, which deals with Sir Patrick Dun's estate.  The accounts of this estate have to be submitted to these visitors of the College, who were appointed by Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>I think the statements made are not quite accurate because the visitor to Trinity College is not appointed by Act of Parliament at all.  He was appointed by King's Letter. I think the question raised by Deputy Redmond is a very important one and deserves more consideration <Col N="254" /> than we can give to it on this, the first time that the Bill has been before us. I would suggest that the point raised should be reserved for further consideration and taken, say, on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I submit that what Deputy Sir James Craig has stated has confirmed rather than contradicted what I said.  He states distinctly it was the Act of Parliament that Trinity College has got that confers this <i>ex-officio</i> position on the Judge.  Now this is not a private Bill for Trinity College or otherwise.  It is a Judiciary Bill, and I submit that the <i>ex-officio</i> appointments that are referred to have absolutely nothing to do with our Bill here, and that the proper way to approach that subject would be to get their Bills altered or amended if it is thought desirable.</P>

      <P>I think if you were to accept Deputy Hewat's reading of this amendment you would have ruled it out of order in the first instance.  If it has nothing to do with this Bill, therefore it should never have appeared on the Order Paper.  It must be remembered that many of these institutions carry on charitable work, and are you, I ask, going to put them to the expense of coming here to get a special Act of the Dáil to do a certain thing when you can put in an omnibus clause in this Bill that would give them the same powers and save them all this expense?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Hewat, I just wish to say that we are now abolishing these existing Judges, and one of the powers appertaining to the holding of the office of these judges was the exercise of these ex-officio powers and duties.  Surely when we are abolishing the existing office it is only right that we should make some provision whereby their successors should be in precisely a similar position in regard to these most important institutions, as some of them are.  Take, for instance, the Charitable Donations and Bequests.  That is a most important institution, and I think it would be unfair for us not to place the new substituted judge in a similar position and to give that institution the <Col N="255" /> benefit of his experience and knowledge, just as it had the previous benefit of the existing judges.</P>

      <P>There is a consideration that I suggest has been overlooked in the argument of Deputies Redmond and Hewat.  It is so long since some Deputies read the report of the Judiciary Committee that it is easy to understand that they have forgotten some of its details.  The recommendation there, which is acted upon in the framing of the Bill, gets rid of separate jurisdictions of every sort in the sense of having no more Masters of the Rolls in Equity Jurisdiction, no Bankruptcy Judge sitting in a Bankruptcy Court, and all the rest.  They are all, by a Section of this Bill, placed on an equal footing as Judges of first instance.  In other words, the reform which was begun in the eighties in the English Courts has been carried out to the last letter.  There was a time when there was a Court of Exchequer and a Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and there was a Court of Common Pleas, the President of which had his own distinctive title.  These things were abolished, and the Lord Chief Baron was known in a friendly jocose manner as &ldquo;the last of the Barons.&rdquo;  The title remained to him after the office had gone.  In this present Bill the reform has been carried still further.  The method of one Court, one Judge, if I may put it that way, is carried out thoroughly, and so if there were functions or duties attached to the Master of the Roll's position ex-officio, with the disappearance of that separate jurisdiction that ought to disappear, rather than be renewed in a Judiciary Bill on the assumption, which is not sustainable, that there will be someone among the Judges of the new Court who will occupy a position comparable with the office of the Master of the Rolls.  With all respect, I submit that there is a mistake underlying the contention that there is anyone to continue in the office of Master of the Rolls, but there is one office that does persist&mdash;the one that was formerly known as the Lord Chancellor. The office persists, but the title is that of Chief Justice or Chief Judge <Col N="256" /> of all the Judges, and the jurisdiction which belonged to the Lord Chancellor, and which was recently transferred on the extinction of that office to the Lord Chief Justice, now passes by a special operation of this enactment to the equivalent office.  That, so far as I can see from a study of the report prepared by the Judiciary Committee and of this Bill, is the only thing in this measure that is a continuation of anything in the nature of separate powers.  I would suggest, with all respect, that this amendment, as Deputy Hewat has contended, is not germane to this measure.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy Magennis is only correct in what may be described as the strictly judicial functions of the Judges concerned, and not in respect of the extra-judicial functions&mdash;functions attached, as it were, by passing.  One of them that I am concerned with more particularly, and one of very great importance, and one that may prove of very great importance in the future&mdash; affects the records of this country, which ought to be published and are published under the authority of the Master of the Rolls, as he is at present known.  That is strictly not a judicial capacity at all.  His judicial capacity, I believe I am correct in stating, has grown out of the other functions he held originally.  But the fact remains that whereas the exercise of his judicial capacity is merged in the new Court, this other function is not so merged, and should be merged and should be definitely attached either to the whole body or to certain persons of the whole body.</P>

Unless Government business is pressing we allow private business to go on these days. Towards the end of last session we had to make an appeal for the whole time for Government business, but ordinarily private business will go on at the time indicated.  I would say that this particular amendment appears to me to be very far-reaching in character, and I do not think I could recommend the Dáil to accept an amendment without seeing precisely where it is that we are going.  If there are emoluments, duties and offices other than those we prescribe in this Bill, we ought to have them defined, and knowing what they are, see how best to distribute them if it is considered advisable to distribute them.  If they are duties of an onerous character, taking up a considerable amount of time of a Judge, it might be well that they be re-distributed between three or four Judges, but I do not think that I could advise the Dáil to pass an amendment so sweeping in its character as this without much closer examination.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that nothing in this Act, nor in any rule made under its provisions, shall take away, or prejudice, the right of any party to an action to have questions of fact tried by a jury in such cases as he might heretofore of right have so required, nor upon any trial before a Jury to have the issues submitted and left to the jury before which the same shall come for trial with proper and complete direction by the judge upon the law and as to the evidence applicable to such issues; and provided that such right may be enforced by motion in the High Court, or by motion in the Supreme Court, in accordance with the practice at present existing in the respective Courts; and provided that subject to all existing enactments limiting, regulating, or affecting the costs payable in any action by reference to the amount recovered therein, the costs of every action, question, and issue tried by a jury shall follow the event, unless upon application made the Judge at the trial, or the Court, shall for special cause shown and stated in the Order, otherwise direct, and any order of a Judge as to such costs may be discharged or varied by the Supreme Court, and provided also that in all actions for Libel where the jury shall give damages under forty shillings, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to more costs than damages.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment contains two provisos, and those provisos are copied out of the Judicature Act.  The first proviso is from Section 48 of the Judicature <Col N="260" /> (Ireland) Act.  It is meant to preserve the right of any party to an action to have questions of fact tried by a jury.  The second proviso was put into the Irish Judicature Act advisedly after the English Judicature Act had given to the Judge a discretion with regard to costs.  It has been the practice in Ireland under a rule of the Benchers to make the costs follow the event in an issue tried by a jury.  Inasmuch as these things are already provided for by Statute, to seek to introduce them into the present measure seems a work of supererogation, and quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>But it was in the mind of certain members of the Bar that under a decision given some time ago in England it might be possible for the rule-making authority to make a rule which would in effect supersede this provision of the Judicature Act, but a rule-making authority cannot supersede by a rule an enactment of the Act which confers the rule-making authority upon them. Consequently it was to make this provision of the Judicature Act stand firm against any assault that the provisos were borrowed and introduced here. In England&mdash;we will make England be the bad example for this purpose&mdash;it was not unknown, when a judge had taken offence with regard to the too independent demeanour or conduct of counsel, that though the jury found for the offending counsel the judge refused to give costs.  Some of those who advocated this amendment were fearful that in coming years something of that kind might happen and they sought to preclude it.  Personally, when I look at the composition of the rule-making authority, and when I find, moreover, that the rules made are to be submitted to this Dáil for criticism, and may be annulled in consequence of criticism, I think that the amendment is not at all necessary.  However, as I tabled it on behalf, as I have said, of those who had this special interest in the matter, I am discharging my duty to them, who are in large part constituents of mine.  So that in one sense I am putting their arguments before you as their mouthpiece, and in another way expressing an individual opinion that the case is already provided for and, therefore, unless Deputy Redmond <Col N="261" /> seeks to press the matter, I would withdraw it.</P>

    <P>In the trial of all civil cases before a judge and jury, a majority vote of nine of the twelve members of the jury shall be necessary and sufficient to determine the verdict.

The Section says: &ldquo;In the trial of all civil cases before a judge and jury a majority vote of nine of the twelve members of the jury shall be necessary and sufficient to determine the verdict.&rdquo; The wording implies that there must be twelve.  By consent in practice there may be only eleven, and it was to obviate that interpretation that this amendment was put down.  Some formula of this tenor would meet the case: &ldquo;In the trial of all civil cases before a judge and jury a majority vote in the proportion of nine to twelve,&rdquo; or something of a similar nature.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;When any action shall be pending in a Circuit Court, any party to such action may, at any time before service of notice of trial therein, apply to the High Court that the action be transferred to the High Court or to some other Circuit Court; and thereupon if the Court shall consider that the action is fit to be tried in the High Court, or owing to the special circumstances of the case ought to be transferred to such other Circuit Court, it may order such transfer upon such terms in either case, and subject to such conditions as to costs or otherwise as may appear to be just; and every action so transferred to the High Court shall proceed therein in the same way as if it had originally been instituted in the High Court subject to such rules as may be made regulating the utilization of the pleadings already provided for the Circuit Court; and in the event of an action being transferred to another Circuit Court the judge thereof shall have the same jurisdiction as if it had been commenced in his own court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Fortunately for the Dáil this amendment speaks for itself.  As regards Part I. of the Bill, it deals properly with matters relating to the High Court jurisdiction, but this Sub-Section refers to cases pending in a Circuit Court, and empowers any party, before service of notice of trial, to apply to the High Court to have it transferred to the High Court or to some other Circuit Court.  Now, in the place where more logically it might be introduced on page 6, in these amendments, Deputy Duggan has tabled an amendment covering the whole ground and some more perhaps.

If either of the parties apply to the High Court for transfer from the Circuit Court, it seems to me, and I am very innocent of those legal questions, that you are inviting the wealthier of the two parties to penalise the poorer by going from the Circuit Courts to the High Court.

      <P>I move: To delete all words from &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; at the end of line 48, to the word &ldquo;which,&rdquo; at the end of line 54, inclusive.  I think this is rather important in principle, but it does not require very much to explain it.  The effect of the amendment would be to make the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal final and conclusive, and prevent the possibility of a further appeal, provided the Attorney-General sanctioned it.  I believe that is the practice adopted in certain other countries, <Col N="266" /> particularly America, and that it has been found to be most disadvantageous. I suggest that we should not follow it.  It would throw upon the prosecuting counsel the duty of saying whether a decision ought to be challenged further or not.  Certainly it does not seem to me a thing to be recommended. I suggest, for the consideration of the Government, and the President in particular, that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal should be final and conclusive.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Thrift in this amendment, and in doing so I would like to remind the Committee that this is an entirely new departure, the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal.  Having that Court of Criminal Appeal, I venture to suggest it should be final and decisive. According to this Section, it shall rest with the Attorney-General whether the appeal shall be taken from the Court of Criminal Appeal or not, and one is bound to realise that the Attorney-General is a party to every criminal proceeding.  He is the law officer of the State and, without in any way disparaging the occupier of the office, whoever he may be, it must be recognised that he is a biassed party and in some cases it is possible that the Attorney-General might feel hurt if he had not been successful in his prosecution and might desire to take it to a further Court.  That is really only a small point, but the question whether there should be an appeal at all from this Court of Criminal Appeal is a very important point and should be very carefully considered by this Committee. What is the necessity to have two Courts of Appeal from a criminal conviction? At the present moment we have none.  I gladly welcome the proposal to institute one.  I think it is most proper and humane, but why not finish there with that one, and make it final and conclusive?  It is true, I understand, in England and elsewhere, that there is an appeal, but, as in other matters we have been already appealed to to stand upon our own in these affairs, I suggest that our Court of Criminal Appeal should be the final and decisive Court to determine an appeal that has come from a previous conviction.</P>

      <P>I would like to oppose the amendment.  The clause as set out here leaves appeal to the Supreme Court, which will have to take an exceptionally high position in the new order of things.  There is abolition of the appeal to the House of Lords and unless our Supreme Court takes up a very high position we will miss the decision of the House of Lords and the atmosphere surrounding such decision in the future.  We all know that the law and the lawyer may define the law in a very technical sense, and will have some hesitation in going outside the law to do justice.  The great strength of the appeal to the House of Lords in the past has been that you got out of the technicalities of the law and got broad justice.  I think that is what is wanted here, and that is what I would hope our Supreme Court would fulfil in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that a good part of what Deputy Hewat has stated hardly applies, because the House of Lords has no decision in respect of criminal appeals at all. There is one additional argument, and it affects what Deputy Hewat has said, and bears also on what Deputy Redmond has stated.  Bias may not exist in the Attorney-General.  I should hope that in very few cases would there be any question of bias existing in the Attorney-General, but, inasmuch as he would be a party to the proceedings if he gave his certificate so that the matter should be carried from that Court, which is already a Court of Appeal, to a higher Court, bias would unquestionably be imputed.</P>
      <P>As to the point about the Supreme Court, if the Attorney-General were to give a certificate from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court happened to support the Attorney-General in that specific instance, bias may also happen to be imputed to him and also to the Court.  Generally, I think there is everything to be gained that there should be now a Court of Criminal Appeal in Ireland.  Having created that Court let it be a final court, and let its judicial review be final, with no prospect of appeal further.  Appeals upon appeals must necessarily be bad and injurious.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might remind the Committee that my attitude in this is not at all favourable to my brethren at the Bar, because the more appeals there are the better it is for them.  On the contrary, the attitude I adopted in this is to curtail and make final the decision of the Court of Appeal.  It might be said that a higher appeal would lie to the Privy Council.  That is a matter which would require consideration, but whether that further appeal did lie according to our Constitution or not I feel confident at any rate that the Privy Council, who are the final and only arbiters as to what shall be taken by them, and what shall be heard by them, would never dream of accepting or of hearing a case on appeal from an Irish Court of Criminal Appeal, which had been made final and conclusive by this Dáil. Therefore, it is with that feeling of confidence in regard to any future action by the Privy Council that I ask you to approve of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I did propose to accept amendment 21.  If we are giving let us give generously, and I would have the Supreme Court of Appeal the final tribunal before whom any person should have an opportunity of appearing if he thinks injustice has been done to him.  That, I think, is fair, and the person is entitled to it.  There is just the possibility that an attempt might be made to skip the Supreme Court if it were not there, and to go direct to the Privy Council.  I do not think that is desirable.  It will not make for confidence in the institutions we are putting up, and I do not think that the Deputy should press this particular case.</P>

The Clause provides that the certificate of the Attorney-General would justify an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The point is raised that the <Col N="269" /> Attorney-General should not be the only decider as to whether the matter in question was of exceptional importance. The Judges of the Courts would be capable of deciding upon such a question just as well as the Attorney-General, and the Clause should allow, I submit, the Court to give such a certificate.
