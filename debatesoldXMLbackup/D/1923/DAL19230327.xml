      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that many traders and others in the towns of Mallow and Fermoy, Co. Cork, whose premises were burnt out by Black and Tans in September, 1920, are most anxious to start rebuilding those premises and are prepared to start this work and give employment to many men &mdash;who have been out of work now for a considerable period&mdash;the moment the Minister makes his awards; whether the Minister can state definitely when those awards will be made, and also whether any awards have been made by his Department to persons in Mallow or other areas whose premises or property was destroyed in 1921?  If so, can the Minister inform the Dáil whether these people are now reconstructing and why the claims of 1920 are being held up while the claims of 1921 are investigated and awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the position in regard to compensation. In cases of malicious damage to property inflicted within the period 21st January, 1919, to 11th July, 1921, where no final decree exists or where the Council of the County or County Borough in whose area the damage <Col N="2487" /> occurred did not appear in Court by Counsel or Solicitor in opposition to the claim, compensation is determined by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission and is paid by the Minister of Finance. Payment is made as soon as possible after notification and, generally speaking, in the order of notification.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to define the order in which particular cases may mature for payment, but there has been no discrimination in favour of any particular year.</P>
      <P>Up to the present awards have been received in nine cases in the town of Mallow, and in one of these, in which the amount involved was £57,700, payment was made four months ago.  In the other cases the amount involved is comparatively small and does not in any case exceed £150.  These will be paid in due course without avoidable delay.</P>
      <P>Approximately 45 other cases in the town of Mallow have been registered in my Ministry, but still await determination. It is not for me to say in what order the commission will have them investigated, but they must obviously be guided to a certain extent by the conditions existing in the particular areas.</P>
      <P>No awards to owners of property in the town of Fermoy have as yet been notified by the Commission.</P>
      <P>Cases where final decrees exist and where the Council of the County or County Borough appeared in Court by Counsel or Solicitor in opposition to the claims are not subject to review and are paid by the Minister of Finance on application by the holders of such decrees. I have received notice of no such cases in the town of Mallow, and of 16 in the town of Fermoy.  In four of these cases I have caused advertisement of intention to pay to be issued in the usual way in the &ldquo;Irish Oifigiuil,&rdquo; and the remaining cases are at present under investigation in my Department.</P>

Definite proposals were being awaited from Messrs.

Larkin&mdash;who accepts responsibility, with the object, as specified, of creating employment; further, is he aware that this interference will mean an estimated increase of £20,000 or tenpence in the pound, added to the rates of County Limerick, and whether there is any legal responsibility upon the ratepayers of Co.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>We come now to consider a piece of legislation about which there will be no unanimity either in the country or in the Dáil; and there is, of course, a reason for that probable absence of unanimity.  The Bill is not in the interests of all the people.  It is not claimed, it never has been claimed, and <Col N="2498" /> it is not proposed to claim now that it is directly in the interests of all the people.  The case for this Bill would be rather that it is so much in the interests of a section of the people which is not inconsiderable, that the other section, possibly larger, who may be slightly inconvenienced by the Bill, should be prepared to put up with that inconvenience for the sake of the greater good.  The case for the Bill is based on National economy in the broadest sense, the saving of light and fuel, considerations of public health, reacting, as they must, on the generations in the future. The case against the Bill is that the agricultural community will have to do a sum in subtraction every time they look at their watches.  Besides, much as some of us might wish it, we do not stand alone.  We do not stand absolutely isolated in the world's scheme.  We form part and parcel of an economic group, and there is interdependence rather than independence between the communities of that group.  Considerations of commerce, considerations of public convenience in two countries closely grouped and associated are in favour of this Bill.  The question of trains, traffic generally, post office considerations, banking considerations, and so on, are behind these proposals, and much as I have tried to investigate the matter I can find no really substantial considerations against the Bill that should be allowed to outweigh the good to the commerce of the country, and to all that large body of people within the country whose fate has thrown them into the position of being indoor workers.  The extra hour in the evening for these people is of very definite value, and of very definite value not merely to them, but to the country as a whole. There is not a pulmonary disease or a nervous disease which cannot be traced one way or another back to the lack of exercise, and back to the lack of fresh air.  The advantages of fresh air and the health-giving rays of the sun are invaluable. The presence or absence of that extra hour will react in the future for the people whose lot throws them into the group of those who work behind closed doors, and inside walls.  That will react ultimately upon the health of those people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to make for a stunted, degenerate, neurotic population we will deny to those indoor workers that extra <Col N="2499" /> hour's sunshine and exercise in the evening.  The case against the Bill is not as considerable as it seems.  A good deal of this opposition sprang up in the first year when this legislation was introduced. It was introduced as a war measure, and we can say that the bulk of the people of this country were not with the British in that war.  The British introduced this Bill as a measure of national economy&mdash;to save fuel and light in a time of war&mdash;and we, in our own way, said, &ldquo;Well, if it suits them it cannot suit us, and if it is going to be a help to them we should be against it.&rdquo; We make no apology for that, and we never did make apology for it.  It was the traditional policy of this country to be always for the Power that was against the country that was sitting on our chest.  Then in that state of anti-British feeling in the country, this Summer Time Bill came on and we all raised our plaintive voices against &ldquo;this rotten British time and this rotten British legislation.&rdquo; Now, with the responsibilities of our own housekeeping upon us, we have to realise that for this as for other measures operative in the past there is a good deal to be said, and there is a good deal of sound sense to recommend it.  We have to get out of that mere irresponsible and unsound criticism of measures of this kind.  There is just one particular section amongst the agricultural community which this Bill does not suit and that is the farmer on a very big scale who carries on both mixed and dairy farming.  I have his case here and I will read it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Agricultural opinion, though by no means unanimous on the point, is unfavourable to Summer Time.  Investigation shows that there is very little reasonable ground for this opposition. Indeed, except in the case of mixed farming&mdash;that is combined dairying with corn growing&mdash;scarcely any hardship arises.  This class of farming is not extensively pursued in Ireland and no difficulty occurs except during the harvesting.  Where dairy farming is engaged in, milkers are required to rise very early in order to have the milk ready for the delivery trains. Then a break occurs in their work as owing to heavy morning dews harvesting operations must be postponed until the day is well advanced.  If <Col N="2500" /> this interval is spent in carrying out minor duties on the farm, the employers are forced to pay overtime rates for the extra work necessary in the evening, which appears to be the best time for bringing in the crops for storage in the haggards.  It must be added, however, that these difficulties are not experienced by farmers engaged in fruit and market gardening because fruit and vegetables are benefited by being gathered with the dew on and transported during the cool of the day.  Besides, farmers in the vicinity of large towns owing to Summer Time have additional sources of labour for evening work during the harvest season thrown open to them.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in Ireland appears to be due to the agricultural labourer being disinclined to change his hours of labour.  The probable reason is that by the operation of the Labourers' Act he has become possessed of a plot of ground to which he devotes his spare time and he is therefore unwilling to work for his employer after six o'clock in the evening. If this difficulty could be overcome by some arrangement, whereby his employer would grant him facilities for looking after his allotment&mdash;say by the loan of horses or implements or an occasional day off&mdash;the opposition of the farming class to Summer Time would dwindle away.</P>
    <P>Taking a broad view of the question the country districts are dependent on the towns for the marketing of most of the produce of the farms, and the inhabitants of the towns are overwhelmingly in favour of the continuance of the Summer Time arrangements, having benefited morally, physically and materially thereby. It seems therefore in the best interests of the State that the farming community should be induced to make arrangements so that the artificial advance of the day by one hour during the Summer months should not adversely affect their interests.  In practically all the European countries which have adopted the Summer Time principle, the farmers have met the same difficulties as in Ireland, but the national and international benefits have been so great that the farmers have withdrawn their opposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2501" /> After this piece of legislation had been in operation in England for some time a committee was set up to hold a searching investigation into its effects, and to show whether in their opinion that legislation should be continued or not.  I have the report of that committee before me, and it shows from a great many different sections of the community, an opinion overwhelmingly in favour of the altered time for the summer months.  I propose to read one of two clauses of the report of the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee says that the replies received to the very comprehensive inquiries described under para. 9 show beyond all question that the opinion of employers in every trade in industry and business throughout the country is overwhelmingly in favour of summer time.  The Committee summarise the evidence on point of detail under headings such as the Effect on Health of Workers, the Saving of Artificial Light, and so on.  The only industry which had any opposition to offer was the cotton trade.  The evidence under the heading of Public Health is very striking, and in a section here dealing particularly with the effects in Ireland the difference of opinion amongst the rural community is admitted.  But the case simply rests on this: That the advantage to the town workers and to the people who work indoors is so very great that the slight practical inconvenience to the agricultural community should be borne, and borne cheerfully, for the sake of the greater good of the country as a whole.  In addition to the advantage to health of a large section of the people, there is also the very large question of the National economic aspect.  It would be impossible to produce figures showing to what extent the country benefits, but it stands to reason that there must be a very considerable national economy in fuel and light as a result of the operation of the Bill.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Before offering any observations on the Bill I want to extend my sympathy to the Minister who introduced this measure.  I sympathise with him in the platitudes that he uttered, and in which he did not believe.  It is quite patent to anybody sitting here, that <Col N="2502" /> he does not believe in what he urged.  Of course, we cannot blame our modern legislators.  They are attempting to do something that was never done before. They are attempting to do something that the Creator never intended should be done.  It seems to be that this phase of modern legislation aims at out-doing the Creator.  They are trying to show that they are cleverer and know more than the Lord did when he created the world.  I have listened to the Minister's opinion about English opinion.  Everybody knows, without being told, that England and Ireland are two different countries.</P>
      <P>English time is considerably earlier than Irish time according to the sun.  I think there is a difference of between 25, or perhaps, 45, minutes between Irish and Greenwich time.  That has already been conceded.  Added to that you want another 60 minutes.  There is no similarity between Ireland and England in the matter of industry.  Ireland is purely an agricultural country; practically speaking, it has no other industries worth talking of.  England is purely an industrial country.  The bulk of its population works in factories.  There is no similarity between the peoples of the two countries as regards their method of living, or their outlook.  We have listened to a lot about fresh air in the evening.  I would like if the Minister, or anybody who has studied this question, would give us figures, or even decimals of figures, indicating the difference between fresh air in the evening and fresh air in the morning.  It may be worked out in fractions for that matter, but I would like to get the figures. If one gets off an hour earlier in the evening it means that one goes into a factory an hour earlier in the morning. I would like the Minister to give us the relative values between the morning and the evening air.  How will an extra hour do all the things that the Minister claims? It is all very well to make statements and to read extracts from reports, but how can he prove the claim he makes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that you can prove anything on paper; you can for fools, but I think, you cannot prove very much to men who know their business, and who believe that God was right and that He knew a little about the world when He created it.  Why not go the whole hog and make this country similar to Australia?  You are looking for 1 hour and 45 mins.; why <Col N="2503" /> not go the whole 12, and convert night into day?  It is a wonder this&mdash;shall I call it a disease&mdash;has not spread to Canada and the rest of the Colonies, and that they are not putting on the same time in their countries as in England.  It would be quite as logical, and there would be as much reason in so doing as there is in this proposition.  The Minister has admitted candidly that this measure is not in the interests of all the people.  As a matter of fact, I believe it would be in the interests of a very small section, possibly one-fifth or one-sixth of the population. We are asked at this age of the world to allow the one-fifth or the one-sixth to make arrangements whereby they would be considered, while the remainder would be made white slaves.  It is argued that the alteration would be good for some.  Perhaps it would be good for Bank officials and others of that sort.  In my opinion, one of the reasons that we have taken up this is because, as a people, we have been fond of taking up cant phrases and cheap inventions.  A cant phrase is not out three or four days in England when it is in vogue in Ireland. We are fond of imitations without considering whether the things we imitate are right or wrong, or are likely to be successful.  A Commission on Agriculture has been sitting for some time.  Has any evidence been given, by witnesses examined there, in favour of this measure? This Commission has been dealing with an important industry in this country, and evidence has been given before it that represents the considered opinions of men who know their business&mdash;not mere platitudes from those who do not. How would this suggestion go down with the bog men of Leix or Offaly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Kilkenny; or, to go further still, how would it go down with the people in Clare, where time counts for most?  Has any evidence been given at the Commission in favour of this measure?  I do not know what evidence has been given, but I venture to ask that question, because I know there are sensible men giving evidence there, and I am sure that not a word in favour of summer time has been said. Here are some of the arguments that can be put against this measure:&mdash;The average agriculturist is not a fool.  He knows that the early morning is not the time to <Col N="2504" /> do work.  In the morning they are waiting for the dews to clear away in order to allow them to deal with crops. We know that people have to get up to milk cows in order to supply the Dublin markets; they have to get up at an early, unseasonable and unnatural hour.  We want to drive them to get up an hour earlier, so as to give comfort to a few of the fly-boys about the city.  We want, by this suggestion, to have the railway trains start an hour earlier, to get the people up to do the milking and to get that milk on the trains an hour earlier than should or could be the case, if any interest were taken in the people's welfare. In the creameries work would have to be started an hour earlier, and, because of that, earlier hours would have to be observed by those who send the milk long distances.  Of course, these things will not count in the scheme of things here.</P>
      <P>The schools are another matter.  People in the country generally have families, and in the morning they have a good many other things to do in addition to getting the children ready for school. Now they cannot do the latter.  Fairs are another matter.  You have markets here in Dublin.  Trains all have to be run an hour earlier.  I make a very fair proposition.  We want to give the same liberty to people in the country as we would like to have ourselves.  We do not want to coerce the residents of cities or towns, and if people in urban areas want to make arrangements let them do so.  We give them the liberty we demand for ourselves.  We will not have laws from them, but we have no objection to their making laws to suit themselves. I want to be quite honest with the Minister and the Dáil on behalf of our people.  We have opposed this under the English regime.  We have opposed it as much as we can.  We will continue to oppose it, and to obstruct this measure, and will call on our people to refuse to send their children to the National School.  We will block this measure in every way we can.  We look upon it as an unnatural measure, because it is an attempt to improve on nature, and I have not so much respect for the arguments of the legislators as to think that they are able to improve on nature.  Notwithstanding the fact that I have a respect for the Minister, I ask the Dáil to reject this measure.</P>

      <P>I was waiting for my friends on the left to indicate in what way they looked on this particular measure, but I notice they are rather in the background to-day.  There are members on my left who represent a considerable portion of the rural dwellers in this country.  The leading member on the left represents a good deal of agricultural labourers in North County Dublin.  Every morning in the week Dublin has a market, and he is condemning his constitutents, if he does not vote against this measure, to six or eight hours' night time in the week. The Dublin market opens for potatoes at 8 o'clock.  The unfortunate farmer has to get up at 3-30, if you calculate three hours for driving and 1½ hours for getting ready, to oblige people in the city.  The thing is morally wrong.  We are told that the majority should rule. Here is a measure principally directed for the management of the people in the cities, and the requirements necessary for them.  These requirements could be met by private arrangement. We are told that railway and banking arrangements hold in accordance with other countries.  Banks open at 10 o'clock in the morning.  Why could they not open at 9 o'clock?  What is wrong in saying that all Banks should open at 9 and close at 2?  All the Chambers of Commerce could do the same, and you would have the same advantages effected as you have in this Bill, and you would not be forcing us in the country to fall in with those new-fangled ideas which we do not require.</P>
      <P>I shall not touch on the obstruction to agriculture with which Deputy Gorey has dealt, but I would point out that Germany was a great nation before she brought in this new time.  So was France, and so was England, and the French to-day are wondering whether they shall not dispense with this measure, and adopt what is known as the Strasburg hour, which will place them in the same position as we are in to-day. We are twenty-five or thirty minutes in front of the sun.  You cannot say the people in France are not intellectual, and they have a population of 40 millions in the country.  With all the association they have with others they will dissociate themselves from their neighbours. Why cannot we who are the most western people of Europe, the last place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The West of our country is fully 9 degrees west of the No. 1 Greenwich Meridian, and therefore we are fifty per cent. handicapped over Scotland, England, France and even Germany.  Germany has it all her own way.</P>
      <P>As regards the national standpoint I would point out to the Minister for Home Affairs, and I also have respect for this Minister, because he deals with those matters in a businesslike way, that he is going to impose legislation which he knows will not be carried out by the majority of those in this country. He knows that four-fifths of the people will not give a twopenny ticket for his legislation, and will not obey it, and he cannot make them obey it.  He could avoid all this by letting things run as they were running, and by advising the Chambers of Commerce, the Bank Managers, and the Insurance Companies to bring their employees one hour earlier in the morning to the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the sympathy of the Dáil in the particular dilemma I am in at the present time.  I am torn between two allegiances.  On the one side you have a large proportion of the farmers, and on the other you have practically everybody else.  That is a rather awkward position to find myself in, but there is one comfort, and that is, that we can treat the question upon its merits and not as a political or class issue.  The merits of the case are, to my mind, simple enough.  To one section there is not a loss but a certain amount of inconvenience, and to the other section summer time is not only a convenience, but a positive gain.  That sums up the position.  I have listened to Deputy Gorey and Deputy Wilson, and neither has alleged actual loss.  The most they have alleged is inconvenience in a greater or less degree.  In fact, I have not seen it suggested anywhere at any time by any of the opponents of summer time, that there is actual loss to any class, so <Col N="2507" /> I repeat that the position is that you have on the one side a certain amount of inconvenience, and, on the other, not only convenience but positive gain.  If that truly represents the position I do not care whether we speak for the farmers, for commerce, or for any other class, I think it is the duty of Parliament to regard the country as a whole, and to pass this Bill.  There would, I agree, be actual loss as far as farmers are concerned if they had to start work an hour earlier&mdash;if their workmen came an hour earlier and left an hour earlier that would be a considerable loss, it would be losing an hour's sun, but, as far as I know, and I have discussed the question with many farmers, there has never been any difficulty in making arrangements with agricultural labour.  Simply the thing is that the labourer comes to work an hour later by the clock and goes an hour later. It would be a serious thing, I admit, if that could not be done, but, as far as I know, there has never been any difficulty in making the necessary arrangements. Deputies stated that the country will not observe this time or obey this law.  It is one of those laws that ought to be very popular in this country, because it does not matter two pence whether you obey it or not.</P>

The Minister for Home Affairs has evidence which shows that the adoption of summer time has had a very beneficent influence on public health generally.  In regard to travelling, farmers travel less than business men, and small farmers hardly travel at all by train.  Business men want this.  It does not make any difference to a farmer whether he has to catch a train at 10, 11, 12, 1 or 2 o'clock; <Col N="2508" /> he makes arrangements accordingly.  In one case there is serious inconvenience, and that is to the farmer who has to take his milk every morning to the train, say, at 8 o'clock, but that applies only to a section of the community small in numbers who have to take their milk, let us say every morning to the train at 8 o'clock, or their cattle two or three times in the week, on market mornings.  They have to get up and have their cows milked, and the milk at the train at, say, 7 or 8 o'clock; that is a certain amount of inconvenience, but will anyone who thinks over the subject say that it is in any way commensurate with the gain from the adoption of summer time? Great inconvenience and confusion would be caused to the whole commerce of the country by not adopting summer time, and by having our Post Offices, Banks, Railways, Shipping Offices and Stock Exchanges, and so on, run on a different time table.  If I am right in stating that there will be no difficulty in arranging with agricultural labour to come in an hour later and leave an hour later by the clock, I do not see any inconvenience.  I have examined the subject very carefully, and to the small farmer who travels very little, and does his own labour it means little or nothing.  He will grumble about it, and object to it.  If he asks you the time and you say, &ldquo;it is 6,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;is that 5 now, or is it 7?&rdquo; His objection to it is the mental effort that it requires to make the necessary calculations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what it comes to.  There is no question about it, but that to the commerce of the country it would be extremely serious if we did not adopt the same time-table as the countries with whom we trade.  There is no representative of commerce here who will not admit that; in fact, commerce is calling cut for it.  But even apart altogether from these great advantages I would be sorry to think that farmers, as a class, would be so illiberal for what is only an inconvenience to themselves, and at that a small inconvenience, as to begrudge the people who live indoors, who work in offices, in factories, in cities, the measure of enjoyment that long summer evenings will give them.  I do not believe that any farmer who thinks over it would for a moment, for the sake of a little inconvenience he would have to suffer himself, deprive all the other classes of the <Col N="2509" /> positive advantages in the way of leisure, the enjoyment of the sun and the open air that they could get in the long summer evenings.  An hour makes a big difference in the sun, as any farmer knows.  The fact is that the opposition to this Bill is really reactionary.  I do not believe that the farmers, if they think it over, if they weigh up the situation themselves, would oppose this Bill.  The Bill asks you to put on the clock.  If you do not put on the clock you are putting it back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCARTAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, from personal experience that some of the arguments used by the Minister for Agriculture do not hold at all.  For instance, he holds that because the Stock Exchange in London opens at a certain time the Stock Exchange in Dublin should do the same thing.  I saw from experience that I had in America that while New York had adopted summer time Pennsylvania had the sun time, and there was a Stock Exchange in Philadelphia and another in New York, and it did not seem to trouble them.  The trains went the same, and it did not seem to cause any inconvenience, although trains were running every hour or oftener, between the two.  I do not think that that argument holds very much.  Again, until recently we were 25 minutes behind England, and it did not seem to cause any inconvenience to the trade and commerce of this country until in the last few years the time was made the same in Ireland as in England.  At the present time we are 25 minutes ahead of the sun and if we put on another hour we shall be 1 hour and 25 minutes ahead of it. and in the West of Ireland probably much more.  I submit it is a loss to the farmer. As I know farming in the North of Ireland they begin work at about 8 o'clock in the morning, but even at that time there are several kinds of work, especially as regards hay and corn, that cannot begin at that time.  It is too early, and the dew is too heavy, and I do not think you can compare this country to other countries which do not get the same amount of dew.  I know I never saw it in America, where the grass is dry at all hours of the day and night.  In Russia, I think, the time is three hours, or two hours, at least, in advance of the sun, but there no one went to work earlier than 11 o'clock in the morning, and, I think, that is the reason they were ahead of the <Col N="2510" /> sun.  There is an argument for the cities, and an argument for the country, and I do not think that both should be mixed up.  I think you should leave it optional for the cities&mdash;for the Dublin Corporation, for instance&mdash;to make Summer Time regulations if it wishes.  Let the County Councils make regulations for the rural districts and the Urban Councils make the times for the towns, if they like.  That is the way that it is done in America. Then if Dublin believes in having the benefit of having the sun in the evening and working early in the morning, there is good reason why it should adopt Summer Time.  If the farmers of Dublin cannot work in the morning you may say that the farm labourers can come to work an hour later, but they will also like to get off at 5 o'clock, when it is 5 by the recognised time.  They will come an hour later, but they will look to get off an hour earlier in the evening.  I think it is a great inconvenience to the farmers, and the same arguments apply to the children.  It is not easy to get children ready in the morning, and get them to walk two or three miles to school.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse the remarks of the last speaker. As far as I understand the views of the people in my constituency they would certainly be very much opposed to this Bill.  In trying to voice their opinions I intend to vote against it.  It seems to me that there is only one service in the community which this really affects, and that is traffic, and it seems simply a question of an unnecessary dodge to call 8 o'clock 7 o'clock.  It seems only a question to me of regulating time-tables of the railways in order to meet whatever regulations should be made.  I believe that the constituency that I represent is typical of most Irish constituencies, and I have a recollection that on one particular occasion when I went down there for a meeting, <Col N="2511" /> they had three or four different times; they had what they called chapel-time, railway time, and they used to call new time freak time, and it seemed to lead to the most indescribable confusion.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the arrangements which this Bill proposes would lead to indescribable confusion; at least that is my experience.  As Deputy Wilson said the people will not observe the new regulations, they will stand by their own time, and that time of the people will be different from the time of the railways and other channels of traffic, and for that other element of the community, such as commercial travellers, or peripatetic politicians there will be at least confusion as to how exactly to make their arrangements. If you want to have a change in hours, in regard to traffic in trains, why not change the hour of departure and arrival of these trains?  If a train starts at 8 o'clock, you want to make it still start at 8 o'clock, but to call the hour 7 o'clock, instead of making the train start really at 7 o'clock without advancing the hour.  I do not know whether I am making myself perfectly clear, but I think I am as clear, at any rate, in my explanation, as the logic embodied in this Bill.  It is to me one of those foolish ideas that have been handed on to us from our connection with that strange country known as the United Kingdom, and I do not see any reason why we should perpetuate this absurdity that has been handed over to us.  I do not know that there is any thing even in the Treaty or the Constitution which makes it incumbent upon us to fashion our ideas, in matters like these, on the lines laid down by the people in Great Britain addicted to freaks of statesmanship, or alleged statesmanship, which, I think, will lead to confusion and inconvenience. I agree with Deputy McCartan that there is quite a possibility of finding a way out of the difficulty by allowing, what he suggests might be defined as, local option on this Bill.  Cities and municipalities might arrange, if it suited them, to have something of this kind, and Co. Councils, which have to deal with agricultural interests, could decide whether it suits them or not.  But to attempt to force it on the country, as a whole, will not do. It will not be observed, and it will only lead to confusion, where people try to observe it.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Bill, and I would point out to Deputy Gorey that I think very few of the farmers would be seriously interfered with in their business by the proposal to institute summer time.  Why should the farmers get up an hour earlier if they do not wish to do so?  Why not remain an hour longer in bed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of catching the train is the exception, and I do not think the question of the school raises a very serious objection.  I do believe that children can be got out to school an hour earlier and I hold that it will benefit them to send them out an hour earlier.</P>
      <P>(At this stage An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the chair.)</P>
      <P>Outside of Ireland school hours are very much earlier than in Ireland and very much to the advantage of the school-going population.  I do not think it is a very serious objection that children have to be got out an hour earlier to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one section of the population which will be very seriously affected by this summer time proposal.  The farmers and the farmers' employees spend most of their time in the fresh air; for them summer time is practically a holiday time, a time for recuperation. Work in the summer time on the land is done in the fresh air, but there are tens of thousands of slum-dwellers here in Dublin condemned, very often, to spend most of their time in tenements.  There are thousands in Cork and in Limerick and in Wexford and in Kilkenny and the only holiday they get, or possibly can get, will be the little extension of summer time in the evenings during the summer.  These people, I contend, will be very seriously affected by the introduction or non-introduction of this Summer Time Bill.  And it is because these people will be so seriously affected that I purpose to vote in support of the Bill.  I contend that anyone who does not wish to get up at the new time need not get up.  That is general; there certainly will be exceptions. If you want to catch a train you must get up in time, perhaps an hour <Col N="2513" /> earlier than usual, but then you can go to bed an hour earlier.  If a person gets up an hour earlier in the morning, and wishes a long rest, there is nothing to prevent that person going to bed an hour earlier in the evening.  There are thousands and thousands of clerical workers who will be affected, and I also hold that hundreds of thousands of children in the slums will be affected with considerable advantage by the introduction of this Summer Time.  I do not at all wish to dwell upon the economic side, from the point of view of the saving of artificial light, because that is very obvious, but I wholeheartedly support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Professor Whelehan, and the Minister for Agriculture, but they fail to convince me by any of their arguments in favour of this new Summer Time Bill.  Deputy Whelehan says it is not necessary for every person to rise an hour earlier if they do not wish to.  I say it is necessary upon almost every day of the week. It is incumbent upon people in charge of children, and also upon people who have business in the towns and at fairs to get trains or other modes of conveyance to attend to their business, and I should like to know how can these people remain an hour longer in bed when they have to get up an hour earlier.  They have to see that the children are got ready for school in proper time, and that could not be done if people remained an hour longer in bed.  I thought the Minister for Agriculture had some sympathy for the farming community until this evening, but this evening he used every endeavour in his power to waylay the community that he represents.  We are compelled to pay rates and taxes, and we must find the money to do so.  Still the Minister for Agriculture, and the Government for whom he speaks, want to hamper us to every extent that they possibly can by forcing this Summer Time upon the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still we are told we must pay our annuities, our rents, our taxes, etc., and that the panacea is Summer Time, whether we lose the best hours of the day by this Bill or not.  I do assure you that the country will not take the least notice of it.  I know, as far as my part of the country is concerned, the people will not take the least notice of it, and I would advise the people in every agricultural <Col N="2514" /> constituency in the country to take up the same attitude towards it. We are told that there is a majority in favour of Summer Time.  As one who had the honour of sitting on the Agricultural Commission for the last two or three months I can say that of the many witnesses examined I did not hear one speak in favour of the Summer Time.  In fact I can say that every witness examined was thoroughly opposed to the introduction of this Summer Time.  We had witnesses before us representative of the different sections and different classes of the community.  Every one of them was questioned as to whether or not they were in favour of Summer Time, and I can say that every one of them decried it, and said they did not want it in the country at all.  The evidence given before the Commission on this question, and our own experience in the country, goes to show that Summer Time is not wanted by the people.  If people in the cities want such a measure they can arrange the time to suit themselves, and we will not find fault with them, but leave us in the country our own time, or, as we say amongst ourselves, God's time.  We will not quarrel with the townspeople, no matter what they do, if they do not hamper us with a measure like this which we do not want.</P>

      <P>I have an open mind on this subject, and I am not at all convinced by any of the arguments, either on the one side or the other.  Time is a matter of convention, pure and simple.  Deputy Gorey says people will not observe it, and Deputy Doyle says the country will not notice it.  That will be the way, too, with ourselves&mdash;we will forget what time it is.

I am not greatly impressed by the arguments of Deputy MacCartan, or Deputy Milroy, to the effect that the people should have local option.  That, I think, would mean local confusion.

      <P>A lot has been said about school-going children, and about school hours.  As far as the rural areas are concerned, I think the Minister for Education could make arrangements to suit the convenience of school-going children, and that such arrangements, in the form of amendments, could be embodied in the Bill before it is finally passed.  Of course, the passing of the measure may cause inconvenience to some people.  For instance, people will have to get up an hour earlier in rural districts if they are going to catch a train, but on this matter, I think, the convenience of the great majority should prevail.  I do not know whether a good case has been made out for the Post Office as regards the arrangements to suit commercial interests between the Government in the North of Ireland and the Free State Government, and the Governments of Ireland and England.  I think that a majority will be found to vote in favour of the Bill.  A good many Deputies who spoke said a lot about the children. I do not know whether they were qualified, any more than myself, to speak for them, but I think the arguments they used against the Bill, as far as children are concerned, can be easily got over with a little give and take.  As far as labour is concerned, with very few exceptions, I think, the farm labourers in <Col N="2516" /> the country will readily fall in with the new time arrangements, and in a manner to suit the convenience of their employers in the matter of starting and quitting work.  In previous years the arrangements worked very well as between farmers and their labourers.  The old hours were observed with very few exceptions, and I think very little, if any, inconvenience was caused to farmers. I think if the matter were properly put before a conference representative of the Farmers' and the Labourers' Unions, that an arrangement to suit the convenience of both could be easily arrived at.  I intend to vote for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in taking my stand in opposition to the introduction of this Bill, for the reason that my constituents, 98 per cent. of whom are engaged in agriculture, are strongly opposed to Summer Time, not so much because it interferes with the saving of the crops or anything like that, but because of the eternal confusion it causes.  In one parish, you have Summer Time, and in another the old Irish Time, and the result is that a lot of confusion is created.  I mentioned this matter at a meeting of the Country Council that I attended in Longford on Saturday.  The meeting expressed its unanimous opposition to this measure, and they instructed me to vote accordingly. I see the advantage that a measure of this kind is to industrial workers, and I have the greatest sympathy for them, but I think, as far as they are concerned, you could get over the difficulty by advising them to go to work an hour earlier in the summer months, and by leaving the hands of the clock as they are at present.  As regards the local option mentioned by Deputy McCartan, I do not think that would work.  If you had it in the towns, and not in the country, and if you had it in the cities and larger towns, and not in the smaller towns, you would have endless confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the farmer who goes to work in the morning, he goes into town to do a little marketing in the evening, and then he finds that the shops are closed against him.  If he goes a little earlier to do a little banking business or legal work all those offices are closed. We may say it is no inconvenience to those people.  It is a decided inconvenience, <Col N="2517" /> and I will vote against it on democratic grounds.  The democratic grounds are that the majority of the people are against the introduction of Summer Time in this country, and I think we ought to take into consideration the wants and wishes and the welfare of the majority in a matter of this kind.  If the industrial population wants shorter hours there is no reason in life why they cannot have them without interfering with the hands of the clock.  Let them go in an hour earlier to work and stop work an hour earlier in the evening.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this measure, and the lighthearted, not to say facetious spirit in which it was discussed, must cheer the heart of the country at large.  There are no Irregulars destroying the resources of the agencies of industry.  All that has ceased.  The only thing that need concern us now is at what particular hour the farmer is to miss his train.  The issue as it presents itself to me now at the end of the debate is&mdash;shall we listen to the voice of the farmer in Ireland or shall we follow the lead of the industrial population in England?  It practically reduces itself to that.  Because one strong reason why this Bill should become law is in order to keep the system of transport&mdash;the railway trains and the rest&mdash; in line with those across the water.  Some years ago Mid-European time was adopted over practically all the railway systems of the Continent.  It undoubtedly expedited the ways of commerce, and now the proposal is that when the moment arrives at which the railway time tables of Britain are to be adjusted, our railway time table, too, must be adjusted, and the consequential amendment upon all that is that the life of the country shall be regulated by Act of Parliament accordingly.  Now, if one were to look at this, as one should not, of course look at it, from a detached point of view it would seem utterly absurd that we are such children that we require to have it made a law in order that we should go to bed and get up at a particular time, although we recommend it on normal <Col N="2518" /> grounds that it is good for health and that it is good for public business, and that it is good for the national interest. Now, the English population to which this new arrangement of time commended itself, and rightly commended itself, is, as the farmers' representatives here have stated, altogether different from ours.  But they dwelt particularly upon one element of the difference.  Let me add another.  The English people have one great virtue predominantly among many virtues.  They are a law-abiding people.  They are a placid, easy-going people who love uniformity of action and regularity of conduct, and they follow the routine prescribed by tradition. These people would not alter their lives in order to save the coal resources of the Nation, as regards the burning of fire, the production of gas, and artificial illuminants of that sort.  They would not depart from their own settled ways unless they were called upon to do so by the law of the land.  Consequently the Legislature introduced a law to secure that uniformity of behaviour, and they obeyed.  We are quite a different kind of people.  It is hardly necessary to emphasise that.  You have heard a declaration made here that once this Bill becomes law it secures the non-observance of the regulation.  Undoubtedly for a country like England, which is really so much land studded over with large cities and huge towns and a great urban population, it is most desirable that they should be forced into the open air and be given that leisure which the Summer Time enactment secures, and it is undoubtedly true&mdash;I make this concession to the other side&mdash;that unless it were done by legislation it would be impossible to secure it by agreement between employer and employee.  There would not be uniformity; there would be the chaos of local option.  But in Ireland we have only a few towns, and the larger part of the population is agricultural, or, if not actually and decidedly agricultural, dependent largely and collaterally upon agriculture for its support.  The staple industry of the country is agriculture, so it is really a question now of public policy.  Should we&mdash;admittedly much can be said upon both sides&mdash;secure the undoubted advantages of such a measure of Summer Time for our urban population? It would be an undoubted boon, <Col N="2519" /> and should we secure it by calling upon the rural majority to accommodate itself to changed arrangements, or are we, having in view the peculiar circumstances of the country, to call upon the minority to adapt themselves to a regulation that suits the major industry of the country? I vote for agriculture when it comes to that decision, because I believe that the city population can be provided for in Ireland.  It could not so easily have been provided for, I have contended, in the case of England.  Now, one of the arguments used here by two different speakers, who adduced undoubtedly very cogent arguments in favour of the measure, was would we who stand for the farming industry&mdash;would we deprive the city dwellers of that great advantage? Well, it is easy to answer that appeal.  We would not deprive them, and we do not seek to deprive them of it.  I do agree that we deprive them if there are no other agencies to secure these advantages for the city dwellers except the passing of this Bill.  Now, if it could be shown to me that here in Ireland there are no means available to secure these advantages but the passing of this Bill, then I should say we have a precedent for the whole situation in the case of the Dogs Act.  You remember the Dogs Act was passed, and the regulations framed under it, and each county or each authority was left to put it in force or not. That had its inconvenience.  I know the answer can be retorted upon me.  I found in giving my own dog an afternoon walk that once I crossed the canal and was in the administrative County of Dublin I had to produce a collar and put it upon the neck of the dog, and that it would have to bear my name and address. Once I returned and reached the canal it was unnecessary to trouble the dog with that decoration any longer There are inconveniences on both sides. It is no answer to the case put up by the farmers that to meet their requirements would cause inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, speaking for the Department of the farmers, said it was only inconveniences it would cause.  Yes, but there are inconveniences that mean money, the dislocation of time and the interruption of work. Let us take, as Deputy Wilson did, the parallel case of France.  France, in comparison <Col N="2520" /> with Ireland territorially, is practically a continent, if I may use a deliberate exaggeration.  It has its industrial quarters and its rural quarters, yet the whole rural population of France has called out most vigorously against the attempt to reimpose this law.  So late as last Friday one of the Ministers&mdash;the Minister of Trade&mdash;proposed, on account of urgency, to bring in the Bill, and he was out-voted.  Unfortunately I am no in a position to quote the precedent of France this year, because the vote will not be taken there until next Monday. We are ahead of France in anticipating summer.  Undoubtedly in the more purely agricultural regions of France the operation of Summer Time was found to react very detrimentally on the industry. That is not denied.  It is admitted, on the other hand&mdash;everyone who views the question closely must admit it&mdash;it was very much to the advantage of the city dwellers.  I can understand the question being decided according to which is the prevailing interest.  This is a case in which, if we do not pass this regulation, we do not do something which would undoubtedly have the effect of benefiting innumerable citizens.  On the other hand, if we do pass it, we do something which runs counter to the interests of what is the major industry of the country.  It seems to me that, as the farmers declared they would not obey this law if it were passed, we have a way out.  This seems to me to be the solution of the difficulty.  If we pass this into law and it is well understood that no farmer will do other than ignore it, then there is no harm done unless the ignoring of it is regarded as a punishable offence.  The difficulty, however, would remain as regards the time tables of the railways. Until the experiment has been tried out sufficiently to give us a final decision on the matter of value we could do what was done some years ago during a similar transition in regard to the European railways.  The time tables gave the two times&mdash;the Mid-European time, in accordance with which the larger lines were run, and the local time&mdash;and those whose business was to put their traffic on trains had the duty imposed upon them of being acquainted with those times.  It seems to me that so long as there is no turpitude involved in ignoring the law there will not be any harm done in passing the Bill.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, one realises what all the trouble was about in this country since 1916.  It was caused by Summer Time and the grave reactions that iniquitous measure had on the rural population.  Deputy Gorey's arguments and the arguments of every farmer-deputy impressed everybody here who knew nothing about agriculture or agricultural conditions. Deputy Magennis said that it is clear that if the farmers can ignore this Act without penalties then there is no harm done.  The farmers have ignored this Act without penalties for the past eight years, and they know that well, and they are inwardly chuckling at the way they have succeeded, or almost succeeded, in fooling the guileless citizens into swallowing their arguments.  I do not like to boast about it, but I probably have as much practical experience of agriculture as Deputy Gorey has.  I have experience of agriculture under Summer Time conditions, and I know that it never made the slightest difference. When you ask yourself what percentage of the population of the average county is driving to an early morning train with produce to send it to Dublin, then really you get this question in its proper focus. The ordinary agricultural routine is not affected.  A man, instead of turning up at 7 by the clock, turned up by sun-time if ignoring the official change in the clock, and he regulated his dinner interval and his time of leaving off in the evening in the same way.  That small section that I touched upon&mdash;the people who combine dairy farming with corn producing&mdash;are affected.  But that section represents an entirely negligible proportion of the population of the country and an entirely negligible proportion of the agricultural population of the country.  On one side you have the slight inconvenience and the mental labour that are involved in that sum in subtraction.  Against that you have the positive benefit to national economy, the reactions on the public health and on future generations of boys and girls and the advantage of an extra hour and twenty-five minutes to those engaged in indoor employment.  Let us take a side of this question that has not been much touched upon&mdash;the inconvenience of having a different time from Britain and from six of our own counties in the <Col N="2522" /> North East.  Deputy Doctor McCartan mentioned that some years ago, and for a long time before that, we had twenty-five minutes of a difference between British and Irish time, and nothing very terrible happened.  The proposal now is that we have an hour's difference. Tracing it out, you do come up against the inconveniences.  Telegrams sent here in the evening which, if the time were uniform, would be delivered the same evening in the North East or in Great Britain will be held over until the next day.  This kind of difficulty will react on your commerce and must react upon it.  If we want to be sentimental, and if we want to be maudlin and to talk about &ldquo;God's own time&rdquo; or &ldquo;the cursed British time,&rdquo; we will pay for our sentimentality in practical commercial values.  Of course this talking about God's own time sounds grand, but it is not pious.  It is only reactionary.  One Deputy spoke of eternal confusion being involved.  I am more than seven years old and I remember no eternal confusion in the last six summers.  Deputy Gorey is a bit of a die-hard on this matter.  He does not want &ldquo;to be healthy, wealthy or wise.&rdquo; He does not want to rise early in the morning.</P>

      <P>There has been too much concentration on the word &ldquo;industrial.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, there are involved the interests of a very, very limited number of the agricultural community as against the remaining people in the country.  It is not merely the employé in a place like Jacob's or Guinness' that is concerned, and consequently there has been too much read into the word &ldquo;industrial.&rdquo; By it is meant all the people who are working otherwise than in the fields.  All the people whose work lies indoors&mdash;domestic servants, shop assistants, clerks in solicitors' offices, and so on&mdash;are to do without their little hour and a half relaxation in the sun, so that Deputy Gorey will not have to say: &ldquo;I wonder now what time is it?&rdquo; There is really only the question of the trains as far as the rural population is concerned, and the number of farmers who are waiting for the early morning trains on which to put their produce is not considerable.  This Bill is not vital.  If you reject it nothing <Col N="2523" /> terrible will happen, but in a way it is an acid test.  It is a test of our responsibility and a test of whether we can give up talking with <i>clichés</i> about God's own time, with tears in our eyes, or on the <Col N="2524" /> other hand cursing British time, and face the fact as a matter of practical convenience and act in the way that all considerations of practical convenience urge.</P>

      <P>The Minister has moved the Second Reading of a Bill to allow the &ldquo;issue out of the Central Fund, and apply towards making good the supply granted for the service of the year ending on the 31st day of March,&rdquo; of this year of a certain sum of money, and a further sum of money to be issued out of the Central Fund towards making good the supply granted for the following year&mdash;a certain sum on account.  I am going to speak on the motion that this Bill should be given a Second Reading. Since coming into the Dáil this afternoon we have had presented to us Estimates of the receipts and expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1924.  In the paper that was issued to us on Sunday containing the Estimate of the services for which the Vote on Account was required we had a total sum of £42,278,000 estimated as required for certain services, and that has been published widely in the papers as a very large sum indeed which has to be paid by the people for the coming year.  On the additional form of Estimates of receipts and expenditure we find that the sum of £42,278,000 is only part of the estimate of expenditure. There are over £4,400,000 in addition to that required to be spent in the coming twelve months.  In the absence of an explanatory statement from the Minister, it seems to me that somebody is called upon to tell the public, if not the members of the Dáil, that there are £4,400,000 required for the coming year over and about the forty-two millions to which reference was made yesterday&mdash; £3,726,000 for services which will be paid for out of the Central Fund, and £691,000 as capital issues, making the total required for the coming year £46,696,664.  There are estimates presented on this paper of receipts, and it is estimated that £20,500,000 will come out of taxes, and £5,500,000 out of other revenue postal services, and £3,000,000 an instalment of the British contribution <Col N="2526" /> towards compensation for damage, really I take it a sum equivalent to the amount which was payable to the Irish Treasury and collected in Britain.  Now we are presented with this statement of Estimates of Receipts, and I think we have the right to ask the question, whether we have the right to an answer or not, upon what schedule of taxation this Estimate of revenue is based.  Are we to assume that it is a continuation for the whole of next year of the taxes which are at present in force?  I notice that there is, in fact, an estimated decline in the revenue of £2,300,000, and I am sure the taxpayers as a whole will be very pleased to know that there is to be a decline in the gross amount of tax revenue, unless indeed the decline is to be accompanied by a decline in ability to pay.  I am afraid this Estimate rather suggests a very pessimistic outlook on the part of the Minister, because he has estimated the necessity of borrowing £20,000,000 while at the same time estimating a decline in the revenue of £2,300,000.  I think that even at this stage some explanation of these figures should be presented to the Dáil.  I want to deal with that question in a somewhat more detailed fashion.  We are to be told in three weeks' time what the scheme of taxation that the Minister proposes is to be, and I am desirous of drawing attention to the need for some alteration in the present incidence of taxation.  We are assuming, according to this paper, a decline of £2,300,000 in the gross revenue.  I ask the Minister to think very seriously of the way the present taxation rested upon the people who are least able to pay it.  It is not recognised as it ought to be, what a large proportion of a poor man's income, or a poor woman's income, has to be paid away in taxation, and I will ask the Dáil to bear this in mind when thinking of taxation, that what you ought to think about&mdash;what we ought all to think about &mdash;is not the amount that is paid by an individual, but the amount that remains to him after the taxation has been paid, the amount that is left to the individual taxpayer to live upon after his taxes have been paid.  I have taken a very moderate estimate of the food consumption of an average healthy working-class man and family, and I have assumed two adults and four children.  I have assumed a consumption of a lb. of tea <Col N="2527" /> in the week, 5 lbs. of sugar, and what those who are able to speak with authority will admit is a very moderate estimate of the non-teetotaller, hardworking artisan or labourer, a pint and a half of porter a day for 7 days a week. I am assuming that three members of the family will, on an average, go to a football match, a theatre or a cinema or a concert once a week.  I have assumed the consumption by this average family of two ounces of tobacco and cigarettes in the week, and I have assumed a very moderate consumption of matches, confectionary, condensed milk, cocoa, coffee, currants, dried fruits, etc.  Now, I do not think anyone will complain that that is an exaggerated or extravagant budget of taxable goods, and that budget means the payment, at present rates, of no less than 7s. 9d. of a direct tax upon what are necessaries and ordinary comforts. Over and above that if men and women are extravagant then they are paying, of course, a very much larger tax than that, and my observation of men in all walks of life points to the fact that there is a very much greater consumption, in the higher ranks, at any rate the wealthier ranks, rather than this amount of a pint and a half of porter a day. But supposing even we take the case of the agricultural labourer who is asked in some parts of the country to live on 25/- or 30/- per week, we assume that that man has a wife and family but that he cannot get to the town to enjoy entertainments and the pleasure of paying Entertainment Tax, and that he does not drink a pint and a half of porter a day or even a half one daily, but contents himself for a whole week with four pints, the taxation on that particular labourer, who is living in the country and cannot enjoy these amenities, as they may be called&mdash;even for him the direct taxes on his income, which the wife to a great extent has to pay, is no less than 5s. 4d. out of the week's consumption, and that is a very high tax and it means too small an income to be left for the purchase of commodities which are non-taxable.  The direct tax of 20 per cent. on a man's income, a family income, is very high.  I want to direct attention to this, and I hope it will be taken into consideration within the next two or three weeks, if we are not able to get any information to-day. <Col N="2528" /> We are paying at the present time for, I suppose, 90 per cent. of the tea that is consumed in this country, a tax of 6?d. per pound, but so far as the information that is available will enlighten us we are going to be obliged to pay an increased tax of 1?d. on tea.  The normal tax is 8d.; the preference that is allowed by England on Indian tea as compared with China is, I think, 1/6th. So far as we have been vouchsafed information there is not to be any agreement for preference for British Colonial commodities.  We are to pay henceforward, presumably after the 1st of April, the full 8d., because no arrangement has been made for a preferential tariff, and I am sure the women folk will be glad to have some assurance from the Minister that the preference that they have been enjoying for the last year will not be withdrawn and that they will be enabled to buy tea at a lower rate than that which the full tax would allow them to buy.  We do not want it to go out from here that there has been an increase in fact on the tea duty of 1?d. in the pound because the Minister has failed to make any arrangement in regard to preferential duties.  I am sure that he would not be willing to say: &ldquo;We shall make arrangements to give preference to the British Dominions on motor cars and we fail to give that same preference on tea.&rdquo; Whether we are to have an assurance that a preference is to be given on motor cars and parts of motor cars to Britain and her Dominions I do not know, but I can hardly imagine the Minister will have the hardihood to say: &ldquo;We are going to give a preference on motor cars made in England or made in Canada over American and French cars, while refusing to give a preference to tea grown in India over tea grown in China.&rdquo; And while I am on this taxation question I want to urge upon the Minister that before he finally decides the rates of taxation on motor cars and films, and on any other of the commodities that touch Irish industry at any point, he will consider it wholly in the light of Ireland's concerns.  As was said yesterday, it is obvious after one moment's thought that the present taxation upon motor cars and parts does not fit in with Ireland's requirements.  And the present taxation upon cinema films does not fit in with Ireland's requirements.  In the case of <Col N="2529" /> motor cars I would urge the desirability of making a distinction in the rate of taxation between non-assembled cars and parts of cars and the completely assembled cars.  I am sure the Minister will calculate as closely as possible the income from taxation, whether it will do damage because of the decline in imports, or whether he will be able to so adjust taxation as to ensure that imports will remain high enough to produce the maximum amount of revenue.  Upon the question of films I am sure he will bear in mind every representation that is made to him, and, especially in view of the probability, and I think it a proved probability, that unless there is a revision of the present taxation there will be a decline in the attendance at cinemas, and consequently a reduction in the revenue derivable from the entertainment tax.  I would ask the Minister to pay special attention to that aspect, which as Minister for Finance, he is of course bound to do, and assuredly will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst the principal items on this list of expenditure there were two, to which I referred yesterday, viz., the Property Losses and the cost of the Army, upon which I desire again to say a few words.  We attempted to impress upon the Dáil that some conditions should be imposed upon the recipients of compensation for property loss which would oblige them to spend a proportion upon home-produced goods.  We fail to impose that condition, and there is no such obligation upon the recipients of compensation, but I want to ask the Minister to be more insistent than has been the case on the expenditure of Army funds upon articles produced in Ireland.  I am quite willing to admit that this will require an increase, and that it will involve an increase in the cost of articles.  I am frankly willing to admit that if we are going to buy in the cheapest market we will buy very few things in Ireland, and if buying in the cheapest market is to be the criterion of our public expenditure then Irish manufacturers will receive very little benefit, or, rather, Irish industries, I should say, will receive very little benefit from the expenditure of public moneys.  But I think that it is well to face the fact that the country cannot afford to buy in the cheapest markets.  Our expenditure will of necessity, in my opinion, require to be used for the development of the home <Col N="2530" /> market.  And here we have the home market, and, provided that there are conditions imposed upon the rates of profit and the scheme of organisation or industries, then the advantage will lie wholly with the utilisation of Irish experience and ability, and Irish materials and resources for the supply of Irish requirements. I would go further and even suggest to the Minister that he could, without very revolutionary action, devise a means of ensuring that even the amount of pay that is expended upon the soldiers could be directed into the purchase of Irish-manufactured goods.  A proportion of every soldier's pay could, by means that I think are practicable, be directly and of necessity utilised in the purchase and consumption of home-manufactured articles.  But in this case, where the spending is wholly at the disposal of the Government through the Army, or through the various other Departments, but particularly through the Army, I would ask the Minister to consider the importance of giving imperative directions that purchases should be made, where possible, of Irish goods.  We have had for too long now the excuse given to us that in giving away contracts they had to be given to English manufacturers because they were wanted speedily, and Irish manufacturers would not supply in time.  And that excuse was a valid one six months or a year ago, but it ought not to be valid now.  It would simply mean there is lack of foresight as to the commodities required.  Now, I have had brought to my notice no later than last night an instance where uniforms have been ordered from London at a price several shillings below the price that they could be produced in Ireland, and ordered before the Irish manufacturers had an opportunity of tendering.  These orders were given away to London because, in the case of a tunic and breeches, they are four shillings below the price that they have been able to produce them at in Ireland.  But what is the explanation?  So far as I can gather, the only possible explanation lies in the fact that the Irish Trade Board rates are being undercut.</P>
    <P>The minimum rate fixed in what was a sweated industry has been undercut by British manufacturers, and they are therefore, able to supply a tunic and breeches four shillings below the Irish quotation&mdash;41s. as against the present <Col N="2531" /> price of 45s.; and great coats at 42s. as against 45s.  The immediate complaint I am making is that this order, at any rate, and I think I am quite right in saying many other orders, have been given to English houses without Irish manufacturers having had a chance to supply them.  This question of contracts has given a great deal of trouble to manufacturers, to members of the Dáil, to Ministers, and to the people concerned. A Committee was set up which was supposed to oversee the giving away of contracts.  I am very much inclined to the opinion that despite all the promises of amendment, in regard to the giving away of contracts, that the Contracts' Committee has not been able to ensure the reform which was absolutely essential, particularly as regards goods required by the Army.  While I am touching upon this question of contracts, I want to ask Ministers whether a greater good is going to be achieved by concentration and centralisation in contracting for specific articles, or whether a greater good is not likely to be accomplished by encouraging the small dealer, grower, or producer in and around the neighbourhood where the goods are required? The practice hitherto, before the Irish Army was in the market, was to encourage in every locality the local people to supply commodities for the consumption of the soldiers in the barracks and camps.  I think the tendency is distinctly away from that at the present time.  The tendency is to hand over the contracts to some large centralised contractor, and allow him to purchase where he can; but he may, or may not, encourage the local grower, the local butcher, or the local market gardener. Without being dogmatic on this question, I would urge Ministers to ask for a close inquiry by the Contracts' Committee and their technical advisers, as to whether a greater social value will not be derivable from the encouragement of the local grower, the local feeder, and the local butcher to continue to supply the local markets in the same way as he has been doing hitherto.  I doubt very much whether it is good politics to discourage local enterprise of this kind by centralising the purchasing power, and inviting contractors simply to buy where they can find the readiest supplies, which means, in effect, to encourage traffic from one end of the country to a <Col N="2532" /> central market, and then buying in a central market and re-distributing. Touching on this question I would like to draw attention to certain questions that have arisen in regard to contracts for canteens in barracks Here again, I daresay, pure business would lead the Army to farm out the right of serving soldiers in canteens.  Whether the authority is good or not, I want to say that I am led to believe that there is a tendency towards farming out canteens. I suggest that that is more likely to lead to over drinking, and, consequently, demoralisation, than a more rigid supervision of canteens; and, especially, if it happens that a dry canteen as well as a wet canteen is in the hands of the same contractor, encouragement would probably be given to the consumption of intoxicants.  I think the encouragement should be entirely the other way in the Army as in most other places.  I would urge the desirability of devising something approximating to the Gottenburg public house system, where all the profits to the management would be derivable from non-intoxicants, so that all the encouragement from the management will come from the consumption of non-intoxicants; and that so far as the management is concerned they will derive no profit from the consumption of intoxicants.  I am not now suggesting that the price should be reduced to mean that there will be no profit or no tax, but that at any rate whatever inducement there would be to push a trade, it would be to push a trade in non-intoxicants.  This is the last occasion, I suppose, for two or three weeks on which we shall have any opportunity to raise any question before the Ministry in a public manner, and I am going to take the opportunity of asking the Minister for Home Affairs or the Minister for Defence, whoever is responsible, to put some stay upon the exuberance, to speak mildly, of the men engaged in raiding houses.  It is not an infrequent complaint that the attempt to catch prisoners in houses in the middle of the night is combined with an attempt to terrorise all the people in the house, women and children as well as men. Even when the object of the search is proved not to be on the premises, and when the men are going away the attempt at terrorising after the bird has flown does not do any good to the <Col N="2533" /> Government, it is not doing any good to the Army, it is not doing any good to anybody.  It is doing a great lot of harm to many people who have experience of violent threats and outrageous treatment by the men engaged in these raids.  It is not an isolated instance that I am thinking of.  I shall bring to the notice of the Minister responsible a particular case, but I want to raise a general protest, and to ask the Minister to curb, as I say, the exuberance of the men engaged in these raids.  Indiscipline in these forces we all know is liable to lead to very terrible consequences.  The reputation of the Army and of the Government would be much higher and will vary in many quarters according to the discipline of the forces engaged in the work which the Government find it necessary to undertake.  I will ask the Minister to bear in mind that there will be an aftermath and that when the present trouble is over, there will be all kinds of forces in the country that will have to be kept under discipline, and if they are allowed to be indisciplined now the problem that we are dealing with at present will be intensified.  I have ranged over a variety of subjects, but I believe that it is the duty of the Dáil to take advantage of this kind of financial Bill to deal with subjects of a general character in the way that I have done, or in the way the Dáil thinks best, and it is not right to allow three weeks to pass without a general discussion of the questions which are of public concern and moment.</P>

      <P>May I refer to one item that concerns the Army?  I would wish that the Minister for Defence or someone acting for him were here to take a note of the few remarks which I intend to make concerning separation allowances.  There have been some dozen of cases brought to my notice within the last week or two where forms have been sent to the parents of boys serving stating that they had insufficient evidence to prove any claim for dependents. I have here a scale in which it is stated that the extent of dependents' allowance per week is:&mdash;Where the recruit gave an allowance to his dependents not exceeding 12s. the dependents get nothing; where he gave from 12s. to 18s. the dependents get 7s. a week; when it is not proved that they get 12s. a week from the recruit then there is no dependant's <Col N="2534" /> allowance.  I know of one case where a woman had two sons in the Army.  Both were earning small wages, and on the two boys the mother proved she got 7s. each, that is 14s. between the two, which would, according to this scale, entitle her to come between the zone of 12s. and 18s., and get 7s. dependant's allowance.  She gets nothing Had she been getting the 14s. from one of the boys she would now get 7s. allowance, but now she gets no separation allowance from the two.  I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that he would make a recommendation to the Minister for Defence that in a case like this, where two boys had contributed to the support of their mother, it would be taken that it had come from one.  It is only fair that that mother should get 7s. a week, which is the minimum of the scale allowance.  I do not think I am unreasonable in asking that.  I think that in the case of a woman giving two sons to the Army, the fact that they were earning small wages each should not debar her now from getting separation allowance equivalent to what she would get if she had been supported by one son.  I must certainly say of the Paymaster's Department, that in every case which I have brought to his attention that within a few days he had the complaint investigated and payments made, but there are a considerable number of complaints still.  If I put questions on the Question Paper dealing with all the questions I get I would want a Question Paper for myself.  What I did in these cases was to send the complaints to the Paymaster-General to get them attended to.  I had another case yesterday, and this is a matter that ought to have the attention of the Ministry.  I know in the days of the British Government there was a special scale fixed.  At present the Inspector goes round and he asks the woman what it cost to keep her son.  He has no standard in front of him.  In this case the woman said he was earning 25s. a week, and it cost 20s. to keep him.  In that case there is no dependent's allowance. Had the woman said that it cost 13s. or 14s. to keep him she would have got 7s. a week.  That is a practical illustration of a case that was brought before me yesterday, and because the mother said it cost £1 a week to keep her boy out of the 25s. he gave her the Paymaster-General turned down <Col N="2535" /> the case.  If that is a laughing matter for the Dáil, the mothers of these boys do not consider it a laughing matter.</P>

      <P>If I might interrupt for a moment I would like to say this: in my case I was laughing because when I was advising people in the time of the British Government I always instructed my clients properly, and I never made a mistake of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I did not get an opportunity of instructing my client, but because the woman told the truth she gets nothing.  I say that the Government themselves ought to make a scale of 16s. a week to be deducted for the boy's upkeep, and have that as a standard. The difference between that and what he gave his mother ought to be given to her.  What I want to say to-day is that I know of a case where a woman said it cost 14s. to keep the boy and the other woman said it cost 20s. to keep her boy.  The one gets separation allowance and the other does not.  I hold the Government Department ought to have a standard scale themselves on which to base their allowances, and not have Inspectors going round putting those questions to the mothers of the boys.  I hope the Government will seriously consider the question, and if a boy has been six months idle that ought not to be taken into consideration for the purpose of depriving his mother of any Army allowance.  If, at the end of six or seven months' idleness, the boy joins the Army, I think his mother is entitled to some allowance, and that something should be done in that direction. I do not intend to go into any other item on this proposal to-day.  I am satisfied to deal only with one matter which affects a large number of poor people, some of whom have come to me during the past few weeks.</P>

      <P>The discussion, so far, has not been very interesting to me.  It has centred round, chiefly, the spending of money which we have to pay in taxes. No effort has been made to show where these taxes are to come from, and no attempt has been made to show where any saving can be effected.  Deputy Johnson says it is too much to charge a family seven shillings in taxes, and Deputy O'Brien says you are not giving enough in allowances.  The Postmaster-General <Col N="2536" /> then comes along and he wants £1,300,000; and the total of the bill is £42,000,000.  Where is it all to come from?  This point should be considered instead of all this embroidery.  It is costing £21,000,000 sterling to run the country when you eliminate the Army cost and the property losses.  I believe it was estimated in the First or Second Dáil that, if they got the running of the country, they could do it on six millions. I used to say it ought to be run for ten millions.  Now we have got it up to twenty-one millions, and if the Deputies who have been speaking had their way it would mount up to one hundred millions. There is one item here on which I would like to get a little information. It is an item of £85,000 for Haulbowline Dockyard.  Perhaps I am too previous in asking an explanation of that, as it may come up again.  It seems a new expense, however, and new expenses should be all checked in the bud.  We will have to begin and stamp out all attempts to raise expenditure in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very interesting and good-humoured discussion here early to-day as to whether or not it was more desirable to change or disfigure the face of Deputy Gorey's grandfather's clock in order to conform with the requirements of the law, or allow the farmers to break the law by leaving the clock as it originally stood.  It matters very little to the hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of working&mdash;or perhaps I should say workless&mdash;men in this country who have been thrown out of employment as a result of the destruction whether or not they have to go by Greenwich or Dublin or Kilkenny time when they find that they have no work to do and no job to attend to which would keep their wives and families from starvation. It is generally admitted that under ordinary, normal conditions this country would not be asked to find the millions of money that it is obliged to find this year.  It is also generally recognised outside the Dáil&mdash;and I am sure by the members of the Dáil too&mdash;that under ordinary conditions a considerable saving might be made in the different Departments of the Government, and particularly in respect of Army administration. Objection has been taken from time to time in the Dáil by members of <Col N="2537" /> the Government to members on these Benches raising questions concerning the Army.  I fail to see what harm is done by raising questions here when everything we say is well known to the people in the different areas throughout the country.  It is customary when anybody &mdash;even a member of the Dáil&mdash;seeks entrance to barracks here or in the country to search him.  From what I know of the conduct of the Army in many places in the country, as well as searching people going into barracks it would be very desirable that they should be searched coming out.  A good many cases of extravagance have been brought to my notice, and if there was proper supervision the cost of the Army in a particular centre would not be what it is represented to me to be.  It would be very interesting to find out what ten or twenty or thirty soldiers in a certain depot or a barracks in the country cost the Government, apart altogether from the question of dependents' allowances. It would be very desirable that the Government, in passing Bills that are sent up to them, should try and discover whether or not the expenditure in a certain area is above what it should be in ordinary conditions.  If they worked out a mathematical problem of that kind it would perhaps enable them to discover extravagance in many directions.  It is generally recognised by the people that the war, which is supposed to be conducted on behalf of the people, is more a war upon the people than for the people.  Everybody in touch with his own particular area is very glad to realise &mdash;as I think the people do realise&mdash;that the country is gradually but surely recovering from the shock it received last June or July.  If the country is to be brought back as soon as possible to what it used to be and ought to be, a very serious effort must be made to open up the many railway lines and sections of lines that have been closed down&mdash;particularly in the Great Southern and Western area.  I have noticed that when a bridge is blown up on the South Eastern or Midland Railway an effort is immediately made to repair that bridge.  But in hundreds of cases bridges have been blown up on the Great Southern and Western Railway, and, in spite of repeated representations to the Government by the people of the area and by the representatives <Col N="2538" /> of the people, nothing has been done to open up the line in that area. The result is that flour mills and other places of work have had to close down. Thousands of men have been thrown out of work, and are kept out of work, simply because the Great Southern and Western Railway people refuse to conform with the wishes of the people.  If the Government wishes to show the people that the country is recovering, and will recover, it must open up all the avenues of transport so as to allow the country to carry on as it would carry on under normal conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told, for instance, that in the case of Palace East, where trouble has occurred within the last two or three days, a certain bridge there has been blown up on at least six occasions, and on every occasion it has been repaired within a period of from 24 to 48 hours, so that the flow of traffic might continue.  I do not see why the same condition of things should not exist all over the Great Southern and Western Railway.  Now that a Bill has been passed that enables the Government to pay money over to the Companies, I hope that during the Easter recess the Government will use all the power it possesses to see that all sections of the railway, especially in the southern portion of the country, will be opened up without delay.  I notice that considerable numbers of the Railway Protection Corps are stationed in different areas all over the railway systems. I fail to see, with such numbers of troops protecting the railways at many different points, how it is that the necessary repairs cannot be carried out so as to allow traffic in the country to be carried on.  I view the stoppage of trade in those areas in a very serious light. While the trade in the Free State area is being paralysed through the destruction of transport communications, the people of Ulster, who glory in the war in the South, are capturing the trade behind the backs of the people who are living in the area under our jurisdiction. Not alone do the Ulster people glory in what is going on in the South, but they are very cautiously helping, from behind the scenes, to do whatever they can to encourage the carrying on of this war between different sections in the Free State.  If we have the means at our disposal, we should not hesitate to use them so that the flow of traffic is carried <Col N="2539" /> on.  I am sorry the Minister for Defence is not present, because I wish to bring under his notice, and the notice of the Government, cases where Army accounts are long overdue.  There are also cases where accidents have occurred as a result of which inoffensive citizens have been shot.  In the April of last year such cases occurred in which the Army Authorities recognised their responsibilities and promised compensation, but that compensation has not yet been paid to the dependents of the people accidently shot.  I hope that from the figures we are asked to vote away now the Army Authorities will make provision for the immediate payment of accounts long overdue, and especially of compensation to dependents of people accidentally killed by military forces.  One thing strikes me peculiarly with regard to army administration. The view that I have held is confirmed by practical experience.  It is a bad policy on the part of the Army Council to leave soldiers belonging to a certain area in that area.  Many of the things which have occurred, and which unfortunately cannot be now satisfactorily settled, would not have occurred if you had troops, who were not natives, in certain areas.  I hope in any reorganisation schemes which will be considered that this will be attended to.  It is not right nor fair to the individuals themselves to have them serving in the Army in their native districts.  I join in this discussion particularly for the purpose of impressing on the Government the necessity of opening up the avenues of communication in the country, so that it can be proved to the people how far the Government forces have justified themselves in the work they set out to do, and justified us in supporting the Estimates that are now being called for.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill passes this stage there is one question which I think it is the duty of the Dáil to ask and the duty of the Minister to answer.  We were told by the Minister for Defence to-day that letters to and from prisoners have been stopped. I presume that applies to internment camps and military prisons.  This is the only opportunity, for at least two or three weeks, we will have of getting replies, and we ought to have an answer as to <Col N="2540" /> why these letters have been stopped. On the one hand it is suggested the stoppage is because of something happening outside; on the other hand, because certain things that have happened inside.  It seems a very drastic mode of punishment to cut off letters to and from relatives and friends and prisoners. I should like to know the exact reasons for that and to know whether those regulations apply also to deportees, presumed citizens, and some who now apparently disavow citizenship of the Saorstát.  If so, why do they apply? Sometime back there were certain regulations enforced in Mountjoy which were not enforced in other internment camps.  The reason was because of certain things that happened in Mountjoy. These regulations were enforced against prisoners in Mountjoy who had not been prisoners there when the acts, which were the source of that particular mode of punishment, were committed. I am sorry I was not here yesterday when the President was referring to the Estimate for the Governor-General's establishment.  When this question was previously before the Dáil the President justified the vote of £10,000 because he said it was a new establishment in connection with which certain initial charges had to be met.  I should like to know if the amount put down in the vote for the coming year includes the salary of the Governor-General, and whether the £1,000 and some odd pounds over the £10,000 is merely for the upkeep of the establishment, or is the establishment going to cost £11,000 this year as compared with £10,000 last year?  The whole thing, in my opinion, is excessive. I should like to know from the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is in a position to inform us that he is able to carry out the forecast he made some months ago in regard to removing prisoners from the ordinary civil prisons in the Free State and leave those prisons in the charge of the General Prisons Board purely for civilian prisoners. There is another item which puzzled some of us, though there was an explanation given last year.  It recurs this year; it may be necessary and probably is.  I should like to know whether the Secret Service referred to is Army In telligence or deals with political matters. What kind of Secret Service is it? These are questions which the Dáil <Col N="2541" /> should demand an answer to, and it is the duty of the Minister to answer.</P>

      <P>I just want to make a slight correction relative to the remark of Deputy Wilson.  He suggests that my Department is about to suffer a loss of £1,300,000 for the coming year and that no improvement is shown in the matter of working compared with the previous year.  That is not correct.  The loss will be in the region of £1,000,000, and it is hardly fair, in the absence of a statement on the Budget, to send it forth to the public that a loss of this kind is being incurred.  Furthermore, I believe that when the services rendered to the Government are taken into consideration, the losses on the Post Office will be very much smaller.  It is only right, in the interest of the Service itself, to make that statement.</P>

      <P>I should like very briefly to reply to Deputy Johnson with regard to the question of Government contracts.  The policy of the Government with regard to the spending of money on contracts, whether for the Army or the Civil Service of the State, is that every penny possible shall be spent within the Saorstát.  That is the general policy.  Now, Deputy Johnson complained that certain purchases are being made without the Saorstát, and that Irish commercial firms did not have an opportunity of tendering for those.  Yes, certain purchases have been made without the Saorstát.  In every case these were emergency purchases, and I am sure the Deputy will be very glad to know that at the present moment over 90 per cent. of the purchases being made are made in Ireland.  During the present week, contracts have been placed for boots and leggings for the Army running into something like £40,000, and all those contracts have been placed with Irish manufacturers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Saorstát. In fact the Contracts Committee, in dealing with the question of the supply of boots, even gave a preference of 3d. extra on the boot, if the manufacturer would guarantee that the sole leather of the boot had been manufactured in Ireland. That was considered good economics, good finance.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Johnson, and the members <Col N="2542" /> of the Dáil Contracts Committee would agree with him, that buying in the cheapest market is not always good economics.  As a matter of fact, I can assure him that over 20 per cent. extra price has been given for those boots that are being purchased in Ireland to that which would be necessary to purchase similar articles across Channel. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is interested in the contracts question from the economic point of view.  We have to deal with the question of unemployment.  We have to try and reduce the number of the unemployed, and we have, above all, to try and ensure that the people who have work in this difficult time shall continue to have sufficient employment to keep them working.  That is our policy. With a view to securing that, we try to avail of expert advice and to place expert advice at the disposal of Irish manufacturers who seek it.  In fact, sometimes we go to Irish manufacturers and try to get them to organise their business to meet the huge demands which are coming from the Irish Army at the present moment.  As will have been seen by the reference I made to extra price in the case of boots, a reasonable allowance is made for the Irish manufacturer, and in this respect I would like to point out that we have found Deputy Johnson and those associated with him most helpful in the matter of contracts.  We have found Irish Labour in different places quite prepared to increase their output in order that the firm for which they were working would be able to compete on reasonable terms with cross-Channel firms.  We have also found Irish manufacturers are fully alive to the situation, and are availing of the present opportunity&mdash;it is a great opportunity&mdash; to try and place their industries on an economic footing.  In only one case has the Contracts Committee found it necessary to cancel the contracts which a firm held because the firm did not comply with the condition of fair wages.  That was in one case only, and the Contracts Committee had no difficulty in concelling the order which the firm held. As far as the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is concerned, we shall at all times welcome helpful criticism from everybody in this Dáil in this matter of contracts.  I am sure the whole Dáil is interested in the question; and we can <Col N="2543" /> assure them that we view the question of purchases from the purely economic standpoint.  The sole principle which guides us in the placing of contracts is whether it is good economics, and the Government's Policy is to spend every penny it possibly can in the country.</P>

      <P>There are a few words I should like to say with regard to payment out of the Road Fund.  I certainly congratulate the Minister for Local Government on the increase.  It is really necessary for the expenditure on the road work.  During 1922-1923 we have had £100,000 for the expenditure. During 1923-1924 we have had £450,000. The increase is 350 per cent.  I think that will go a great deal in the way of relieving the workers throughout the country, and above all things it will be a great stepping stone towards preventing people throughout the country from becoming an encumbrance upon the Labour Exchanges.  I can assure this Dáil that the organised workers of Ireland do not want to be on the Labour Exchanges as long as they can find employment. I am sure that this Government, after the passing of this Estimate, will have the goodwill of all those workers. The roads of Ireland at the present time are in a very bad state, and hundreds of men can be employed on them.  We are, at the present time, dependent on the Labour Exchanges, and above all things, when it is taken into account that the farmer class is not giving the amount of labour at the present time that it gave heretofore, the number of people thrown out of employment must be an encumbrance on the ratepayers or on the State at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal for a moment or two with the question of the unemployed, and with particular reference as to how they can be relieved by this extra expenditure. I would like to place before the Dáil one particular case in the town of Athlone.  The sawmills there have been closed down and 110 workers have been thrown out of employment.  These will now be added to the list of the Labour Exchange, and I was wondering would it be possible for the Government, and would it not be more economical, to start some industry where that industry has ceased to exist, instead of giving these disemployed men grants for doing <Col N="2544" /> nothing at all.  I think it would be much better for the State where industries have closed down if the Government could see their way to re-start these industries so as to give employment.  With reference to the question of contracts, you can get a lot of stuff manufactured yourselves at the present time.  I saw by an advertisement in one of the papers that you want hundreds of articles of furniture.  These could be manufactured in Athlone, where they have the machinery. If you take over the works you will save the State and you will save the workers from being looked upon as going for charity, with their hands out to receive alms, for that is really what they are looked upon as doing at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motor tax collected throughout the country, this money was heretofore refunded to the counties where it was collected.  I have it on the best authority that the Secretary of the Westmeath County Council has received approximately £2,500. That speaks very well for the constituency I represent, and of the regard they have for the Government, when they are coming forward and paying this amount of money.  It is to be hoped this will be refunded to keep men in employment. If some grant does not come, 150 men will have to be dismissed.  Another matter that calls for attention is the question of Old Age Pensions.  Something will have to be done with regard to this, and it may be that a new Act will have to be brought in to deal with grievances that exist.  I am a member of one of the Old Age Pensions SubCommittees, and I find that if a working man and his wife are living together, and that that man is earning £2 a week, and that the woman is seventy years of age, she cannot get the Old Age Pension because her husband is in receipt of £2 a week.  Take the other side of the picture, and you find that if a person has been fortunate enough to have invested in the bank £600 in ready cash that person is entitled to the Old Age Pension, while the working man who is earning £2 a week is not entitled to it.  That is a matter, I think, that wants to be looked into.  The Old Age Pension is certainly a big encumbrance to the State, but it is better to give the pension to people who are entitled to it rather than to people who hand over business <Col N="2545" /> premises or land to their sons and daughters for the purpose of getting the pension.  I have nothing further to add until the Estimates come again before the Dáil.  I certainly congratulate the Minister for Local Government for his pluck in coming forward and giving us that amount to keep people employed on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in the speech of Deputy Johnson which I think it right to dwell upon for a moment.  There seems to be in the Saorstát a prevailing ignorance as regards the incidence of taxation on films, which the Deputy mentioned, for example, and upon motor cars.  May I remind the members of the Dáil that in August, 1921, there came into operation what was known as the Safeguarding of British Industries Act.  Under that Act the Board of Trade is empowered, if called upon by the complaints of British manufacturers, to levy a tax upon the products of foreign competitors.  For example, dealing with films and the allied industry of photography, in May or June last petitions were made to the Board of Trade on behalf of the combined British manufacturers of photographic materials, and also by the Association of Lens Makers.  Evidence was heard from these, and it was proved to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade that owing to the exchange between Germany and Austria on the one hand and Great Britain on the other, that it was possible for the most superior type of photographic instruments, the Zeiss lens and the Goerz lens, for cameras, made in Dresden by the I. K. Firm, which has the largest capital next to the Kodak invested in that industry in the world, to be placed on the market.  It was proved that it was possible to put the highest type of optical instruments on the market at a price lower than the British manufacturer could produce, and consequently, for the safeguarding of the industry, the tax was immediately imposed. Up to the present moment we have been working here under the fiscal system that we took over, and the result is that films, photographic plates, and the other things I have mentioned, come into the country with an <i>ad valorem</i> duty.  The moment we proceed to run our own fiscal system, as from April 1st next, for the purpose of symmetry and <Col N="2546" /> the purpose of adjustment what is referred to here in British finance, that is bound to take place later on when we get our fiscal system into line, and the result is that we impose these duties.  I take it that is the intention; otherwise there will be the difficulty of our having one system here and then across the border another.  The only thing novel about the matter is that film and optical instrument makers, and all those things that we protected for England, if they come into this Saorstát from England, they come in from what is practically a foreign country.  A few days ago the Mersey Docks Board arranged to impose 9s. per ton on Irish butter instead of the ordinary 8d. on inter-coastal traffic that had hitherto prevailed, because in their conception of the new relations Ireland was a foreign country.  Now, with reciprocity, England is a foreign country as regards Ireland, and the films and motor cars and the rest of that come under taxation that was not imposed hitherto on those coming from England.  Further, it seems to me, from what Deputy Johnson said to-day, and from what he said yesterday&mdash;I hope I am not misunderstanding or misrepresenting him&mdash;that the cinema trade is shocked and terrified at this imposition.  It need not be unless it continues to buy and procure these supplies from English sources.  There is no earthly reason why, instead of great distributing houses in London having charge of the importation of all this stuff that is employed here and retailing it at a profit to sub-agencies or retail houses in Ireland through the operation of these fiscal arrangements, Irish houses should not be distributing agencies for the Saorstát, and consequently trade and commerce would be enormously aided thereby.  I wanted to speak on that point because I was under the impression from what has been said about films and the allied goods, that the fact has not been generally recognised that there was protection.  Not only was there protection through the Safeguarding of British Industries Act, but furthermore there has been given a protection to the British industry in motor cars owing to the fact that when the British motor trade began to realise that the industry was threatened practically with extinction as regards the moderately-priced cars by American and Canadian and French <Col N="2547" /> mass production, the trade decided to concentrate upon the light car.  It was found that the light car appealed to the largest number of buyers in Great Britain. For city men, for professional men, doctors and the rest, it provided an excellent runabout.  It was also good for touring under favourable conditions. There was an official definition of the light car that the calculation of the bore and stroke should not exceed 1,500 cubic centimetres.  The British trade concentrated upon that, and by putting on a tax upon horse power instead of upon tyre or petrol consumption the situation was brought about that, whereas the Ford car bore a tax of £23, and the Chevriolet, a Canadian car of a similar type, bore a tax of £21 or £22, the competing car in England was only subjected to £9 10s., or £11 at most, and we are continuing that in Ireland, so that we are really giving preference to the British cars so long as the Minister for Local Government continues to impose the duty by the calculation of the bore and stroke merely, instead of on the basis of consumption.</P>

      <P>On the question of figures generally it may be a trite thing to say, but it helps, or should help, to bring home to the people that &ldquo;the State,&rdquo; as Tom Kettle once said, &ldquo;is you and I and the man around the corner,&rdquo; and that the attack that has been going on for the last year, while it purported to be an attack on a vague entity known as &ldquo;the Government,&rdquo; was, in reality, an attack on the people of the country, and the reason for that attack was that the people would not make a neat parcel of their wills and their intellects and hand them over to a very small section which could not show and have not shown since by their conduct that their judgment or intellect was anything to brag about.  You have a figure here, £42,278,000.  You have an Army figure of seven and a quarter millions for last year and ten and a half millions, if the estimate works out correctly, for the coming financial year, so that within two years the people will have paid eighteen million pounds for the Army, and they will have paid that because their will, their constitutionally expressed will, was challenged.  It is a grim lesson in democracy, and it will only prove worth while <Col N="2548" /> if we learn the lesson well and if, down through the years, we remember it. Then it may be worth while.  Whether it will be worth while really to the people who are living to-day, who will be paying it to-day, is another point, and it should teach us that to have recourse to violence, to have recourse to outrage, for a political preference&mdash;and that is what it comes to&mdash;is questionable wisdom for any country.  To put out an invader, to claim the right to run your own affairs, to claim the right to make your own laws on the grounds that you know best your own interests and your own requirements, is one thing; having done that to turn on the majority of the people and wage a criminal campaign for a formula is quite another, and, getting down to the elements of the thing, we cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that there was not a very considerable political problem here, that there was not close on a million of our people in the North East, close on a quarter of our population, who were utterly opposed to the ideals for which the bulk of the country was standing; that scattered through the rest of the country you had close on another half million, and probably, in addition to that million and a half, close on another million utterly apathetic, who looked on at the whole thing, with their hands in their pockets and their straw in their mouths, with as much enthusiasm as&mdash; probably infinitely less enthusiasm than &mdash;they would display at a cock fight.  It was eminently a matter for compromise and the men that we sent over there realised that and did their best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have had a challenge here for the last year to the collective wisdom of the majority of the people and the people are now paying for it, in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  What they will pay for in other ways, what they will pay for it in moral degradation, what they will pay for it in its influences on the growing youth of the country, remains to be seen.  Children growing into their teens in the atmosphere and amidst the circumstances we have had for the last year are not getting a chance.  It will be strange, if will be providential, if they grow up decent citizens with a proper idea of their responsibility. In any case, take the Army figure and take the compensation figure and let us hope that the people will realise <Col N="2549" /> that the blowing up of a bridge, whether it be a road bridge or a railway bridge or any other wanton act of destruction of property, is not a thing that they can afford to take a detached view of.  It is a destruction of the country's material wealth and it is something for which the people in the country will one day, sooner or later, have to put their hands in their pockets and pay for.  Optimists try to tell you that it is on the whole something to which there is a silver lining, that where a people that has not been doing its own house-keeping for centuries, whose habitual attitude of mind was an attitude of negation, a destructive rather than a constructive attitude, that this experience may not be wholly to the bad if it brings us more quickly to a responsible outlook, and if, in sheer reaction against all this turmoil and wanton destruction of last year, we take on that outlook more quickly than we otherwise would, that it is as well to take that for a silver lining, and if anyone can take comfort out of that particular view I suppose he is entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>Of course, the challenge is fizzling out, and it is fizzling out in the sordid and squalid way one would expect.  There is very little ennobling in it, and there are very few redeeming features in it, and very few outstanding acts of personal courage or gallantry, if we except one in the first week here in Dublin.  I wonder have these people, who threw down the challenge, any sense of their responsibilities, and I wonder have some, who helped to press the button and did not participate in the event, any realisation of the tremendous responsibilities that are upon them.  It is fizzling out in a sordid and squalid way; and Ireland has lived to contemplate an estimate of 40 million pounds for the coming year and endless and infinite harm done to her moral tone and her growing youth. That is the victory, and it was all done on the shibboleth that &ldquo;the people have no right to do wrong&rdquo;&mdash;that is the irony of the whole thing.  How much wrong has been done in the last year?  In one year of her history was ever so much wrong done in Ireland as has been done last year?  People say in written documents to each other that the British will come back, and that their coming back will be the act of God.  What blas phemy!  If the British came back, if <Col N="2550" /> by any possibility they were to wipe out our forces and to annihilate us, what kind of country would these people have to rely upon to assist them?  A country broken-hearted, with its <i>morale</i> bludgeoned out&mdash;a country thoroughly loathing the standards and the shibboleths to which it used to respond.  It is simply with no partisan bitterness that one says these things, but in the hope that gradually the lesson will sink into the minds of even the most thoughtless people of the county that you cannot simply fling out in a wanton way and do damage of that kind and hope to escape the material and moral consequences.  That is the only contribution I want to make with regard to these figures.</P>
    <P>Now, I have been asked certain questions.  One, I think, was addressed to me about the conduct of raiding parties, and the Deputy asking it was not clear as to whether I was the person to apply to in that matter. In Dublin particularly within the last few months the thing has ceased very much to be a military problem in any real sense of the word, and has become more and more just a matter of armed crime; a matter of lootings and arson, and more recently an attempt to intimidate the whole population. They were not to have recourse to places of amusement, and there was to be national mourning.  We met that, not with the regular uniformed troops, but with simply an extension of the Oriel House principle.  There is a good deal of plain clothes protection for the citizens of Dublin at the moment.  I will be glad to receive from the Deputy specific instances of abuses.  We are not standing for that, and we realise as clearly as he does, and perhaps, because of our position, more clearly, the necessity for checking such abuses, and they will be checked if we get the information and individuals will be brought to book. I ask him to remember this: that on these raids these men are brought into contact for the most part, in seven-tenths of the cases at any rate, with people bitterly hostile to them, people who certainly do not spare them from the point of view of tongue-lashing. Also, these men are overstrained, they are working very hard and are exposed to constant risks.  Some of them do not get more than four or five hours' sleep in the night, and if they do swagger a <Col N="2551" /> bit or show a certain amount of gasconade in the face of the receptions they get in the most of these places it is a thing that one can understand, but at the same time a thing that one has a duty to check and correct and as far as possible to eliminate.</P>
    <P>The other question was about the prisons.  As regards these, we have not yet reached the stage when the civil prisons are absolutely available for civil prisoners and no one else.  I am informed by the Minister for Defence that big preparations are on their way and will shortly be completed that will enable him to remove from the prisons almost all the military prisoners&mdash;I think certainly all the male military prisoners.  Speaking for my own Department, our attitude will be &ldquo;God speed the day.&rdquo; The present system does not tend towards efficiency, but we cannot end it or handle it until the situation arising from the presence of military prisoners is ended.</P>

      <P>With regard to the further stages of this Bill, Deputies have probably forgotten that we are discussing the Second Reading of a Central Fund Bill.  I hope this debate will not be taken as a precedent.  We are working under rather peculiar circumstances at the moment, and, therefore, I thought it better not to enforce the strict rules of order.  Deputies expected to have an opportunity of discussing specific proposals for taxation, but on this occasion they have no such opportunity. On the other hand, an estimate of receipts and expenditure has been placed in their hands, and as no machinery exists by which it can be discussed this afternoon I allowed it to be discussed upon the Second Reading of this particular Money Bill.  Once we were transgressing the Rules of Order I did not stop certain Deputies who introduced matters for which they have a peculiar <Col N="2552" /> fondness, and which they endeavour to introduce into almost every debate.  I think, however, the disorder, if I may so term it, must cease with the Second Reading debate.  We cannot have a repetition of it on the other stages of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Paper dealing with receipts and expenditure <Col N="2553" /> has been referred to in the discussion, and I think, for the information of Deputies, some slight explanation of it ought to be given.  Part 1 discloses the total receipts set out under four different headings, A, B, C, and D.  The tax revenue is made up of Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, Stamps, Death and other Duties.  In the case of Inland Revenue, there has been collected in Great Britain a sum estimated at £1,300,000, which is attributable to Saorstát Eireann.  On the other hand, there is a provisionally estimated sum of £3,000,000 which has been collected here, but is attributable to Great Britain, and a discharge of this sum in two payments will be found on page 2, Sub-section A&mdash; the last item on it&mdash;&ldquo;Payment to Great Britain for adjustment of Revenue,&rdquo; £1,300,000 (1922-23) and £1,700,000 (1923-24).  The item £1,300,000 has been discharged.  The other sum, £1,700,000, remains to be discharged out of next year's revenue, and accordingly provision is made for it there.  It is a provisionally estimated sum, consequently it will not be discharged until the exact amount is known. Non-tax revenue items are shown under Sub-head B, page 1.  They are made up of receipts from three Postal services, Miscellaneous and Special Rate under the Damage to Property Act, £300,000 instalment to the British Government of their contribution towards compensation for damage between January, 1919, and July 11th, 1921.</P>
      <P>(C) Capital raised for special purposes. The discharge for that is on page 2, Item C, also.  That is, having raised the money, provision is made there in the expenditure side of the account for its issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth item&mdash;the Unemployment Insurance Act&mdash;is for making good all sums that will be required to fund that account.  Part II. indicates the expenditure side.  Deputy Johnson has referred to certain items which were not before the Dáil on yesterday, because they are not in the nature of Supply services Those are charges on the Central Fund&mdash; statutory liabilities&mdash;which must be met, as will be observed from a perusal of the various items&mdash;local taxation grant, payment to the Road Fund.  Whatever sums come into revenue in respect of them, provision is made there for the discharge <Col N="2554" /> of the same amounts.  In this case there are £450,000 included under that head, £200,000 of which will be got from local authorities.  In respect of damage to property the other £250,000 is estimated to be collected from motor taxation&mdash;and will appear on the revenue side of our receipts.  The third item is what I have already explained&mdash;that is, Capital issues. The only other item it is necessary to draw attention to is the last item on the fourth page, which is a sum of £10,500,000.  Last year we presented Estimates for £38,744,000, and it is estimated that the total expenditure will amount to £28,244,000.  The main reason for that saving is that the compensation for damage has not materialised to the extent it was anticipated.  A sum not much is excess of £1,000,000 has been paid, and the enactment of the Damage to Property Act, which has already passed, will facilitate the flow of awards in respect of which a considerable amount of delay has been occasioned by reason of the necessity of getting a release from every person who gets an award from the Compensation Commission which is at present sitting.  Until that Act becomes law those people have a legal right&mdash;as has already been explained.</P>
    <P>That deals now with the first exhibit of receipts and expenditure under the Constitution.  Reference has been made during the discussion of this Bill as to the Taxation Law.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the law as it stands extends to goods coming from Australia or Canada, or any one of the other Dominions, the same rights as operate in Great Britain, that is to say, that those goods are entitled to the same reduction in taxation&mdash;that is, one-sixth, which is roughly what the amount is in the case of tea, cocoa, coffee, chicory, currants, and other dutiable goods, such as figs, raisins, prunes, sugar, molasses, saccharine, and so on.  In the case of <i>ad valorem</i> duties&mdash;the duties on motor cars and watches and clocks and musical instruments&mdash;what the late Professor Mahaffy used to call objects of vulgar amusement, and so on&mdash;they would be entitled to one-third reduction, and the duty they would pay or be liable for would be 22 2-9.  Cinematograph films, positive one-third, negative two-thirds of the full rates.  I think that will ease some people's minds, although it may <Col N="2555" /> possibly ease the Treasury purse as well. However, I think it is a reasonable thing, and, from the point of view of not disturbing taxation, it is the most equitable arrangement which, as the law stands, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, could be made.  I do not think that this would be the time for going into any detailed examination or explanation of the revenue.  I might say with regard to Income Tax that the revenue is not anticipated to be the same amount as last year by reason of the reduction from 6/- to 5/- which scarcely operated last year, the revenue for the previous year having been at the rate of 6/- in the pound. Furthermore, after two bad years the reduction will be more marked.  On that account there is in this year's estimate a sum of £1,000,000 less entered under that heading for revenue.</P>
    <P>I think that the other points that have been raised have been met.  There was one which I do not know if the Minister for Home Affairs mentioned, the question that was put to me about letters in and out to the internees and the prisoners that we have got.  It appears that those who are directing the activities of the Irregulars have decreed a time of mourning and we thought that it was unreasonable that all the mourning should be on one side and that there should be an opportunity afforded to prisoners to take part.  I think it was an excellent idea.  At any rate it brings home to them some of the disadvantages of the present situation.  We do not support this particular line of action that is going on.  We are no parties to it, and it is our duty to correct it.  From what has happened in the various places of internment nothing but strict discipline must be put into force if they are to be brought at all to a conception of the shocking atrocities that they have committed against the State.  When they appreciate that it is quite possible that they will come to their senses. Mention was also made, I think, by another Deputy, of visits and of certain exuberance of spirits on the part of persons raiding.  I can only say with regard to that that we have 10,000 prisoners. The murderer of Dr. O'Higgins is not yet dead; he is still living.  The murderer of my uncle is still living.  The murderer of young Emmet McGarry is <Col N="2556" /> still living.  Ten thousand prisoners as well are all living.  I think that while it is possible certain excesses may occur in many parts of the country those particular matters must not be forgotten. Even if out of the 30,000 or 40,000 or 50,000 troops that we have got there is a certain percentage&mdash;and it is a very small percentage&mdash;who have at some time or other allowed their hot blood to obscure their commonsense, as far as the Army is concerned and as far as the Government's conduct of this particular operation that we have on hands is concerned, there is something of which we must be proud, and that is the remarkable forbearance that has been shown towards people who have started this and are persisting in it, and who, whenever the weight of the people's wrath falls upon them, squeal, and turn and squirm.  There are not six cases, as far as I can learn, and as far as I am informed, throughout the country in which the property of these people or their friends was interfered with, and their shrieks in each one of these cases had been heard from one end of the country to the other, and even in America.  I have been in communication with many people who have lost valuable property and priceless records, and I have had to implore one particular man to place on record the losses that he has sustained, not for the purpose of recrimination, not to show what a serious loss has been occasioned him, but simply to see if it were possible by any means to bring home to any thinking person that may be amongst them these inhuman acts they are committing. If there be shame in that, I accept full blame for that shame.  I think that is all I have to say on the Second Reading of this Bill, which provides for something like £14,700,000 odd. It is necessary, as I have explained, in order to allow the public services to be carried on to the 31st July next.  Details will be furnished in connection with the particular items questions have been asked about.  A question has been asked about the Governor-General's establishment. The particular sum inserted there does not refer to the Governor-General's salary.  I have not got the figures as to what extent the sum of £10,000, provision for which was made in last year's estimate, was spent.  I rather think that no half of that sum <Col N="2557" /> was spent.  In connection with these sums voted, if not spent in one year they do not carry on.  A balance does not be transferred from one year to another. One must strike a further sum, so that there is no indication on the Paper, and there will not be until the details of the Estimates are being considered any information available to know what savings there have been in any of the Services. I formally move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

    <P>After the words &ldquo;Bank of Ireland,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;any advance&rdquo; should read &ldquo;may advance.&rdquo; That is a misprint.  This clause was drawn in the same form as the corresponding clause originally inserted in the Bill which became the Appropriation Act.  When that Bill was discussed exception was taken to the terms of the clause that was supposed to give special preference to the Bank of Ireland as compared with other banks, and as a result of the discussion an amendment was inserted last year in the appropriation Act setting out that the Minister for Finance may borrow from any person, and the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister for Finance, etc. I am advised that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; and Banking Corporation&rdquo; fulfil the same purpose.  I think it is already explained, and it is understood now that the Bank of Ireland was created by an Act of the Irish Parliament of 1782.  A section of that Act laid it down that the bank should not lend money to the Government <Col N="2558" /> except with the special authority of Parliament.  For that reason it has since been necessary, in order to enable the Government to borrow money from the Bank of Ireland, that special mention should be made of the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I move to agree with <Col N="2559" /> Amendment No. 1:&mdash;&ldquo;In Section 9 in line 4, to insert after the word &lsquo;any&rsquo; the words &lsquo;County Borough or Urban, or,&rsquo;&rdquo; and also Amendment 2: &ldquo;In line 5, of Section 9, to insert after the word &lsquo;such&rsquo; the words &lsquo;County Borough or Urban, or.&rsquo;&rdquo; The power of proceeding in cases under the Vaccination Acts has to be transferred from the Board of Guardians to the Sanitary Authority of the District. A mistake occurred in the drafting of the Bill, which provided that the Rural Councils might proceed in the case of Rural Districts, but provision was not made for proceedings in County Boroughs and in Urban Districts.  The necessary changes have, therefore, to be made.</P>

      <P>There was a matter left over on Friday&mdash;the framing of a reply to the message from the Seanad with regard to the proposed site for the Oireachtas buildings.

      <P>Arising out of that would the President not give the Dáil more information as to what the meaning of this message really is.  Should we not have some idea as to what is in the minds of those who are negotiating for premises other than these even whether they are to be temporary or not.  I hold that neither the Dáil nor the Cabinet ought to proceed to make arrangements for the housing of the Oireachtas without giving the public outside an opportunity of saying where those buildings should be.  I know for a fact that a considerable canvass is being made and a Press propaganda has been arranged by certain individuals for a transfer of the Headquarters of the Oireachtas out to Kilmainham.  As a result of that canvass, options are being secured on sites or efforts are being made to get options on sites out there.  Now I hold that the centre of the city is the proper site&mdash;no matter what property is involved in Kilmainham, and notwithstanding canvassing by people having property out there or people who do not want their property touched in the vicinity of what is now known as the Bank of Ireland.  No matter what influence they have, it should not be allowed to weigh with the Dáil and there should be no negotiations for other housing quarters without letting the Dáil know.  I hope the country if it is made clear at an election will get an opportunity of saying whether the Bank of Ireland should be the Headquarters of the Oireachtas or not.  I only mentioned this now because the advantages of Kilmainham are every day being pointed out and the disadvantages of College Green are being emphasised. I sincerely hope the Cabinet will not be swayed by any of the arguments put forward by those individuals who have some personal motive for or some interest in removing the Oireachtas buildings from the centre of the city.  I think the Minister ought to tell us what the temporary proposals now being discussed for the housing of the Oireachtas are.</P>

      <P>I was going to suggest that before submitting final plans for <Col N="2561" /> the temporary housing of the Oireachtas, it would be an advisable course to arrange for an informal visit of such members of the Dáil and Seanad as might desire to see alternative accommodation.  I suggest that could be done without adding to or taking from anything of the Message that is proposed to be sent to the Seanad, and that such a proceeding might, with profit, be adopted, so that we would be able to express some general view on the merits or demerits of any particular place which was in mind as an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned we wish to give each member of the Dáil and Seanad every possible facility for seeing the place at any time that would be convenient.  I could undertake to make the necessary arrangements. The plans, however, are not yet completed, and it might be as well if members allowed the plans to be developed before making an inspection.  However, I am perfectly willing, even before the plans are perfected, to allow any members who so desire, to pay a visit. We have some rough sketch plans outlined which members can be afforded an opportunity of seeing.  I do not know what Deputy Byrne means.  Certainly nobody has canvassed me, and I have canvassed nobody.  I have already explained more than once&mdash;and the sooner Deputy Byrne and those standing with him realise it the better&mdash;that I will not stand for a huge expenditure for a Parliament House if the Parliament can be accommodated at a smaller price.  I certainly will not.  If the Dáil desires to do so, it is perfectly entitled; but I will not stand for it.  I cannot see my way to recommend this Oireachtas to spend a huge sum of money when you can get suitable and cheaper accommodation. This is not a time for indulging in huge expenditure.  As far as options are concerned, I heard long ago of people taking options in the centre of the city in the likelihood that a Parliament House was going to go there.  As far as the Bank of Ireland is concerned, it would be well to realise your position.  You would have to provide another Bank for them, and probably have to build one.  I suppose you think that it means merely putting your hand in your pocket to find the money. Then you would have to reconstitute the other place We want this accommodation at once.  We have already explained more <Col N="2562" /> than once that there is not sufficient accommodation in the Government buildings for the business that we are doing; business is not well done when there is not sufficient accommodation.  The Oireachtas will get every opportunity of examining, criticising and changing the plans and doing anything it likes with regard to the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not want to detain the Deputies longer, but there is an urgent matter on which I should like the Government to give us some announcement. It is the matter of compensation for loss of property.  Just before Christmas they were good enough to say that they did not intend to proceed with actions and claims at the then ensuing sessions, which began in January. Everything was adjourned, and people were saved expense by the announcement. They were adjourned to Easter, and it was hoped that this Bill would become law in time to allow them to go on for the Easter Session, which begins a fortnight before we assemble.  The Seanad has a compensation Bill down for the Second Reading to-morrow, and I do not think they are going to spend their Easter holidays in sitting in Committee on that Bill.  In no case could the Bill become law before Wednesday next, so as to enable those Quarter Sessions which begin on Wednesday, and which will be going on for three weeks, to take up the claims.  I should like if the Minister for Home Affairs would make some announcement similar to that which he made last December, to the effect that the Government did not intend going on with those malicious injury cases at the next ensuing sessions.  It would be a great convenience not only to the Judges sitting at the next Sessions, but to the litigants who are in readiness to come on.</P>

      <P>I have discussed this matter with the Attorney-General, and the position is that the Bill is not <Col N="2563" /> law, and, even if it were to be passed through all its stages in the Seanad to-morrow, it would scarcely be possible to provide that those cases be heard at the Easter Sessions.  Procedure and rules would have to be laid down, and cases would have to be prepared.  It is not unlikely that it would be necessary for the County Court Judges to hold special Sessions to deal with claims of this kind. The State Solicitors throughout the country will receive instructions to apply for adjournments in claims of that kind, and consequently it will not be necessary or advisable for solicitors to bring up their witnesses or to go ahead with the cases.</P>

      <P>In supporting the adjournment, I wish to occupy the attention of the Dáil for a moment with a point of privilege.  Frequently I have noticed cases in the local newspapers where the privilege of the Dáil in regard to reporters attending here has been departed from by the use of certain expressions such as &ldquo;Southern Ireland&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Free State,&rdquo; and others with which many of the Deputies are conversant.  I would not have raised it because of that, but in answer to some questions by Deputy Figgis on Friday last I found it necessary to use the words &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire&rdquo; a few times in connection therewith, and I found that this paper omitted &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire&rdquo; and inserted &ldquo;Kingstown.&rdquo; That may appear a small point, but attention has been drawn to it in certain weeklies and in correspondence, and I believe that sooner or later it would arise here, and perhaps better sooner than later, because it does not help us.  I think that it is your duty to see that this discrepancy, whether deliberate or otherwise, is corrected.</P>

      <P>On the question of the date for adjournment, I would like to ask the President whether there is any good reason for meeting for two days on that particular week, and whether the purpose would not just as well be served by carrying over to the following Tuesday.  I think, unless there is very good reason, the Dáil would generally approve of an adjournment <Col N="2564" /> until the following Tuesday, and I think also it would be for the convenience of the Dáil if the Minister could indicate, without being too definite and without asking to bind himself, what would be the business for, say the week after the resumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of the reason for coming back that week has for the moment escaped my memory.

      <P>With regard to the other point that the Postmaster-General has raised, I am not quite clear as to what my duty is with regard to the Press.  I am not accepting exactly what the Postmaster-General said on that, but a particular paper has consistently used terms which are not the terms we use in our ordinary procedure, which are used in our reports and which are used generally.  In this particular instance I have had the editor of the paper spoken to on the telephone and he stated that he was sorry that the name &ldquo;Kingstown&rdquo; was inserted instead of &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire,&rdquo; and he agreed to print the answer to the question as it appears in our Official Report.  If the Dáil thinks that anything further should be done in the matter, it can, of course, take suitable action, but that has been done this evening, at any rate.</P>
