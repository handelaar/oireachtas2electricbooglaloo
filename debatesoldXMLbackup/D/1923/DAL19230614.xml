Kildare, Pay Book No. 18724, who joined the Army in Carlow, 14th July, 1922, and was discharged on the 14th April, 1923, as a time expired man, ceased on the 22nd November, 1922, and that the balance due up to the 14th April, 1923, of 21 weeks at £1 18s. 6d. per week, is still due to her; further, that Mrs. Delahunt has since died, on the 2nd May, 1923, the necessary burial expenses being considerable, and to ask whether the Minister will give orders that the withheld balance of the allowance be paid forthwith to Delahunt.</P>

    <Title>DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - INCREASE OF RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST (RESTRICTIONS), BILL, 1923.</Title>
    <P>(1)  The amount by which the increased rent of a dwellinghouse to which this Act applies may exceed the standard rent shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Where the landlord has since the fourth day of August, nineteen hundred and fourteen incurred, or hereafter incurs, expenditure on the improvement or structural alteration of the dwelling-house (not including expenditure on decoration or repairs), an amount calculated at a rate per annum not exceeding six, or, in the case of such expenditure incurred after the second day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty, eight per cent. of the amount so expended:</P>
    <P>Provided that the tenant may apply to the Court for an order disallowing or reducing such increase on the ground that such expenditure is or was unnecessary in whole or in part, and the Court may make an order accordingly:</P>
    <P>(b)  An amount not exceeding the amount for the time being payable by the landlord in respect of the rates chargeable, or which but for <Col N="1902" /> the provisions of any Act would be chargeable, on the occupier:</P>
    <P>(c)  In addition to any such amounts aforesaid:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  where the landlord is responsible for the whole of the repairs, an amount not exceeding ten per cent. of the standard rent; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  where the landlord is responsible for part and not the whole of the repairs, such lesser amount as may be agreed, or as may, on the application of the landlord or the tenant, be determined by the Court to be fair and reasonable having regard to such liability:</P>
    <P>Provided that pending any such agreement or application the amount shall be an amount not exceeding five per cent. of the standard rent; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  in addition to any amount under this or the preceding paragraph, where in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-two the landlord has expended an amount exceeding one-third of the standard rent, or during the period of the two years 1923 and 1924 shall have expended an amount exceeding two-thirds of the standard rent, on putting the dwelling-house into a reasonable state of repair, an amount not exceeding fifteen per cent. of such excess or excesses of expenditure:</P>
    <P>(d)  In further addition to any such amounts as aforesaid, an amount not exceeding ten per centum of the standard rent:</P>
    <P>(2)  At any time or times after the date of any increase permitted by paragraph (c) of the foregoing sub-section, the tenant or the sanitary authority may apply to the Court for an order suspending such increase, and also any increase under paragraph (d) of that sub-section, on the ground that the house is not in all respects in a reasonable state of repair.</P>
    <P>The Court on being satisfied by the production of a certificate of the sanitary authority or such other evidence as to the Court shall seem reasonable that any such ground as aforesaid is established, and on being further satisfied that the condition of the house is not due to the tenant's neglect or default or breach of agreement, shall order that increase to be suspended until the Court is satisfied <Col N="1903" /> that the necessary repairs (other than the repairs, if any, for which the tenant is liable) have been executed, and on the making of such order the increase shall cease to have effect until the Court is so satisfied.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any transfer to a tenant of any burden or liability previously borne by the landlord shall, for the purposes of this Act be treated as an alteration of rent, and where, as the result of such a transfer, the terms on which a dwelling-house is held are on the whole less favourable to the tenant than the previous terms, the rent shall be deemed to be increased, whether or not the sum periodically payable by way of rent is increased, and any increase of rent in respect of any transfer to a landlord of any burden or liability previously borne by the tenant where, as the result of such transfer, the terms on which any dwelling-house is held are, on the whole, not less favourable to the tenant than the previous terms, shall be deemed not to be an increase of rent for the purposes of this Act: Provided that, for the purpose of this section, the rent shall not be deemed to be increased where the liability for rates is transferred from the landlord to the tenant, if a corresponding reduction is made in the rent.</P>
    <P>(4)  On any application to a sanitary authority for a certificate or report under this section a fee of five shillings shall be payable, but, if the authority as the result of such application issues such a certificate as aforesaid, the tenant shall be entitled to deduct the fee from any subsequent payment of rent.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of this section, the expression &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; means any repairs required for the purpose of keeping premises in good and tenantable repair, and any premises in such a state shall be deemed to be a reasonable state of repair, and the landlord shall be deemed to be responsible for any repairs for which the tenant is under no express liability or liability implied under section forty-two of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act (Ireland), 1860.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where owing to the default of the landlord any dwelling-house to which this Act applies is not in a reasonable state of repair, the Court may order the landlord to pay to the tenant such compensation, not exceeding an amount equal to the annual amount of the standard <Col N="1904" /> rent, as to the Court seems just, provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The right of the tenant to obtain relief under this sub-section shall not prejudice his right to seek relief in any other form of proceedings;</P>
    <P>(b)  If at the time of the application for or the making of any order under this sub-section the landlord shall undertake to put the dwelling-house into a reasonable state of repair the Court may adjourn the application, or stay or suspend execution on any such order, and if the undertaking is fulfilled the Court may discharge such order;</P>
    <P>(c)  Any sum awarded to a tenant for compensation under this sub-section shall be expended on suitable repairs to the dwelling-house, and any order awarding compensation may be made subject to any conditions that the Court shall think fit to impose for the purpose of ensuring such expenditure as aforesaid.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment to this Section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (1) (c) (i) to insert after the word &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; in line 49 the words &ldquo;and has since the third Day of August, nineteen hundred and fourteen, expended an amount not less in the aggregate than one half of the standard rent.&rdquo;  I understand that the Minister has intimated his willingness to accept this and the next amendment unless other Deputies dissent.  I do not therefore propose to state the arguments in its favour.  The next amendment is:&mdash;In Sub-section (1) (c) (ii.) to insert the word &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; in line 52, the words &ldquo;and has so carried out repairs since the third day of August, nineteen hundred and fourteen.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (1) (d) to substitute the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; in line 5, page 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to move this amendment.  The Order Paper does not state the intention of the amendment.  Whose mistake it is I cannot say.  I shall confess to the guilt.  The word should be to substitute the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; for &ldquo;ten&rdquo; in Line 5 page 10.  The effect of the amendment <Col N="1905" /> would be to allow a house-owner to add 5 per cent. for nothing to the standard rent as a bonus.  The Bill desires to give to the houseowner a bonus of 10 per cent. on the standard rent.  It is difficult to understand on what principle 10 per cent. has been decided, and the Minister may say it is equally difficult to understand why 5 per cent. should be indicated.</P>
    <P>The only explanation I can give for that is that it brings the Bill into accord with the Dáil Decree allowing an increase of 15 per cent. from the standard rent, to include repairs.  The 10 per cent. which is mentioned in the Bill is an increase to the landlord by virtue of the fact that other people were making at the time, or have been making higher profits on their investments than in pre-war times.  We are told to-day, at any rate, that no such increases are being made.  It may be said, on the other hand, that inasmuch as the cost of living to the landlord or house-owner has increased in the same way as for other people, therefore the landlord is entitled to an addition.  If there is any title to an addition, it is to more than 10 per cent.  I cannot see the grounds for fixing a sum not exceeding 10 per cent. simply by virtue of his ownership.  We have already agreed to an increase upon the standard rent to cover new expenditures, interest on new expenditures.</P>
    <P>This is a new proposal to allow an increase on a standard rent of 10 per cent. as a bonus.  I do not think there is any case for any increase, but as a compromise and to meet the Minister, the amendment proposed is to allow him, just to show good feeling, 5 per cent. upon the standard rent.  The fact must be borne in mind that a large number of tenants throughout the country have as a matter of fact been protected by the Dáil Decree. If this Bill passes in its present form it <Col N="1906" /> means that landlords will be free to increase rents by 5 per cent. more than the increase allowed by the Dáil Decree, and if they take advantage of that facility there will be a very great deal of trouble indeed in the country.  The conditions are not such now as to encourage us to run that risk.  Therefore I urge the acceptance of this amendment limiting the amount of increase under paragraph (b) sub-section (1), to 5 instead of 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>It will be noted that one member of the Advisory Committee signed the report with the reservation that that 15 per cent. should stand, and in fact the 10 per cent. represents a compromise between conflicting views within the Committee, a compromise which resulted in the agreement of all members, with the exception of Mr. Judd.  I personally do not consider it right, and I certainly do not consider it wise, to depart from a recommendation of this Committee on which conflicting interests were amply represented.  In this respect I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment and I propose to adhere to the figure which the Committee advised me to adhere to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'CALLAGHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the following amendment&mdash;&ldquo;To insert before Section 9 the following new Section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  If a dwelling-house to which this Act applies ceased to be used as a dwelling, and so continues bona fide for a longer period than two months, the Court may, upon the application of the sanitary authority or of any person appearing to the Court to be interested, require the landlord to <Col N="1909" /> show cause why the dwelling-house should not again be let and may order that it be again let within a period to be fixed by the Court, but not exceeding two months, and if the landlord fail to comply with the order of the Court all his interest in the dwelling-house shall be transferred to and vested in the sanitary authority for the period of the duration of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  A dwelling-house which is let to a tenant under the provisions of this Section shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment, which is designed to prevent the abuse of houses, to prevent houses being locked up for an indefinite period. Owing to the shortage of houses people are put to great hardship and this would become intensified if landlords were allowed to lock up houses and to wait to sell them at a high price, which might never materialise.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment as it will relieve to some extent the shortage complained of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat puzzled with regard to this amendment and the exact meaning of &ldquo;bona fide for a longer period than two months.&rdquo; There seems to me nothing for the Court to decide and nothing that could be properly laid before the Court.  The fact of houses standing vacant in a time of shortage is undoubtedly an evil and an anomaly, but I submit that this is not the best way to deal with them.  It could, for instance, be better dealt with by the Minister for Local Government imposing full rates on vacant houses. The amendment suggests an interference which I do not think is warranted by the circumstances.  The house is let and the tenant dies, let us say, and it is claimed that if within two months the house is not let again, the owner could be brought into Court to show cause why it should not be forthwith let, and if he fails to let it the local authority of the area is to take over full and complete possession for the period of this Act.  That I think is a fair statement of the effect of this amendment.  It is too drastic an interference with the property rights of the owner to be accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, further, the danger that a <Col N="1910" /> provision of this kind might well lead to the discouragement, if not the intimidation, of prospective purchasers.  The owner of a house must have a certain liberty in dealing with it.  He must have a fair opportunity to see whether it can be disposed of by sale and in their own interests it can be taken that owners will not only not leave houses vacant indefinitely, in the event of failure to sell that they will undoubtedly let. The idea of confiscation for a period underlying this amendment scarcely appeals to one as a wise or advisable expedient to adopt.  It is open to abuse. There can be, for instance, that kind of idea got up that it would be a good thing to refrain from making any offer within the two months either to buy or to let and then bring the owner into Court to show cause why the house should not be immediately let at what to him would be an unfavourable figure.  His property would be taken over by the local authority for the period of the duration of this Act. I agree that some pressure ought to be brought to bear on owners of houses to insure that they would not be left vacant indefinitely in a period of extreme shortage, but I cannot accept this amendment and I think that there are other ways less extreme of dealing with a problem which is undoubtedly there to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate part of it is that we are dealing with an Increase of Rent Bill and this is an occasion when it might be possible to have an evil, which the Minister admits to exist, remedied in this Bill and so far it has not been within the programme of the Ministry to introduce a Bill authorising the Minister for Local Government to extend his powers of pressure.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he wishes to postpone the consideration of this amendment, to take a walk through his prospective new constituency and make some enquiries as to how long many houses in that constituency have been un-let and un-occupied and from there go around Gloucester street and Gardiner street and many other streets around the centre of Dublin and put the two pictures before his mind's eye and ask why these, in his own constituency, should continue to be un-occupied while people are still pressing for houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> If the Minister says two months is not a long enough period for the landlord to hold his house for the highest price, then there is room for extension of the period from 2 to 3 or 4 months.  But what we really see is that houses are vacant, and that they remain unoccupied for months upon months and years. Some houses have been unoccupied for two years, but because the landlord cannot get his price he will not let, and it is to meet the case of the landlord who refuses to let, that this amendment is put down.  He will not let because he wants to sell.  He will not sell at the price offered to him by a prospective tenant.  He holds for the higher price. The buyer and seller do not come to an agreement, and the house remains un-occupied.</P>
    <P>It is a fair thing in regard to the general provisions of this Bill that the house which has been built pre-war and now unoccupied, should be let to the tenant at the standard rent, plus such allowances as are being agreed to in this Bill.  The amendment would still allow a landlord to seek a purchaser, and there is nothing in the Bill to restrict the price, but the amendment would restrict the liberty of the landlord to hold that property out of use pending a satisfactory price. After all it is a creation of a further house famine.  When we are talking about the need for rebuilding, the needs for housing, everyone realising the difficulty of rehousing must admit that the practice that is prevailing is intensifying those difficulties.  What we are asking you to do in this amendment is practically to give the effect of building probably a couple of hundred houses within the county of Dublin within three months.  That surely should appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have no census of the number of houses vacant waiting for buyers, but the numbers are very large, and as I say, the effect of this amendment, if carried, would be the effect of building one or two hundred houses within three months, and to that extent at least lessening the housing problem.  The injustice the Minister fears is not injustice at all, and it is no greater injustice even on his own argument on any other part of the measure; it is simply insisting that houses built pre-war shall be let at a <Col N="1912" /> certain rental.  The landlord says: &ldquo;The first opportunity I have of finding houses vacant, I shall get outside the Bill, and wait for a buyer.&rdquo;  I submit the acceptance of this amendment would mean in effect the building of a very large number of houses, particularly within five miles of the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I would like to know at this stage if we are to interpret the Minister as recommending the Local Government Ministry that rates are to be paid for houses when idle.  From the experience I had in public Boards, I find if a sanitary authority makes certain orders in connection with the insanitary condition of a building, the sanitary authority who cannot get the landlord to do certain things, orders him to close the building, and as a result the property is closed up and deteriorates, thus adding further to the housing famine.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider his own suggestion again, and I hope Mr. O'Callaghan will bring forward an amendment at another stage of the Bill.  It would go a long way toward settling the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson did not really bring forward arguments that would support action of the drastic character proposed in this amendment.  I think it introduces a principle which would operate against the filling of the housing shortage which exists.  It seems to me it would tend to have a deterrent effect in the way that for instance the fixing of the scheme of fair rent courts for houses would.  We might bring this possibility of having sanitary authorities to take possession of houses from the owners who decline to let, so that when those owners have got clear possession of the rights to some extent, it would be difficult to calculate to what extent it tended to deter people from investing in houses, or in going into the building of houses.  We have to bear in mind, in dealing with any of these propositions in regard to houses, that the houses are not things that are there for somebody to take possession of.  They have to be constructed, and if there is any possibility of people being further cut out of the rights which they would normally have as owners, the tendency <Col N="1913" /> would be for people to refrain from putting money into houses which they otherwise might.  You might have a conspiracy to prevent people from even renting a house, not to speak of buying it, so that somebody might get it from the sanitary authority at a great deal less than the standard rent.  That is a possibility if an amendment such as is on the paper were to be adopted.</P>
      <P>I agree that, in view of the present circumstances, it is unfortunate that the owners of dwelling houses should be free of rates while those dwelling houses are unoccupied, and I would undertake to consider, from the point of view of the Local Government Department, whether we could not introduce something into this Bill on the next Stage making it possible to have the owner of a dwelling house, which would come under this Act, deemed to be the occupier when the house is unoccupied and liable for rates.  As the law stands at present, the rates are not on the building but on the occupier of the building.  There is some difference between Poor Rate and Town Rate, but, broadly speaking, the rates are on the occupier, so that when the house is un-occupied, except where there are special provisions, the owner of the house is not liable for any rates.  It would certainly be in the nature of considerable pressure on the owner of a house if he had to pay the full rates of that house during the time it was unoccupied.  He certainly would not leave it unoccupied for any length of time except he was convinced that he was not being offered what he considered a fair price and that there was some reasonable prospect of being offered a fair price for the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if we did that we would put sufficient pressure on owners of houses to let or to close with some person who is offering to purchase.  I would like of course to consider the matter with some greater care than I have been able to do up to the present before actually agreeing to a provision of that sort.  However, I do think that if it is not likely to create difficulties in other directions or have effects which might lead to litigation and confusion in the matter of rating, we might introduce such a provision. It does cut across the ordinary principle of rating, but if it were possible at this time of emergency in housing matters to introduce such a provision, I think it would certainly lessen the likelihood of <Col N="1914" /> houses being wantonly&mdash;if one may use the word&mdash;kept vacant for any lengthy period.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is a very desirable change to saddle the owner of an unoccupied house with certain responsibilities to induce him to let, and not to hold out for an exorbitant price. I hope that in any case that change will be made.  I very much doubt that it would be possible to bring it into the scope of this Bill, but in any case such an amendment would not satisfy the requirements. I wonder whether, when the Minister uses the argument that the adoption of such an amendment as this would deter building, he seriously thinks that within the next five years, or within the next three years&mdash;the scope of this Bill as it is drawn&mdash;there is any likelihood of speculation in housebuilding for the purpose of letting.  People will build houses, I have no doubt, for their own use, and the Minister, I am sure, is anxious to encourage that, but I very much doubt whether he has any anticipation that people are going to build houses for the purpose of letting within the next three or four years.  If my observations are at all accurate, the chances are almost nil that any such prospect is in front of us, so, if this view is correct, the adoption of this amendment would have no effect in deterring people from building houses.  I think the amendment ought to be accepted, and I ask the Dáil to support it.</P>

      <P>If the house is not let or sold within a particular period, it falls then to the local authority of the area for the duration of the Act.  The amendment is silent as to what would happen at the expiry of the Act, but presumably a tenant in possession would remain a tenant in possession.  The danger of that course is that you would have a situation in which a circle would be drawn around that particular house, and people would be told to &ldquo;keep off from that; it is in its incubation period; one of these days it will be falling to the local authority, and you will get it for nothing.&rdquo;  That is the kind of situation you would create by a provision of that kind.  The waiting game, the Deputy knows as well as I know, in rural areas in particular is very easily played, and people very often are very easily discouraged. If it becomes known that they cannot go into a certain house or a certain farm without a certain amount of good-will from their neighbours, then, in fact, in 75 per cent. of the cases they do <Col N="1916" /> not go in.  So a charmed circle would be around this house that would be about to fall into the Local Authority for two or three months, as the case might be, and the Local Authority would, no doubt, see its way to dispose of it at a very much lower price than the owner would dispose of it.</P>

I consider that the undertaking that the Minister for Local Government has given is an honest and reasonable attempt to meet this particular evil, but we ought not to set about to relieve one evil by a greater one, and that I think would be the tendency and would be the net effect of the Deputy's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> To insert before sub-section (1) <i>(a)</i> line 55 the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That where a dwelling house and business premises are held in common as an Annual Letting, this Act shall not apply unless it is shewn that the value of said premises for residential purposes alone is more than one-half its annual letting value for the combined purposes of trade and residence, and accordingly in case the annual letting value of any premises for the combined purpose of trade and residence is shown to be more than double its value for residential purposes alone, nothing in this Act shall affect the right of the owner to recover possession of same or otherwise obtain a competitive annual rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am proposing this amendment for the purpose of relieving hardships, for there have been cases of hardship brought under my notice in relation to the Rent Restriction Act for some time past. There is no clear distinction drawn between business houses and houses used only as dwellings.  This Act was intended to safeguard the tenants, but surely it was not intended to inflict injustice or injury to business and trade?  It is inequitable that the tenant for a business house should be able to prevent the owner from getting possession of his own premises, or from getting a competitive rent.  It is not just to the individual, nor is it to the interests of the State.  I feel the amendment is necessary and its acceptance cannot impose any hardship on any class that needs protection. These who hold these premises are not the class that so much need protection. The insertion of this sub-section cannot do any harm.</P>

I think that the gist of the amendment cannot be reconciled with the sub-section which has been passed by the Dáil.  There is the further apparent inconsistency, that there is a provision that business premises should be controlled under Section 16.  That has not been passed, and therefore it does not arise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to put the owner of business premises in the same position with regard to the bonus, as I call it, as the owner of the residence.  Section (8), sub-section (1), paragraph <i>(d)</i>, which has been adopted, says that there may be a further addition to any such amounts over and above the standard rent, the amount not exceeding 10 per cent. of the standard rent.  The proposal in Section (16) is that when the Bill is applied to business premises, the landlord shall be entitled to add an amount not exceeding 25 per cent. of the standard rent.  The amendment seeks to limit that increase under this head to 10 per cent.  Deputy McGoldrick and other Deputies from distant parts of the country are very familiar with the smaller shop-keeper.</P>
      <P>Apart from the general question of the economic utility of the small shopkeeper, there is no doubt that if 25 per cent. is allowed to be added over and above any other increases that are allowed they will be badly hit, and there is no case made, except in the case of competitive rents.  The Bill itself is a restriction upon the right of the landlord to levy that toll, and he has power to levy that toll because of the high cost of building to-day. It is just as difficult to build a shop or business premises as it is to build residential premises.  If we believe the stories that come to us from Donegal and Kerry and other parts of the country, the shop-keeper of to-day is not in as good a position to live out of his trade, and the Bill is going to authorise an increase of 25 per cent. for these business premises as against an increase of 10 per cent. for a house-owner.</P>

I submit it is necessary for the Minister in asking that business premises shall be placed in a position two and a half times worse than the tenant of the house in relation to the landlord, to explain and to justify to the Dáil the difference.  If he can satisfy the <Col N="1921" /> shop-keeping element in the country and those who speak more particularly for the shop-keeping element in the Dáil that such provision is desirable, then I think the Dáil would accept it.

      <P>The 1920 Act controlled business premises for one year, and the 35 per cent. was allowed.  It is, to a certain extent, a concession to control them again at all, and the reduction from 35 per cent. to 25 per cent. which the Committee recommends is decidedly fair under all the circumstances. The shopkeepers&mdash;shall we put it at the lowest, and say&mdash;the shopkeepers are not the least fortunate class in the community at the moment, and there is no reason that I can see why they should make their increased profits without paying a somewhat increased rent.  Almost from the start of this Bill the mentality seems to have been that anyone was entitled to a profit except the landlord. The word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; is a word that has certain associations of ideas calculated to create prejudice.  If you call him a person who owned houses it would sound ever so much better, but when the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; is mentioned Deputy Davin's blood boils, and he talks of people who are thrown out on the roadside, and so on, forgetting, as I said yesterday, that in very many cases the circumstances of the bloated landlord are not nearly as good as the circumstances of his tenants, and that a great many landlords were people who were living on certain annual rentals at a time when the purchasing power of money was very much greater than it is at present.  These rentals have not increased in proportion to the decreasing purchasing power of money, leaving a great many of these people in very dire straits and in very bad circumstances indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conventional picture of the bloated landlord is not in accordance with facts. <Col N="1922" /> This middle man for whom Deputy Johnson pleads is not the least fortunate person in the community at the moment. For the most part he is more fortunate than his landlord.  I will not depart in this respect from the recommendations of the Committee.  No case has been put up for such a departure, no case sufficient to warrant the disregard of the advice of the Committee who can well be called experts on this very technical subject. The contention used to be that direct contact of producer and consumer was the ideal to be aimed at, and that the elimination of the middle man was desirable.  It will be interesting to hear if that, as an economic programme, has been abandoned by Deputy Johnson and by his colleagues.</P>

      <P>If there is nobody else to plead the cause of the small shop-keeper then it is left to us, I am sorry to say.  I would wish that the Minister, or one of his colleagues, was thinking of bringing in a Shopkeepers Purchase Bill, and buying three-fourths of them out, on the taxation of the fourth, but inasmuch as that desirable end is not being sought for by the Ministry, my only suggestion is that the landlord, who in this case has not done anything at all to warrant the increase of his income by virtue of his ownership of these shops, should not therefore be rewarded. We should take out of the mouths of some of the shopkeepers such justification as they have for increased prices to the consumer.  If you are going to add to the rental they are to pay, they have at least that little modicum of excuse for higher charges and higher profits.  I want to remove if possible that excuse, so that we can then go fiercely to the shopkeeper for overcharging the consumer.</P>

It is unwise, I think, to let the public and the prospective builders of houses that the Minister has in mind lie under the delusion that there is any prospect whatever of this control ceasing by 1926.  There may be a chance of its ceasing by 1930. It is for that reason I propose the amendment to make the date 1930.</P>

      <P>I am glad, despite the fact that I have not been able to accept many of Deputy Johnson's amendments, he still thinks the Bill good enough to double its life.  The period of three years was selected because it is about as long a time as we felt we could measure in this particular matter of housing.  If the conditions at the end of <Col N="1924" /> that time are such as to require the renewal of the Bill or the extension of its life, then the Parliament of the day will undoubtedly deal with that.  The lifetime of this Bill will run until about the last year of the Parliament that will be elected in a few months' time.  I think that the Constitution provides for four years as the normal life of a Parliament. There will be ample opportunities for the Parliament of 1926 to consider the situation and decide whether or not this Bill is required to be extended.  It may possibly affect the situation in some way if the Bill is not considered immediately before the election.  As to Deputy Hennessy's remark, I am sorry that he has such a bad opinion of the Bill, and, having that opinion, he made no representations to the Ministry responsible for bringing it forward with a view to improving it.</P>

      <P>It is a fair rule in family life that the parents should so conduct themselves that the children should not have abnormal difficulties facing them in their youth.  The Minister wants to hand over to the successors of this Parliament what appears to be quite likely a fierce conflict over the question of rent restriction.  I am not so confident as the Minister appears to be that the next Parliament will be so willing to pass legislation as beneficial as that of this Parliament, and no doubt they will have very much to concern themselves with.  I would much rather that tenants, in towns particularly, should not have to run the risk of a fierce conflict with the Parliament of that day on the question of the removal of the Rent Restriction Act.  I admit quite freely, and I give the Minister all credit, that this Bill is a very great improvement upon the old British Act, though it is worse than the Dáil Decree, and it is a very much better Bill indeed than the Bill which is now before the British House intending to amend the Act of 1920.  This I say all on condition that the matter we were discussing last night is embodied before the Bill leaves the Dáil&mdash;namely, that the provision that any agreements that are to be allowed between the landlord and the tenant are <Col N="1925" /> subject to the restrictions embodied in the Bill.  I give the Minister all credit for having brought in a Bill which is fairly good.  It might be better, and it would have been better if he had the good sense to accept our amendments; but we cannot expect everything from the Minister, though undoubtedly he will improve with age.</P>

      <P>The first thing I will deal with is that which was referred to last evening, namely, the circular that was issued with regard to canvassing of T.D.'s.  I wish to say that, as far as being approached by officials of the Department is concerned, I only saw one individual in this House in a private room, and I understood that individual was acting on behalf of the staff.  I stated I was acquainted with the staff for a number of years.  Any other person I saw was outside this House.  Also I understood that this individual approached me during a period of leave. I contend that, that being so, there was no necessity for the drastic terms of the circular issued on the 12th June.  The other question is that of the temporary <Col N="1926" /> staff in the Solicitor's Department.  It is rumoured that this staff is going to be dispensed with in connection with the reconstitution of the Land Commission.  It appears to me that the administration in connection with the carrying out of the Land Bill will have to be strengthened, especially legal work done in connection with the previous Land Bill.  The previous work has been done by the solicitor, who was acting in conjunction with the tenant and the landlord.  That will be quite the opposite from what one may anticipate regarding this Act when it is amended and passed.  For that reason it would be incorrect to anticipate that the staff in the legal department, who have an average service of eight years will be treated in the way it is rumoured they are to be treated.  All that I ask is an assurance that those men who have long service, and who are fully acquainted with all the working of the legal department, should be taken over with any section of the temporary staff that may be taken over by the Ministry.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely in favour of this amendment of Deputy Fitzgibbon.  The question of canvassing has nothing to do with it.  The question is, are the demands of those clerks just or unjust?  They are just.  They have been kept for years working in the Civil Service on a starvation wage, and now, when the whole thing is being reorganised, when the thousands accumulated by the Congested Districts Board are being turned over to this new Land Commission, I do not see why justice should not be meted out to those clerks.  They have been working for 16 or 20 years in the service of this Commission, and they are still working at £150 a year.  That amount during the war was worth, say, about 17s. 6d. a week, and therefore justice should be meted out to them now. Those men who controlled the Board and who turned it into a life trust, whose interest is to prolong the settlement of the land question, paid themselves the bonuses.  They did not pay these men the bonus; they let them stew on the starvation wages they had before the war. What is the position of the Government, that wishes this thing to continue.</P>

      <P>I wish to say I think the Congested Districts Board staff have a great grievance.  They were treated badly by the whole Board.  The Minister <Col N="1927" /> for Agriculture gave an assurance yesterday evening that they would be put on a Civil Service basis as Second Division Clerks, and that in future their service would be taken into consideration by the Minister for Finance.  I should like to know if that means that the years they spent in the Congested Districts Board will be taken into account just as if they spent those years under the Land Commission.  The British Treasury, I understand, offered to take over those men, and the offer was rejected by the Congested Districts Board on the grounds that they had no money.  They held to that decision up to the last, and when they examined their reports at the end they found that they had £153,000 to the good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this question of the clerks ought to be approached in this way.  There is no doubt up to some time ago the intention of the Board was to treat those as Civil Servants, on the same lines as Second Division Clerks. That has certainly been proved by those who are making this claim now.  In 1920 a certain revision or reorganisation of the Civil Service took place, and if the Congested Districts Board had carried out their original intention, and had given the same freedom to their clerks that the Civil Servants in a similar position got, they, too, would have carried out the reorganisation on Whitley lines at that time.  Assuming that they had done that&mdash;which all must agree would have been a perfectly fair and right and just thing&mdash;I take it that the Government, in taking over these people now would take them over in the positions in which they would have found them.  The point is: are we, in taking them over now, entitled or is it fair or right on our part to take advantage of the fact that the Congested Districts Board did not do by these men what it should have done, and what we think it should have done, two or three years ago.  I think that is a consideration we should bear in mind when we come to consider the equities of the question.  I would suggest that that is the point of view from which the Minister, in taking over these people, should consider the case.</P>

      <P>I have been, I suppose, <Col N="1928" /> indirectly responsible for the fact that the Minister for Agriculture issued that circular in reference to canvassing, because I drew the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to the presence of not one but at least three representatives of these men outside the Dáil who were canvassing Deputies, myself included.  If we are to conduct the affairs of this country on anything above the standard appertaining to a Rural District Council or a Board of Guardians we certainly could not avoid taking the step that the Minister has taken.  I do think that to wink at it or to gloss it over or to permit it to be continued would leave us open to the charge of permitting a most reprehensible practice&mdash;a practice that no Parliament in any country would dare to tolerate.

      <P>Deputy Davin asked for an undertaking that the officials of the Solicitor's Office in the Congested Districts Board will get the same treatment as the temporary clerks of the Board.  I give that undertaking.  They will get exactly the same treatment, and the fact that they are in a slightly different position will not count against them.  With regard to the amendment, I have been asked to do so many things for the staff of the Congested Districts Board that I find myself in some doubt as to what exactly I am really expected to do.  Perhaps the best thing I can do is to keep to the amendment.  I will read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Upon the transfer to the employment <Col N="1929" /> of the Irish Land Commission of officers of the Congested Districts Board the Minister for Agriculture, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, may make regulations providing for the appointment to the Executive class of the Civil Service of the State of pensionable officers who obtain such certificate of efficiency as may be required by the regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has the power to do that already.  I take it that there is no doubt whatever about that.  Everybody is clear about it.  The Minister for Finance has the power to promote any officer, whether he be temporary or not, whether he be a Civil Servant or a non-Civil Servant, to an Executive post in the Civil Service.  There is nothing to argue about so far as the first part of the amendment is concerned.  The amendment goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and for the appointment to the clerical class of the Civil Service of the State of all other pensionable clerical officers and non-pensionable clerical officers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has equal power to do that.  There is no chance whatever that he is going to appoint an unpensionable clerical officer to the pensionable clerical class, but, in fact, he has power to do that if he so wishes.  The amendment proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and such regulations may provide that for the purpose of determining the salary and seniority of officers transferred or appointed as aforesaid, their permanent service in the Civil Service of the State as provided by Section I. shall be taken into account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has the right to take any relevant considerations into account, and he will, in fact, take all relevant considerations into account. The amendment concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and their salaries adjusted according to such service, and that any increments which would have accrued in such service shall be paid retrospectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that.  First of all, no one is in a position to say at this stage what increments would have accrued. There are officers in the Congested Districts Board who would have been in receipt of a higher salary if they had been in the Land Commission or in the <Col N="1930" /> Department of Agriculture.  There are officers of the Congested Districts Board who would have been in receipt of the same salary that they have been receiving. There are officers in the Congested Districts Board&mdash;temporary officers&mdash; and they might have had lower salaries if they had been in the Department of Agriculture or the Land Commission or in the ordinary Civil Service.  Nobody can look back and say &ldquo;Such a man would have been in such a position if he had been in such a service.&rdquo;  It would be quite impossible.  In any event, the principle is absolutely unsound.  We can promise to do our best to give every man a fair chance so far as we are concerned in the future, but we cannot promise, and we do not intend to promise, to right all the wrongs&mdash;where there have been wrongs&mdash;in the past.  We could not do it.  We would be taking on a task which we would find would be growing every day.  The principle is absolutely unsound, and I do not propose to give any undertaking of that kind.  We will do what we can in the way of giving treatment to people who are entitled to treatment&mdash;establishing people who are entitled to be established, and grading the various grades of the Congested Districts Board into the appropriate grades in the Civil Service.  We will do what we can in that way to make up to them for what they lost in the past, but we can do no more.</P>

      <P>I want to answer a couple of arguments that have been adduced.  In his first speech the Minister for Agriculture complained that this amendment was only conferring powers upon the Ministry which they already possessed, and that it was only a permissive amendment.  If that is a real objection I am quite prepared, if he wishes, to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may,&rdquo; and make it obligatory.  I do not know whether that is the ground of his objection or not, but I do not desire to stand in the way of any amendment of that kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree.  Therefore, I would be quite willing <Col N="1931" /> on the Report Stage to have a good deal of the earlier part of the amendment, dealing with powers that are already possessed, struck out, but the vital portion of this amendment is where the sting is in the wasp&mdash;in the tail. That is the part that provides that these people should be treated as their employers promised to treat them, and placed in the positions they would have occupied had they not been prevented from rising in salary by purely arbitrary barriers imposed on them because they had not been put upon a Civil Service basis, as was promised them.  It seeks to empower the Ministry, out of the moneys these men earned and were carried over with them to the Land Commission, to make good to them these increments in salaries they would have obtained if the promises that were given by their employers had been carried out. That is power which is necessary, so far as I am capable of forming any opinion, to enable the Treasury to carry out the object of the amendment.  I am by no means satisfied that the Minister for Finance would have the power to authorise one penny of retrospective pay to these men without express Parliamentary sanction.  It is for that reason that I think the concluding words of this amendment are necessary, and that they are not covered by the undertaking given by the Minister.  The Minister has promised, and I have no doubt his promise will be fulfilled, in a way that previous promises to these men were not fulfilled, that he will do all he can in the way of grading and restoring to them the positions they would have held if the promises of their former employers had been carried out.  I have no doubt that the Minister will carry that out loyally, but I doubt that he possesses the power to give to these men the increments they would have obtained if the promises of their former employers had been carried out.  The only thing he has really urged against this is, if he yields to the prayer of these men he will be deluged with similar applications from other people. Where will he be able to find any body of men in the public employment with twelve years of promises in writing, repeated over and over again, that would be treated in this way, with a document handed over by their late employers to this Government urging this Government <Col N="1932" /> to carry out the promises their former employers had broken?  Surely there cannot be any such body of men in existence, a body of men bringing with them to the new Department money that has actually been saved out of their own pockets and by the broken pledges of their employers.  If there be any such other body of men I respectfully suggest that they are just as much entitled to receive from the Government the consideration I ask for these men, and which the Government should not in common honesty deny.  It is not that we are trying to saddle this Government with the obligations of the British Government. I am asking that these men be paid out of money that they are bringing into the service, money that has been saved out of their own pockets.</P>

      <P>First of all, if the money is on the Vote it is open to the Minister for Finance to pay anybody retrospectively. However, I do not want to take refuge in that for a moment.  I am absolutely against the principle of paying these men retrospectively.  I stated already, and I repeat it, that we cannot undertake to right all the wrongs that were done in the last hundred years. All we can do is to give everybody a fair chance in the future.  If we do that we will be doing our part well.  There are a good many dismissed and resigned Civil Servants, men who resigned, perhaps, for good reasons.  Would anybody suggest that we should not only pay them their entire salaries during the period of their dismissal, but have a Commission set up to find what promotion they would have got if they had not resigned or if they were not dismissed?  Is that the suggestion?  If so, are not these people as well entitled as these clerks of the C.D.B., who drew their salaries, such as they were, during all this period? The fact of the matter is that the C.D.B. men want something you cannot have in this world&mdash;absolute security.  We all have to take our chances.  They are depending to a great extent on the goodwill of the particular people who are in charge of the Congested Districts Board and in charge of the finances of the country at the moment.  Nobody can insure them against anything that may happen in that way.  It is quite impossible. Like everybody else, they have to depend on the good will, good sense, <Col N="1933" /> and sense of fair play of these people, and they are not entitled to come along and ask for any more assurance, and they are not entitled to come along and <Col N="1934" /> get rights, privileges and safeguards that no other class can get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on First Reading that the price of a tenancy on which a judicial rent of £100 had been fixed prior to 1911, was to be approximately fifteen years' purchase, and that the tenant purchaser's annuity was to be £65, a reduction of 35 per cent.  It will obviate misunderstandings if we consider the general principles of the Bill in their application to such a tenant.  His case is the key to the position.  The figures which apply to it can be adjusted and made to apply to the very small number of judicial tenancies on which rents were fixed after 1911.  This 35 per cent. reduction gives the tenant on the average 10 per cent. better terms than tenants who have purchased under the 1903 Act, and between 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. better terms than tenants who have purchased under the 1909 Act.  Consider what that means.  Annuity is interest and sinking fund on money lent by the State and borrowed by the tenant to pay for his holding.  The rates of interest between 1903 and the outbreak of the European war were 2¾ and 3 per cent.  The rate <Col N="1939" /> now is 4½ per cent.  Notwithstanding this increase, we were faced with the problem of evolving a scheme which would leave the tenant's interest and sinking fund not merely the same, but actually lower, than pre-war figures.  Land Purchase is essentially a stock exchange transaction, and we were under the necessity of carrying it through as if the European war with its tremendous reactions on prices and credits had never occurred; as if the rebellion of the last twelve months had not cost us about three times the price of land purchase; as if, in fact, the trend of things was entirely the other way.  We have tried to do it, and as I have said, the terms offered give to tenant purchasers under this Bill annuities between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. lower than the annuities of pre-war tenant purchasers.  The term over which the tenant-purchaser will pay annuity, will vary, of course, with the price of the stock on the market, but the maximum will be between 68 and 69 years, that is to say, the same term as tenant purchasers under the 1903 Act.</P>
      <P>The price is approximately fifteen years' purchase.  I explained on first reading that even at the price of 3 per cent. land stock between 1909 and 1914, there would be no difficulty in borrowing between £1,500 and £1,600 on terms which would leave the tenant's interest and sinking fund £65.  Now, with interest at 4½ per cent., £65 will only provide interest and sinking fund for £1,368, and we are forced, therefore, if we are to achieve our double purpose of being just to the landlords and generous to the tenants, to add 10 per cent. as a State contribution, making the price within a few decimal points of £1,505.  I hope we are not going to be involved in a futile argument as to whether this 10 per cent. is a bonus or a contribution to the price.  It does not matter what we call it.  Everyone to his taste.  The important thing is to realise exactly what it means, what purpose it achieves, and if we are clear about that, then we need not waste time in arguing about its name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is £1,505 a fair price in all the circumstances? I will content myself with indicating the considerations which the Government had in mind when fixing it. We were acquiring property compulsorily for the first time in the history of the Free State, and whatever the principles, <Col N="1940" /> or if anyone prefers the word, the expediencies, of the case may be, I take it we can all agree that the issues raised are manifold, and are entitled to something more than casual decisions.  First, the transaction cannot be looked at as an ordinary case of bargain and sale where the price is fixed entirely by reference to market value. Market value is a variable quantity.  It fluctuates according to the point of view of the vendor, and according to the point of view of the purchaser.  It may have been one thing last year; another thing this year, and it may be something quite different next year.  What I will call the value of the property as a security is much more stable. Fee-simple property is, and always has been, a recognised security, and in fact, Irish rents are quite a common security both in Ireland and England. We are dealing, therefore, not only with the vendor, but with the people who receive his head rents, with his mortgagees and his encumbrancers.  These include different people and different institutions; middle-class people who wanted a reliable 5 or 6 per cent. for their money, stock-brokers, charitable institutions, banks, insurance companies, and so on. When they are lending their money as an investment, they take care to make allowances for fluctuations in the market value.  Irish lands, in view of the fact that rents have been regulated by law since 1881, are, as a business matter, a recognised investment, and in view of the fact that they have escaped the general inflation during the war, are mortgageable, that is to say, are worth, from the point of view of a banking institution, a high percentage of their current value.  We realise that we cannot afford&mdash;to put it for the moment on no higher grounds&mdash;to fix a price on these lands which would adversely affect their value as a security.  In other words, we cannot afford to give notice to people here or elsewhere who have money to invest that Ireland is no place in which to invest it.  That is the first consideration; it is the business aspect of the question, and from that point of view, it is the primary consideration for the State.  There are others.  There is the tenant's point of view, that at present agriculture is not flourishing, and we have to put that fact against its condition in the immediate past and its prospects in the immediate future; and there is the landlord's point <Col N="1941" /> of view, that a large number of the estates with which we are left to deal are mortgaged to individuals, to banks, and to other institutions, and encumbered with family charges and head rents up to their full security value.  We have endeavoured to fix the price in the light of all these considerations of financial credit, and in addition to keep in mind the necessity for fair dealing.  We realise that when applied to the heavily encumbered estates, it will entail hardships, and we have tried to provide for this and for the fact that the purchase money is being paid, not in cash, but in bonds, by arranging that the redemption price of mortgages, encumbrances and head rents shall also be paid in bonds.</P>
    <P>With regard to tenancies on which judicial rents have been fixed after 1911, the annuity and price are, when the extra reduction which these tenants received has been taken into account, slightly more favourable to the tenant.  The price of non-judicial holdings on which the rents vary very widely must be fixed by the Land Commission, who will take all the circumstances into consideration.  A 10 per cent. contribution to the price will be made by the State in the case of all tenancies.  Untenanted land will be acquired by the Land Commission at a price which, in default of agreement, will be such an amount as may be fixed by the Land Commission other than the Judicial Commissioner, or by the Judicial Commissioner on appeal from the Land Commission, and in fixing such amount, regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively.  There will be no contribution to purchase money in the case of untenanted land.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need labour this question of price any further.  I claim, and I think I may say that it is admitted by the tenants themselves, that the terms provided have, so far as it is possible to do so, succeeded in reconciling the conflicting questions of price and annuity within the equities of the case.</P>
    <P>I have explained the terms with regard to arrears on first reading.  The arrears now due are not in the same case as the arrears, say, in 1881, which were dealt with by the 1881 Act.  The strike against rents which took place during the last two or three years was only indirectly a strike for a reduction in rents.  It was primarily a strike against the relationship <Col N="1942" /> of landlord and tenant, a protest by the existing tenants against the fact of their not having purchased.  This differentiates the problem from all previous problems of the same nature.  So far as it was a protest against the fact of non-purchase we have met the case; we are introducing this Land Purchase Bill.  We are now faced with the problem of making an arrangement which will obviate, as far as possible, the hardships that must ensue as a result of the necessity which the tenants are under of paying rents which accrued due over a period of two or three years, within a much shorter period.  There are 70,000 tenancies, with a rental of about £800,000, that is to say, an average rent of about £12 per annum.  We all realise that the payment of £12 per annum over a period of two years is a different proposition from a payment of £24 down.  That is the difficulty from the tenant's point of view.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the landlord is under the necessity of paying his head rents and interest charges in respect of those years during which arrears of rent have accumulated.  Further, he must pay them in full without any abatement. This will be his position until he receives his purchase money and is in a position to redeem his charges.  The owner of a heavily encumbered estate will not be able to pay his full rent and interest charges out of the income from his purchase money.  The purchase money is £1,505.  The income is £67.72.  This £67.72 is the interest at 4½ per cent. on the purchase money.  On the other hand, the interest on his charges may be, and probably is, at the rate of 5 per cent or 6 per cent.  He can overcome this difficulty, that is, the difficulty due to the fact that whereas he is only receiving an income of £4 10s. 0d. on every £100 of his purchase money, he may be under the necessity of paying out £5 or £6 for every £100 of his purchase money which represents the redemption price of a mortgage or charge by redeeming his rents and other charges in bonds at once, but he cannot do this until he receives his purchase money, and hence we cannot in equity allow the same abatement in regard to arrears and payment in lieu of rent, that is to say, in regard to the period during which the landlord must pay his full charges without any abatement, as we have allowed in respect of annuity. We have taken these facts into consideration, <Col N="1943" /> and in addition the fact that before the landlord receives his compounded arrears or payment in lieu of rent, costs of collection must be deducted, and in the light of these facts we have fixed the reduction in regard to arrears and payment in lieu of rent at 25 per cent.  All arrears up to the first gale day in 1920 and all hanging gales are written off.  The arrears collectable are the arrears due from the first gale day, in 1920, to the first gale day in the present year, 1923.  One year's arrears, less 25 per cent., is to be paid on the passing of the Act, and the balance &mdash;where there is a balance, is to be paid in cash in accordance with regulations to be made by the Land Commission, who will take all the circumstances into account.</P>
    <P>I referred shortly to the scope of the Bill on first reading.  It is defined in Section 21.  The relevant portion reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, and notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, all tenanted land wherever situated, and all untenanted land situated in any congested districts county, and such untenanted land situated elsewhere as the Land Commission shall, before the appointed day, declare to be required for the purpose of relieving congestion, or of facilitating the resale of tenanted land, shall by virtue of this Act, vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section 2 of the same Section provides that the foregoing Section shall not apply to land which has been purchased previously under the Land Purchase Acts, land which is not substantially agricultural or pastoral, demesne land, home farms building sites, or land held by the State.</P>
    <P>Then sub-section 3 provides that, where it is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, the foregoing lands excluded by sub-section 1, except land held by the State, may be acquired compulsorily by the Land Commission.  That, I think, for all practical purposes, justifies my statement on first reading, that for the relief of congestion, the Land Commission has power to acquire any land of any kind anywhere.</P>
    <P>Section 28 specifies the persons to whom advances may be made by the Land Commission for the purchase of parcels of <Col N="1944" /> land.  They are: congests, tenants who enter into an agreement to exchange their holdings, evicted tenants who have been evicted within a period of twenty-five years before the passing of the Land Act of 1903, labourers who have been deprived of their employment by reason of the sale of any lands, and any other suitable persons.  Congests have the first claim, and any land available after congests have been dealt with may be sold to these persons.  It is specifically provided by sub-section (2) of Section 28 that when choosing landless men to whom advances are to be made, the Land Commission shall be satisfied as to their competence to work the land, their intention to do so and not to sell, let or assign it.</P>
    <P>The problem of congestion is a huge one and it bristles with difficulties.  There are congests on practically every estate, and wherever there are congests the Land Commission will acquire the estates, deal with the congests and resell the balance to landless men.  Outside the congested districts, which are roughly the Province of Connaught, the Counties of Donegal and Kerry and parts of the Counties of Clare and Cork, though untenanted land will be bought, in the first instance for congests, nevertheless the major portion will be available for landless men.  In the congested districts, however, the case is different.  There are thousands of wretched holdings huddled together along or near the sea coasts, all under £10 valuation and with very little untenanted land of any kind in the neighbourhood to provide for them.  As far as possible these tenants must be migrated, and as far as possible the bigger tenants must be migrated.  Bigger tenants, as a rule better educated, are more suitable for migration.  But after everything has been done there will be a residue, and I am afraid a big residue of congests undealt with.  I do not want to dilate too much on the difficulties; most people understand the difficulties of getting tenants to migrate, difficulties which arise from the point of view of the tenants themselves and from the point of view of the tenants and landless men on the estates to which they are going.  We can only do our best, and I claim that we have done our best when we provide that any land of any kind may be taken for the relief of congestion.  We have not preserved the old definition of a congested <Col N="1945" /> tenant.  The Congested Districts Board had a hard and fast rule that no tenant of a holding of £10 Valuation or over could be regarded as a congest.  We have not drawn any definite line.  There are tenants whose holdings are over £10 valuation and who are nevertheless congests. It is only right that the Land Commission, where possible, should be able to deal with them as such.  Owing to the special conditions in the congested districts, Section 21, which I have quoted already, specifies that all untenanted land in the congested districts shall be taken up not only compulsorily but in fact automatically; and it should be remembered that land will be required outside the congested districts not only for the purposes already specified, but for migrating tenants from the congested districts.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the limitation on advances and provides that the Land Commission may advance up to £3,000 to any tenant for the purchase of his holding, and further gives the Land Commission a discretion to advance more in any case where, in the opinion of the Land Commission, who will take all the circumstances of the case into account, it is expedient to advance more.  This limitation will mean that the Land Commission will retain on hands considerable areas of large tenancies and these will be used for the same purposes as untenanted land.  Where they are not required for the relief of congestion they will be sold to landless men.</P>
    <P>Section 33 empowers the Land Commission to acquire compulsorily any bog, even bog which has been sold under some of the previous Acts to tenant purchasers. Under the previous Acts in certain cases all available bog has been sold to tenants, with the result that these tenants have more than enough, while there is no turbary available for future tenant purchasers. This Section enables us to deal with that difficulty, I hope, equitably.</P>
    <P>Section 36 gives ample power to the Land Commission to make regulations with respect to turbary on any bog and to make such regulations as may be necessary for conferring or defining rights of access to or through the bog.</P>
    <P>Sporting rights and fishing rights are dealt with in Section 38.  They vest in the Land Commission.  This need not frighten anybody.  In practice there are no sporting rights of any monetary value <Col N="1946" /> on tenanted land.  There are, however very valuable sporting rights on untenanted land, such as large areas of bog and mountain.  These can be developed and can be made to yield an income that will be by no means negligible.  There are extremely valuable fishing rights out of which a very large number of fishermen make their living, especially on the bigger rivers, and there is no reason why they should be vested in the tenant who happens to own the adjoining land.  If anybody has a first claim to them it is the fishermen who have been making their living out of them up to date.  The Land Commission will acquire these rights and let them at reasonable prices. These are the main provisions of the Land Purchase section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured to make what I will call the machinery of the Bill as simple as possible.  As from the date of the passing of the Act the relationship of landlord and tenant shall no longer exist.  The State will take over the management of the estates as a going concern, will collect the compounded arrears of rent up to the first gale day of this year and will collect payment in lieu of rent from the first gale day of this year until the appointed day.  The appointed day, as I have said before, will vary for different counties and perhaps for different sections of counties, and on the appointed day the landlords' interest in the holdings of the tenants for whom the day has been appointed shall vest in the Land Commission.  Before that appointed day can be named it will be necessary to find out accurately the name of the tenant, the area of his holding, the amount of his rent, whether he is a present or future tenant, and if judicial, whether he is a first, second or third term tenant, and other particulars of that sort.  When these facts are ascertained the appointed day is named, the holdings vest in the Land Commission and the tenant begins to pay a sum which is equivalent to his annuity, that is to say, a sum which, in the case we have been considering, is a 35 per cent. reduction on his existing rent.  When the estate is completely re-arranged and all titles in connection with it made to the satisfaction of the Land Commission, the holdings on the estate which up to then are vested in the Land Commission will be vested in the purchasers and the bonds for the purchase <Col N="1947" /> money allocated to the vendor and to his encumbrancers.  Sub-section 2 of Section 25 deals with this matter and provides as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be payable by the tenant to the Land Commission an annual sum equivalent to the standard purchase annuity for the holding, from the appointed day until the gale day next after the holding is vested in the tenant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section 4 of the same Section specifies that all payments made by the tenant after the appointed day on foot of the annual sum payable by him to the Land Commission shall, from and after the vesting of the holding in him, be treated for all purposes as if they had been payments in respect of purchase annuity.  It will be noted that in effect the tenant begins to redeem his purchase money as from the appointed day, though as a matter of book-keeping the payments will not be appropriated to this purpose until after the holding is vested in him. The reason for this distinction is as follows:&mdash;Certain holdings will be retained, say, for the relief of congestion, and certain holdings will not be sold in their entirety to the owners, and it is necessary to make it quite clear that though the tenant is paying a sum which is equivalent to his purchase annuity as from the appointed day, nevertheless his payments will not be appropriated to the payment of the sinking fund until the Land Commission is in a position to say whether they are going to vest the holding in him or resume it or part of it for other purposes. It is necessary to make it quite clear that the occupier is not the owner until the Land Commission is in a position to say whether they require the whole or any part of the holding.  In 75 per cent. of cases tenants will be left in occupation of their old holdings, or will get additions to their old holdings, but it will take some time before the Land Commission can say who are the particular tenants who will come within the other 25 per cent. category.  It would be going back to the old slow procedure to hold up the appointed day and to defer the commencement of payment of sinking fund in redemption of the purchase money until that is decided, that is to say, until the estates are re-arranged.  The difficulty is got over by the provisions in the Act <Col N="1948" /> which provide that a sum equivalent to the annuity shall be paid as from the appointed day by all tenants, and that this payment shall not be appropriated towards annuity until the holding is vested in the tenant.  This arrangement gets over definitely the grievance which tenants had under the old Acts by reason of the fact that they were paying interest in lieu of rent, none of which went in redemption of the price, for six or seven or ten years before the holding was vested in them.  Every payment made under this Act after the appointed day will count as contribution towards redemption of the advance, and this alone makes the procedure just about five or six times more expeditious than the procedure under the 1903 and 1909 Acts.  I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Whilst I thoroughly agree that the Minister for Agriculture has made a fair effort to bring in a Bill to settle the land question in this country, I believe there are many shortcomings in the present measure, and that it will require drastic amendment in the Committee Stage.  There are only two points which I would desire to impress upon the Minister.  The other points will be dealt with by other members of the Party.  My first point is as regards the price.  The price is not so liberal at all in the Bill, I think, as the Minister would have us believe.  The conditions, as you are all aware, of the agricultural industry in the past three years have not been at all favourable to those engaged in that occupation.  In fact, for the past two or three years people engaged in the industry have suffered a dead loss. Therefore I think the prices quoted by the Minister and the comparisons made with former Bills are not applicable to the present conditions at all.  We are all aware that the cost of producing crops for the last year or two was far in excess of the receipts obtained from those crops.  For that reason I say that the people engaged in agriculture at the present time are far worse off than they were at the time alluded to by the Minister when other Bills were brought forward.  Therefore they are entitled to much more liberal terms under this Bill than were the people concerned under the previous Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> The reduction to tenants whose rents were fixed before 1911 is 35 per cent., and to those whose rents were fixed from 1911 to 1914 30 per cent.  We, and those others engaged in agriculture, believe that the terms should have been at least 40 per cent.  We cannot see any real difference between the 1911 fixtures and the 1914 fixtures.  We think that both should share in the same reduction under the Bill.  It is not permissible at the present stage to move amendments, and I am just making a statement.  What I have indicated should be, I think, the minimum offer to the tenants.</P>
    <P>The next question I desire to touch on is the question of arrears.  The landlords at present do not seem to recognise at all the section in the Bill dealing with arrears.  They are out at the present moment with writs and processes to recover the full amount of their arrears, whereas a section in the Bill definitely provides for a reduction in respect of those arrears.  The landlords are out for their pound of flesh in the interval before the Bill becomes law, and I am sorry to say they are assisted by the forces of the Government in the collection of those arrears.</P>

      <P>The soldiers are supplied to the Sheriff to collect those arrears under duress.  While the Bill provides for a reduction in respect of those arrears, the landlord is taking advantage of the interval to seize and secure every pound of flesh that he possibly can.  I ask the Minister and I ask the Government to give an undertaking now that the issue of writs and processes for the recovery of those arrears will be stopped.  It was mainly because of that clause in the Bill dealing with arrears that the measure was acceptable to the general body of the tenants in the country.  They were getting a reduction on rents that they could not possibly pay, considering the state of agriculture during the last three years, and now the Government is assisting in the collection of those rents throughout the country.  This does not <Col N="1950" /> apply solely to one county or to two or three counties, but it applies to many counties.  The State is giving assistance by lending the military to the Sheriff to collect those rents under duress.  This must be stopped and, without an undertaking from the Government that the thing will be stopped and stopped immediately, I say that we must take very drastic measures with our people to see if the Bill will be accepted at all.  This matter is very important&mdash;so important that even if it needs a short Bill in order to remedy it, such a Bill must be introduced by the Ministry.  Otherwise I cannot say that the tenants will accept the Bill in its present form.  It is a shame and a disgrace to say that while things are sub judice those people are allowed to harass and persecute the tenantry to procure the payment of rents which the Government admit by this clause in their Bill are not payable. Other clauses of the Bill will be dealt with by other members of the Party and amendments will be introduced later. But the Government must give an undertaking&mdash;and that shortly&mdash;to put a stop to the execution of writs and processes and the collection of rents under duress at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, with his usual clarity of diction, has explained to the Dáil that this particular Bill is the best of its kind which has ever been introduced, and that it is even 10 per cent. better than the Wyndham Act of 1903.  It provides that the tenants pay 13.68 years' purchase of their holdings. Their annual contribution at 4¾ per cent. amounts to 65 per cent. of their rental.  I want to explain what 65 per cent. of their rental would bring in under the Act of 1903.  20 years' purchase at 3¼ per cent. amounts to £65.  Therefore 13.68 years purchase at 4¾ per cent. is tantamount to 20 years' purchase to the tenants of the country, who do not understand high finance.  It represents 20 years' purchase as the tenant understands it, so that we need not go into ecstacies over the Bill at all.  This Bill provides that for a term of years extending over two and a half generations the tenant has to pay 4¾ per cent.  I do not think it is a proper view of the finances of the country which represents that the rate of interest for 68 years from now will remain at 4¾ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that it is probable that in 10 or 20 years the rate of interest will be 3 per cent.  Therefore I would like to see a clause in the Bill making it competent for the Minister for Finance of the day to reduce the interest to the tenant and enable him to get a benefit which is now refused him on account of the finances of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you, £4 15s. to-day, if it were reduced to £3 15s. in twenty years, would mean that a particular tenant would get a reduction of 20 per cent. in his rent. When men are asked to make engagements which will bind themselves and their families for two generations, an opportunity ought to be given by which, when the finances of a country are again right, these men would get the benefit. There is a point made about arrears, and also about these compulsory clauses.  In a Free State that sounds wrong.  The citizens of the Free State are to be compulsorily disturbed in their property. Now, there is no such thing as compulsion in this Bill.  The compulsory clause was based on an agreement made in 1920. It was an agreement between the landlords and the tenants, and the very wording of this particular clause was put into a Bill which never became law.  The landlords agreed, and this is not compulsion, because it is merely carrying out an agreement.  Therefore, the question of compulsion does not apply and the question of acquiring land compulsorily does not arise.  The question of compensation, I admit, does arise.  A citizen of the Free State, be he a landlord, tenant, or anyone else, cannot be deprived of his rights without due compensation.  I think this Bill is over-beneficial to the landlords in the matter of compensation. There is camouflage in the Bill.  Fifteen years is put down in print.  It is not fifteen years' purchase at all.  There is a percentage for costs, and that means 15.3 years' purchase.  Then there is payment for sporting and fishing rights; and really one does not know what the landlord does not get in the end.  When you multiply that by 4½, you will observe that the landlords are coming out fairly well. In those cases the landlords would be getting 67½ per cent. of their incomes now for a problematical 100 per cent. in the future.  I believe that the landlords are generously dealt with, and if anything <Col N="1952" /> could be done to lighten the load on the tenants it would be very desirable.  Who is to get the sporting rights?  What will the Land Commission do with them?  Do you mean to tell me that if anyone comes from the Land Commission with licence to shoot over my farm, I will let him?  I will not.  If the tenant buys his land, he has as much right to the sporting rights as the State.  There is such a thing as commonage in mountain rights. If you live at the foot of the Wicklow mountains you will find a man with a little bit of arable land, and he has the right of running so much collop&mdash;that is, eight sheep&mdash;on the mountain.  There is no provision made in the Bill for that. Is he to be deprived of this collop?  That is not defined in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will define it in black and white, and so allay the feelings of the men outside. I also want to know why it was that fee-farm grants and leaseholders are debarred from the operation of the Bill. No good case has been made in that respect. Could we also have information as to what becomes of the total amount of tithes payable by the tenants?  Are they to be called superior interests?  I understand that the tithe charges payable by the landlord will be classified as superior interests.  What becomes of the tithe rent charge payable by the tenant? No provision was made for that.  Then there is the question of the omnipotent power which is to be given to what in future they will call the Land Commission&mdash;the power to take lands anywhere and at any time.  I want to know what rules and regulations are there, and how the powers of the Land Commission are to be defined.  It is essential in the interests of the country that the powers of the Land Commission in this respect should be defined.  It may be that the land of a working farmer would be required for the purpose of what would then be described as the common weal. We are not satisfied on this point, and we would like the powers of the Land Commission to be definitely set out and embodied in the Bill, in order that we may have some security, and that we may know we are not going to be interfered with in our holdings.  I am not condemning the Bill.  I believe it is an honest effort to bridge over a difficulty.  I believe that the Minister has done his best to try and better the lot of 350,000 of <Col N="1953" /> our citizens&mdash;70,000 tenancies of 5 each. On these tenants of a Free State the Minister is going to put a load for two generations.  He, in his efforts to lighten that load, seems to be over-anxious to give the minority the advantage.  I believe his efforts were the best he could put forward; at the same time, if I had the management of that it would be different. At the one end you have 350,000 people of your own class; at the other you have a minority of citizens whose interests the State must also protect, but I believe that the balance was made too great on one side, and <i>fiat justitia ruat colum</i> was forgotten.  The Minister has at the same time, made an honest attempt to deal with the situation.  If the landlords are prepared to take what they are entitled to, then the Bill will go on, but if not&mdash;nothing.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on the reception which his measure has received.  I took the trouble of reading the landlords' organ immediately after the Bill was in troduced and after the text of the Bill was published, and I saw that, though they stated the Bill meant the confiscation of the landlords' property, yet they had to admit it was a bold and honest attempt on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture.  In fact, their criticism, though couched in severe language, was after all only an attempt to conceal their satisfaction and delight at having obtained so much where they really feared they would not come out so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The splendid oratorical effort of Deputy Wilson did not at all come down to the same thing.  He said it was a bold and honest attempt, and that the Minister had done his best as between the claims on both sides.  The only point he made was based on the fact that money cannot be obtained on as good terms to-day as could be obtained in 1903.  The Minister for Agriculture cannot be blamed for that.  Deputy Wilson knows well, in the course of his purchases and sales, what changes have taken place between 1903 and to-day.  Deputy Doyle pointed out the difficulties that have arisen in regard to prices and the cost of production.  If Deputy Wilson compares his notes with Deputy Doyle, he will come to the same conclusion, that the Minister has made a very good attempt and has struck a happy medium as between the contending interests. <Col N="1954" /> One point Deputy Doyle made and Deputy Wilson corroborated was with reference to the action of the landlords at present.  I never had any good opinion of Irish landlordism.</P>

      <P>Landlordism is now in its final stage, and it seems it is going to die with a sting in it to the last.  Landlords are taking advantage of an Act the provisions of which were never intended to help them as it is helping them now, but the Minister for Agriculture cannot be blamed for that.  I think the Deputies on the whole, when examining the two speeches criticising this measure, will arrive at the final conclusion from both that the Minister has done his best, and that the Irish landlords of to-day are doing what they always did&mdash;their worst. As a representative of an area in the congested districts, I am far more interested in the provisions of the Bill dealing with congests.  First, I might express my satisfaction with the clause that deals with turbary.  Turbary, as everyone knows in the congested districts, is a very valuable right.  The ownership of a bog, the ownership of the only source of fuel in the district, is a very valuable right.  The Government in this Bill has put into practice a principle that even if the most revolutionary member of the Labour Party was Minister for Agriculture he could not do more. Some men own bogs in the West of Ireland who have a monopoly of bogs, and have a little gold mine in them.  They are selling out those bogs at a high price to men in desperate straits for fuel. This Bill proposes to take possession of those bogs and sell them out to people who are in need of fuel.  I was delighted to see that clause in the Bill.  Now, as to the question of congestion, what this Bill does is to break down the fence that divides the people of congested districts from the ranches.  These good lands in Connacht&mdash;and there are good lands in it&mdash;off which the people were driven are now to be made available for them. This Dáil has, on more than one occasion, approved of the principle of dividing up those ranches amongst the congests, amongst those people who were living, as the Minister for Agriculture describes, on very small holdings.  The Congested Districts Board tackled this <Col N="1955" /> question 30 years ago, but, as Sir Henry Doran himself said, they have been only playing with it all that time.  They knew very well the proper remedy for congestion, but they had not the powers to apply that remedy.  They could not get possession.  Now, this Bill gives them possession of the land.  There is also a great difficulty that the Congested Districts Board were faced with, and that is, how to deal with the congests. You take a man out of his area where he has 3 or 4 acres of land, and where up to this he has been living the poorest life of any peasant in Europe, that is, that his standard of living is at the very lowest.  If you were told what his meals were and what his family lives on, this Dáil would hardly believe it.  If you take a man who is living on a farm like that, and trying to eke out an existence on it, and bring him away to a big ranch and say, &ldquo;Here is 15 or 20 acres of that land for you,&rdquo; you will have the difficulty about his house and outoffices and fencing.  These will cost five or six hundred pounds.  The interest on that amount, at probably 5 per cent., would be £25 or £30.  Is that to be put on top of what is considered to be a fair rent? If that is done, it is impossible.  He cannot face the burden.  You cannot go ahead with your remedy.  You will come to a full stop.  The Government must face that question.  Congestion is an evil in the National body.  These people have only been able to make out a living so far by sending their children to England to reap the harvest and going there themselves; a most humiliating and disgraceful situation it is to see thousands of these men crossing over to England and Scotland and living in stables and barns and coming back with their savings. Worse still it is to see the girls going over. Then there is the American letter which brings home the cheque which pays the rent and helps to keep them going.  That state of things cannot be kept going continuously, and I am glad the Government are taking the first step to-day, and I hope they will take the final step to remedy congestion.  The Congested Districts Board set up a great many&mdash;fifty to fifty-three thousand&mdash;holdings, and of these holdings not a single tenant failed in a single case to meet his engagement. If ten or five per cent. of them failed, it <Col N="1956" /> would not be a reflection upon the general body.  I have a letter from the Congested Districts Board saying that in not a single case did these people fail to meet their engagements.  These people are deserving of every support.  They have gone to every extreme of effort to make a living.  Canada is faced with a problem. Canada has land, but has not the men. Australia has land, but has not the men. We have the land and we have the men. The Minister for Home Affairs said we have a depopulated country.  But you have people cultivating land that would not repay cultivation at any rent.  If you go to the barony of Erris you would have to take two hundred acres to get a holding with a valuation of £10.  If the Government means to go ahead in earnest against congestion, I would urge them that they must be more generous in setting up the congests than the Congested Districts Board were.  If they come to this Dáil for any further powers in that matter this Dáil will readily give them those powers.</P>

      <P>I must condemn the present Government for the drastic action they have taken in regard to the arrears of rent of many unpurchased tenants.  There are three farmers in my locality, and their cattle and horses have been seized by the bailiffs, assisted by the National troops, and I submit it is a very bad action by our Government. These farmers whose cattle and horses have been seized were the men on whose lands the Clonbanin ambush took place, and where Colonel-Commandant Cummings lost his life.  These people gave us assistance when we were out on the hills fighting against an alien Government.  I think it is a very bad action for the Government to seize cattle on these farms for arrears of rent due to English landlords.  I do not know what sympathy this Government has with these landlords.  It seems to me they have some sympathy with them.  I know several tenants who asked the landlords to sell some time ago, and they refused to sell because they had the English law and Government at their backs. Now, I know some farmers in North Cork who gave assistance to the Free State troops in every way.  The Irregulars found it out, and gave them final notice to quit the country, and they had to be <Col N="1957" /> deported to Glasgow.  What protection did the Free State Army give them for the help they rendered?  Now, when normal times have come, cattle can be seized from the farmers.  I do not think that that is just or fair.  I would ask the Government, therefore, to stay all executions for decrees for rent and also to stay civil bills.  I hope they will give a straight answer to that matter.</P>

      <P>One does not want to be cruel, but the temptation is very great to remind Deputies of the Farmers' Party of their conduct.  Despite very earnest and very direct warnings that what they are now complaining of would certainly not have happened if they did not support the Government on the Enforcement of Law Bill, they did it with their eyes open.  Everything that has now happened was foreshadowed from these benches.  Deliberately and with knowledge they supported the Government in passing that measure.  The Minister and Deputy Sears on one side, and the Farmers' Party on the other side, have discussed the finances of the Bill and have discussed the details, one side suggesting that there is fairness here and generosity there, and the other side saying generosity is over-stated and that there is no such thing as fairness.  It seems to me that, inasmuch as this is the first Land Bill that has been discussed in an Irish Parliament for a very long time, we ought to consider something more fundamental than the mere detail of the business transaction that the Minister spoke of.  I think we have to go back before agreeing to the passing of this Bill.  By the way, I would like before the vote is taken that some ruling should be given from the Chair as to whether it would be competent to receive an amendment from a Deputy, not a Minister, such as that foreshadowed by Deputy Doyle, which would mean raising the charge upon the State.  I question whether it is competent for any amendment to come from anyone but the Executive Council raising a charge upon the State, and, inasmuch as there is a ten per cent. mentioned in the Bill, any alteration in the incidence of the charges which would not mean a reduction in the amount to be paid to the landlords would mean an increased charge on the State.</P>

      <P>The question seems to me to arise at once, as to whether we are to consider the relations between the landlord and tenant in this matter as a right relation, whether, in fact, we are to consider the landlord's claim as a just claim, and whether in the allocating of a price we are to consider his position as one which he has occupied in equity and justice.  It is true that for fifty or sixty years there has been an understanding that landlords should be bought out, and Land Purchase Bills have been passed and made use of, but they were passed not by an Irish Parliament. It was the best that could be done, and I am not going to subscribe to the proposition that because terms were made and accepted by the tenants in Ireland giving the landlords certain property rights in their land, certain rights to charge rentals for the use of land therefore we have to accept that as a right, and must consider it as personal property, or, leaving out the legal meaning of that phrase, as property to which the landlord has an equitable claim.  The whole basis of the agitation that led to the Land Acts and Land Purchase Acts was that the landlords had no rights to the land, that they had stolen those lands, and their only right was the right of conquest.  I was interested enough in the Minister's speech on the First Reading to read a book which is very interesting, &ldquo;The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland,&rdquo; and I take this extract from the Land League's judgment of the 1881 Land Purchase Bill before it became law. &ldquo;It is impossible to place the relations between landlord and tenant on any sound economic basis in Ireland.  With us landlordism means confiscation.  The people of Ireland will never acknowledge any Statute of Limitations in a matter of injustice.  Their basis is their inalienable right to the land of their country.  They consider the longer the injustice is continued the greater is the wrong inflicted, and if they seem to accept the principle of land law compensation they do so not as an admission of the landlord's right, but because they are willing to accept a peaceful solution of the question.  They are prepared to make concessions to-day; to-morrow they may insist on rigid justice.&rdquo; That was in 1881.  Is to-day the to-morrow of the Land League manifesto?

      <P>Then, if we are to insist on rigid justice, we ought to insist on having presented the two titles to the land which is to be sold, and if the title is not quite good and not acceptable to the people of this country, then all the damage done must be charged against the State in so far as the State can bear it. There will be very little coming to the landlord if justice is to be done, but the tenants in the main have accepted the principle that they are prepared to pay annual sums for a limited number of years with the object of obtaining possession of that land free of rent after that period has expired.</P>

      <P>Surely conditions have to be taken into account as the years pass, and if in the case of landlords who had an opportunity and refused to avail of it&mdash;if in that case they come now and ask to be put in as good a position as their predecessors or as their neighbours, we have a right to examine the position quite afresh, and consider it <i>de novo</i> at least in Dáil Eireann.  I believe that it is our duty in the Dáil, representing the people, to lay down, in considering the terms on which land is to be transferred, that the first charge upon the land and the produce of the land must be a reasonable livelihood for the people who are working that land.  I read an authority, an Estate Commissioner, in his definition of an economic holding.  &ldquo;It is to be a holding of sufficient productive capacity to support a family at a reasonable standard of comfort out of the produce, and after the family have been supported at a reasonable standard of comfort, then to pay the rent.&rdquo;  So, even on that definition of an economic holding we have got to assume that the holding is capable, first of all, of maintaining the family at a reasonable standard of comfort; and in present conditions, when agricultural produce is produced for the market to sell, the economic conditions of that holding are variable.  It may be economic this year, and not economic next year, and I make the assertion that, despite agreements that may be come to between the legal owner and tenant, despite agreements when we are dealing with land, bearing in mind, as the Minister <Col N="1960" /> for Home Affairs has told us so frequently these last few days, that there is a difference between land and manufactured property; despite agreements, men working on a holding or on a farm, farmer and labourer, have a right as first charge upon the produce to a reasonable standard of life.  But what the Bill proposes to do is to say that the first charge upon the holding shall be an annuity for sixty-eight years, and at the end of that time even the purchase price, with the freedom to reinvest, shall become a perpetual charge upon the annuity in the form of interest upon capital investment. It may be very good for farmers who agree upon this method of the transfer of land, and I suppose one may say they are satisfied, the landlord is satisfied, and that the other citizens need not worry; but at least the other citizens have a right to worry when we come to the question of 10 per cent. plus some other cost. We have a right then to intervene and to say that there is no reasonable claim in present circumstances, and I do not think there is any reasonable claim in any circumstances for the landlords to demand of the State something over and above what the farmer is presumed to be willing to pay.  I think the treatment of the landlords in this matter is overgenerous. I think better justice would have been done to the State at any rate, and to the farmers also, if it had been said that in consideration of past practices we are prepared to allow you a sum something less than you have been getting as a rental over a limited number of years, a terminable annuity, so that those who have been dependent upon rentals would not be immediately deprived of a livelihood, and would have ample time to make provision for other means of livelihood.  It seems to me that would have been a just way to have dealt with this problem. It would have been more fair to the farmer and the tenant, more just to the community, and no hardship would have been inflicted on the landlord. The thing that is being purchased, what is it?  It is the annual value of the land as fixed by the Land Courts, taking no account of the tenants' improvements. That is supposed to be the intention. I wonder do farmers generally agree that that is the practice in fixing judicial rents.  Do farmers agree that <Col N="1961" /> improvements, past or present, are not taken into account?  A gentleman not unknown to fame in the Dáil is credited with responsibility for a Clause in the Act of 1881 which stated &ldquo;No rent shall be allowed or made payable in respect of improvements made by the tenant or his predecessor.&rdquo;  Is it generally agreed that that has been faithfully observed in the fixing of judicial rents?  Has it been accepted all through the country that the Healy Clause in that Act has been faithfully carried through by the Commissioners?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not, for the price that has to be paid for the land is being based upon a price which was not fairly fixed according to the Act, which provided that the improvements which the tenants and their predecessors had made should be taken into account. For all these years since the judicial rents were fixed the landlords have had the benefit of that maladministration of the law, and henceforward, in this Bill, they are still to retain the benefits of that maladministration and wrong interpretation of the law.  Is it just that this should be continued?  Is it right that the Dáil should be so generous to the landlords, whose friends helped them out in these past years?  It is very laudable for Ministers to desire to satisfy what is called the sense of justice of those whose ideas of justice have been trained in a different school.  Justice to the landlord and justice to the landlord's supporters mean considering that they had rights, equitable rights, as well as legal rights in their estates.  Real justice demands that the people who made the land valuable are the only people who have rights in equity in that land.  The equity would be met by providing a landowner with an annual sum for a very limited number of years, not exceeding 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that too much is being given to the landlords under this Bill.  The Bill does not say very much about very many things that are important.  It is vague on matters upon which we would like to have some light.  Perhaps the vagueness would be easily justified if we could be sure that the powers that would be given to the Land Commissioners would be used in the way that I think the Minister himself would desire.  It <Col N="1962" /> may surprise some Deputies here if I say that this question of land ownership is not so important to me as is alleged.  I really am not very much concerned who owns a farm of land, whether it is Earl this or Patrick that.  I desire, though, to make sure that the land, whoever the owner may be, is made proper use of, and if by this process of devolution of trust from the State to an individual the greatest use can be made of the national estate I have no fault to find, but I want to see worked out in practice that the greatest use is being made of the national estate by this method of distributive ownership.  I would like to see some condition imposed or implied in the Bill which would say to the future owners of these lands that by virtue of the assistance the State is giving, you have as a <i>quid pro quo</i> to make full use of that land, to make the best use of that land, and that not only for your own personal interests.  After all, the individual interest of the landowner is what has led to the de-population of the country in favour of cattle, and I would like to see that some provision is made in the Bill to ensure that at least a refusal to make fair use of a holding would mean its falling back into the hands of the Land Commission. I would like to see also the retention of holdings large enough to make possible experiments on a large scale in agriculture.  Hitherto, of course, there has been work done on that line by landowners.  I think it would be undesirable to eliminate by the process of this Bill the possibility of utilising any development in agricultural science which may be caused by the over subdivision of estates.  I think there might be opportunities given&mdash;I hope there are &mdash;within the limits of the Bill for large bodies to use large estates, some estates at any rate, here and there through the country for experiment and models in the hope that if they prove to be the most successful, that smaller holdings could combine and copy the methods of those large holdings.  This is looking somewhat to the future, but it is well in such a Bill as this to look to the future in regard to the possibilities of agricultural development. I hope the Minister will reassure us that within the limits of the Bill there is provision made for such possible development.</P>
    <P>I also would like to have some assurance that workmen in towns can be provided <Col N="1963" /> with grazing for their cows, and that there would also be a development of the plot-holding system.  These are some of the smaller matters that I hope have not escaped the attention of the Minister in the framing of the Bill, but there is another matter that ought to be borne in mind before we pass from the Second Reading.  When this land purchase is completed we shall have the farmer proprietor and the labourer irrevocably divided.  Now, that may be inevitable. In the course of evidence before the Agricultural Commission it was brought to our notice that quite a considerable percentage of agricultural labourers in Great Britain were able, on their system of tenure, to eventually become tenant farmers, and that there was an urge forward and an encouragement given to labourers on farms to learn agriculture because of the prospects of the future.</P>
    <P>Under the conditions that will prevail in Ireland there will be little opportunity for the landless labourer to do anything but bargain for the sale of his labour.  He will be a man trained to the soil, living on the soil, and naturally inclined to the soil, but precluded from ever thinking of having a holding of his own.  That at least ought to encourage the Minister to think on the lines I hinted at a moment or two ago, that there should be reserved from sale to tenants at least a number of large holdings to which capable labourers could be attracted, where they would have some responsibility&mdash;not the ownership perhaps, but some responsibility in the working of a farm.  I suggest that it would be worth while bearing that in mind in dealing with the land that is to be vested in the Commission.  I do not know whether the Minister has high hopes that his scheme of migration will be successful.  He has appealed to the Dáil and to public men to use their influence to make it easy rather than difficult for migrants to be settled upon new lands.  I hope that appeal will be responded to, and that it will be made easy. I hope that this terrible problem of congestion in the West will be eased and solved by the process begun by this Bill. When we speak of the congests' problem and the corresponding evil, the grazing problem, we are again immediately driven back to the causes of those two problems.  Again we must ask ourselves <Col N="1964" /> the question, having regard to the causes of these evils, having regard to the people responsible in the first instance for these evils, and those who have, generation after generation, benefited by those evils, whether we are doing justice to the people more intimately concerned &mdash;to the tenants, to the migrants, and to the citizens generally&mdash;whether we are not doing greater injustice to them by being so generous as the Minister has claimed, or so fair, I think he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would ask the Minister, when he goes away from here to-night, to telephone to the Viceregal Lodge and ask for a copy of &ldquo;Stolen Waters,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Great Fraud on Ulster,&rdquo; and take that as an example of the kind of thing in respect of land that has been going on in Ireland.  That was done in respect of waters all over the country&mdash;long generations ago, centuries ago no doubt, but the evil has remained, and the evil results of it are still there, and people have benefited to this day from the crimes of those people Now, having benefited so long, having, through the agency of themselves and their friends, been put into a legal position, the Minister asks the Dáil to treat them generously and treat them justly according to their conception of justice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say in this we are up against the most important problem we had to face yet.  We are facing it under conditions that make it a very difficult problem to deal with.  Who are we that are here to deal with it?  We are the children of the people who had to fight the power of landlordism in the past, who have had to stand up against it, who had to put up with the hardships that it meant, and who had to consider and feel a great deal of the sufferings and penalties that it had imposed.  We are standing here with these things ringing in our ears.  Remember, we do look at them from afar.  We know them, we realise them, and, standing here, it is certain, instead of the assertions that are made from across the Channel in the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; and other peculiar organs that we are not treating these agencies fairly and that we are not disposed to treat them fairly, that we are going to confiscate from them their lawful property&mdash;is it not surprising at all to them that we here can stand and view these things dispassionately?  Is it not <Col N="1966" /> surprising to them, when we come to consider them, that we can view them in the light in which our Minister for Agriculture here has been able to view them, and in the viewing of which he has secured, so far as I can see, the sympathy and support of the people not alone in this Dáil, but throughout the whole widespread area of the country.  Is this not a lesson, and one of the greatest lessons that can be preached by any persons in any country, that would for one moment lay a charge against the people of this country that we are not capable at any time of putting aside all the considerations that would urge us on to have retaliation for the wrongs we have suffered. We are approaching this question with a sense of justice and a sense of equity and a sense of fair play.  I hope that those agencies will not continue in this way in making allegations that any unfairness is attempted to be practised on them.  We have then the allegations of our people on the other side.  We have the allegations of the sixty or seventy thousand unpurchased tenants on the other side.  This Bill attempts, at a time when it is extremely difficult, to place these tenants as far as possible upon the same basis and on an equality with the tenants who have already purchased.  I have carefully read the Bill and examined the figures, and, as far as I can see after reading them, it succeeds to within one per cent. of doing that&mdash;that is, placing them on the same basis.  Then there is the difficulty that has to be surmounted in the borrowing of money.  I think the Bill is a credit to the ability and earnestness with which this question has been approached and considered.  Deputy Johnson is talking about rents not being fair in the past, and that improvements made were not allowed for.  We have heard of what is known as the Healy Clause, and later on we heard of the case of Adams v. Duncan.  This clause was nullified because it was held that after the improvements had been in operation for twenty years, the benefit of those improvements had gone to the tenant, and consequently no residue remained. So that has nullified that clause.  With regard to unpurchased tenants and a comparison between the tenants who purchased under the Act of 1903 and the unpurchased tenants at present, I wish to <Col N="1967" /> show that from my estimate of the whole conditions of finance here I find that if the unpurchased tenant now got 36 per cent. of a reduction instead of 35, he would have got compensation for all that he alleges he has lost on account of the fact that he had not purchased under the Land Act of 1903.  That is how he stands according to the figures here, and I have studied them.  I wish here the Minister to understand another important item in connection with this Bill.  I ask him to watch carefully the position with regard to the Ulster Custom.  In all the Acts from 1870 down the Ulster Custom has been very jealously protected and preserved. Bear in mind that the landlord did not own any portion of the land.  The tenant was the owner of both the landlord's interests and his own.  The landlord had control only over an annual sum which was payable to him.  The tenant held both interests, and still holds them, and those interests must be carefully protected.</P>
    <P>I can plainly see in this Bill before us the problem that is likely to keep the forces of the Land Commission, stipulated here, in operation for, perhaps, our lifetime.  I cannot see how it is possible to do all the things that are to be done by the Land Commission in the lifetime of the average man here.  The problems are infinite.  We cannot measure them. It is impossible to estimate them.  It is easy to say the Land Commission can do this and it can do that, but look at the problems and difficulties to be faced. How is all the work going to be done? You have the question of bogs, demesne lands, uneconomic holdings, congestion, and all those other questions.  Then you have matters relating to boundaries, and it is nearly impossible to arrange an exact boundary between individual tenants. Then there will have to be dealt with such matters as common rights and duties of landlords with regard to drainage and fencing.  These are things that create all the troubles you have in the country.  They are the cause of a considerable amount of expenditure in law, and we have to consider that these will have to be definitely decided in the Act of Parliament.  There is no use in telling the Land Commission that they should do this or that.  It is our duty to lay down definitely for them the procedure <Col N="1968" /> they are to follow and the lines they are to be guided by.  If you do not, you are going to have a terrible amount of trouble and confusion.  Then there is the question of commonages.  It must be expressly and definitely laid down what a commonage means.  You must watch all those things.  They are difficult problems which will have to be faced. The Minister will have his own difficulties. This is a very big problem, and I do not suppose that this Bill will put an end to land purchase, for I can foresee a time coming when there will be another kind of purchase, a purchase from the men who have the land now, a time when the land will be used in the general interests of the community.  I can foresee that, though perhaps other Deputies cannot, and if any man can prove to me that it is possible for individual ownership to safeguard the interests of the community I will at once surrender my contention. I do not think that that is possible, because I think the individual interests and the community interests involve perpetual fight.  I think that the only property that we have in this country is the land.  I have said so much I will now give way to Mr. Gorey, who seems anxious to follow me.  I will take the liberty of telling the Minister that I intend to put down a number of amendments, and I will be insistent on pressing them.  I think that the tenants have very little grievance in this Bill, and I think this will solve their difficulties. They have grievances according to themselves, but every man at present in the world has a grievance.  I think that their principal grievance is that they think they have not sufficient authority within the nation.  We are willing to give them that authority, but they must prove the merits of their case.  The unpurchased tenant at present cannot claim anything better than the tenants who purchased in 1903.  You must stand upon common sense and equity, and if you take from one man something which another man has got you are entitled to compensate that man.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson is a great idealist, and, like other great idealists, he is inclined to lose touch with realities, and at times almost to outrage reality.  Frequently one is inclined, particularly coming on towards evening, to take the view that after all it would not <Col N="1969" /> matter very much to let these abstract doctrines be enunciated, as they are scarcely likely to be put into immediate practice and they could be safely ignored. I think, on the whole, that that line might be pushed too far, and when we hear doctrines such as Deputy Johnson used the Land Bill as a peg for enunciating, someone ought to take the trouble and responsibility of clearing the air.  &ldquo;You must go back,&rdquo; says Deputy Johnson; &ldquo;you cannot take things as they are; you must go back and inquire most searchingly how these titles arose.

What I mean by keeping their feet on the ground, is to keep some contact with the realities of the situation, and with regard to this question of the rights of landlords the actualities are that these rights have been recognised in law here as elsewhere for centuries, that there has been this dual proprietorship legally recognised, and that these rights have been sold, devised, transferred, mortgaged and dealt with as a commercial asset for centuries, that on the recognition of these rights thousands of people are dependant, that money has been lent on the security of them, and that to challenge them now <Col N="1970" /> would be to challenge something that has become part of the woof of our social system, and would have re-actions and repercussions which I am sure Deputy Johnson would be the last seriously to desire.  He read an extract from the Land League Manifesto.  Here, I think, in the privacy of our own Parliament one can say that many things were said in this country, when we had not the power to translate them into action, and said by men who, if they had power to translate them into action, would hesitate to do so. They were said because we were in a negative and destructive frame of mind, and because we were pushing at the props of Government.</P>

I think that properly accepted, properly worked, it will prove to be a great and healing measure here, and that it will cure and end what has been a sore of long standing in the body politic. One can only go ahead in that way, healing the old wounds, with an attitude of constructive idealism, doing the things that are possible, that lie to one's hands that is on the whole a safer line to take than to talk abstractions, dangerous abstractions, if taken up here and there by irresponsible, unthinking people, and attempted to be pushed to what would seem to be their conclusions.</P>

      <P>It might result in abstractions of cash.  I just want to refer in a passing way to what has been said about the Enforcement of Law Act. This Act is really in danger of becoming a glorified bugbear, and people seem to have the tendency to ignore the fact that it is a measure that has helped considerably to restore normal conditions, and to end anarchic ones here.  The Enforcement of Law Bill has been referred to in various terms of vituperation both during its passage and since, and yet I have not had placed before me a single case of genuine hardship arising out of its operation.  Deputy Vaughan referred in a passing way to cases in his neighbourhood, and the chief argument he used against people paying their rent was that on those lands an ambush took place in which a British General was killed.  That, no doubt, was a very creditable ambush to those who took part in it.  I do not see that there is a halo around the farm which makes it free of rent, and Deputy Vaughan did not say that an offer in accordance with the terms of the Land Bill had been made.  He did not say that. You can take it that that Bill was only brought in because the Ministry responsible for it had a very clear idea of the situation which necessitated it, and a very clear idea of the proportion of the problem which called for it.  It has not been used in any harsh or aggressive way in the matter of rents.  I would be interested to hear if it has been used in any single case where an offer in accordance with the provisions of the Rent Bill was made, or that the assistance of military was requisitioned for execution of a decree in such cases.</P>

      <P>I want to say again now what I said on the First Reading of this Bill, and I say it with every intention of acting upon it, and in the hope that the warning will be conveyed and accepted, that is where people go out in violence, in illegality, to seize land, then whatever influence I can bring to bear on the Minister for Agriculture, and whatever influence I can bring to bear upon the Executive Council would be directed to seeing that such people do not benefit by this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they opt for that course of violence <Col N="1972" /> then the State can only meet them upon that plane and at a rough guess I would say that the collective arm is going to prove stronger than the individual arm or arms.  They cannot have it both ways. They cannot have law and violence.  They cannot have an Act and their own plunder and, in so far as I can secure it, I will see that they do not have it.  Over the country there has been&mdash;no doubt they got the lesson and they got the lead &mdash;a tendency to go out without a shred of legal or moral claim and seize another person's property, and that has taken place a great deal more with regard to the land than with regard to other forms of property.  It simply must end, and by the time this Bill reaches its closing stages, I hope to be able to assure the Dáil that there is not in any county, over which we have for the time being responsibility and jurisdiction, one acre of land in the possession of any person but the legal owner.  That is the immediate objective; that is something that we are going out strong for at the moment and that we hope to be able to tell this Dáil before this Bill is through.  No one wants to hit anyone heavier than the exigencies of the situation demand, and no one wants to do it that way if there was another way, if there was the way of reason, if people could be taught to look to the Parliament to adjust their claims and to deal with the equities of the situation.  But if the Parliament is rejected and if the State is challenged, and if individuals take up the stand &ldquo;law or no law, State or no State, we are going in there and we are going to stay there,&rdquo; then it becomes the duty of any responsible Executive to use all its resources to end that insolent challenge&mdash;not insolent to us personally, but insolent to what and to whom?  An insolent challenge to the collective majesty of their own fellow-citizens, an insolent challenge to that authority which sent all of us here, which keeps us here and which could remove us to-morrow.</P>

      <P>At an election.  I would like to stress the point, even in their own interest, that the way of order and the way of law is the better way. Here, even while on the defensive during the last year, which has been a bad <Col N="1973" /> year, we have endeavoured to construct. We have set up an agricultural Commission for dealing with agricultural problems, and the Minister for Agriculture assures me that whoever is responsible for agricultural legislation in the next Dáil will be considerably assisted by the deliberations of that Committee.  There have been Committees and Commissions of various kinds set up and their work is on record, and even while there was a very definite and a very bitter challenge here, a more bitter challenge than was ever offered to the British administration, we have been endeavouring to deal with the problems of the country. This Bill is one evidence and one manifestation of our desire, and our power to deal with these problems, and it is not in the interests of any section to encourage or sympathise with that kind of wantonness, criminality and violence that has been going on on a fairly large scale with regard to land in quite a good many counties.  There was only one way to meet that.  There is only the one way if it continues, and people may take it very definitely that the objective of the Executive is to be able to tell this Dáil by the time this Bill is law that there is not one acre of land within our jurisdiction in the possession of any but the legal owner.</P>

      <P>Is maith liomsa mo chongnamh a thabhairt ar son an Bhille Tálmhan seo atá ós ár gcomhair, mar tá fhios agam go dtiurfaidh sé athrú saoghail agus go gcuirfidh sé feabhas mór ar go leor de na daoine a bhuil me ag labhairt ar a son san Dáil. Le bliadhanta mora fada bhi na Gaedhil bhochta ar dhroch chaoi.  Bhiodar caithe ar thaobh na sleibhte agus imeasg na bportach on am ar bhain na Gaill seilbh taltai mine, reidhe na tire diobh, agus bhi an sgeul nios measa aca ó aimsir an droch shaoighil, mar briseadh go leor aca na bliadhanta ud ar loic na fatai orra.</P>

    <P>Badh doiligh an sean-bhunadh Gaedhealach a chlaoidh, agus tar éis gach corr a cuireadh orra thosadar ag cur a ngreama sa tir arís.  Fuair go leór de thunontai na h-Eireann seilbh thar-barr amach ar a gcuid talmhan faoi na reachtanna dlighte a cuireadh ar bun san am atá caithte, ach bhi tunontai eile ann, nach raibh chomh adhamhail sin. <Col N="1974" /> Bhi na daoine seo ar an gcuid ba mheasa agus ba bhoichte den talamh agus nuair a bhi daoine eile ag feabhasu agus ag dul ar aghaidh san saoghal sé an chaoi a raibh siad-san ag dul le fanaidh.

    <P>Is iomdha corr agus casadh san saoghal acht is deagh-chosamlacht é agus ádhbhar misnigh dúinn go bhuil Gaedhil ag teacht ar a gceart arís in Eirinn.  Is ionmholta an Bille é seo ar go leór slighti.

    <P>There was a big question raised by Deputy Johnson on the debate on this Bill&mdash;the question of the right of the landlords to get any price at all for their land.  In a matter of this sort when a Government comes to consider it it cannot go back 200 or 300 years to inquire. It must try to do justice between man and man, leaning of course to the side of the weaker party, and the Government have done that in this case for the masses.  Deputy Johnson stated also that he has no fixed opinions on ownership of land, but I am sure he and every other Deputy in this Dáil are agreed that dual ownership should cease because it has proved to be a failure.</P>

      <P>I accept in full the Deputy's assurance, and I am sorry for miscontruing what he said.  Deputy Wilson also made a forcible speech.  I like to see Deputy Wilson when he is in a fighting mood, but if he turns his attention back to 40 or 50 or 60 years ago he will find that many theorists and political economists, taking Henry George as one and Fintan Lalor as another&mdash;advocated forcible views.  Although that is a long time ago now, and the world has made great progress since, I am sure as regards land many theories put forward then by these men would not be accepted in the full by Deputy Wilson in 1923.  I rise to support this <Col N="1976" /> measure, coming from the West of Ireland where people unfortunately were placed in a very bad position as regards the land.  Deputy Doyle mentioned that for the past two years there was very little money to be made out of agricultural produce, but in my district, where people were tilling the same plots year after year, the question of what was made on agricultural produce, one year with another, did not affect them very much. This measure which has been introduced by the Minister for Agriculture brings a message of hope and gladness to their hearts, because they see now that after long weary years of waiting they have the prospect, in a few years,, of getting back on the good land of the country from which their forefathers were evicted.</P>
