      <P>To ask the Minister for Fisheries whether his attention has been called to the constant trespassing of trawlers within prohibited limits; whether such trespassing is calculated to do serious injury to the Irish Sea Fisheries; and whether, in view of the impossibility of preventing it without efficient patrol service, he will endeavour to obtain the return of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; for the service of his Department, or will endeavour to provide some other vessel or vessels to protect the Irish Sea Fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Fionan Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the constant trespassing of trawlers within prohibited limits; and I am aware that such trespassing is calculated to do serious injury to the Irish Sea Fisheries.</P>
      <P>Owing to the diversion of the fishery cruiser &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; to other service, the marine police work off our coasts has, in the past few months, been weakened. I am, however, definitely assured that the cruiser will very shortly be available for her normal duties; and this, together with such temporary measures as have been adopted will, it is hoped, prove successful in reducing this illegal trawling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, however, to make it clear that, even under the best conditions, one fishery cruiser, having an all-Ireland &ldquo;beat&rdquo; of something like 2,000 miles, could not possibly cope effectively with this menace of illegal trawling.  Scotland has five such fishery cruisers as against our one.  I trust I may count on the support of the Deputy when, later on, I come to the Dáil with a proposal for a provision of one or two additional <Col N="936" /> fishery cruisers.  The work of developing Irish fisheries, with which I am charged, is most seriously affected by these infractions of our trawling limits.  Some idea of the number of such offences is conveyed by the fact that since the s.s. &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; was first commissioned for this work, 258 prosecutions were undertaken and 248 convictions obtained.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether a large tract of land near Creggs, Co. Galway, was seized about two years ago by a body of men calling themselves the Creggs Land Committee, ostensibly for landless men; whether the dispossessed owners brought the matter into the Land Settlement Commission Court set up by the second Dáil; whether a Receiver was put into possession by the Court; whether any final judgment was ever delivered in this case; whether some of the lands are not still in the possession of the Receiver or parties holding under lettings made by him, and what are the intentions of the Ministry with regard to pending cases before the Land Settlement Commission.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="MEMORANDUM" RHead="">
    <Title>MEMORANDUM</Title>
    <P>BY MINISTER FOR FINANCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE SEANAD ON ARTICLES 21 AND 23 OF THE CONSTITUTION AND SUGGESTED APPOINTMENTS AND REMUNERATION OF OFFICERS OF THE SEANAD.</P>
    <P>1.  &mdash;Article 21 of the Constitution leaves it to the Seanad to determine the powers, duties, remuneration and terms of office of the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman, and the recommendation in paragraph <i>(a)</i> of the first part of the Report regarding the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach proceeds in accordance with the provisions of that Article.</P>
    <P>2.  &mdash;Article 23 of the Constitution says that the Oireachtas shall make provision for the payment of members and may provide for free travelling facilities.  The provision under this Article should apparently be made by an Act of the Oireachtas covering both Houses, and it would not appear to lie with each House acting separately to determine the payment of its own members and the grant of free travelling facilities.  The recommendations for payment of Senators in paragraph <i>(a)</i> and for granting of free travelling facilities in paragraph <i>(b)</i> of the first part of the Report fall therefore to be considered when a Bill is introduced in the Dáil for giving effect to Article 23 of the Constitution.  The Bill should initiate in the Dáil on the motion <Col N="938" /> of a Minister inasmuch as it is a Money Bill within Article 35 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>3.  &mdash;The second part of the Report:</P>
    <P>(1)  prescribes the principal posts of the staff of the Seanad;</P>
    <P>(2)  recommends certain persons for appointment to these posts, and</P>
    <P>(3)  makes certain recommendations regarding the junior and reporting staff for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is silent as to the power of appointment of and as to the fixing of remuneration for the officers of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  The remuneration of officers of either House must be, of course, the subject of an Estimate to be presented in the Dáil and passed by the Dáil in common with all other Public Service Estimates before remuneration can be payable.</P>
    <P>4.  &mdash;In the time available it has not been found possible to obtain any information as to the practice in Canada or in other Dominions, and the only information available is the practice obtaining in the British Parliament.  The British Parliament is not a correct precedent for the present purpose inasmuch as the House of Lords occupies in the British Parliament a different position from the Seanad in the Saorstát, and has certain functions which are not vested in the Seanad of the Saorstát The following outline of the arrangements of the British Parliament may, however, be of help in considering the arrangements to be adopted in the Saorstát:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The principal officers of Parliament, namely, the Clerk of the Parliaments (House of Lords), the Clerk of the House of Commons, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, and the Serjeant-at-Arms are appointed by the Crown.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Second and Third Clerks in the House of Lords are appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and the Second and Third Clerks in the House of Commons are appointed by the Prime Minister, on the recommendation of the Speaker, from the House of Commons Staff.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Clerk of the Parliaments and <Col N="939" /> the Clerk of the House of Commons have, as a general rule, the power of appointment of the Clerks, Librarian, &amp;c., but in the case of certain posts the appointment is reserved to the Speaker and to the Offices Committee of the Lords.  The recruitment of staff is carried out by both the Clerk of the Parliaments and the Clerk of the House of Commons by a limited competition for which candidates must be nominated.</P>
    <P>The House of Commons has a statutory Committee or Commission consisting of the Speaker, the Secretaries of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Master of the Rolls and the Attorney and Solicitor-General for the purpose of regulating the numbers, salaries and pensions of the House of Commons staff.  The Speaker is Chairman to this Committee, three constitute a quorum, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is always present.</P>
    <P>The House of Lords has an Offices Committee composed of Peers drawn from both sides of the House, appointed at the beginning of each Session to regulate numbers, salaries, and pensions of House of Lords staff.</P>
    <P>The direct control exercised by the Treasury in relation to staff in the Public Service does not extend to the remuneration of staff of the House of Commons or the House of Lords.  In the case of the House of Commons Treasury influence is maintained through the Chancellor of the Exchequer as a Member of the Commons Commission.  Estimates for the House of Lords and the House of Commons are only criticised by the Treasury in regard to expenditure other than personal remuneration. In practice the Estimates of the House of Lords as regards personal remuneration are not challenged in the House of Commons, but the right of the House of Commons to do so was exercised in 1893, when the House of Commons reduced the Vote for <Col N="940" /> the Clerk of Parliaments and other staff of the House of Lords by £500.</P>
    <P>5.  &mdash;The analogy of the British Constitution points to a Statute of the Saorstát to determine the principal posts and the remuneration thereof in the Dáil and the Seanad, and to provide machinery to regulate the numbers, salaries, etc., of the junior staff.  In the report of the Seanad Committee it appears to be assumed that it is a matter exclusively for the Seanad to determine what officers it will have and what their remuneration will be, but there is nothing in the Constitution to that effect, and it is clear that as the responsibility rests with the Dáil of providing the money, some machinery should be provided to bring the two Houses into accord as regards numbers and salaries of officers and the regulations governing their appointment. It is suggested that for appointment to the principal posts in both the Seanad and the Dáil a Committee should be constituted consisting of the President, the Chairman of the Dáil, and the Chairman of the Seanad, with the addition of the Law Officer should a legal appointment be under consideration.  It is suggested that as regards remuneration and numbers of junior staff there should be a Standing Committee consisting of the Minister of Finance, the Chairman of the Dáil and the Chairman of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>6.  &mdash;As regards junior staff, it is suggested that until experience shows that there is sufficient work to justify the creation of separate staffs an attempt should be made to carry on with one common staff.  The report of the Seanad Committee recognises the desirability of a common reporting staff, and the principle should, it is suggested, be extended for the present to the Junior Clerical Staff and any typing staff that may be required.  It is suggested also that there should be one common Parliamentary Library.</P>
    <P>7.  &mdash;As regards recruitment of junior staff, the British Parliament has a limited competition with nomination for each House.  Open competitive examination is not desirable as, owing to the relations that must necessarily exist between the staff and members of the Seanad or of the Dáil, it is important that careful <Col N="941" /> selection should be exercised.  There appears, however, to be no good reason why the junior clerical staff of the Seanad and of the Dáil (whether separate or as suggested above, one common pool) should not be recruited in the future from an appropriate open Civil Service examination, subject to the condition that the successful candidates at that examination should be subject to selection before appointment.  At the moment no suitable Civil Service examination is available.  The Dáil, however, has obtained practically all its junior staff from the existing Civil Service, and has proceeded on the principle of building up staff to meet the growth of the work.  Pending the creation of whatever machinery may be decided upon, the Clerk of the Dáil, in obtaining staff, has followed the practice of the Civil Service by obtaining the Finance Ministry sanction for appointments and salaries. If the Seanad is to have a separate junior staff it is suggested that the staff should be drawn from the Civil Service by selection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I moved that this matter should be deferred for two or three days so as to permit of a report from the Ministry of Finance upon the subject matter of the Seanad Committee's report.  The Seanad Committee's report consists of two parts; one deals with the remuneration payable to the Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach, and members of Seanad Eireann, and also as regards their travelling expenses. The second part of the report deals with the payment to the Seanad staff; that is, the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk, and the second Assistant Clerk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as this is the first occasion on which we received a communication from the Seanad, and as it was necessary to regularise the business relations which will exist between the two Houses, it was sent forward to the Ministry of Finance for report, and that report is submitted to-day consisting of 7 paragraphs. It is pointed out that as far as the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach is concerned it is prescribed that the Seanad will appoint these officers and will specify the remuneration, and their terms of office, and it goes on then to deal with the situation as regards the other officials required by the Seanad.  Paragraph 3 of the report says that it will be observed that the Constitution is silent as to the power of appointment, and as to the fixing of remuneration for the officers of either the Dáil or the Seanad, and then it gives a retrospect of what is the usual custom with regard to the two Houses in another place which do not stand in the same relation to one another as do the Seanad and the Dáil; and in paragraph 5 suggestions are made regarding <Col N="943" /> the methods of procedure to be adopted. I do not know whether the members of the Dáil have had the opportunity of reading and studying this report.  I am sure it is generally desired that we should act in cordial co-operation with the Seanad in this matter.  I think it will be felt after reading this report that there is a real effort made here to come to an amicable arrangement, and if any better suggestions can be made for effecting that purpose we are open to receive them.  I do not know of any at the moment.  The appointments that have been made as far as the Dáil is concerned have not been extern appointments. I think every person appointed here, save one&mdash;and in the case of that exception the person was in the service of the Government of the last Dáil&mdash; has been drawn from the public service and there have not been what is usually called patronage appointments.  I am sure it is the desire of the Dáil to afford the Seanad the officers it requires, and all the assistance it needs, but I think, having regard to the state of public finances, and even apart from the state of public finances, the consideration of the officers and also of the staffs of both Houses should be regulated on a sound business basis so that there would be no overlapping, and that the State would be enabled to get, from any officers or officials so appointed, good service for the remuneration paid to them. It is with that intention that this report is submitted and I put it forward now for the consideration of the Dáil, believing that it is a good solution and that there are good reasons for the recommendations made and that we can get on a sound working basis without delay.  I accordingly move that the memorandum be approved of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is that the Dáil approve of the suggestion in the memorandum and postpones the consideration of the report of the Seanad, or the taking of any action until such time as the arrangements in this memorandum have borne fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to recommend, also, approval of the three appointments, viz., the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and the second <Col N="944" /> Assistant Clerk.  In a letter the Cathaoirleach points out that they may require the services of a legal adviser. Now both the Assistant Clerk and the second Assistant are Barristers-at-Law, and it is quite possible in making these appointments the Seanad had in mind the usefulness of the services that could be given by these men, having regard to their legal experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not know whether the Dáil is as ignorant and as much at sea in this matter as I am.  The report made to the Seanad was circulated last week to members of the Dáil.  One day last week the President suggested that that report would in some form or other come before the Dáil, and he asked that the consideration of the report to the Seanad be deferred until a memorandum be produced and circulated.  That memorandum has been produced at 3 o'clock to-day and we are asked to decide that that memorandum contains wise recommendations.  I submit that before proceeding further with the consideration of this matter we should have an opportunity to consider what is in the memorandum and then I suggest we should consider the whole matter afresh.</P>

      <P>I wish to move the following amendment.  To add at the end a new paragraph, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The returning officer shall also send by post, as soon as practicable after the election is adjourned, to each person on the register of Parliamentary electors for the constituency, a notice, directed to the address on the register, and showing in the prescribed form the day and hours at which the poll is to be taken, the voter's number on the register, the polling station at which the elector is entitled to vote, and the names and descriptions of the candidates as they will appear on the ballot paper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment throws upon the Returning Officer the duties of sending particulars of election to each registered elector.  This is usually done by the candidates or their agents, but there is very often a great deal of confusion as to the day and hour and place of the polling, and we think it is a reasonable request that the Returning Officer should officially notify every registered elector as to the time and the place of the polling, and I accordingly move the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is one which would undoubtedly relieve candidates and party organisations of labour which they undertake at present and it would throw a very considerable amount of labour on the Returning Officer.  Some of the constituencies that are proposed will have as many as 9 members, that is, there will be a constituency with something over 180,000 of a population.  As this Bill is based on 200,000 about half the population will be electors, so roughly in a constituency like that there will be 90,000 electors.  If notices are to be sent out officially the work must be done with some care.  Reasonable precaution must be taken in ensuring that when an <Col N="947" /> elector gets notice his number is correctly marked on it, that the polling place is correctly marked, and that that person does not get a notice intended for someone else.  Especially is that so when we take that in conjunction with proposals of Deputy O'Brien, to be moved subsequently, and when it is borne in mind that we calculate that in doing this work, addressing envelopes, filling in the elector's number, filling in the place where the elector is to poll, the time occupied would be such that probably the person engaged on the work would not do more than 25 in an hour.  If that is taken as an average hour's work, in 8 hours of an average day there would just be 200 electors dealt with by one person. In a constituency of 90,000 electors, that means the staff to be employed by the Returning Officer there would be caused 450 days' work.  There would only be a limited time between the reception of the nomination and the taking of the poll, as a day or two will be lost getting the complete ballot paper printed.  Persons do not know, until the nominations have closed, who will be proposed, and some time will be lost getting the ballot paper printed, and getting the notices sent out a day or two before the election, to give time for postal delays.  There may not actually be more than five or six clear days for doing the work.  That means that something like eighty or ninety people should have to be employed by the Returning Officer.  It seems to me, in addition to the other preparations that would have to be made by the Returning Officer, to cast this responsibility on him, work which would have to be done in a limited time, would tend to over-burden him, besides raising very considerably on the public purse the cost of the election. It is hard to discuss this subject satisfactorily, without infringing a little on the strict rules of order, as one can hardly consider it without considering subsequent and consequential amendments at the same time.  We hope to make such arrangements for polling and to give such notice that there would only be a comparatively small number of people who would have any difficulty in discovering where they were to poll. The time and the day of the election are <Col N="948" /> known to everybody, and certainly, to everybody who wants to vote, the names of the candidates will be known, so that I do not think anyone is seriously misled by getting out a series of ballot papers with one name or a series of names printed in large type.  I do not think in this particular amendment before us there is a very great argument for casting this labour on the Returning Officer and incurring this expense.  I suppose I could hardly discuss the question on this amendment as to whether it would be effectual as a means of preventing personation or not.</P>

      <P>About this being effectual as a means of stopping personation, I am somewhat doubtful.  In the first place there will be a large number of people who will not bring their papers with them.  There will also be people who because of change of address will fail to get their papers.  If it is to be strictly required that everybody shall show a paper, you will have, perhaps, the progress of the poll very seriously delayed, and perhaps delayed at the busy hour, by numbers of people rolling in without a paper to show.  On the other hand, if there is not a fairly strict demand for the paper, the value of the provision is very, very seriously lessened. There is one other aspect of the matter. Suppose people are induced to bring their papers; suppose that practically everybody brings a paper, means could certainly be found either for faking these notices or perhaps capturing them. Now, if it is to be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person presenting the paper is the elector who should have that paper, you might even facilitate personation by having the persons given the ballot paper without question on their presenting the notice described in this particular amendment.  That may easily happen.  The Committee on Corrupt Practices reported that one of the abuses, or one of the failures to comply with the regulations, which facilitated personation was the failure of the presiding officers to ask the name of the elector presenting himself for a ballot paper.  It was stated that in many cases people simply called out their numbers <Col N="949" /> when they came into the booth, and were given a ballot paper, and I was told to-day of a person who, at the recent election, voted a great number of times; each time he went into the booth he merely announced a number and did not in any case know what his name was supposed to be.  If too much attention were to be paid to this notice&mdash;if the possession of the notice was to be regarded as a sort of proof that the person presenting himself was entitled to vote&mdash;you might possibly facilitate that kind of personating.  My view of the whole of the matter is this, that its value as a means of preventing personating and of facilitating the proper carrying out of the poll is somewhat doubtful.  I believe that in certain circumstances it might possibly be used and in a certain way it might possibly facilitate personation.  In other circumstances and operating in another way it might delay the poll unduly.  I believe great numbers of people undoubtedly, probably half the electors who are not deprived of their right to vote at present, would turn up without the notices. You were not depriving anybody of his right to vote because of his not having a paper, but under this proposal numbers would turn up without them.  The strain on the returning officer and the staff would be considerable; the expense would be something that would certainly be sufficiently large to be a consideration; and on these grounds I would be inclined to resist the amendment.</P>

      <P>The argument for Amendment No. 3 does not depend upon the case which has been demolished by the Minister, or which he has attempted to demolish.  Most of his argument against No. 3 is based upon an objection to No. 4.  Now, I want to maintain that the case for No. 3 stands by itself.  We are informed that there are constituencies which will have 90,000 voters and we ought to understand that the idea of the constitutional provision for Proportional Representation is to encourage the individual without a Party at his back to come forward as a candidate.  The intention of that provision was to encourage individuals of public spirit to come forward as candidates and to seek representation. But the big constituency which, in the main, I think, is desirable, once we have accepted Proportional Representation, <Col N="950" /> will undoubtedly deter public-spirited individuals, and unless we facilitate the individual the Proportional Representation system is going to lead more and more definitely to the control of election work by Party organisations and the elimination from the contest of the individual as such.  Ninety thousand of an electorate means a very wide appeal; it means a very great deal of hard work and the organisation of writers, if you are going to approach that electorate by post.  The Minister has pointed out as a difficulty, or what he thinks to be the difficulty, that nothing of this kind could be done until after the election has begun.  The intention in moving this amendment is that as soon as the register is ready the organisation of the preparation of notices may be proceeded with.  It may be said that you cannot indicate the names of the candidates. That is true; but it is not unknown to the arts and sciences of the printing trade to be able to add to a fly-sheet or the lower part of a card, a notice with the names of candidates.  The rest of the card, or notice, may be filled in with the name, address and number on the register of the voter, and that can be ready in preparation for the day when the election is announced and when the nomination has taken place.  In that way there will be no delay and no difficulty for the registration officer or returning officer.  It would be a continuous process. The difficulty might arise it may be said in the case of a bye-election, but if that were put forward as an objection it might well be inserted that this provision would only apply in the case of a General Election, so that the mechanical or practical difficulty is nil.  The question that really arises is whether the State or the individual candidate should bear the expense.  Now, if the printing and sending by post of such a notice is part of the election expenses and if the preparation of those notices is taken in hand after the Register is ready, the added expense will not be very great It will facilitate the conduct of an election, and in a matter of this kind, when the intention is to elect a legislature representative of the opinions of the people, it is better that this kind of work, which is really public work, should be done by the public authority rather <Col N="951" /> than by the individual who may have much money, or by the other individual who has a party organisation behind him.  We might say that it will militate against party candidates, and therefore we should not support such a proposition; but we think that on the merits this is a sound principle and should be adopted, and that the notification to the individual elector of his registered number and the names of the candidates should be undertaken by the State and not simply by the exhibition of the notice of the election in a public place, and that he should be provided with it at his residence, as notified on the Register I think the practical difficulties are not to be taken into account at all, because they can be easily got over.  The only question is that of the expense, and I submit that the expense should be borne by the State and not by the individual who is a candidate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is very little case for Amendment No. 3 by itself.  In regard to the question of incurring expense for this, there are very great difficulties about incurring what may be needless and fruitless expenditure of public money.  I think it would be very hard to justify the expense of preparing all this big mail if there was no certainty that it would be required.  It may easily happen that even in the biggest constituencies there will not be a contest, and until it is ascertained that there is to be a contest, it would be difficult to justify the expenditure of money in anticipation of a contest.  Then, as regards encouraging the individual candidate, I think that the individual candidate is going to be helped by the desire that all parties will have under Proportional Representation a full poll.  There will be big parties, and I take it that it is regarded as of advantage to circulate a list or notice to each elector showing where he will poll.  Now, the big party, if it circulates that, will do the work of the individual candidate.  It will be of no material assistance to this individual candidate apart from facilitating people in actually coming to the poll, and that will apply to everybody.  It will be of no particular assistance to this individual candidate to have a ballot paper on which his name appears&mdash;just the plain ballot <Col N="952" /> paper sent out to the electors.  I honestly do not think that amendment No. 3 would be of any substantial benefit to the individual candidate.  I do not see how it could gain him any votes.  It will not move any people.  If he sends out an appeal to the electors, he will send it out under the provision which enables him to send one communication free to each elector.  That will be the thing that will facilitate him.  The sending out of this particular ballot paper will do him no good whatever, as far as I can see.  I think that everybody who is interested enough to vote will know who the candidates are, and will have learned from the Press and from public meetings, and in other ways, something about them.  Then if you send out this notice, it has often happened&mdash;it happened in the last election&mdash;that for one reason or another a polling station will have to be changed at the last moment; and in any case, so far as country districts are concerned, if reasonable care is taken beforehand and proper notice is given, there is no reason why anybody should have any difficulty, even without this notice, in ascertaining where he is to poll.  As a matter of fact, I think that the benefit from this amendment would be very small indeed.  I believe that practically all candidates will avail of the free postal facilities to send out some sort of a circular.  It might be a good thing; it might be worth while, when sending out the envelope, for them to indicate to the elector what his number was on the register and what his polling place was if they chose to do so.  That would be a certain facility to electors, but the benefit of this proposed amendment would be infinitesimal, and I do not see how the work could be done in advance. Even if the circulars were written out, they would have to be carefully taken and put into envelopes, and there would be a very considerable amount of work, even if we agreed that expenditure should be incurred in view of an occasion which might not arise.  I think it is undesirable that this expenditure of public money should be incurred when the occasion for it might not arise.</P>

This amendment, if carried, will assist the personator. He will go round and collect these cards and use them, and if the elector has the official cards it will assist that sort of thing.

That was drafted some considerable time ago, and I am now satisfied that there is a danger that it would assist personation rather than prevent it, and I do not propose to move that amendment.

      <P>I do not take sides very much one way or the other as regards this amendment. I see the advantage to be derived from it and I see the great difficulties in the way which have been mentioned by the Minister for Local Government.  But would it not be absolutely essential, if this amendment is to pass, that there should be some provision in the case of failure on the part of the Returning Officer, in compiling this document, or failure on the part of the Post Office to deliver it to the voter, that such failure should not have a prejudicial effect on the election subsequently held? It seems to me that it would be a very dangerous thing to make it an essential part of the election that a document giving vital information to each elector should be sent out and which would really be one on which he would act as to how he was to vote and where he was to attend and vote.  It does seem to me, in the hurry before an election, it <Col N="954" /> is highly probable that in some constituencies, at any rate, some Returning Officers would blunder in doing that.  Some Returning Officers are dealing with very large numbers of electors, in some cases 90,000 electors, and any mistake that occurs in the printing of the document will be repeated in the case of every elector and in addition there may also be mistakes in the written part of the documents dealing with the particular elector or batch of electors.  I can conceive a vista of election petitions to quash elections arising out of involuntary and wholly unintentional errors on the part of the Returning Officer.  Therefore, it seems to me that you must put in some proviso to safeguard the elections that are held although there may be mistakes in what is really a vital document.  On the other hand, if you put this in then you are rather at the mercy of unscrupulous Returning Officers, if any should turn up in future, who might make the whole election void and say it was only a clerical error or mistake, if by some mistake a party did not get their notice.  It seems to me that the possibility of causing great confusion in an election is a consideration that ought to be very carefully weighed before this amendment is accepted.  As I say, on the merits on other grounds the thing seems to be fairly evenly balanced, but this is a difficulty that has not been touched upon at all and that does seem to me to be a very serious one.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the amendment on the ground that it makes the procedure too cumbersome, but I am not opposed to adding any provision that will oblige the elector to produce a notice on the day of the election.  It was stated that that would impose too great a strain on the Presiding Officer, but if entrance into the booth is conditional upon producing this card it would be no strain on the Presiding Officer.  It is also opposed on the ground that it would prevent the ordinary precautions being taken by the Presiding Officer; but the Presiding Officer could take these precautions in addition to getting this paper.  It would not at all relieve him of the necessity of taking other precautions.  I would refer to this as an additional precaution. Then the objection is raised that the voter would be put to inconvenience <Col N="955" /> because he had not the paper.  Polling stations are now so numerous that they are never more than two miles or so from the voters and there would not be much inconvenience in that.  I would not support the amendment because it has not been recommended by the Committee. We are trying a larger Register and we would like to see how the recommendations will fare with the new Register.  If there is much personation under the new Register I would urge upon the Minister to take into consideration this additional precaution.</P>

There is an express provision for the possibility of either of these officers being prevented through ill-health or any other incapacity from acting.  The performance of their ordinary duties would prevent them from taking on the active duties of Returning Officer, and it seems to me that it would be only reasonable to allow them to appoint Deputy Returning Officers from their own staff or any such other person whom they might think fit to perform the duties of Returning Officer in this particular case.

      <P>I only saw Professor Thrift's amendment this morning. What struck me about it was, that it seemed to indicate a division of authority and a division of responsibility.  I do not know whether that is desirable or not.  If the Statutory Returning Officer did not desire or choose to act it might be a good thing to make provision for a Deputy acting.  That, I understand, is what happens in Great Britain.  If the Mayor of a Borough, say, does not choose to act, the Town Clerk acts and has all the authority of the Returning Officer; but every Returning Officer must have agents, and if it is a case of lack of knowledge as regards counting under the Proportional System, he could appoint an Assessor.  I think there should be either a Returning Officer taking responsibility and acting by his agents or there should be the handing over of the whole business to a Deputy Returning Officer.  The Returning Officers have certain statutory duties to perform, and they are responsible for the proper carrying out of the rules in <Col N="958" /> connection with the elections.  I think some person should be responsible. There is nothing, I take it, to prevent a Returning Officer from appointing an agent or an assistant, to assist him to do certain actual work in connection with the election.</P>

There are various acts he has to perform which could really only be done by a Deputy; whether these could be done by an agent, as the Minister suggests, I am not sure, unless we give him the necessary authority. I do not think the agent could be said to have sufficient authority.  I would suggest to the Minister, and urge that the appointment of this Deputy would not relieve the Returning Officer in any way of responsibility.</P>

I would think, without going into the point too closely, that the Returning Officer would have power to get people to do things for him, that he could not do personally.  For instance, if the amendment of Deputy O'Brien as regards sending nominations through the post had been adopted the Returning Officer would send the nominations through the post, but of course that would not mean the Returning Officer would himself go to the post with the letters.  I am not prepared to say that the appointment of the Deputy is not necessary, but if it is necessary I will look into it.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct a little inaccuracy of expression in the case of the Minister's Bill, and Deputy Fitzgibbon's reference to it. The Vice-Chancellor of the National University is not the Chairman of the Senate.  The Chancellor is <i>ex-officio</i> Chairman of the Senate.  Fortunately, the Chancellor is conspicuous by his absence, so that the Vice-Chancellor is as a matter of fact the Chairman.  Now, we have several pro-Vice-Chancellors, and if any Vice-Chancellor is incapacitated, there is provision made in the Statutes of the University, for his duties to be discharged by the pro-Vice-Chancellor, so that so far as we are concerned there is no great difficulty to be overcome.</P>
