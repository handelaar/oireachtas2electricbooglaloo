      <P>asked the President whether &ldquo;The Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo; as provided for in Standing Order No. 100 of Dáil Eireann has yet been appointed, and, if not, when it is proposed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee has not yet been appointed, as the first Appropriation Accounts of Saorstát Eireann are not yet due to be rendered. It is proposed to take steps for the appointment of the Committee as soon as the Comptroller and Auditor-General presents his Report on these Accounts.</P>

      <P>asked the President whether the Comptroller and Auditor-General has yet made his Report on the Accounts for the last Financial Year, and, if so, when that Report will be presented to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act of 1923, which incorporates the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866 and 1921, the Appropriation Accounts of the several Supply Grants comprised in the Appropriation Act of each year, together with the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General thereon, shall be submitted to Dáil Eireann on or before 31st January, 1924, after the termination of the Financial Year to <Col N="1716" /> which the Accounts relate&mdash;that is, the 31st January next year for the accounts of 1922-23.  There has been a certain delay in some Departments, owing to the circumstances connected with the transfer of the Exchequer and the general conditions prevailing last year, in furnishing the Accounts and Vouchers for the latter part of the Financial Year 1922-23, but it is, nevertheless, hoped that the Report on the Appropriation Accounts for the Financial Year, 1922-23 may be completed by the 31st January, 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for the year that I mentioned&mdash;1922-23.  It is hoped that these accounts will be ready on the 31st January, 1924.  I should say, with regard to that, I have some experience of public accounts, and the delay is not unreasonable.  It is about three months beyond the date when some important local bodies manage to furnish their accounts.  They are not audited for a long time after that.</P>

      <P>asked the President if the Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland have just appointed a gentleman to be Director of the Gallery, and if, having regard to the importance to Ireland of the post and to the widespread disapproval which the announcement of the appointment has caused, the President is prepared to endorse and ratify the choice of the Board.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that answer, surely some Minister is responsible for the appointment of the person who will be paid out of public funds, and, if so, to what Minister should we address our enquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated that the Board of Governors is a statutory body.  The Minister is not responsible any more than if the present judicial system were to prevail; it would not be the business of a Minister to interfere with the appointment by the Lord Chief Justice of a person in the Courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the Vote of the Dáil.  I do not think the sum is £2,500; I think it is £1,000, but if the Deputy persists in saying it is £2,500, I will accept his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>

      <P>May I ask a further question with regard to the answer of the President?  In the Bill before us the Minister for Education is put in charge of the National Gallery.  Are we to take it that the salary of any person appointed will be on the Estimates, and, therefore, can be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a fair question, though I do not think it arises out of the original question put by the Deputy.  I believe the salary will be on the Estimates, and it is open to the Dáil to refuse to pass it and to refuse to pay if it so desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The premises referred to in this question consist of the old R.I.C. Barrack, in which the Civic Guard at Fermoy are accommodated.  It was held by the R.I.C. on a lease for 21 years from 1903, the interest in which passed to the Free State Government.</P>
      <P>Between the dates of vacation by the R.I.C. and that of occupation by the Civic Guard the premises were occupied by the Legion of Irish Ex-Servicemen. Such occupation took place without the knowledge or consent of the Free State Government, and no claim by the Legion of Ex-Servicemen in respect of disturbance or for improvements would ordinarily lie against the Government, which, under the lease, is not responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the premises.</P>
      <P>I am having inquiries made regarding the promise of compensation which is stated to have been made by the representative of the Board of Works, and concerning which the Commissioners of Public Works have no knowledge.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Coroner's inquest is itself a judicial enquiry, and no machinery exists for enabling any further enquiry of the kind suggested to be held.  If at any time sufficient evidence is forthcoming to connect any particular individual or individuals with the crime the appropriate court proceedings will be at once instituted for the purpose of having the charge investigated and dealt with in due course of law.</P>
      <P>It is to be observed that the opinion expressed by the Jury to the effect that armed forces of the State were &ldquo;implicated in the removal and disappearance of Noel Lemass from the streets of Dublin,&rdquo; was entirely unsupported by evidence.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part is in the affirmative.  It is estimated that the reconstruction of this bridge will cost £2,500.  The total estimated cost of repairing and reconstructing damaged bridges in the County is £163,961, and provision was not made by the Council in their rate estimates for the carrying out of this work.  As regards the particular bridge referred to, I have not sufficient information before me as to whether rebuilding could be undertaken during the winter.  If an application is made <Col N="1721" /> by the County Council for a loan for the purpose of rebuilding, the matter will receive immediate consideration.</P>
      <P>Advances will be made from the Road Fund in the Spring of next year in connection with damaged bridges. The Road Fund will not receive until next month the first contributions from the special sixpenny rates under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923.</P>

      <P>With regard to the drainage of the Barrow generally, it involves financial, engineering and legal difficulties, which could not be settled at once, and, while it is recognised that a scheme for the drainage of the Barrow would bring real relief to the farmers in the districts mentioned, it is clear that work of this magnitude is not for the Land Commission.

That will not prevent the appointment of honorary Parliamentary Secretaries in accordance with the wishes just expressed by Deputy Nagle.  One of the effects of the amendment will be that, on appointment, it must be declared whether a Parliamentary Secretary is appointed with or without salary.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Government upon the action they have taken in this matter. They have met the opinion which I expressed on Second Reading when I stated that seven Ministers and seven Parliamentary Secretaries would be enough.  I am not going to quarrel with the fact that the Attorney-General requires one more, so that the number fourteen, as contemplated by me, is increased by the Government to fifteen. If they desire to appoint one extra, by all means let them do so.  What I call attention to is that when I urged that course on Second Reading the Attorney-General stigmatised my arguments as superficial and unsound.  Yet, after mature deliberation, he adopts that very scheme as his own.  The explanation <Col N="1726" /> is a simple one.  I did not convince the Attorney-General.  I do not think I have convinced him even now, but I think I convinced the Minister for Finance, who adopted my view yesterday on this matter.  This, I think, affords a very good indication of the value to be attached to discussion.  If Ministers take a little longer time to get their Bills through, they may be comforted by the fact that in the end they do get their Bills in an improved form, as compared with the form in which they were introduced.</P>

      <P>My object in moving the amendment is very much the same as that which animated me in moving a previous amendment in regard to the reduction of salaries of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter, however, in suggesting the reduction of the salaries of Parliamentary Secretaries, as fixed by the Bill, I am on surer ground than in the case of the former amendment. Here we are dealing with appointments and with salaries to men who have not yet started to perform their duties, and we are dealing with salaries which are to apply to positions that did not exist before.  I think, for these reasons, it is very important, at the commencement at least, that the salaries to be paid to <Col N="1727" /> the Parliamentary Secretaries should be fixed at a reasonable amount.  It seems to me that when we get more experience of Parliamentary work, and know the material of which the secretaries are composed, it would then be in the power of the Oireachtas to increase these salaries, if they thought well to do so.  I also think-and it is very reasonable to expect-that we have here in this Dáil many young men who would be anxious to take up the duties of Parliamentary Secretaries at comparatively small salaries, in order that they might serve their political apprenticeship, and at the end of that time might rise to greater eminence and higher salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, on this amendment, that I am rather surprised the Deputy did not compare the salary which he proposes to pay in this case with the salary paid in similar employment outside.  We are not concerned in getting Parliamentary Secretaries who will serve an apprenticeship at the cost of the State. We are concerned with the appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries who will do more than what we call Parliamentary duties, as I have explained on one or two occasions.  I have examined this amendment from the point of view of how much extra the Deputy would receive for the duties which it is proposed to impose upon him or to ask him to discharge.  In the case of a single man appointed to this position, his salary would be £166 17s. 6d. per annum, a little over £3 a week, over and above what he would be entitled to receive as a member of this Dáil.  I thought the Deputy would be in a position to give the Dáil some information as to what is usually paid to the Secretary of the Farmers' Union or a Secretary of a County Council, or some other official associated with the activities of the party to which he belongs, and of which he has got expert knowledge.  I would like to know of a case of any whole-time officer to any one of these bodies&mdash;a County Council or a Farmers' Union&mdash;who has only £166 17s. 6d. per annum.  There is nobody that I know of in a position to take up such important duties at this particular <Col N="1728" /> price.  I think the Deputy ought to take the Dáil into his confidence, and tell us where these great men are to be found who are capable of doing so much at such a figure, because we certainly do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the President that the Secretary of the Wicklow County Council has a salary of £500 a year, and that although there is only a difference of £160 between a Deputy's allowance here and the salary proposed to be paid to these Parliamentary Secretaries, it is well to point out that it is not intended, I think, that these Parliamentary Secretaries would be living outside the City of Dublin.  Therefore, the £360 a year allowance would in that case be more or less a salary.  It will not be considered in the light of expenses, because the Parliamentary Secretary would be living at home.  The salary of £50 a month for a beginning, except of course in the case of a man of exceptional ability, is, I think, a very fair start.  It is a salary which a man in the Civil Service takes years to reach.  Therefore, we think that the salary to be paid to these Parliamentary Secretaries should start fairly small, and that they should be given gradual increments in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is to have the salaries proposed to be paid to Parliamentary Secretaries reduced from £1,200 a year to £800 a year.  We are all very well aware that this salary cannot be regarded as setting up a very generous standard.  But all things considered. it cannot be regarded as meagre or as unfair.  A man's work in any Department is conditioned by two things: First, the service he renders, and secondly, the capacity of the nation to pay.  The services rendered by these Parliamentary Secretaries would be of a subordinate, if not of a subservient, character.  They will not have the responsibility of the Minister, and consequently they will only be filling a minor rôle.  As a matter of fact, I <Col N="1729" /> think a well-trained Civil Servant would be a greater acquisition, and a more desirable asset in any Department than a Parliamentary Secretary, for, when everything is considered, you must regard your proposed Parliamentary Secretaries for some time to come, at least, as unskilled labourers.  Secondly, as to the capacity of the people to pay, I do not think that at the present time, when we are faced with a deficit of eighteen and a half millions, that we should set up a champagne standard of emoluments.  It would be very undesirable, all things considered, seeing the poverty of the country, that such high salaries should be paid.  I think the Dáil should set a good example and leave the salary of these Parliamentary Secretaries at £800 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that there were any unskilled labourers in the country earning £800 a year.  I do not know whether any are paid that salary down in the Deputy's own county or not.  In this case an unmarried man would get £320 a year, over and above his allowances, and, as I said before, we have got no information from the financial experts on the benches opposite, as to what they pay the secretaries of their own Farmers' Union.  I think they ought to take us into their confidence and give us some idea as to what they pay these secretaries, because I have very great respect for the organisation of the farmers.  I have seen the activities of these men, and I know of their usefulness, and it would be a headline for us, perhaps, if we were told the salaries paid to them.  The Deputy stated that the salary he suggested would be, in essence, what a civil servant would get.  The salaries paid to Executive Officers in the Civil Service range, I believe, from £700 to £900 a year with bonus.  But, in this case, the Deputy proposes to pay less to Parliamentary Secretaries than is paid to the higher Executive Officers in the Civil Service.  While the Deputy may say that these Parliamentary Secretaries had not got the responsibility, I may say that they have practically the responsibility of a Minister. with the difference, perhaps, that fewer bricks <Col N="1730" /> are thrown at them than at the Ministers.</P>
      <P>It is very doubtful whether they will not suffer the same discredit in the event of any catastrophies occurring that a Minister will have to bear.  One cannot say that an allowance is not eaten up if the member stays in Dublin. Everybody knows that the expenses in connection with membership of this House are not confined to hotel expenses.  A Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, or anybody of that sort. will have certain expenses over and above what attaches to the ordinary member.  It has been stated on many occasions, as a reason why people should be paid a fair wage, that they should have a reasonable hope of comfort or a reasonable chance of keeping themselves free from the burden of debt, and that where such conditions do not obtain one does not get really good results.  In this case a Parliamentary Secretary is in more or less the experimental stage.  One can only say that during our experience Parliamentary Secretaries have had practically the same hours of work, as, and perhaps on some occasions, even longer hours of work than, Ministers themselves.</P>
      <P>When calculating what salary ought to be paid the persons taking up those positions, one must take into consideration the value received for that work. I am satisfied, from my experience, that we have had good sound value for the work.  I am satisfied, even with the deficit of eighteen and a half millions that the Deputy has mentioned, that it is still an economic proposition to incur this extra expense.  I am not satisfied that a reasonable case has been made for the acceptance of the lower figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister makes his defence on the assumption that there is somebody in the service of the Farmers' Union or some other Union in receipt of a bigger salary than this.  As far as I can gather from his remarks, his whole case turns on that. The highest salary paid to an official of the Farmers' Union&mdash;our General Secretary and Organiser&mdash;is £700, and that salary was fixed in 1918 or 1919, the peak years.  What our policy will be in reconsidering that salary, it is not <Col N="1731" /> for me to say at the moment, without consideration.  That gentleman has been sent to America on the business of the State.  He was described by a Minister as a superman, a man I believe who was not to be found on their own benches.  In my time in the Dáil I have seen very little signs of supermen. There may be supermen amongst the Ministers, but I was unable to see amongst the rank and file any trace of these supermen.  I think them very ordinary individuals, and the general public think them very ordinary individuals, men who are to be met in almost any walk of life, commercial or otherwise. To offer £800 to these young men who are, as Deputy Heffernan said, being placed on the road to still greater things, I think is a very respectable inducement.  Even £800 with income-tax&mdash;I forgot to mention that our Secretary is also subject to income-tax&mdash;is a very fine start for our ambitious and capable young men.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were charged here the other day with eye-wash, a charge that I resent personally, and on behalf of the Party that I represent.  My idea in facing the economic situation, the situation described by the Minister for Finance, was that everybody should lend a hand in tiding over the difficulty, that everybody should accept a cut.  That is a very fine doctrine for everybody except ourselves.  When it comes to ourselves we find a very different outlook.  We find ourselves making a case for ourselves. And our case, when made, is a very bad case in comparison with that which other men in the country can make when the question of a ten per cent. cut is put to them.  The case we can make personally is a very poor case, indeed, in comparison with that of every other class of the community. I think this amendment offers fair remuneration even for the super work required from these supermen.  We do not begrudge men holidays; we do not begrudge them amusement.  But our own officials have not been seen unduly on racecourses or anywhere else. We do not object to anybody else being there, but we do think that £800 is a <Col N="1732" /> fairly decent salary to offer.  It is as much as this State can afford.  Therefore, I support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Deputy who put forward this amendment.  If the President is anxious to get facts and figures with regard to the salaries paid the County Secretaries of Farmers' Unions, I will be very pleased to give him all the facts and figures he requires.  I would be more or less ashamed to state here in the Dáil the actual salaries they receive, and I can say that if the President will base the salaries of his Ministers and of his Parliamentary Secretaries on the salaries of the County Secretaries of the Farmers' Union, we will be perfectly satisfied with the work he is doing in the interest of economy.  He also mentioned the Secretaries of the County Councils.  In that regard, I see more or less eye to eye with him.  I believe the salaries of Parliamentary Secretaries ought at least to be equal to the salaries of Secretaries to County Councils, or, perhaps, somewhat more.  But I am also strongly of opinion that the salaries of the Secretaries of the County Councils are in most cases too high, and should be reduced, as also the salaries of other officers of Local Government Boards throughout the country. I notice that the amendments on the paper dealing with this matter are on an ascending scale.  They start at £600, go up to £800, and from that to £1,200.  I would suggest to the President, before he allows the amendment to be put, that he should do what is commonly done in the farming business &mdash;split the difference and fix the salary between £600 and £1,200.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section (3), line 46, to delete the figures `£1,200' and to substitute therefor &lsquo;£1,000.&rsquo;&rdquo;  I did not vote on the last division because I think the salary would be too low.  At the same time, I was not anxious to endorse the President's arguments, because I knew they would be probably used against me on this amendment.  I shall try and give the Dáil some of the reasons that actuated me in putting down £1,000 instead of £1,200 as a suitable salary for these new secretaries.  The President stated yesterday that the reason he was calling them secretaries was because of the British precedent, and because it was a post that was known.  In fixing their salaries I hold it is not unfair to adopt a British precedent also. The salary of a first-class British Minister, such as is attached to the Colonial Office, would be £5,000, and the Secretary to such a Minister would get £1,500 a year.  The salaries of second-class British Ministers, such as are attached to the Board of Education and the Ministry of Pensions, amount to £2,000, and the Secretary would get £1,200.  We are proposing to pay our Secretaries on the same scale as the British Secretaries are paid in the Board of Education and the Ministry of Pensions and other Ministries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hardly think a case can be made out for that.  There should be some ratio between the salary of the Minister and the salary of the Secretary.  It would obviously be absurd for the Secretary to get more than the Minister.  I venture to think this amendment preserves that ratio in the fairest manner. A British Minister gets £2,000; our Minister gets £1,700.  Where a British Secretary gets £1,200, our Secretary <Col N="1735" /> should get £1,000.  I suggest, as our Ministers get £300 less than British Ministers, so our Secretaries should get £200 less than the British Secretaries. In that case we preserve the ratio and make a smaller cut in the smaller salary.  That is a reasonable contention.</P>
    <P>The President will, no doubt, tell me what the total amount will be when he has deducted the salary of the Deputy, together with income-tax, etc.  I would like to point out that by being appointed a Secretary, a Deputy will gain certain advantages.  Some of his duties as a Deputy will not be quite so arduous as before.  He will not be expected to put down questions, and unless questions are addressed to his Department he need not be in his place in the Dáil during question time.  He will have facilities, if his correspondence is rather heavy, because he will presumably be given a Secretary from the Civil Service who will help him to deal with his correspondence.  There are those advantages to be set off against the £360. It is suggested that he will also get a certain amount of free postage.  I do not know about that, but it has been suggested that Ministers get free postage for their correspondence.  I can hardly believe it, but yet it is suggested. I am not going to make that a definite charge.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, however, is that the Secretary will have his foot on the ladder of promotion.  A Secretary of a County Council can never become anything more, but a Parliamentary Secretary, who performs his duty efficiently, and pleases the Dáil with his advocacy, has a very good chance of becoming a Minister.  He is not in a blind alley, and therefore I think £1,000 is a reasonable salary.  It is not an enormous amount, I agree, but it is an amount consistent with our means, and it is also sufficient to keep up such dignity as the position of Secretary possesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me what is the difference between this salary and what he would receive as a Minister.  It would depend whether the man is married or single.  If you take a single man, the net salary he <Col N="1736" /> would receive, if the proposal was passed, would be £387.  That would be in addition to his £360.  I do not know whether the Deputy has carefully examined the clause as amended.  In any case the words &ldquo;an annual sum not exceeding a sum of £1,200,&rdquo; do not give any undertaking that in the case of any appointment there would not be a recommendation for less than £1,200.  As the Deputy says, there is always an opportunity of having those appointments criticised, and it would be better, I think, that it would be left at £1,200, because as the work decreases&mdash;and we hope it will&mdash;there will not be the same need for appointments of Parliamentary Secretaries, or, perhaps, for the appointment of them, at such salaries.  I do say, from our experience of the last twelve to eighteen months, that it is not a fair comparison to put these Parliamentary Secretaries along side Parliamentary Secretaries to British Ministers.  I do not think there is any comparison with the British Cabinet so far as the hours of work are concerned.  It may have been a fair comparison during the war.  I read on one occasion where a member of the British Cabinet complained they had been working 14 to 16 hours a day. During normal times it is not likely such hours of service would have to be given.  It may be so for some years to come, but I think, in the exceptional circumstances of the times, the suggested salary is scarcely a fair salary. Parliamentary Secretaries have not got the same opportunities as Ministers. Even though there is an apprenticeship in an appointment such as this, there is not the same opportunity as Ministers have of making a name or, perhaps, of losing it.  It is a case in which a man cuts himself away from his profession or his business without the notoriety of doing it, and perhaps with a good deal of criticism for doing it.  The impression sometimes circulated about a person like that is that it is a soft job.  I think those Deputies who have come in contact with men doing that work are satisfied that good services have been rendered.  I think, in view of the circumstances, the Deputy should not press his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not entirely convinced by the President's argument.  In practice the maximum salary nearly always stands to be the normal salary.  Where it is laid down that it shall not exceed a certain amount, there is always strong pressure brought to bear that it shall be that amount.  Once posts are established, and once people draw salaries from those posts, it is very hard to make a reduction.  I do not know whether those Secretaries will be acknowledged as Ministers within the Constitution, so that no reduction will be made in their salaries.  Even if they are not given that protection, it would be a painful and unpleasant thing to come here and propose a reduction of the salary of an individual you know, and very possibly like.  Nothing is easier than to increase a salary.  When we are starting let us get on sound lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is found impossible to get men for the post at £1,000, I am quite certain the Dáil would give its confidence to the President if he said the salary <Col N="1738" /> must be £1,200.  I think £1,000 is quite enough, in the circumstances of the time, and in view of the fact that these men will not have served a long political apprenticeship.

    <P>The object of the amendment is to make clearer the powers and duties of those Parliamentary Secretaries.  I think we have it clear now that they <Col N="1742" /> are really, if not so called, Assistant Ministers, and the amendment seeks to make it quite clear that they are to assist the Minister.  The sub-section, as it stands, speaks of the delegation of powers, but I think these are rather inadvisable terms to use in this connection. It would rather take from, or might possibly take from, the responsibility of the Minister to this Dáil.  I think the position is that even though Parliamentary Secretaries are employed, the Minister, and the Minister alone, is primarily responsible, and it is that I desire to be made clear by the amendment.</P>

I do not quite know whether the provision that they are to give assistance to the Ministers has any relation to the figure at which their salary is placed.  I am afraid that the phrasing of the amendment as proposed is not clear enough; but it does occur to me that sub-section (4), in view of the amendments carried, will require some consideration, and I think it might be well reconsidered before the Report stage in connection especially with the two paragraphs inserted on the motion of Deputy Johnson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 1, to delete this section. We have in various parts of the Bill been discussing matters of very great administrative importance.  I take this to be a matter of quite a different character altogether.  This raises not merely a matter that is important from an administrative point of view, but is important respecting a fundamental principle concerning the future conduct of this State.  We are, in this Bill, making provision, presumably, for the administration of a civil body, and of a civil Executive responsible to this Dáil, and quite gratuitously there has been introduced into this Bill a semi-responsible military body which is described as a Council of Defence.  This Bill is entitled &ldquo;The Ministers and Secretaries Bill.&rdquo;  The Attorney-General indicates that perhaps at a later stage it might be called &ldquo;The Ministers, Secretaries and Attorney-General Bill.&rdquo;  All those various persons designated in that title are civil authorities responsible to this Dáil. Here we have introduced the principle of persons who shall constitute a military tribunal not responsible to this Dáil.  No one military person is really responsible to this Dáil at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to certain words in particular that fall under Sub-section 6, where it reads, that &ldquo;The Council of Defence shall meet and act as a collective body, and shall be collectively responsible for all matters entrusted to it in its collective capacity, whether by any act of the Oireachtas or otherwise.&rdquo;  These are very extraordinary <Col N="1745" /> words.  We have the words &ldquo;collectively responsible.&rdquo;  I ask, collectively responsible to whom?  They cannot be collectively responsible to this Dáil, because this Dáil has no knowledge of any military person at all.  It has only knowledge of a Minister for Defence who shall not be a military person.  To whom, then, is this Military Council to be collectively responsible?  I suggest that the answer is a very obvious one, and not a pleasant one, and that is that the collective responsibility of the Council of Defence will be a collective responsibility to the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence and myself have participated, from different points of view, in a movement that resulted in the establishment of the Free State, and he knows, and I know, that at an earlier stage when the Army, as the Irish Republican Army, was first established, that it was then placed under Dáil Eireann in the year 1919.  Prior to that the movement had been known as the Irish Volunteers.  The Minister for Defence knows, and I know, that the Irish Volunteers met in a special deliberative convention to decide whether it would permit itself to be placed under civil authority or not, and the decision taken was that it should be placed under that authority, under a Military Council, and a Military Council, did, in fact, for a long number of years exercise powers that were, under the circumstances, inevitable; but unfortunately this Military Council was not so completely under the Civil Authority as it might have been, and I fear that there is a tendency in this Section to create a Military Council of Defence that is intended to act as a corporate and as a collective body.  Collectively responsible, as this Bill says, is collectively responsible not primarily to this Dáil or to the Oireachtas, but to the Army, and that is a very serious state of affairs.  In any case there are the words &ldquo;collective responsibility.&rdquo;  It cannot be said that the Council of Defence are collectively responsible to this Dáil, because the only person whom the Dáil recognises in any military authority or responsibility whatever, is not a body comprised of persons, most of whom are not members of the Dáil, but of one <Col N="1746" /> person only, and that is the Minister for Defence, who, in order to become a member of this Dáil is no longer to be a military person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the words by which he is so placed in that position in this Section are in conflict with the words &ldquo;collectively responsible.&rdquo; That is the point I want to make.  One part of the Section states that the Minister for Defence shall be responsible to this Dáil; another part of the Section states that a Council of Defence shall be created of which he is only Chairman, and that the Council of Defence shall act as a single collegiate body.  That leads to the next point that I wish to deal with, which is in Sub-section 2.  It says that the Council of Defence shall consist of certain persons, chief of whom is the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a remarkable fact with regard to this sub-section 2.  As Chairman of the Council of Defence he is no more the Minister for Defence.  He becomes there the Commander-in-Chief. He shall be styled Commander-in-Chief. That is not only an undesirable provision in itself, and a very dangerous provision in itself, but it is actually contrary to the law of this country.  I have in my hand the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act (No. 30) of 1923.  Part I, Chapter I, Section 5, states &ldquo;the command-in-chief of and all executive and administrative powers in relation to the Forces (including the power to delegate authority to such persons as may be thought fit) shall be vested in the Executive Council.&rdquo; That is part of the permanent provisions of this Act, but, lest there should be any confusion, the very phrase is repeated in the temporary provisions of this Act, in Part IV, where it says &ldquo;the command-in-chief of and all executive and administrative powers in relation to the national forces&rdquo; I exclude the parenthesis&mdash;&ldquo;shall be vested in the Executive Council, and exercised through it, in the name of the Minister.&rdquo;  In other words, the law of this State has laid it down, quite clearly and quite firmly, that the Commander-in-Chief <Col N="1747" /> is not a person, but is the entire Executive Council.  That is a safe and right and necessary provision. It has a parallel in the provision in the United States' Constitution, by which the Chief Executive, who is the President, by reason of being Chief Executive of the State, is <i>ipso facto</i> the Commander-in-Chief of the United States army.  In Ireland, the Chief Executive is held, in fact, in the Executive Council. The provision that I have just read from the Defence Forces Act states that the Executive Council, who have executive authority in the Free State, acting as a body, is the Commander-in-Chief. But here it states that the Council of Defence shall consist of, amongst others, the Minister for Defence, who, under the style of Commander-in-Chief, shall be Chairman of the Council of Defence.  In the Dáil we know him as a member of the Executive Council; we know him as a member of the highest responsible authority in this State, in which is vested the Commander-in-Chief of the army, but when he removes himself from here and becomes part of the Council of Defence, which is the Army Council in a new guise, he becomes a military person, though we knew him here in a non-military capacity.  We knew him here as a Minister amongst other Ministers, but there he becomes Commander-in-Chief of the army.  I say that that is a very dangerous provision to adopt.  I do not know that any country would consent to a provision of this kind.  In other countries the practice is, as members of this Dáil are very well aware, that there is no Commander-in-Chief, as such, of the army.  There may be a Commander-in-Chief appointed in charge of an expeditionary Force; there may be a Commander-in-Chief appointed for an army in a certain location, but there is no Commander-in-chief of the entire army. That is the prerogative of Parliament as it should be and was intended to be.  I know that nominally the title is held by the king, but in the various Acts that have been passed (Mutiny and Army Acts) it has been laid down as a principle that the actual command should vest in the authority that issues the money by which that Force is maintained, <Col N="1748" /> and the real Commander-in-Chief is the Chief Civil Authority. Therefore, when those words were adopted in our Army Act we were glad that they were adopted.  Now they are to be departed from, and I say that if these provisions, standing as they are, are to be adopted, we are taking in a very dangerous principle into this State, a thing that strikes at the fundamental principle of Statehood, which is that the civil authority shall be supreme.  I do not see, in any case, why military matters of this kind should come into a Bill of this nature, which is a purely civil Bill.  Apart altogether from that, if provisions are to be adopted, they should be of a kind not like the provisions in this section; they should insist that the Minister for Defence is purely Minister for Defence, and that all persons acting under his authority should act separately under his authority as Minister for Defence without admitting the dangerous principle that is embodied in this section.  I move that this section be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat the arguments of Deputy Figgis, which follows very much the lines I had intended to elaborate if I had moved this motion.  I would like the Minister for Defence, or the Attorney-General, to inform us whether the army has been established under Section 22 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, and whether, the date has been fixed by proclamation.  The necessity for this Section is not understood by me.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to insert in this Bill a provision respecting the Ministry of Defence, which has not been found necessary respecting other Ministries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no suggestion, for instance, of appointing a Council to assist the Minister for Fisheries or the Minister for Home Affairs.  Nevertheless, each of those Ministers has, within his authority, the right and power to delegate certain responsibilities to persons in the control <Col N="1749" /> of his Department.  In the Defence Forces Act it is laid down that the Minister may delegate authority to such persons as may be thought fit or that the Minister and Executive Council together may do so, but that the Minister shall not allocate to himself any Executive military command.  All the requirements of the case regarding a Council to assist the Minister in the technical work of the Ministry of Defence are already embodied in an Act of the Oireachtas.  It seems to me that the introduction of this Section has the effect of placing the Minister for Defence in a different category from Ministers having charge of other Departments. I agree with Deputy Figgis that the effect of the section is to distribute responsibility, notwithstanding the statement in Section 1, that there shall be no derogation from the Minister's responsibility.  The very fact that we are, by Statute, asked to appoint a Council of Defence to assist the Minister, imposes upon the Council certain authority, as distinct from the responsibility of the Minister.  The fact that there is appointed by Statute a Council to assist the Minister, and that the Council is, in part, named beforehand, imposes upon the Council a responsibility direct to the Dáil, thereby relieving the Minister of some of his responsibility. A Council of Defence, which may be necessary, can be appointed under the present law by the Minister and Executive Council.  If the Bill which is before us passes into law, a Parliamentary Secretary may be appointed. But Sub-section 2 of this Section insists that there shall be a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, rather suggesting that it is contemplated in the future that the Ministry of Defence is going to be a very much more important body than one would hope the future of the country would require.  Surely, we are not contemplating permanent Defence Forces of such a character as would require not only a Minister but a Parliamentary Secretary.  The arguments that have been used in favour of the appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries may be strong in respect of Finance, Justice, Home Affairs, Industry and Commerce and Agriculture, <Col N="1750" /> because one can imagine that, as the development of the country proceeds, these Departments will have more and more to do.  But if that development, industrially and agriculturally, proceeds in the manner we would like, one would hope that the Department of Defence would have very little to do except keep in being the skeleton of a Defence Force.</P>
      <P>We are asked to lay down as a necessity that not only shall the Minister for Defence be a member of the Oireachtas but that he shall appoint a Parliamentary Secretary and that, by law, there shall be established a Council of Defence to assist this Department. One would imagine that it is contemplated that this Department is going to be the biggest and most important of the whole Ministry.  I hope that is not the expectation of any Deputy here.  There is no necessity, o far as I can see, why the Department of Defence should be singled out for special consideration in this Bill.  The Dáil places the responsibility upon the Minister and he has power, under present enactments, to organise his Department in such manner as he may think well.  That, I think, should be sufficient.  He is in exactly the same position as any other Minister in that respect.  I think the inclusion of this Section in the Bill is unnecessary. Therefore, I support the motion to delete the Section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying, at this stage, that I will both vote for and use every effort to support the amendment Deputy Figgis has moved to delete this Section entirely. It seems to me that it would be rather a calamity if this Section were to go through in its present form.  I have never taken part in any military operation and, therefore, I am not qualified to speak technically on the subject&mdash;unless, perhaps, a little difference of opinion now and again with some of my friends on the Labour benches might be regarded as a military operation.  This whole clause visualises a state of affairs which I, for one, hope none of the Deputies here looks forward to.  It places an importance <Col N="1751" /> on military organisation which a small agricultural, and I hope peace-loving, country will not consider necessary.  Deputy Johnson has said that he hopes&mdash;and I also hope&mdash;that in the future the skeleton or nucleus of a Defence Force will be sufficient for all the military needs of this country. We are all approaching a frame of mind when we can look on that state of affairs as likely to arise.  Under the circumstances, to introduce a clause in connection with the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, such as we have before us, seems to me a very retrograde step in the affairs of State.  The Commander-in-Chief, as Deputy Figgis has pointed out, is not a recognised appointment. I think I may accept that as being correct.  A Military Council, surely, is not necessary under those conditions.  To elaborate all these clauses in connection with the matter seems to me to be entirely unnecessary. Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I propose to vote in favour of Deputy Figgis's motion, and if it be lost to vote on the same lines in connection with every other amendment.</P>

      <P>May I say first with regard to the point raised regarding Sub-section 6, where it is stated that the Council of Defence shall be collectively responsible, the purpose is, and it can be amended, that they shall be collectively responsible to the Minister for Defence for all matters entrusted to them.  From the point of view of his position in the Executive Council, and his responsibility to it, and through the Council to the Dáil, the Minister for Defence does not stand in any different position to any other Minister.  With regard to the Army and its position, and what people who have never touched the Army want to make of it in this country, there is nothing in that but troubled imaginings. Deputy Figgis speaks of the old days, when you had an army that more or less met and asked whether they were going to be subject to the civil power or not.  One of the outstanding points with regard to that trouble was that there was a time when the elected representatives of the people did not <Col N="1752" /> think it advisable to accept responsibility for the Army or for the Army's doings.  In spite of that political position here there was maintained a perfect understanding and a perfect trust as between the Army of that time and the Dáil. And when the political situation was such that the Dáil could see its way to take responsibility for the Army and its doings, it was the Dáil acted, and it was not the Army.  With regard to the Ministry of Defence, there is no proposal to put the Minister under this scheme in a different category to any other Minister, as is suggested.  But the Ministry of Defence, in that it provides and keeps in readiness the military arm of the State, is in a very different position from any other Minister. There is no other Department of the State that may find itself called on in the same manner as the Ministry of Defence in a time of national emergency. When we realise that the State provides a Ministry of Defence in order to be able to organise its forces and to be able to defend the interests of the State, that does not mean to say that as a people or as a State we are out looking for war.  We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that we have been the victims of war in this country, and that the people who lie on every side of us have been the victims of war, and that war in one country has reacted willy-nilly on the peoples of other countries.  It is to be prepared for national emergencies, when your defence forces are called into action, that you have a Ministry of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out on the Second Reading that the holders of particular Army positions who, it is suggested, shall form members of this Council of Defence, are heads of administrative Departments.  As far as the Military members of the proposed Defence Council are concerned, they administer Departments that run peculiarly into one another.  As I have suggested, these heads of Departments would, in time of national emergency, become the Staff of the Executive Commander-in-Chief in the field.  In envisaging the problems that would face this country in time of war, personally, I think it would be inadvisable for the Dáil to <Col N="1753" /> accept a position by which the Executive Council would simply nominate the Minister for Defence, and would not give any idea as to how that Minister ought to look for the highest possible counsel in preparing the policy, plans, and supervising in a matter of policy the technical plans that must be prepared if you are going to be in a state of preparedness in any national emergency.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is giving to the Army a particular position outside and away from the authority of this Dáil.  It is, on the contrary, indicating that the Minister will have about him a Council of Defence consisting of persons who have administrative duties of a particular type, but who, for those particular duties, are from time to time the selection of the Executive Council.  They have selected for these positions, on the advice of the Minister for Defence, the particular officers who hold those positions, and, therefore, they are much more closely in touch and control the direction from which the Minister for Defence gets his counsel, advice and assistance.  It is necessary in the settling of the policy of defence that a number of minds connected with the technical side shall get their proper base, or at any rate shall get their proper arena for the exchange and formulating of views, and it is most advisable that they will be brought together in a statutory rather than in a non-statutory way.  It is absurd to say that this Council of Defence suggested is a military tribunal not responsible to the Dáil, and it is absurd to say that this is dragging into what is a civil matter a military body.  The functions of the Defence Department are more technical in a way than the functions of the other Departments of the State can be regarded.</P>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Johnson, the Defence Forces, under Paragraph 22, have not yet been called into being by the Proclamation that is contemplated there, for the simple reason that in the reorganisation and settling of our army machinery, we are not in the position that we would like to be in before we call the Defence Forces into being.  We are at <Col N="1754" /> present working under the latter section of the Defence Forces Act.  With regard to the title of Commander-in-Chief, I have already stated that is vesting, in what is considered the most suitable member of the Executive Council, the title which corresponds to the fact that the Commander-in-Chief of the Army is vested in the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill, I took exception to the inclusion of this Section and I did so mainly upon two grounds.  In the first place I said that it pre-supposed the setting up of a Standing Army in this country, and that, to my mind, was a question which should have very serious and weighty consideration before it was decided upon.  In the second place, I objected to the various proposals included in this Section because I understood, and still understand, them to be unconstitutional.  Almost a week after I gave expression to my views in the Dáil, the Attorney-General made a vigorous&mdash;I do not think I would quite style it a virile&mdash;reply to my observations. His reply was composed, for the most part, of sneering personalities regarding my own knowledge and the source from which it was derived.  I do not know whether this method of argument in the Dáil is worthy of a King's Counsel and the leader of the Irish Bar; but I do know that as a junior member of the Bar I do not consider it worthy of reply.  Suffice it for me to say that as it is common knowledge that the Attorney-General favours a change in the robes of Barristers, it would now seem apparent that he is also in favour of a change in their manners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would say to the Attorney-General is, that when he has been as many months in public life as I have been years, he will come to know the true value of personalities.  As far as I am concerned in this case, they leave me cold; but after five days of, I presume, incessant labour, the mountain hath brought forth a mouse.  What is this mouse?  A contradiction of a statement of fact.  In spite of the Attorney-General's gibes about my humble knowledge <Col N="1755" /> of constitutional law, he does not answer my constitutional point.  I stated, as a matter of fact, that in my opinion the Commander-in-Chief of the Army of this country was the king. But that was only incidental to my argument that there was no necessity for the setting up of such an office, and that a person in that position, and at the same time occupying the position of Minister of the Department which controls that office, was in an unconstitutional position.  Let us examine the Attorney's-General contradiction and his authorities for it.  He is very fond of shying text-books around the Dáil, but I had occasion to look up a well-known text-book known as &ldquo;The Laws of England,&rdquo; by Lord Halsbury; and I find on page 418 almost exactly word for word the speech of the Attorney-General. It is there stated that the Executive command was delegated-mark the word delegated-to a Commander-in-Chief, who advised the Secretary of State upon all military matters, the latter&mdash;that is the Secretary of State&mdash;remaining responsible to Parliament and the Crown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Capt. REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I possibly can, but I feel I am bound to reply to the Attorney-General upon this point.  The Attorney-General contradicted my statement that the King was Commander-in-Chief.  He said that previous English Kings were Commanders-in-Chief, but the office had been delegated to an officer, and that in the year 1904 that office had been abolished; at the time, I believe, it was held by Earl Roberts.  Nobody denies that that office was abolished, and if the office was abolished what I say is that it reverted to the Sovereign and is provided in our Constitution to-day in Article 51 where it is stated that the Executive Authority of the Saorstát is vested in the King and where <Col N="1758" /> it is expressly laid down to that effect I maintain that the supreme command of the Army in the Saorstát to-day is also vested in the King.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the Second Reading I mentioned the fact that if there was an army at all it was the King's army, and that fact was not contradicted. I still say it is the King's army, just as much as the Attorney-General is the King's Counsel, and just as much as the President and other members of the Executive are the King's Ministers.  Now this may seem to some Deputies as beside the point, but it is not, and for this reason, that according to our own Act&mdash;an Act passed by the Oireachtas, namely, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 (Part 1, Section IV.), actually bears out the position that I have outlined.  It is stated in this Section that it shall be lawful for the Executive Council to raise and maintain an arme force consisting of such number of officers, and it goes on, in Section V., to state: &ldquo;The Commander-in-Chief and all the executive and administrative powers shall be vested in the Executive Council.&rdquo;  According to Article 51 of the Constitution, the Executive Council is a Council consisting of a President and other members to aid and advise the King in the government of this country, and therefore I come back again to my original proposition that the Commander-in-Chief of the Army is vested in the King. When I say vested in the King I say that not in any derogatory sense, because I am as proud to have borne the King's Commission as, I am sure, the Attorney-General is proud to be the holder of the King's warrant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Attorney-General and the Government to give one instance where the Commander-in-Chief or even an officer with a lower designation is also a Minister and head of a Department which controls the Army anywhere throughout the British Empire&mdash;I might even say the world.  When Earl Roberts was Commander-in-Chief, was he the Minister <Col N="1759" /> in the British House of Commons responsible for the Army?  Was he the Minister for War in the British Government? Nothing of the kind.  I suppose it is because it was not the case elsewhere that we are anxious to make it so here.</P>
      <P>This Section, to my mind, is the most, if not the only, obnoxious Section in the whole Bill.  It proposes virtually to set up a Council of Defence responsible to a gentleman who shall be styled Commander-in-Chief&mdash;a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde arrangement&mdash;a person who may be Commander-in-Chief one moment outside, and Minister for Defence the next moment inside the Dáil.  Such a proposal, I say, would not, and never has been, tolerated in any of the Dominions of the King.  And there has been no reason put forward so far for this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it that the civil authorities in this country are not to be the masters?  Is it that the army, if there is an army, or if there is to be a standing army, is not to be placed permanently under the supervision and control of the civil and not the military authorities?  If that is so, what other reasons govern the course which has been taken.  I hope, and we all hope, that very shortly we will be able to diminish the army.  If possible it would be well if we could adopt the Canadian system, as we have in so many other respects adopted it, namely, have a force of militia or territorials, and not a standing army at all. I say that the bringing in of this proposal in this measure is a very sinister way of enabling the military of to-day to lay the flattering unction to their souls that they will be rulers both of to-day and of to-morrow.  I think that it is a bad precedent, therefore, for the future civil government and control of this country, and in making these few remarks I want it to be understood that they are in no way derogatory to the army, because the principle that I am in favour of having applied to our army in Ireland is equally applied to the British army in England, and to every other force throughout the King's Dominions.  I believe that if this Section were dropped, and if this, I might almost call it, military policy were not persisted in, that it would give great <Col N="1760" /> reassurance and great confidence to the civilian population of this country and show them that the Government are determined that it is to be a civilian and not a military regime which shall rule the future of this land.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to address myself to the question of the Commander-in-Chief.  I have an amendment on the subject later on, on the paper, and it was my personal feeling that you, A Chinn Chomhairle, should have ruled both Deputy Figgis and Deputy Redmond out of order for skimming all the cream off my milk.  There was one passage in the speech of the Minister for Defence which caused me to feel considerable apprehension, and that was when he said that the head of the Department of the Ministry of Defence would be head of the Army Council, and in time of war would be Commander-in-Chief in the field.  I hope that is not the considered policy of the Minister for Defence or of the Executive Council.  It suggests what happened to the British in 1914.  They had no adequate arrangements, no efficient general staff, and no experienced Adjutant-General when they muddled into the Dardanelles.  The whole thing was muddled.  Artillery were converted into cavalry, and cavalry were transferred to the infantry. It was exactly the same in the Quartermaster-General's Department; everything was in a state of confusion. Is that the policy to be adopted here? The Minister for Defence is to sit here and be responsible to the Dáil or a Parliamentary Secretary acting for him, and the three military members of the Council of Defence are to take the field.  I thought that reference in the Minister's speech was merely an <i>obiter dictum</i> and not an indication of his considered policy, and I do hope that he will give a little further consideration to this matter in the light of experience elsewhere and by the light of such experience will alter his present attitude.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Redmond is in the House it will not be five days before he hears any observations that I have to make with reference to his remarks.  I regret that comments upon the admitted sources of <Col N="1761" /> argument should be considered by Deputy Redmond as personalities.  The matter he put forward here on the second reading of this Bill was in his own words gleaned from what he called his little experience in the British Army.  If the complaint that that experience had not been sufficiently educative is to be regarded as personality or to be called personality then I must plead guilty to personalities, but I think it is quite legitimate and far from impertinence to state that even experience, whether it be on the battle-field or in barrack, may not be quite as informing or educative as other sources of information which are available to the soldier as well as to the civilian and more particularly when that civilian purports also to have a legal training which should place at his command a certain volume of knowledge which he might not have otherwise so easily accessible during the time, that he referred to himself, as his little military experience.</P>
      <P>Now I take it that the patriotic speech that we heard from Deputy Redmond will be recognised as his last patriotic speech has been, as material upon which certain broad-sheets built up their futile polemics.

      <P>Deputy Redmond says this provision for the Council of Defence presupposes a Standing Army.  I say nothing but ignorance could produce such a statement. <Col N="1762" /> In several of the Dominions where there are not standing armies, there are Councils of Defence, existing by Statute, even in Dominions where the minimum army establishment is maintained, where the militia and territorial system that one has heard advocated, is the system that is established&mdash;even in those Dominions provisions are made for an Army Council for the administration of matters connected with the Army and the Department of Defence. There is.  I understand, a learned work called &ldquo;Halsbury's Laws of England.&rdquo; I do not think you will find-and I should not have sought there-material appropriate to a discussion upon the Constitutional status of a Council of Defence, whether in this country or in the various Dominions.</P>

Perhaps another piece of enlightenment, if only a reminder to Deputy Redmond, is this, that the office of Secretary of State for War in England&mdash;I mention this by way of correction&mdash;was actually held, I think in Deputy Redmond's recollection, by a soldier&mdash;the late Lord Kitchener.</P>

      <P>This provision of the Bill is simply for the organisation of the civil administrative side of the army.  When the question of responsibility is raised, sight is lost of the preliminary clause in the Section, which provides for the establishment of this Council, without derogating from the responsibility of the Minister for Defence to the Executive Council and to the Oireachtas&mdash;which, as a matter of fact, I think should read &ldquo;to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any suggestive gap between that and Sub-section 6, the matter can be very easily set right.  I am sure no one on these Benches will object if, after the word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in the second line of Sub-section 6, the words &ldquo;to the Minister for Defence&rdquo; be introduced.  It is the clear sense of the clause.  It is the clear intention and meaning.  Notwithstanding the sinister recollections and dire fears of Deputy Figgis, there is no question as to where the responsibility of this Council lies, and to whom.  This Council of Defence, which has attracted to it a certain amount of perhaps unusual feeling, is really a very simple matter. In all the other Departments which we have taken over you have an organised Civil Service, Departments organised to a large extent on a statutory basis.  We are now creating, for the first time, and organising for the first time, a Department of Defence.  It has been found in many countries a useful and important thing to have a Council of Defence consisting of the heads of the main sections of the military arm, associated with civilians, as is proposed here; and it does surprise one that the association of the military organisation with those who are responsible in civil capacities calls forth an attack which rather indicates apprehension of some form of militarism, when, in point of fact, the obvious intention and purport of these <Col N="1764" /> provisions is quite the opposite.  The matter, Sir, is a simple one.  It comes here naturally when the Department is for the first time being organised.  It makes clear the responsibility and it sets up a check on finance in the person of a civil member.  In that connection, I may perhaps be permitted to call attention to the fact that there is an amendment upon the Paper which makes it not necessary to have as a permanent institution a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence.</P>

I say that the pity of it is that it was deliberately mischief-making, and that it is not certainly in the interests of himself or his late Party or his late friends or any friends of this country that a statement like that should have been made here.  It is no thanks whatever to the Deputy that after a hard struggle we made friends with our late enemy in this country.  In the making of that friendship there was a good deal of give and take on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps at a particular time it was not with good-will that there was give and take on both sides.  But in view of the Constitution passed here by the late Dáil and the rights that are guaranteed to the people of this country, by reason of that Constitution, I think it is not in the power of any genius&mdash;lawyer or otherwise&mdash;to indict the Ministry of this country, the people of this country, or the army of this country, with any derogation of status or any giving up of the rights and the privileges of a free people. The very first Article of the Constitution placed beyond all doubt what our position is, and the second Article secures and places beyond any question of doubt the rights and privileges and freedom of the people of this country. I say that it was with the purpose of <Col N="1765" /> deliberately misleading the people of this country and of giving the enemies of peace in this country an opportunity for attacking the Oireachtas, that the statement was made by Deputy Redmond this evening.  Every single syllable of every agreement that we made with the British I will carry out in the spirit and the letter; but I will not accept from any person the insult that we have given away anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must interrupt the President.  By way of personal explanation, will you allow me to say that I never ventured to suggest an insult to him or his Ministry, or even this country, by the insinuation that we had given away anything.  What he has got now is what I always wanted&mdash; Dominion self-government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated during the course of the Deputy's speech on two occasions that the people's representatives had appointed a Commander-in-Chief. Had they the right to do it? The Deputy says we had not&mdash;that the right was vested in somebody else. Why does the Deputy state that?  Because he thinks it is going to insult us, because he thinks it will give joy to the people who have tried to wreck this country.  We have a right to appoint a Commander-in-Chief.  We have asserted that right.  That right has not been disputed, and we are going to maintain it.  We have asserted the right of the people over any army officers.  It has been accepted by the army officers.  We are going to maintain it.  We may be wrong in the manner in which we set up the machine to exercise that authority, but we have done it to the best of our judgment, and having regard to our experience. From our experience, also, the machinery that we set up here is machinery to see that there will be civil control over the army.  I do not know that there is any officer of the army worthy to wear the uniform he is wearing who will dispute that right of the representatives of the people to control the army and control every service there is in the country.</P>

He accused me of mischief-making in regard to the statements I made concerning the status of Commander-in-Chief. I am afraid that I will not be able to disabuse his mind in that direction if he has already so made it up.  I can only assure both him and the House that it was the last thing that occurred to me. But what I wanted to show, and what, I think, I have shown, is that according to our Constitution&mdash;a Constitution which I thoroughly admire and which I whole-heartedly support&mdash;the Command-in-Chief of any Forces in this country is vested in the King.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's point, which I have been endeavouring to grasp since he first spoke, is that the provision in Sub-section 2 of Section 8, which mentions the Minister for Defence under the style of Commander-in-Chief, contravenes the Constitution.  Is that the exact contention?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>Well, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, which was passed on the 3rd August, 1923, and which is valid now and until the 3rd August, 1924, states (Section 5):</P>
      <P>The Command-in-Chief of and all Executive and Administrative powers in relation to the Forces, including the power to delegate authority to such person as may be thought fit, shall be vested in the Executive Council&mdash;</P>
      <P>I would draw attention to the word &ldquo;vested&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and exercised through and in the <Col N="1767" /> name of the Minister, who shall not, however, allocate to himself any Executive Military Command and who may not be a member of the Forces on full pay.</P>
    <P>Under Part 4 of the Act, Section 236, it is set out:</P>
    <P>The Command-in-Chief of and all Executive and Administrative powers in relation to the National Forces (including the power to delegate authority to such persons as may be thought fit) shall be vested in the Executive Council and exercised through and in the name of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Here in the Dáil we are bound by the Acts of the Oireachtas.  When a matter has been settled by Statute it cannot be questioned.  If a point is made that something which has been passed in an Act of the Oireachtas contravenes the Constitution that point must be made before the Court which the Constitution, in Article 65, provides for the purpose of deciding upon the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  It would not be for me to decide whether a particular matter was in order on a question being raised that it contravened the Constitution.  In this case, we have actually a Statute which states that the Command-in-Chief is vested in the Executive Council.  That, I think, prevents the Deputy from making the point that it is not vested in the Executive Council, and if his point is that the Constitution is contrary to the Act, then that point must be brought elsewhere; it cannot be pleaded here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to say that before you, Sir, came in, I actually quoted Section 5 of this Act, and I never suggested that the Command-in-Chief was not vested in the Executive Council.  On the contrary, I say it is, of course, according to this Act.</P>

As far as the Constitution is concerned, which the President referred to, I am a complete subscriber to that Constitution.  I believe it is, perhaps, the widest Constitution any country could desire, and as one who never advocated anything but a large measure of Dominion Self-Government, such as we are now enjoying, I think I am entitled at any rate to say&mdash;as one who never was a Republican, but was always in favour of the present Constitution, which we are now enjoying&mdash;that nothing I said was in any way derogatory to that Constitution.

      <P>I am doing my best. Let me say, with all due respect, that there is hardly a sentence I have uttered that has not been broken into before I was half way through, and it is impossible to address oneself coherently to the Assembly in a matter of this sort if such continuous interruptions are allowed.  If the point I wish to make is not relevant to the discussion, I will not press it.  It is this: There were 800 national soldiers who applied to be registered as voters in Derry City, and the tribunal before whom they appeared decided against the application, on the ground that they were not soldiers of the King's army.  I leave it at that, and I come now to the Deputy who was apprehensive that I was going to ignore him while I was devoting all my attention to Deputy Redmond.  I believe the Deputy who proposes the amendment to delete this Section is Deputy Darrell Figgis.  To delete this Section is practically a proposal to delete the army. There are many people in this country who would, I am sure, be glad to delete the army.  There was a time when they would have been very reluctant to have <Col N="1772" /> had the army deleted, and there may come a time when they will betray a similar reluctance.  For instance, supposing there was an attack upon that hirsute appendage of which Deputy Figgis is so proud&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, allow me to say that Section 1, which has been passed, definitely agrees to the setting up of a Department of Defence, and a question of the elimination of this Section, a proposal for which I am partly responsible, does not at all attempt to go back upon Sub-section X. of Section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the object of this Section, towards which this amendment is directed, is to create some kind of effective head of the Army which will give effective direction to the policy of the State's military arm.  I should have prefaced my remarks with this: I take it one of the objections to the Section is the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Council of Defence. That seems to me to give the Dáil added control over the army.  In previous debates I have heard it urged it was quite the reverse.  If certain proposals were put forward by the military members of this Council of Defence, a Parliamentary Secretary attending could decline to agree with them and say that he would have to put the matter before the Dáil before assent could be given to them.  I do not know what precisely will be gained by the deletion of this Section, or what precisely is the objective of those who support the amendment, unless it be to prevent the State securing an effective military force, coherent in its control and its guidance.  I will not raise the matter in reference to which your ruling was given.  I regret your ruling has been such, because certain arguments have been put forward which your ruling prevents any attempts to rebut.  I do not intend to contravene that ruling.</P>
      <P>The arguments I have heard in support of this amendment have not in any way convinced me that anything would be gained by the acceptance of it; possibly very much danger would ensue to the State by its acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I <Col N="1773" /> first raised this amendment, we have certainly travelled a very long way. Permit me to express my regret that it should have travelled a good deal of the ground that has been travelled.  I do not touch upon that now.  I come back to where I was when I raised the proposal that this Section should be deleted.  Deputy Milroy says he fails to understand what purpose will be achieved if this deletion be carried. Supposing Section 8 of this Bill does not form part of this Bill, what happens? The army remains the army. The Minister for Defence remains the Minister for Defence.  The Ministry of Defence remains the Ministry of Defence. And that Minister in his Ministry may to-morrow, if he so wishes, for his better guidance, create a Council of Defence, without anybody to say him nay.  It has been said that a Council of Defence has not been brought into a Bill styled a Ministerial Bill and so given semi-ministerial rank. That is the gain.  The Minister does not require this Bill to give him power to create such a Council.  It does require this Bill to create such a Ministry, but not to create a Council of Defence.  There is certainly nothing to stop him doing it, but by bringing it in and enjoining upon him to do it, in a statutory provision in a Ministerial Bill for creation primarily of Ministries, that Council of Defence is given a semi-ministerial rank in the State, and that is a very deplorable thing to do.  I do not criticise the Sub-section as a Sub-section. I criticise the Sub-section because I believe that Sub-section 6 has revealed the minds of those who drafted that Section.  It was there stated that the Council of Defence shall be collectively responsible.  I asked to whom the Council of Defence should be collectively responsible.  The Minister for Defence made answer which left me in extreme wonder, a wonder that was only enhanced when the answer was repeated in so many words again, by the Attorney-General, who said the Council of Defence will be collectively responsible to the Minister for Defence. Let us go back to Sub-section 2.  The Council of Defence &ldquo;shall consist of the following members, namely, the Minister for Defence, who, under the <Col N="1774" /> title of Commander-in-Chief, shall be Chairman of the Council of Defence...&rdquo; So the Council of Defence, of whom the Minister is one, is to be responsible to the Minister who for that purpose is stepping outside the Council of Defence presumably.  In other words, the Commander-in-Chief is to be responsible to himself as the Minister for Defence.  That might be thought to involve an absurdity, that he should in one capacity be responsible to himself in some other capacity.  Let us examine that absurdity and see where it lands us.  If the Minister for Defence, as Commander-in-Chief, is to be responsible to himself as Minister for Defence, then there is a distinction between the Commander-in-Chief and his ministerial position, although this Act of the State has stated that the Commander-in-Chief is the Minister plus certain other Ministers.</P>

      <P>That is the point I raise, and I urge that the matter is of very great importance.  The Attorney-General has said here what is perfectly correct and what we all recognise to be true.  It is a fact that in the Dominions and in this Free State there are Councils of Defence set up. In the greater number of the Dominions I believe such Councils of Defence exist.  It is perfectly true that they are set up by Statute in certain of the Dominions, but not in all.  They are not set up in a statute that is called &ldquo;The Ministers and Secretaries Bill.&rdquo; That is my point.  The reason why I think this should be eliminated is because it has no place in a Bill of this character.  The Attorney-General drew attention to the fact that the first clause did assert positively that the Council of Defence should be under the responsibility of the Minister for Defence, of the Executive Council and <Col N="1775" /> Oireachtas (presumably the Dáil, as he suggested), respectively.  I am opposed even to the inclusion of the first paragraph of this section because I do not desire to see in any Bill of this nature mention of a Military Council.  But if it were to be left at that first paragraph, a good many of my objections would disappear.  It is obvious in the Section as it stands, embodying seven sub-sections, that sections two to seven are in many of their features contradictory to the provision set out in sub-section one.  They are contrary also to the earlier enactments of this State. The chief reason which I emphasise, because it is the essential of the case, apart from everything else that has been said, is that there is nothing whatever to stop the Minister from creating a Council of Defence.  If this section be deleted, the Minister, the Army, and the Ministry remain, and the power to create a Council of Defence remains.</P>
      <P>All that will have been saved, if this Section be deleted, is the creation of a Council of Defence under a Bill entitled &ldquo;The Ministers Bill,&rdquo; or the giving to it of a semi-Ministerial rank which is not consonant with the place of any Council of Defence in a properly organised State subject to the civil power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully, in the hope of hearing some reason stated for the inclusion of this Section in the Bill.  The Minister for Defence said it was most advisable that this Council be brought together in a statutory way.  Now, I am sure the Minister believes it is most advisable, but I think it is due to the Dáil that they should be given the grounds for his belief that it is most advisable, that the Dáil should also be persuaded that it is advisable; but we have had no reasons adduced to us for the inclusion of this Section constituting the Council, in the manner in which it is constituted, to assist the Minister for Defence, thereby distinguishing this Ministry from other Ministries.  I hope we shall be acquainted with the reasons which make it most advisable.  The Attorney-General says it was simply an organisation <Col N="1776" /> of the civil administration end of the Army.  Again I want to know why insert that in the Bill?  We are told, I think, by the President that it is because in this case a new Ministry is being set up, and that in the case of the other Ministries they are already existing Departments.  Hence the reason for inserting this Section in the Bill. But I do not think that can be a reason.</P>
      <P>I think the President does not recall the position.  It is true, no doubt, that there was a Department dealing with Agriculture and a Department dealing with the administration of Justice. It might also be said, but not quite with the same force, that there was a Finance Department, though I think I have heard it stated, when trying to persuade the Dáil in another direction, that an entirely new Department had to be set up for Finance.  But, I ask, will it be contended that there was no Department for External Affairs or anything approximating to a Department for External Affairs. Yet, under Sections I and II, we set up a Department of External Affairs, but we do not, as a matter of fact, indicate in subsequent Sections how that Department shall be constituted, whether the Minister in charge of External Affairs shall have an Advisory Council or not.  As a matter of fact, the organisation of the Department is left to Ministerial responsibility in that case.  Now, some reason must be adduced, more than has been given, for treating the Ministry of Defence in a different way from that, let us say of the Ministry of External Affairs Deputy Milroy has left again.  He does not intend to follow the discussion subsequent, as he did not follow it prior to his intervention.  I was going to draw his attention to the fact that his reference to Parliamentary Secretaries was not appropriate, inasmuch as there is nothing in the Bill yet to indicate that Parliamentary Secretaries are responsible to the Dáil.  They are responsible only so far to the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct attention further to Sub-Section 6 which Deputy Figgis, who also has gone, dealt with.  The Sub-Section says that the Council of Defence shall meet as a collective body. How it could do otherwise, I do not know, but the Section says it shall meet <Col N="1777" /> and act as a collective body, and shall be &ldquo;collectively responsible for all matters entrusted to it in its collective capacity, whether by any Act of the Oireachtas or otherwise.&rdquo;  It is contemplated in this Section that there shall be entrusted to the Council and not to the Ministry or to the Minister, but to the Council of Defence set up under this section, certain responsibilities by Act of the Oireachtas.  I maintain that that is not the same as setting up an administrative organisation within the Ministry as is done in other Ministries. It is contemplated here that the Council of Defence shall be nominated as a body to whom will be entrusted responsibilities directly by Acts of the Oireachtas.  If that is not creating a distinction between this Ministry and other Ministries I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>I hope some satisfaction will be given to the Dáil as to the meaning of that, and perhaps while on that the Attor ney-General or the Minister for Defence will enlighten us as to what is meant by the words &ldquo;or otherwise.&rdquo; I submit that no case has been made for the inclusion of this Section.  The Bill would serve all the necessities covering the Department of Defence without the Section.  The Minister has been granted powers to act with the Executive Council, which is responsible to the Dáil for the organisation of his Department, and I think it is unwise of the Dáil, notwithstanding the assurances given, that the Army shall be under the control of the civil authority.  I fear that the inclusion of this Section defeats the purpose in view.  One may ask is there any fear that without this Section the Army would not be under the control of the civil authority.  I think that both the Minister for Defence and the President have stated fully and clearly that there is no such fear.  Then I say there is no case, even from the arguments adduced from the Ministerial benches, in favour of the inclusion of this Section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a word on a point which Deputy Johnson has referred to.  The Deputy referred to the words in Sub-Section 6 &ldquo;Entrusted to the Council whether by any Act of the Oireachtas or otherwise.&rdquo; That is intended to cover the <Col N="1778" /> two methods of entrusting; the one may be either directly by specific Statute, as, for instance, when a permanent Defence Forces Act is passed hereafter. There would be certain things which would be definitely within the duty of the Council of Defence, or there may be other matters referred by other Statures directly and specifically to the Council of Defence.  The word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; would refer, for instance, to the indirect delegation or direction rather of the discharge of certain functions, and the performance of the certain duties by the Minister himself as Chairman and head of the Council of Defence, and responsible for it to the Executive. The meaning of &ldquo;collective responsibility,&rdquo; notwithstanding the play of Deputy Figgis is, I think, fairly clear. The Commander-in-Chief is <i>ex-officio</i> the Chairman of this Council, and through him that Council is responsible to the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>The Act to which reference has been made, the Defence Forces Act, is a temporary Act and opportunity was taken then in order to enable things to be carried on until this Bill should be in a position to be laid before the Dáil so as to make temporary provision in that temporary Act for the setting up of a Defence Council.  Now, the position of the definite organisation of the various Departments of the State has come to the point at which they must be settled on a more or less permanent basis, and this seems an appropriate time to deal with the matter in this Statute, which is not a temporary Statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards differentiation between other Departments, I may refer to the fact that in this Bill provision is made for the organisation of the various Departments under different Sections. Section 2 deals with the appointment and the number of principal officers and other officers in the various Departments, and Section XI. provides the machinery for the organisation of the various Departments.  It is usual in dealing with that particular type of Department that one refers to others. A military department of this kind could deal with them in that way, but, on the other hand, a fairly established <Col N="1779" /> practice now is to provide by Statute for the organisation of a Council in relation to the military section of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the British Army the way it was done was this.  In England the army, being directly the army of the King, the whole thing is carried out by Order in Council.  I can show the Deputy the Orders in Council which were made after a certain Commission sat in the year 1904, under which all that organisation was given definite effect by specific Orders in Council, and the present organisation in England has been set up under elaborate and detailed Orders in Council.  It is true that under the Constitution, the army is the army of the Parliament and of the people, and that this Parliament and this Oireachtas is the established Constitutional Government of the army as of the rest of the population.  This section does not, for the first time, create Parliamentary control of the army.  What it does is, it associates specifically and beyond all question the government of the army with the civil government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is now a question of judgment as to whether or not this is the best machine for controlling the Army.  The question has come to that.  I must say that it is only right that we should acknowledge the fairness with which this question has been approached by Deputy Figgis, Deputy Johnson, Deputy Hewat and Deputy Bryan Cooper, who spoke on it.  This is certainly a new organisation and a new Department absolutely. Foreign Affairs had, to some extent, the advantage of being assisted in the administration of its work by the Civil Service.  There is not the same organisation <Col N="1780" /> possible in the case of the Army, and we must set up an Army machine of some sort or kind.  That is only reasonable.  If it were only a football team which was under the control of a particular Minister, somebody on the team would have to be in touch with the Minister if he had charge of it.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Army by mentioning it in that way, but we will take it that there is a body of men, twenty or thirty thousand, or, say, only five thousand, and that to that extent they have an organisation. I should say it grew during peculiar times and had to be adapted to still more peculiar times.  It is now in a state of discipline and of organisation, peculiar, I suppose to some extent, to all the circumstances and all the phases that it has passed through.  We want here to get established by Statute regulations under which that machine will be placed, in the first instance, under the Minister, and, in the second instance, through the Minister under the Oireachtas.  The machinery that we have elaborated here in this particular Section is, to our minds, the best method of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could have wished that the motion had not been the elimination of this Section, unless some other particular method of control or of administration were to be put in its stead.  This is a new service, different altogether to any other that we are administering.  I should say that if we were starting tomorrow with regard to the Ministry of Finance that it is possible you would have a separate organisation.  You would consider the question of associating the various heads of particular sections under the Minister for Finance in a sort of Council to advise him.  One member of that Council, say, would have his mind on administration and expenditure; another member, say, would have his eye to some extent on the question of raising taxation, and so on.  At any rate it is open to the Minister at any time to organise such a machine.  I do not say it would have been so easily open to him, and I am not saying that now as giving the slightest indication that I have ever heard that the Minister had any difficulty in it.  It is right and proper that <Col N="1781" /> in a young army we should lay down in black and white what its relations are to be to the man responsible to the Dáil, and how it should be organised. As I said before, an alternative suggestion would be much more satisfactory than a simple deletion which leaves the Minister free to organise the Department in whatever way he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are provisions in the Bill, as the Attorney-General pointed out, for describing the organisation of various Departments and stating what may be done.  These orders would have to be laid before the Dáil, and I think that inference may be read into Sections XI. and XII.</P>
      <P>Will the Attorney-General or the President indicate their view of Amendment No 3, which makes the position somewhat different, and gives authority to the Minister to establish such a Council to assist him, as distinct from a deliberate Act of the Dáil setting up this Council in this manner?</P>

      <P>In urging the President to answer that question on the lines that Deputy Johnson would wish, I would like to say that I agree entirely with him that it is merely a question of the best way to achieve what we hope to be the best method of getting the control of the army by this Oireachtas.  I would like to feel that Amendment 3 would be accepted. While still perfectly convinced that the amendment I moved was the right one, and that the reasons I gave were reasons why the amendment should be carried and the Section be deleted, I must say that much that has transpired and intervened since then has filled me with a considerable amount of distaste for all that has preceded. I would like to feel that under the circumstances it could be possible to meet half way on this.  If this is pressed to a division, I will, of course, vote for my amendment, because I am sure that when the passing distaste is gone my convictions will show that this Section should not remain part of the Bill.  I agree very heartily with the President that he looks at it from one point of view, that I look at it from another point of view, but that our common intention is the same, and that <Col N="1782" /> is, the best method of getting proper civil control over the army of this Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>May I point out in answer to Deputy Johnson's inquiry with reference to Amendment No. 3 that there is this difficulty. In the Council of Defence as proposed &mdash;if I may now refer to it in conjunction with an amendment that stands in my name later on&mdash;it is proposed to constitute the Council of Defence by having a civil member who may or may not be a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, but who must be a member of the Dáil, and whose special charge will be to watch questions of finance.  It does occur to me, as a matter of great difficulty&mdash;if it be desirable, as we think it is desirable to have a civil member of that kind&mdash; to leave the organisation merely to the Minister for Defence.  It is difficult to see how he can organise the machine on the lines that are indicated here in conjunction with that amendment.  In the case of the other Ministries, you have the ordinary civil service lines and ruts which are as little disturbed as possible in organisation, but here you are creating this new thing.  You want to be able to call on a member of the Dáil to assist in this controlling and checking capacity, and it is proposed to associate this additional civil member with the Ministry of Defence, who is, of course, a civil member himself.</P>

      <P>I do not think there could be agreement to accept the idea contained in Amendment No. 3.  You have, in considering this matter, to take yourself to a long drawn-out crisis <Col N="1783" /> and to consider the responsibility of the Executive Council and of the Minister for Defence himself.</P>
      <P>In reviewing plans from the military point of view, and taking any of the things that war involves for a people, the different aspects, and the strain of war on a people, you have to satisfy yourself in the organisation of the Ministry of Defence that all these are looked at from a systematic point of view.  You have to see that you do not arrive in the middle of a crisis, before matters have developed, we will say, to a war point, that the policy, the thought, the mind and the interchange of ideas, were not, perhaps, haphazard. You set down in the organisation of the Ministry for Defence that the Minister for Defence shall have this Council; that it shall be selected from the people mentioned here, who in their ordinary administrative work perform the duties set out for them.  That is the way of securing that the very heavy responsibility of foreseeing and foreplanning is carried out in a systematic way by people who have had systematic experience, and whose appointment to the administrative positions they hold have passed the review of the Executive Council.  The important point about it is the obligation to have this Council, and it would be entirely getting away from that important point if you accepted Amendment No. 3, were you to simply say, it shall be lawful to have such a Council.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister that the statutory obligation to have a Council of Defence is a very valuable and a very important thing.  In some respects I prefer the proposal to Deputy Davin's amendment. A point that I think has not been made clear is why this particular Section is in this Bill and not in the Army Bill which we are to consider in <Col N="1784" /> the future.  It would seem the natural way to begin an Army Bill by creating your organisation, by laying down such and such a Department to the Chief-of-Staff, such and such a Department to the Adjutant-General; and such and such a Department to the Quarter-Master-General. Having set up your organisation in the Army Bill, you should develop down to the various duties of each branch.  It seems to me that this is an excrescence on this Bill.  I agree that statutory authority is absolutely necessary, but it would come better in conjunction with the rest of the Army, rather than merely with Secretaries, Ministers, and Schedules, relating to Government Departments.  I should have thought that it would be sufficient to detail in the Schedule the responsibility of the Minister for Defence, and leave the rest to the Army Bill that we are bound to have, as at present these are only temporary provisions dealing with military matters.</P>

I would run a smaller chance, I am sure, of getting the financial member of the Defence Council and a Parliamentary Secretary in an Army Bill than I hope to have in a Ministers Bill.</P>

      <P>It may be that the views of the Farmers' Party were expressed in this matter in the Commission when Mr. Young of Stradbally gave evidence.  I come from Mr. Young's area.  In the recent election, as a member of the Labour Party that had put forward this policy of nationalisation of railways as one of the main planks of its platform, I headed the poll at that election.  If Deputy Gorey assumes that he is putting forward the <Col N="1787" /> views of the farmers of Leix and Offaly he has no right to say he is doing it on their behalf.  The Labour Party polled 9,040 votes.  Deputy Gorey's three nominees polled 5,400.  None of them was elected, and one of them lost £100. Perhaps it is for that reason that Deputy Gorey is silent in the debate.  I am sorry Deputy Figgis intervened yesterday in the debate, and prevented a member of the Government Party from giving expression to his views.  I regret it, because I remember that particular member, as well as a number of other members to-day sitting on the Government benches around him, being on the hustings as advocates of a policy of railway nationalisation.  I was eager for some of them to give reasons why they changed their minds in this matter. I also regret that since the introduction of this Bill, the Minister responsible for railway matters has not been present in the Dáil.  May I express the hope that this is not an indication of his lack of attention to a matter as important as that contained in this Bill?  Deputy Hewat said: &ldquo;As a novice in political matters, it strikes me as strange that a Bill of this public importance should be introduced as a Private Bill.  Whereas the Bill is brought forward by a leader of the Opposition, the attitude of the Government seems open to question. They have given us very little guidance in the matter, and it seems to me the Government are in the happy position of looking on while the Opposition exploit the proposition of how far it will go down in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I assure Deputy Hewat that so far as the Labour Party are concerned they had decided previous to the dissolution of the third Dáil to introduce a measure which it is now my pleasure to support.  Therefore, so far as that is concerned, they are not the instruments of any other parties or persons in this Dáil.  The measure Deputy Johnson introduced was drafted after very long and careful consideration by people who have had a long experience of railway administration in Great Britain and Ireland.  I am not supporting this Bill in the interests of railway servants.  Railway servants, like every other section of the trades <Col N="1788" /> union movement, are only too well informed of what they might expect since the Free State Government functioned in this country.  They are under no delusion as to the treatment they might expect as servants of the Free State Government.  That aspect does not weigh with us.  I hope that unlike what has happened in the previous division that the members of this Dáil who have thought over this matter will not be running out to the lobby when a division is called, but that they will be here to give expression by their votes to their feelings on this measure. It is too common for members to take up the time of this Dáil speaking to amendments to Bills, and when the division bell is rung, they go outside in the lobby and have not the courage to give expression to their views by voting on the matter.  Nationalisation of the Irish railways is looked upon by Deputies of this Dáil as an impossible proposal.  It is looked upon as a bigger question than it really is.  What do we find?  It may be of interest to have on record the capital of the Irish railways as returned on the 31st December, 1921.</P>
    <P>The Irish railways had a capital upon which interest or dividend was paid amounting to £47,875,824.  The number of the staff employed on the whole of the Irish railways, and I am quoting from the last record issued, was 30,511.  So far as we can gather, and there is nothing on record to prove it, as no statistics have been published since the Free State Government began to function, there are only 20,000 railway employees in the Free State. What is the position with regard to the great English combines?  Take the London, Midland, and Scottish Company with a capital of £398,929,175, a mileage of 6,962 miles, and a staff of 268,835.  Somebody&mdash;I cannot recollect who&mdash;suggested in the debate yesterday that it would require a superman to control the Irish railways under a system of State ownership or control. May I ask the individual who made the statement where the man was found to control a staff of 268,000 as compared with 20,000 on the Free State railways? Would he not describe him as a superman?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted figures to show how small a proposition it is to deal with a situation which from that point of view has been touched upon by Deputy Hewat.  Since this Bill was introduced many inspired articles have been written in the daily Press with the usual statements against nationalisation. In one article it has been said that Deputy Johnson, in introducing this Bill, made no attempt to relieve the minds of traders and travellers of the scepticism which State management during the war had sown in their minds. Deputy Hewat lent himself to the same kind of arguments when he stated: &ldquo;In connection with railways we have had some experience of Government control.  During the war it was considered necessary that the Government should take control of the railways, and, speaking as a commercial man, I do not think that the result of that experience has convinced many traders that they are going to benefit by the change.&rdquo;  One could understand articles in the Press, although inspired, written by people who do not understand the situation, but I am surprised at Deputy Hewat, who has some knowledge of railway work, associating himself with statements of that kind.  It is the usual argument put forward to try and mislead people, that the system of British Government control was anything like what might be expected under a proper system of State management. What was the system of State control in the European War?  A Board was appointed of five or six of the principal Irish railway managers, with the Under-Secretary as the nominal head.  I challenge the Government, if they are prepared to answer this aspect of the case, to produce the minutes of the Railway Executive meetings to show how many times the nominee of the British Government attended. That will show, to some extent, the interest and supervision exercised <Col N="1790" /> by the British Government in the control of Irish railways during that period.  The railways were placed in the hands of five or six managers with the directors lurking in the background to see if any manager appointed by themselves would do anything against the interests of the railway company with which they were associated.</P>
      <P>You can imagine the position of railway managers, many of whom, and perhaps all of whom, are experienced men, taking up a certain attitude in the interests of the British Government which would be opposed to the policy of the Board with which they were associated. I can imagine such men at the termination of control period finding themselves in the ranks of the unemployed. The railways were taken over by the British Government under the very wide contract that they were guaranteed the nett receipts for the year 1913.  Referring to that aspect of the case, it has been stated that perhaps that is not a fair test, for the State was not really in control during the war but was under the dictatorship of the trades unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Dáil that if the trade unions or the representatives of the railway workers had any share in the Management Committee that was set up under the system of British Governmental control many of the abuses which went on during that period would not have been allowed without being exposed.  It is fairly well known that the agreement, so far as it existed, between the Government and the railway companies was interpreted in a manner that made the taxpayers of this country suffer to an extent that they should not have suffered if those who were in control exercised that control on behalf of the taxpayers. I will give you a case in point.  Assuming that two hundred railway waggons and six engines were built in a certain railway works during the year 1913, that agreement could be interpreted, and perhaps was interpreted so, that although these waggons and engines were not built during the years of control, that railway company, under the very wide terms of the contract, was paid for the building of these waggons and engines, not alone the amount paid in the year 1913 <Col N="1791" /> but the additional cost of labour and material for the building of waggons and engines which were really never put into stock.  Does Deputy Hewat or any other Deputy contend that if the railway workers, or the Trades Unions, had a share in the Committee of Management such a system as that and the robbing of the taxpayers in that way, would have been tolerated?</P>
    <P>In England the Workers' War Emergency Committee, which was an advisory body of the Labour Party, associated with the conduct of the war, suggested to the British railway companies that for the purpose of saving money and keeping prices down railway waggons should be pooled.  They made that suggestion to the Government and the Government referred them to the Railway Companies' Managers and the suggestion, which was a very useful one and would have saved especially a rise on coal prices at the time, was ignored and turned down. It is well known, and it is known to Deputies here, that when traders in Dublin and elsewhere were looking for waggons to convey foodstuffs and other goods during the period of control they were told that no railway waggons were to be had, while at the same time railway waggons were lying empty in every depot.</P>
    <P>I rely upon the statements I am making in regard to this matter, that during the whole time British Governmental control during the war both in this country and in England, was used by railway managers, with the backing of their directors, to prejudice nationalisation and State ownership in the minds of the trading and travelling public.  In connection with the question of waggons, I would like to know if there is any return in the hands of the Transport Department of the Ministry of Commerce to show the number of miles which empty waggon were carried over during the period of State control.  I am sure if all the records that should be available, that were at the disposal of the British Ministry during that period, were handed over, as I believe they were, to the Irish Government, they would disclose many things which even Deputy Hewat would be surprised at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> In addition to abusing the system of control in the manner in which I have stated, the railway companies were given £3,000,000 to represent what was called deferred maintenance.  That was supposed to be set aside on the termination of the period of control for renewal of stores, repairs, and other matters of that kind.  And, by the way, it is pretty well known, too, that the railway companies interpreted the agreement which I have referred to in a way that enabled them to renew their stores under the terms of the contract and practically to do everything for the improvement of the railways except painting the tracks.  They received this £3,000,000, representing deferred maintenance. Was it set aside and used for the purpose for which it was voted? No.  If you examine the reports of the shareholders' meetings last year, as reported in the Press, you will find that the £3,000,000 was used for the purpose of paying dividends to shareholders.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given such an explanation as will remove from the mind of Deputy Hewat, and any other Deputy, that State control, as we knew it during the period of the European war, was anything like what might be expected from any proper business system of State management.  I would go so far as to say that if the Government were unable, and if they are prepared to say that they are unable, to give to each member of the travelling public a better return for the money that was spent during that period, then the case for the State ownership of railways falls to the ground.  Deputy Hewat, and, I think, in this matter Deputy Cooper was largely associated with him, asked the Dáil to believe that the railwaymen of this country find themselves in a peculiarly advantageous position as a result of the political forces which they were in a position to manipulate.  It is information for me to know that the Irish railwayman, during the period of the European war or since 1916, had any very great political influence with the British Government when they controlled the railways. Deputy Cooper rather assumed that as a constant traveller he would be molested by railwaymen in connection <Col N="1793" /> with an aspect of this Bill dealing with their civil rights.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of their political influence, let us assume&mdash;and I think we will not be wrong in assuming&mdash;that the number of shareholders in the Irish railways is as large as the number of railway employees&mdash;and I think it is larger.  If we are to take the arguments that were used by Ministers when they were inviting the Irish public to subscribe to the recent Loan, the men who have the money are the men who really control the machine.  Therefore, if the number of railway shareholders in Ireland is greater than the number of railway employees, I take it that the political influence of the men with the money is greater than that of the railway worker, who has nothing but his life invested in the industry.</P>
    <P>A shareholder, speaking at the Great Western Railway Company's shareholders' meeting on a recent occasion, stated:&mdash;&ldquo;If we bring to bear our political influence&mdash;700,000 votes at least in this case, excluding a great many other votes of people indirectly interested&mdash;I think we can bring pressure to bear on the Government which is very desirable and which the Shareholders' Protection Association will concentrate upon.  Organise: unity is certainly strength.&rdquo; That is the view of a railway shareholder regarding the political influence of those who have their money invested in the railways.</P>

      <P>I put it to Deputy Hewat and Deputy Cooper that we can take the case of the Postal Servants in the Free State as a fair example, and I would be surprised to hear from any Deputy, or from anybody outside, that when members of the public go to the Post Office counter to buy stamps they are delayed to any great extent by the interference of postal servants in discussing political affairs.  That may be taken as a fair example of the arguments that Deputy Cooper and Deputy Hewat are trying to persuade us with, in regard to the question of political influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell Deputy Hewat and Deputy Cooper that the political and civil rights of railway men are not going to be surrendered at any price.  I had an experience at the last election, and perhaps it is not wrong for me to relate it here.  Down in my own constituency I had the experience of meeting some Civil Servants from Government Building working on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedheal, and in opposition to the nominees of the Labour Party, and of Deputy Gorey's Union.  Was not that a political interference by Civil Servants, and one would like to know in a case of that kind whether the Civil Servants working for Cumann na nGaedheal were paid by the State at the time they were working against us.  I think there is no use in labouring the point here, or asking the Dáil to agree that the present system of railway organisation is a failure.  Commission after Commission has been set up by both British and Irish Governments to inquire into and report in regard to the question of railway organisation.  President Cosgrave on a previous occasion stated that the Government were unable to adopt the reports of many of the Commissions appointed by himself, simply because the Commissions did not make sensible recommendations.  The Commissions, as far as I know, made recommendations in accordance with the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If President Cosgrave in appointing these Commissions will so limit the terms of reference as to rule out questions of this kind, then he will find whether he will be able to get men to sit on these Commissions, and devise recommendations which would suit himself or the Ministry.  However, Commissions which have dealt with this question of reorganisation have reported in favour of State ownership.  I contend that there is no necessity in a small country like Ireland, much less in the Free State, to have 46 different registered companies with 28 separate managements, and with 170 railway directors drawing, on an average, fees of from £19,000 to £20,000.  If that is the <Col N="1795" /> contention that was put up by Deputy O'Mahony, and the representative of the Farmers' Union who gave evidence before the Railway Commission, then I think that there are very few in the Dáil who will agree with it.  We are faced with the proposal that the present system is rotten, and must be got rid of; and what is the alternative? We heard it stated by Deputy O'Mahony yesterday that the Ministry had no policy with regard to this very urgent question.  He made a statement on a previous occasion, but it was qualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, what I said was that the Government had not revealed their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Ministry had not revealed their policy, even to their supporters, I hope, if a division is taken on the Bill, that those who have not heard the policy of the Government will vote in favour of the Bill.  To give an example&mdash;I do not know whether it is necessary for me to do so or not&mdash; of the present wasteful system of administration, one has only to look at the town of Collooney, with three different railway companies there and three different staffs, stationmasters, signalmen, and all the other paraphernalia operating three different systems of railway administration in that town, with a population of 371.  I think I need not go any further than quoting that case in support of the contention that the present system is rotten, and must be got rid of.  In most countries where State ownership is in operation, and working with a considerable amount of success, the railways have been originally constructed under certain concessions and limitations laid down by different Acts of Parliament. The first railways, for instance, constructed in Prussia were built by private companies under certain concessions laid down under an Act of 1838. That Act conferred on the then Government power to acquire the railway lines at the expiration of 30 years, at a price fixed at 25 times the annual dividends for the preceding five years.  It might be quite rightly said that these <Col N="1796" /> are more favourable terms than we are providing in the Bill introduced here. I think Deputy Johnson has made it quite clear that so far as we are concerned as a party, we are not staking our political future on that particular clause.  If the Dáil is prepared to take over the Bill and give better terms to the shareholders than the Minister for Agriculture gave the landlords who confiscated the land, then it is the responsibility of the majority of the members of the Dáil if they amend the Bill in that particular form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Prussian railways, a remarkable coincidence, and quite the opposite of our experience here, is that although the Prussian Parliament had powers under the terms of the Act of 1838, yet when eventually in 1873 they decided to acquire the railways for the State, they did not rely on the compulsory Act of 1838, but an agreement between the then owners and the Government was arrived at by friendly negotiation. That example, I think, might be followed by those now in control of the Irish railways; and if it was followed it would make the position of the Government in dealing with this Bill, or any other Bill of the same kind, a very easy matter.  Deputy Hewat stated, strange to say, that the Bill was of a confiscatory nature.  Deputy Woulfe, speaking yesterday evening, pleaded for the railway companies under the present system of organisation, and laboured to explain&mdash;which I think he should not in dealing with that aspect of the case&mdash;the insolvency of the present railway systems.  If the railways are so insolvent as the Deputy would have the Dáil believe, I do not think he would object if he were a shareholder, to the Government taking them over under the terms described by Deputy Hewat as confiscation.  It is, of course, well known to those who have travelled around the country; they can see it from their experience in looking out through railway carriage windows, as Deputy Woulfe said, that the thought of ultimate unification, amalgamation or nationalisation never seemed to have dawned on the people who originally constructed the various kinds of railway lines in this country.  We have every system of <Col N="1797" /> known railway in the country to-day, from the electric narrow gauge railway to the Mono rail, known as the Lartigue Railway, running between Listowel and Ballybunion.</P>
    <P>Perhaps those who constructed the railways at the time were doing it, with the advice of the British Government, to make it impossible at any time in the future to arrive at a system of organisation of the railways that would be suitable to the needs of the trading community.  It has been stated in the Press and elsewhere that nationalisation has been ruled out.  We have had statements made in the Dáil by responsible Ministers in connection with the Government's policy regarding the future of the railways.  I am not aware of any discussion in the Dáil in which it was decided that nationalisation was ruled out by the Government.  If the Government is to be taken as the Ministry, then perhaps that has been the case.  If the Government is to be taken as the Cumann na nGaedheal, or governing party in the Dáil, then that is not so, according to Deputy O'Mahony's statement.  But, if the Government is the majority of the Dáil, which is the only place where matters of this kind should and can be decided, then railway nationalisation has neither been discussed nor ruled out according to my knowledge.  On the 3rd January last we had from the Ministry the only statement which could be taken as a statement of policy. If one is to look at the Governor-General's address and observe the language used by the Governor-General, representing as he does the views of the Executive, I think it must be agreed that we are getting further back from the position which the Ministry took up on January 3rd last.  The Minister read a very carefully prepared document, in which it was stated: &ldquo;The Companies were definitely informed that the policy favoured by the Government was the unification of the whole railway systems under one management and the securing of the maximum economies in organisation and administration that unification rendered possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say: &ldquo;The larger companies on their part&rdquo;&mdash;it should be <Col N="1798" /> made quite clear who these were&mdash;&ldquo;represented that the object desired by the Government would be better secured by a system of grouping than by complete unification.  To this the Government has replied that it will keep an open mind on grouping as compared with unification, and if all the companies can agree on a grouping scheme that will secure the same degree of economy and efficiency as is to be expected through unification, without prejudicing in any way the interests of trade and industry in the Saorstát and its ports, it will give any such scheme its most serious consideration.&rdquo;  The statement goes on to say: &ldquo;From a date, early in January, the railway companies had informed the Government that they could agree upon a scheme of grouping, that the Government informed them that that scheme should be brought forward by the end of March, and failing an agreement upon a scheme which the Government could support, the Government would proceed to put their own policy into operation.&rdquo;  We have learned very little as to what happened since that. If rumours are to be taken as correct, there has been no agreement among the Companies.  I hope, however, replies will make it quite clear what Companies made that statement to the Government, and whether or not all the Companies were consulted.  I previously argued in the Dáil, and I am still more convinced now that nationalisation of the railways is the only solution of the difficulty in the area particularly over which this Parliament has jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have argued, and I still contend, that the solution of the railway question, in the interests of the general body of the community, is bound up very largely with the question of the settlement of the Boundary difficulty. It has been rumoured, and it is quite right that this Dáil should be informed of these rumours, in railway circles that the Northern Parliament, or whatever else you call Sir James Craig's Parliament, has favoured unification of the railway system within the Six County area as we know it and as it exists to-day.  The Government will <Col N="1799" /> be faced with a very serious problem if that is the position.  In my opinion, if the railways of the Six Counties were unified, and all the railway property in that area were unified under one management, it would add further difficulty to the solution of the Boundary problem. We do know at any rate that no matter how long it may be, or what the powers of the Belfast Parliament may be in the future, whether it operates or functions for a Parliament of Six Counties or Four Counties, even with limited powers, it will always create rivalry between the Saorstát ports and the ports of the Belfast area.  Picture the position of any great Northern combine, subsidised, as we are told it may be, by a huge British corporation, and imagine the position of a Southern competing combine.  That is the difficulty which I believe the Government is confronted with, and that is the position which will force the Government in the near future to take complete control of the railways operating wholly in the Free State.  If the policy of the Government is unification of the railways operating wholly in the Free State, I ask the President or the Ministers what control can they exercise over railways operating on the border-line or on railways operating inside the Six County border, to prevent them diverting traffic out of its natural route?  What control in any case can they claim the right to exercise in these cases?  Can they override any combine of railways operating wholly in the Free State area?</P>
    <P>The question of railway rates, both passenger and goods, is a question which should be dealt with, perhaps, more by Deputy Gorey and his party than by anybody associated with the Labour party.  In dealing with this matter we realise that high railway rates not alone affect the producer, but are in all cases passed on to the consumer, who has eventually to pay. Now, it is a coincidence that in giving evidence before the Provisional Government Commission that was set up to inquire into the railways, two railway companies operating inside and <Col N="1800" /> on the border of the Six Counties gave evidence, to the effect, that their revenue would not meet their working expenses.  It is a strange thing, that since that evidence was given these two companies have reduced their rates to a considerable extent.  How, therefore, could railway companies who have given evidence before the Railway Commission stating that the revenue would not enable them to meet working expenses, have since agreed to reduce their rates and yet prevent their systems from being closed down?  There must be a subsidy in these cases coming from somewhere, and it is up to the Ministry to find out where it is coming from.  The question of railway rates, so far as it affects the railways solely in the Free State area, has been dealt with on a few occasions.  It is an extraordinary thing that although the railway companies operating in the Six Counties and on the border have reduced their rates there has been practically no reduction whatever in their rates by the companies operating in the Southern area, although the railwaymen's wages have been reduced by £1,500,000 as the result of an agreement that was arrived at between the railwaymen's representatives and the railway companies.</P>
    <P>The railway companies had the further reduction of one and a half millions as a result of the reduced cost of coal and other materials.  What argument or what reason has been put forward, or can be put forward, by these railways, especially in the Southern areas, for not having reduced their rates, particularly in view of the facts I have stated?  The real fact is that these companies having had thrown at them this question of unification, or not knowing the position that they are going to be placed in as a result of the Government's policy, are not going to, and will not, do anything until the Government makes up its mind as to what it is going to do with regard to the railways in the future.  As far as I can see, nothing can be done in connection with the question of the relief of railway rates, at least for a considerable period, unless the Government <Col N="1801" /> is prepared to take control of the railways in the Free State area. Whether this Bill is passed, or whether any other Bill is passed by the Government, it will take a long time for the Bill to go through.  When the Bill has passed through both Houses it will be necessary to set up a railway rates tribunal.</P>
    <P>It will then take a long time to prove to the tribunal that there should be a reduction in rates.  My point is that if the Government are prepared to give any immediate relief to the people suffering as a result of the present high rates, it will have to make up its mind to face the situation with which it is confronted in a bold and courageous manner.  We have seen interviews given to the Press by people who are unable or who are ashamed to allow their names to stand over what they state. We have been warned about the domination of foreign capital.  As far as I can see, while the railways are called Irish railways, both North and South, there is a great domination of foreign capital at the back of them.  Belgium was confronted with the same position, and in order to prevent the domination of its railway system by foreign capital it decided, in the year 1870, to refuse any further concessions to privately-owned companies for the purpose of building any further private lines.  Between the years 1857 and 1906 the Belgium Government took over as many as 20 private companies to prevent what is called the domination of foreign capital.  That, I submit, is another argument in support of the Bill which Deputy Johnson introduced.</P>
    <P>In 1910, as a result of this operation, 2,697 miles out of a total mileage of 2,915 miles were either owned or controlled by the State.  As is well known to those who have experience of travelling on the continent, passenger fares and goods rates on the Belgium railways are the lowest in the world.  It is well known that as a result of the arrangements made, especially in pre-war days for tourists in Belgium, that the rates charged to tourists in that country were the lowest practically in the world, and as a result of these low fares, and of the other concessions given, there was a remarkable influx of <Col N="1802" /> tourists to Belgium which, of course, was a considerable advantage to the country.  While on this question of railway rates, I think it desirable to give a quotation from the findings of the Scotter Commission.  This was not a Commission of Irishmen set up by Irishmen, but was a Commission composed of Englishmen and set up by the British Government, who never take into account the Irish outlook, so far as trade and commerce are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should have said there were some Irishmen on it.  Now, that report contained the following remarkable statement in regard to the question of Irish railway rates: &ldquo;In our view the Irish railways have not, and are not, being fully utilised for the advancement of the general interests in Ireland owing to the competitive rates on imported goods being so much lower in scale than the local rates, so that the advancement of the local manufacturers is discouraged rather than assisted, as it should have been.&rdquo; That is the remark made in the findings and in the recommendations of the Scotter Commission, and it is scarcely necessary to say anything further to prove that the Irish railways in the past have been controlled by men not interested in the development of the country.  Now, if these people who are in control of so many small railways in Ireland are going to get control of the bigger combine, if the Government tolerates the setting up of a system of that kind, it will not be a case of dealing with men who dominated the Irish railways in the past, but it will mean that the men who own these railways will own and will run the State.  I am sure there cannot be any objection to my reading an article written by the late President Arthur Griffith in regard to this aspect of the railway trouble.  Writing &ldquo;In the Sinn Fein Policy&rdquo; published fifteen months after he published &ldquo;The Resurrection of Hungary,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;Owing to the attitude of our railways the development of the country is materially hampered,&rdquo; and he goes on to say: &ldquo;We cannot make up for the deficiency of the railways, but we can certainly do much to alleviate the present <Col N="1803" /> situation by the proper utilisation of our semi-derelict canal system.  With the proper transit system in Ireland the interdependence of manufacturing and agricultural industry would become manifest, and a larger market would be created for each.  By a proper transit system, as the maker of industrial Germany pointed out, not merely are the powers of labour of those who are employed in it brought into activity, not only is the agricultural population enabled to obtain from the natural resources which it possesses a greater return than before, but the wealth heretofore lying idle in the earth becomes useful and profitable. Articles such as coal, stone, salt, gypsum, marble, slate, timber, which the freight of a few miles rendered before unprofitable to work, become distributable over a whole country, and thus the formerly valueless resources of a country become, through good transit facilities, of a high importance in the total of national production.  This is what transit means to our country.  It is worth working hard to obtain.&rdquo;  I can imagine that if President Cosgrave, as the worthy successor of the late President Arthur Griffith, is inclined to take his view in regard to how the transport system should be dealt with, he would, I think, take over the Bill which Deputy Johnson has introduced. He would, I am sure, be particularly gratified to take over the Bill, if he is not in a position to tell the Dáil before he turns it down what his alternative policy is.  I scarcely think it is necessary, although I could do so at much greater length, to go any further into the question of the ownership and management of the railways on the Continent, and to prove by figures which I could give and which are at the disposal of every member of this Dáil, that State ownership, where it has been brought into operation, has succeeded in almost every country in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the case that I cannot sit down without dealing with, and that is the question of the wages of the railwaymen.  A good deal of piffle has been talked regarding the wages of railwaymen, not alone during the discussion of this Bill, but on previous occasions, <Col N="1804" /> by Deputy Gorey and others. I want it to be definitely understood once and for all that these statements are absolutely contrary to the facts, and that, as a matter of fact, railway workers' wages are the lowest of any section of workers in this country, with the exception of agricultural workers. Deputy Gorey, of course, could solve that problem, judging from previous statements he has made.  He stated: &ldquo;If the citizen must discharge his duty the State must discharge its duty, and I suggest seriously to the Government that if there are any more strikes or any more attempts to get hold of the key industries of the country, such as the ports and railways, it is their duty to set up a State organisation which could be done and manned within 24 hours.&rdquo;  That is the statement of Deputy Gorey when speaking in the Dáil on the 22nd November.  I have been asked by people outside if that went further than the terms of our Bill.  I would ask Deputy Hewat if what Deputy Gorey suggests there is not confiscation to a greater extent than the proposals contained in this Bill.  Deputy Gorey, of course, would settle the whole wages difficulty by providing men from the ranks of the farmers and the farmers' sons to run the railways for the State for nothing.  That is what I think is contained in the statement which I have quoted.  I would, however, warn the Ministry and Deputies who may be confronted at some future date with a position such as he suggests, that if Deputy Gorey is in charge of the lever of the mail train going to Cork in a fog, and if they are travelling on that train, that they would be very well advised to take out an insurance policy.  We have had a little sample of the management of Deputy Gorey's people when they took over SS. Brussels and a couple of other ships.  They tried to run them for about three months.  They failed, and eventually handed them over to one of the great British combines which we are now told are going to dominate this country in future, proving that what Deputy Gorey has suggested with regard to the railways has been a failure when they previously attempted it.</P>
    <P>With regard to railway wages, apart <Col N="1805" /> from the free labour which Deputy Gorey has suggested can be provided, traffic porters at present are only paid from 45s. 6d. to 49s. per week, according to the importance of the station at which they are employed.  A few parcels' porters at Class I. stations get as high as 52s.  I would like to ask Deputy Hewat if he is prepared to go to his men in the coal trade and offer them these wages.  Station foremen, with large numbers of men under their control, are paid as low as 52s. 6d. per week, while the highest wage paid to a foreman who controls scores of men is only 62s. per week.</P>

      <P>I have personal knowledge of a station not very far from Dublin, where 153 trains are scheduled and run each day, and the foreman controlling the staff there is paid at the rate of 62/- per week.  I do not know if Deputy Gorey would argue that that is an unfair wage for the responsibility which that man has to undertake. Deputy O'Mahony yesterday evening alleged that while the Bill provided only three-fifths of the present income for shareholders, it provided 100 per cent. in the case of the staffs.  If the Deputy will read the Bill again he will find that in the case of all men who may become redundant as a result of reorganisation, the maximum amount which they can get is two-thirds of their present wages, although dismissal is of far more moment to them than any reductions in dividend could be to the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been customary for railway companies both in England and Ireland, when recruiting staffs, to do so at a very low wage.  I am not disclosing any secret when I make the statement that I started work on a railway as a clerical worker at 8/- a week.  I ask Deputy Gorey, who is so healthy and happy looking to-day, if he would like, after getting an ordinary reasonable education, to be faced with the prospect of starting work at 8/- weekly and having to pay 12/- for his lodging. I can assure Deputy Gorey that we are not going back to the stone age so far as that is concerned.  Deputy O'Mahony <Col N="1806" /> quoted figures in connection with the Caledonian Railway as against the whole of the Irish railways, but what he professed to show by the figures it is difficult to see.  He said that the receipts per mile were higher in Scotland than in Ireland, but he did not say that the cost of working per mile was infinitely greater in Scotland than in Ireland.  I could detain and entertain the Dáil&mdash;if such a discussion is an entertainment&mdash;at greater length if it was necessary to prove that the Bill I have the pleasure of supporting is the only practical measure that holds for the moment.  I could go into many questions connected with the administration of the railways both in pre-war days, and during the period of control. I believe, however, that anything I might say would not convince some people, who are so prejudiced against nationalisation, that even if it was a practical proposition they would not vote for it.  I have put forward as briefly as was necessary the principal reasons why this Bill should be taken over by the Government.  Deputy O'Mahony must be right when he told us that the Ministry have no policy. If the Ministry are not prepared to announce what, in their opinion, is the only practical alternative to this Bill, I ask the members of the Dáil to take their courage in their hands and vote for the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene to explain what our proposals are with regard to the adjournment for the Christmas holidays?  We intend, if we can get through certain measures by Friday, to adjourn then until the 15th January.  If we do not get them through, it will mean either sitting on Saturday or Tuesday next, or coming back on the 8th January.  I do not very well see how we are going to finish this discussion this evening.  We certainly will not have time to deal with it on Friday, having regard to the other business.  There is a motion by Deputy Morrissey for Friday, and I expect we will want two hours anyway for that.  It is only fair that the Dáil <Col N="1807" /> should realise what the position is. Apart from pressing Bills, I do not see how we could get much further with the Ministers Bill, and I would not mind tying up that to give greater time for this discussion, that is, if Deputy Johnson wishes to have this matter decided before the adjournment. He need not answer to-night&mdash;it will do to-morrow&mdash;but I just want to put the position before Deputies, so that they will understand the situation.</P>

      <P>We do not know what other business there may be for to-morrow, but if it is competent to take this Bill, then I think the possibilities of an adjournment on Friday, that the President speaks of, are reasonable.  If there is business for the Dáil to transact to-morrow, I do not see how it is possible to get through what possibly is necessary business this week, and in that case I think we should meet next week.  It is desirable, in my view, that this Bill should be discussed and a division taken before the adjournment; but I press for due time to consider the motion of Deputy Morrissey, and there is also a motion by Deputy Figgis that has precedence according to the form in which it appeared on the paper.  I think the question really is, in view of what the President says about the Ministers Bill, what other business there is to transact to-morrow.</P>
