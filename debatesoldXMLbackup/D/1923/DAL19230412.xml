      <P>asked the President if he will set aside a day, and if so, what day, for discussion of the White Paper, entitled Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the Year ending 31st March, 1924, handed to Deputies on Tuesday, the 27th March, and of the financial position revealed therein?</P>

      <P>A sufficient opportunity for the discussion of this matter appears to be provided by the Debate on the Resolutions which I shall propose to-day, and also in connection with the Estimates for the year 1923-24, which will shortly come for consideration before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>asked the President if his attention has been drawn to the recommendation of the Coroner's jury on the 4th inst. in regard to the murder of Christopher Breslin and Joseph Kiernan, that the relatives of the deceased in each case be compensated by the Government, and if he will say if this recommendation will be accepted by the Executive Council.  Further, to ask if he will cause a public enquiry to be held into the circumstances of these murders, as revealed in the evidence given at the inquest?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. The answer to the second part is that the Coroner's inquest was in itself a public inquiry, and the answer to the third part of the question is that before I received notice of this question from the Deputy I made enquiry and had been informed, by the Commander-in-Chief, that previous to my enquiry he had already instituted a military inquiry into this matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that numerous claims have been submitted to the Board of Works and Military Authorities arising out of the commandeering of private property for military purposes, for rent, damage to, and in some cases destruction of such property during the period of occupation; whether or not and to what extent such claims have been dealt with and passed for payment, whether payment in such cases as have been dealt with and passed is being held up owing to the failure of the Ministry of Finance to give the necessary sanction or authority, and if in view of many urgent claims now long overdue, he will sanction payment of all claims already dealt with, and expedite payment or clearance of all outstanding cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of claims in respect of the commandeering of private property for military purposes have been received and are being examined. <Col N="4" /> The process of examination takes a considerable time as in many instances the actual facts are obscure. Moreover, the decision to be taken in a considerable proportion of cases will be affected by the final form in which the Damage to Property (Compensation) Bill emerges from the Oireachtas.  In the meantime investigation into cases is, as far as possible, being carried out by the Ministry of Defence and the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that many employers are not paying the minimum rates of wages set up under the Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board and the Millinery and Dressmaking Trade Boards; if any complaints of this nature have reached his Department? If he has ordered, or is prepared to order, prosecutions for the purpose of having the minimum rates enforced?  If any such prosecutions have taken place, and, if so, will he state what Court they were tried before, and if convictions were secured?  If the Department have sufficient Inspectors to ensure compliance with the Trade Board regulations in question, and if the available Inspectors will be given positive instructions to prosecute defaulters and press for the maximum penalty, including payment of arrears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been ascertained that a number of employers have not been paying the minimum rates of wages fixed under the Trade Boards Acts in the retail bespoke tailoring and the millinery and dressmaking trades.  Complaints of this nature have reached the Department, and all such complaints have been investigated by the Inspectors.  In the great majority of such cases the Inspectors have been able to persuade the employers concerned to pay the correct rates of wages as well as the whole or portion of arrears due, and in a number of cases where employers refused to make payment in accordance with their obligations legal proceedings were instituted. Eight such cases in the dressmaking and tailoring trades were recently heard by District Justices.  Convictions were secured in every case, fines were imposed carrying costs, and in addition <Col N="10" /> orders were made for payment of arrears of wages due.  In five other cases in the dressmaking trade prosecutions have been directed, and it is expected that these cases will be heard at an early date.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is possibly aware that it is at present difficult to enforce the determinations of the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board, because those determinations are on a time basis, while practically all male workers in that trade are employed on a system of piece-work.  I understand that the Trade Board has this matter under consideration, but in the meantime it is difficult to secure a conviction except in those cases where the workers are employed on time rates.</P>
      <P>I consider that the staff now available for inspection purposes is sufficient, having regard to the need for economy.  It is certainly sufficient to deal promptly with all complaints received, and the Deputy will appreciate that the employment of a large staff to inspect for grievances to which the workers or other employers have not drawn attention would not be justified.  The Inspectors have instructions to demand payment of appropriate rates, together with arrears in cases of default, but I do not propose to issue general instructions to Inspectors to prosecute defaulters, as it is necessary to consider carefully the facts of each case in order to determine whether it is a suitable one for prosecution, whether there is a reasonable probability of securing a conviction, and to what extent, if any, the workers themselves have facilitated the non-compliance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether his attention has been called to the reports in the Press that there is an increase of £10,000 in the estimates for outdoor relief for the coming year in the Dublin Union; whether he is aware that the total amount spent in outdoor relief in Belfast does not exceed £10,000; whether the alarming amount spent in outdoor relief in the Dublin Union is due to irresponsible spending; and whether he proposes to do anything to check extravagance in the giving of relief?</P>

      <P>The Ministry have been informed of an increase of <Col N="11" /> about £10,000 in the Estimate for Home Help of the Dublin Guardians.  Authentic details as to recent expenditure in Belfast Union are not available at the moment, but there are grounds for believing that the total expenditure on Outdoor Relief, as suggested in the question, does not exceed £10,000.  There is room for doubt as to the propriety of a great deal of the expenditure on Home Help in Dublin.  Considerable economy could be effected by more active investigation of all the material facts concerning applicants and by frequent systematic revisions.  The advocacy of cases by individual Guardians, often without having acquainted themselves fully of the true circumstances of the cases, leads to the inclusion of undeserving parties, embarrasses responsible officials, and weakens the whole system of administration.  In conjunction with other necessary reforms in the Dublin Union the question of Home Help has recently been receiving special consideration by an official of the Ministry and a scheme is about to be formulated to secure well-regulated and economical administration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether it is a fact that the cost of the coal consumed in the Dublin Workhouse for the year 1921 was nearly £12,000, if it is a fact that there is no check on the supplies of coal delivered to the Workhouse, and frequently no written record of orders or receipts, and whether any steps have been taken by him to remedy these abuses?</P>

      <P>The cost of coal in the Dublin Workhouse in 1921 was approximately as stated.</P>
      <P>The quantities of coal delivered to the Workhouse have been suitably verified, but up to the present there has been no check on the supplies distributed to the several departments.  The Ministry's General Inspector recently submitted a report on this matter to the Guardians, but it has not yet been published.  It indicated gross laxity in the method of distribution, and made suggestions as to future procedure.  The Guardians adopted the report in so far as it prescribed the rations of coal and the records to be kept, but they considered that the officials concerned in the report should be given opportunity of refuting the charges made. To meet the wishes of the Guardians the Ministry have ordered a public inquiry into the whole matter.  It will take place as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.</P>

Cork, strongly protest against their holdings being vested, until such time as the embankment on the foreshore bounding these lands is put in proper condition to resist the very strong tides that prevail there; whether he has been supplied with a copy of the report made by Mr. D. J. Tierney, B.A., B.E., Assoc.M. Inst.C.E., 16 Cook Street, Cork, an engineer of the highest repute, which is a very great indictment of the condition of this embankment, and whether he considers that public monies should be advanced on the security of lands protected by such an insecure and ineffective embankment as that described in Mr. Tierney's report; whether he has been supplied with a copy of notice sent out to each tenant in this estate by Estate Commissioners, under date 8th ult., informing the tenants that they (the Commissioners) propose to vest these holdings; and whether he will have these notices withdrawn, and at an early date take some suitable steps to investigate the reasonable complaints of those tenants, and be assured that the embankment is properly secured, and that those lands are securely protected, before public monies are advanced in their security?</P>

      <P>I am aware that the tenants on the two estates of Henry F. Lowe and F. J. B. Gubbins, Co. Cork, have protested against their holdings on these estates being vested in them until the embankments bounding the lands have been put into a proper state of repair. I have had the whole matter investigated by the Land Commission.  As regards the embankment on the Gubbins Estate, the Commissioners are satisfied, as a result of a special inspection made by one of their engineers that the work on the embankment, carried out in accordance with a specification prepared by the tenants' engineer and under his supervision, has been satisfactorily completed. In addition the Vendor of the estate has agreed to increase the amount which the Commissioners asked him to provide for the future maintenance of the embankment from £750 to £1,000, and has also undertaken to effect some further repairs suggested by the Commissioners' Engineer on the occasion of his last visit.</P>
      <P>As regards the embankment on the Lowe Estate, extensive repairs were carried out to the embankments in the years 1912 and 1913 by the Vendor at the request of the Land Commission, the work being completed to the satisfaction of the Commissioners' Inspector. Again in 1919 the Vendor at the request of the Commissioners, carried out certain further repairs to the banks which were considered necessary in order to put the banks into thorough repair before the holdings were vested.  In the case of this estate it is to be observed that in the agreements signed by the tenant purchasers the latter undertook to keep the embankments in proper repair.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that everything reasonably possible has been done both by the Vendors and by the Land Commission to put both these embankments into a proper state of repair, and I do not, therefore, propose to authorise the withdrawal of the notices stated to have been served on the tenants informing them that the Land Commission proposed to vest their holdings in them forthwith.</P>

Complaints regarding their depredations were received even in normal times, and the number of such complaints does not appear to have recently increased.  Firearms were not used to any great extent for their destruction even when no restrictions were imposed, trapping, snaring, and ferreting by professional operators being regarded as the most effective means of getting rid of the pest.  These methods can still be applied, and, to ensure success, only require to be adopted generally.  I do not consider it, therefore, necessary to have special inquiries instituted.  The poisoning methods adopted in other countries depend for their success largely upon the lack of herbage at certain periods of the year, and it is not considered that they would be effective in this country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash; Section 49.&mdash;To delete in line 17 sub-section (1) the words &ldquo;and shall be proclaimed a public holiday.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> In Section 49 of the Bill it was provided that the day for taking a referendum should be a public holiday.  That is a matter about which there is something to be said on both sides.  The feeling in the Seanad was that for the calling of a referendum it would not be a very popular thing, and would perhaps lead to the disuse of the referendum.  It was also felt that while a General Election for the Dáil may only take place every four years, with little loss of pay and business dislocation in consequence, a referendum might occur with a great deal of frequency.  There was a fairly strong feeling in the Seanad that the proclaiming of a holiday for the purpose of taking a referendum should not be provided for in law.  I take it it would be practicable to have the day proclaimed a public holiday if it were felt necessary.  It is a matter about which I have no great feeling one way or the other; but I do agree that if referenda were occurring fairly often, it would be impossible to have days proclaimed public holidays.  I think it is an amendment that the Dáil might agree to.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;proclamation,&rdquo; Sub-section (2), line 23, to add &ldquo;provided that the Minister may, with the assent of both Houses of the Oireachtas, postpone the date of such referendum for a period not exceeding nine months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of enabling the holding of a referendum to be postponed, the idea being that if a referendum on another subject had been held, it might be undesirable and prejudicial to hold the second one immediately. It might also happen that when a referendum was called for, some measure would be under consideration which, it was fairly certain, would lead to a demand for a referendum.  Then it might be a saving of time, trouble, and expense if the referendum were postponed, so that two or more subjects could be dealt with on the same date.  I think it is a good amendment.  I certainly believe that any great frequency in holding referenda would defeat the intention we had in mind when the Constitution was framed.  It is a device that can only be used infrequently and on special occasions. <Col N="24" /> If it is made onerous on the people by being resorted to too frequently, it certainly will break down.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 51&mdash;To add after the word &ldquo;offence,&rdquo; Sub-section (2), line 8, page 24, the following proviso:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided always that the disqualification effected by this sub-section on account of a sentence of imprisonment or penal servitude shall not, in the case of a person who is a member of the Dáil at the date of such disqualification, take effect until the expiration of thirty days from the date of the sentence, or in the event of an appeal, from the date of the order confirming such sentence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This provides that where a member of the Dáil, actually sitting, is sentenced to six months with hard labour, the disqualification shall not take place until he has an opportunity of appealing.  That is obviously fair.  The disqualification shall not take place until thirty days after the confirmation of the sentence, or until after the sentence is given.  The object of the amendment is to provide a way out in the case of a gross miscarriage of justice.  There was one very notorious case some years ago where, in the case of a prominent labour leader, the sentence was a gross miscarriage of justice, and had to be remitted.  If anything like that occurred in future&mdash;if there was any sentence that was a gross miscarriage of justice&mdash;there would be thirty days during which the matter might be ventilated, and if it were shown that a gross miscarriage of justice had taken place, the duty of the Executive would be to remit the sentence in the case of a member of the Dáil, just the same as in the case of an ordinary citizen.  That would ensure that disqualification would not take place through error.  It is strongly felt by the Government that where a man commits something which justly merits a sentence of six months with hard labour, he should not be a member of the Dáil.  There might be a case where a grossly unjust sentence would be given and I was authorised to accept this amendment when it was proposed in the Seanad.  It was felt that this would give an opportunity of preventing a disqualification clause operating where it should not operate.</P>

      <P>On this amendment I would like to say that it seems to me that the object sought for by the Seanad is not quite achieved.  I take it that the guardian of the privileges of the members of the Dáil is the Dáil rather than the Executive.  In a case of this kind if the 30 days occurred during the period when the Dáil is not sitting, the Dáil would not be able to raise its voice or influence the decision of the Executive with regard to the remission of the sentence.  That, I think, is an omission, and it should be remedied in some way by adding words making the 30 days lap over into the period when the Dáil is sitting; that the disqualification shall not occur until so many days elapse after the Dáil has resumed its sittings. I feel that in a case of this kind the decision of the Executive should be influenced as to whether the sentence is, if anything, an infraction of the privileges and rights of a member of the Dáil, not only punishing him for crime, but possibly increasing the period for the purpose of depriving him of membership. The Dáil itself should have some means of deciding whether the offence is one that makes the prisoner, as he would in that case be, unworthy of membership of the Dáil.  It should rather be left to the decision of the Dáil to say whether a man is worthy or unworthy of sitting in its councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was considered by the members of the Government, and it was felt as a matter of fact in practice that the general disposition of the magistrates would not be to increase the sentence for the purpose of disqualifying the accused.  It was felt, on the other hand, that it would be better not to make this a matter of voting and lobbying in the Dáil.  If you make it a case whether the Dáil could or should vote as to whether this sentence was one that should operate in the normal way, you might, where there was a close contest, have a man who might commit something that clearly ought to disqualify him, allowed to remain on as a member of the Dáil because his vote was required. It was felt that really the attitude should be that this particular person should be dealt with not as a member of the Dáil in this matter, but just as an ordinary member of the public.  If he was sentenced in the ordinary way, and there <Col N="26" /> was no case made out that his sentence was wrongfully given, or that it was unjust, and that he should not serve the sentence, then the Minister for Home Affairs would really consider it on that basis.  It would be for him to say that here was a man sentenced for an offence, and was his sentence such a one that the prerogative of a remission ought be exercised, and that he should be let out. If you do it on any other basis you certainly get to the stage where you probably would have the whole question on a purely Party vote in any case that would come up, and that would not be desirable. If we are to have any sort of fair administration of justice in the country, and if we are to have judges and magistrates who would do their duty reasonably well, then in normal cases they will not give sentences that will be unjust, and we feel that in the ordinary administration of justice a crime that involves a six months' sentence is a crime sufficiently heinous to disqualify a member from sitting in this Dáil.  We feel we ought to rely on the discretion of the Justice, and that the members of the Dáil might perhaps vote on Party lines.  The thing should be decided automatically by the Justice dealing with the offender brought before him, not as a member of the Dáil, but simply as an offender against the law, and that the Executive should not interfere, except only in such a way as if the offender was an ordinary member of the public.  Now, it would have to be a very gross miscarriage of justice if, within 30 days after being sentenced a man who got six months' imprisonment with hard labour would be let out and it would be something that the Minister for Home Affairs would have to justify and show there was no political partisanship involved. I think, on the whole, that a Minister who would have to answer for such a remission, and who had to take some responsibility would have less likelihood of going wrong, perhaps, than would a casual vote that would be called for in the Dáil; that was the feeling of the members of the Government when they considered the question of the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which the Minister brought forward that we ought to bear in mind when dealing with these questions.  Let <Col N="27" /> us look to the future and not to the past. The Judges that will be chosen will be for good or evil.  These Judges will be chosen by the Executive of this Dáil, and they will be the Judges selected by the Government of this people.  Let us have confidence that in the future we will have Judges inflicting sentence who will have the confidence and trust of the people, and let us stand over their decisions.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that we did touch upon when this question was before us we must think not only of the individual, but also of the constituency. The sentenced person, whoever he may be, will be in jail for six months, or perhaps for a period of penal servitude, and surely his constituents ought not to be disfranchised during that period, because a Party here&mdash;and we will always have Party Government with us whatever we may do&mdash;may say, &ldquo;We desire to whitewash our friend by passing a vote that he shall not be disqualified&rdquo; If they do not disqualify him, it disfranchises his constituency. That is not fair to the body of electors of this country, who have a right to be represented here.  It does seem to me that when a sentence of such weight as six months with hard labour&mdash;which is only a sentence inflicted in grave cases&mdash;or a sentence of penal servitude has been inflicted by a Justice selected by ourselves, the individual who has suffered that sentence ought not to keep his constituency disfranchised during the period he is serving the term.  I think that is a thing we ought to stand for both for the sake of ourselves, of confidence in our Justices, and of the electors who sent each individual here.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 54.</P>
      <P>Amendment 8&mdash;To insert immediately after Section 54 two new sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>55.  (1) If at a General Election any person is returned as a member of the Dáil for two or more constituencies, such person shall, by writing under his hand, delivered to the Clerk of the Dáil before taking his seat for any one of such constituencies, declare which one of those constituencies he elects to represent in <Col N="28" /> the Dáil; and if he does not so deliver to the Clerk of the Dáil such declaration in writing within one month after the first day on which the Dáil sits next after such General Election, he shall be deemed to have elected to represent the constituency in which he received the greatest number of first preferences.</P>
    <P>(2) So soon as a person so returned for two or more constituencies elects, or is under the foregoing sub-section deemed to have elected, which of such constituencies he will represent, he shall be deemed to have resigned his seat or seats in each of the other constituencies for which he shall have been so returned.</P>
    <P>56.  No member of the Dáil shall, while holding his seat, be eligible to be a candidate at a bye-election to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment introduces some new matter, but I think that it is matter that will commend itself to the Dáil.  It is not proposed by anything in the Bill that where a person who is returned for one constituency does not attend in the Dáil, he shall be disqualified, and a new election shall be held, but it is here provided that in case a person should be elected for two constituencies there shall be the possibility of declaring a vacancy in at least one of them in case the member should not turn up.  It also provides a means for making a member decide which of two seats he shall represent in case he does attend in the Dáil.  We have had in the Second Dáil and in the First Dáil cases of members sitting for two constituencies, and I think there were some members sitting for three constituencies.  That, I suppose, would not occur in normal circumstances in any country, and it might not occur again.  If it did occur, it might be possible to deal with it by Standing Orders. On the other hand, in view of the fact that there is a precedent for it, there might be some difficulty.  As present, as the Bill stands, there is nothing to prevent a member of the Dáil, in the case of a by-election, going and submitting himself as a candidate, and testing any views he may have on the electors in that way.  It is not felt that that is desirable. If a person who is a member of the Dáil wants to test the feelings of the electors, he ought to resign his seat and do so.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw your attention to what I think is an omission from this list of amendments. There was a small amendment passed in the Seanad which I do not see here, and I think we ought to pass it even though it is not on the Paper.  The object of the amendment was to put Section 55, which deals with disqualifications for membership of the Seanad, into the same form as Section 51, which deals with disqualifications of members for the Dáil.  The amendment would be that Sub-section 2 of Section 55 should be in the same form as Sub-sections 2 and 3 of Section 51, substituting the word &ldquo;Seanad&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; wherever it occurs.  That amendment was certainly before the Seanad, and was passed by the Seanad, but through some slip it does not appear on this Paper</P>

      <P>Amendment 14 stands with Amendment 15.  Amendment 14 is merely the form.  I notice there is a clerical error in it; a small amendment will have to be made and it will have to be returned to the Seanad.  This form is prescribed to be used in a case where there is more than one candidate of the same surname.  Heretofore, and as the Bill stands without this amendment, if there were two Doyles, for instance, in an election, there would be only the word &ldquo;Doyle&rdquo; in large letters in each case. It was pointed out by the Senator who moved the amendment that it would lead frequently to preferences being given in error.  People thinking of voting for William Doyle might not remember, where there were eight or ten candidates, that there was another Doyle, and might make their marks opposite the first name Doyle they saw on the paper, without looking into the matter any further; or they would have marked their paper wrongly, and would be put to the trouble of getting a new paper if they wanted to record their vote in the way they intended to do.  It is proposed in such cases that the Christian names should be printed large as well as the surnames.</P>
      <P>Then it was pointed out by the same Senator that in his own area on one occasion there had been quite a number of candidates of the same surname, and sometimes there were even candidates of the same surnames and the same Christian names, and it would be well in such cases to distinguish the candidates by either their addresses or their professions being printed in large type, so that people looking down the list would not be likely to vote for candidates other than the candidates they intended to vote for. I see in the two bottom names in this list the Christian names are different; they should be the same, and I would move that the form be adopted with the substitution of Thomas for William in the last name.</P>

      <P>There is a question that may be raised in connection with that, as to whether there is an improvement in insisting that the full name shall be printed in the same type.  It is not an uncommon thing to find surnames and Christian names&mdash;the first name and <Col N="35" /> the second name&mdash;reversible-Morrogh McCarthy and McCarthy Morrogh.  In that case the trouble with the elector would be just as great.  It would be worse, as a matter of fact, than by putting the name in large type.  The description probably would be as effective by itself.</P>

      <P>That is a difficulty that will arise, but, I think on the whole, that there was some improvement, and that this would help in certain cases, as compared with the system by which the surname would be printed in large type. It would be unlikely that there would be two sets of people with Christian names and surnames that might be interchangeable. It would be unlikely that there would be two people called &ldquo;James William,&rdquo; or anything like that.</P>

      <P>There is one matter that I think might perhaps be changed, and that is with regard to the designation of the two &ldquo;Patrick O'Briens.&rdquo;  One is described as a &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; and the other is described as a &ldquo;silversmith.&rdquo;  It is an important distinction, but there may be no difference. I think that the designation or description of a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; might disappear&mdash;not the habits of a gentleman, I hope&mdash;but the description a &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; and that both persons might be designated by their trade.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the form will have to go back to the Seanad for the insertion of &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;William&rdquo; in the last name.  It would be possible to consider at the time of printing as to putting the name in some slightly larger type from the surname.  I think that would meet the point raised by Deputy Johnson.  You could have the name &ldquo;Doyle,&rdquo; and then you could have the Christian name &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; not in block type, but in a smaller type of the kind. That, I think, would be a way out of the difficulty put forward by Deputy Johnson, and it would still meet the case, as <Col N="36" /> I understand it that the amendment from the Seanad is intended to meet the case of these two people with identical Christian names and surnames.</P>

      <P>As far as the schools are concerned, there is no doubt it is within the province of the Minister for Education to make provision as regards the attendance hours. On the general question there is an amendment down in the name of Deputy McCartan which will introduce local option, if it is carried by the Dáil.  The present motion by the Minister is that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill, and the first amendment to that is in the name of Deputy Byrne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. C. BYRNE Mr. C. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move to delete the words &ldquo;one hour&rdquo; in line 2, and to substitute the words &ldquo;thirty-five minutes.&rdquo;  I would remind the Dáil that <Col N="40" /> in other countries, such as England, where Summer Time has been adopted, they advance the clock by an hour.  The natural result of adopting such a measure in this country is that we would be putting on the clock one hour and twenty-five minutes, because for a number of years the clock has been advanced twenty-five minutes in Ireland.  A decision to advance the clock by an hour would at any time inflict great hardship and inconvenience on a very large section of the people, especially the agricultural community.  As a matter of fact, the twenty-five minutes increase did inflict great hardship and inconvenience on people in rural districts, and the purpose of my amendment is that if we are to have Summer Time, then let us have Irish Summer Time.  I know a number of arguments will be used against this amendment.  It will be said, for instance, that its adoption will cause great confusion to people travelling to England or across the border.  I would remind the Dáil that years ago, when crossing to England, we had to change our watches. We had not Summer Time then, and when we got to Holyhead we had to change our watches so as to conform with the English time.  On the Continent, in France, Germany, and Austria, Summer Time has been dropped, and I presume the same difficulties will arise between these countries and England as between this part of Ireland and across the border. People travelling in trains over the border will have to change their watches, but that is all the inconvenience that will be caused.  When the matter was under discussion on the last day the farmers' representatives pointed out the great inconvenience that will be caused to the agricultural community by the adoption of Summer Time.  Its adoption would mean that the farmers would have to get up an hour earlier.  From a very large part of the constituency that I represent, a big proportion of the milk supply to this city comes.  The result would be if Summer Time were adopted that the people engaged in that business would have to meet the trains an hour earlier than at present.  They would have to start work one hour and twenty-five minutes earlier than at present in the morning, and would knock off an hour and twenty-five minutes earlier in the evening, or, as I might say, during the <Col N="41" /> most valuable part of the day to people engaged in agriculture.  We hear a lot in these times about the will of the people. I certainly challenge any Deputy in this Dáil to say that the people of Ireland would vote for Summer Time.  I am convinced that if the question were put before them they would turn this proposal about Summer Time down.  I would urge the Dáil if we are going to have Summer Time, to give us something that will meet with the approval of that large section of the people engaged in the agricultural industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  It was stated here the last day that if there was a difference of time between England and Ireland it would lead to great inconvenience in the discharge of business.  Now, the business between England and Ireland is very important, no doubt, but this difference of time would not matter very much. France, which is a nation with a greater volume of business than ours was face to face with this question only the other day; that if they did not change their clocks in accordance with the English time there would be great inconvenience caused thereby.  The industrial and commercial portion of France were emphatically in favour of altering the clock in order to adjust it with British time, but the majority of the people of France were opposed to it, and the Government in France did not think they would be justified in ignoring the views of the majority. I sympathise with what Deputy Byrne said, that in these days it is time to drop ignoring the majority.  Some people think that it is a good thing to be in the minority, that when you are in the minority, you are nearly always sure to be right.  The majority of the people of Ireland do not want this Summer Time; it does not suit them.  In the matter of international trade, I contend that it is not such an obstacle.  The great obstacle to international trade that any man who travels experiences, is the different kinds of coin.</P>

      <P>To anyone who has faced and survived that difficulty, the question of the time is a small one altogether. On the last occasion Deputy McCartan pointed out that in the United States, in different portions of it, they have a different time; they have not the same <Col N="42" /> time in each place.  That being the case, I think there is not much point in the argument with regard to adjusting our time with international time.  Why, as Deputy Byrne points out, are we asked to go one better than the Englishman? This Bill is a concession to British sentiment. In the cities it is a good thing to give a full hour to the artisan and worker, but in this country, when you are asking the artisan to get up thirty-five minutes earlier, what is the reason for adding another thirty-five minutes? Is it because the Englishman does it? I submit that is no solid reason; it is no reason because he gets up one hour before his usual time.  I think one hour is a sufficient change to make in his life and in the life of the nation, and there is no reason why an additional thirty-five minutes should be asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread, I support the amendment.  If I had my way I would do away with the Bill altogether. The point I want to stress is this:  Ireland is the most westerly point of Europe.  West Clare is ten degrees west of Greenwich, and that means a difference of forty minutes in time.  On top of that you want to put another hour. In my opinion the inhabitants of the West of Ireland are more handicapped than any other people in Europe. Western France is only three degrees west of Greenwich.  When the people in Western France would not take three degrees, why should we take ten, which would mean a difference of forty minutes?  This question of opting out, that is arranging with the Minister for Education for the alteration of school hours, might be operative.  If the Minister for Education would agree, perhaps that could be done; but we are not satisfied with that kind of thing. We want to conduct our business in our own way.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Byrne says.  If we are to transact business in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people, we should make laws accordingly, and not legislate according to the desires of the minority.  Last week the Minister said that this Bill was going to save the nation's health and wealth.  To my mind it will mean a loss of work, and the Deputies on the opposite benches are losing time by it.  There is unemployment <Col N="43" /> enough in the country, and under this Bill it would mean doing away with, perhaps, one hundred hours' work.  That is, they would be losing wages for one hundred hours, and that ought to be remembered at a time like this.  What is the gain to the nation's wealth?  In my opinion it does not affect the nation's wealth.  I consider that where the majority of the people are against the measure, it is ill-becoming for a popular Government like ours to bring in a Bill of this sort.  I desire to support the amendment.  It does not go as far as I would like it to go, but I think it is better than nothing.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a suggestion.  There is a difference of eleven minutes between Dublin and the West of Ireland time.  I do not see why the convenience of the West of Ireland should not be consulted.  Instead of a thirty-five minutes change you should reduce it to twenty-four.  That is my suggestion.  As regards this matter about schools and school-time, in my part of the country they are continually growling when they do not adopt the new time and so have the children coming home from school at the same time and having dinner together.  That is the popular feeling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W.L. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally recognised that the workers in towns are more in favour of Summer Time than the people in the country.  In the country nearly every one observes the old time.  The Summer Time was opposed altogether or ignored.  People very seldom recognised it except when they had to catch a train.  Nobody was in love with it.  France and Germany dropped out, and in Canada the Manufacturers' Association have agreed to work an hour earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a great deal of point made in the argument particularly as affecting the West.  It is a case of losing twenty-five minutes Greenwich time and then adding eleven minutes for the West, that is making 36 minutes, which is the better part of an hour altogether, so that in the West it comes to this that seven o'clock in the morning would be only 25 minutes past five.  I think it ought to be considered in the towns, too.  It undoubtedly affects the people in the towns <Col N="44" /> who want to go to work early.  This would hit them very hard when Summer Time starts.  And then it is very cold in the mornings.  The fact is that people who have to be out at 6 will have to be going out a little after 4.30, 25 minutes to five to be correct.  The people in the West of Ireland would be going out before 4 o'clock.</P>

The milk supply of the country is a very important matter.  I represent a constituency that is very much interested in the milk supply, and in the Summer Time the people will have to get up practically in the middle of the night in order to milk their cows in time.

      <P>Deputy Cole spoke a profound truth when he said that in the country Summer Time is ignored altogether.  That is about the case for this Bill.  On the one hand, it has a very positive, a very considerable benefit for a large proportion of the population, and, on the other hand, the people on whom it does not confer benefits ignore it altogether. No one asks them to stop ignoring it altogether.  First of all, we had a certain amount of perfervid rhetoric about &ldquo;God's time,&rdquo; and that more or less worked itself out.  But now the suggestion is that, instead of an hour, we should have merely twenty-five minutes advance in the clock.  Well, it seems to me that if we take that line we would show a very poor sense of proportion. It would mean that for the sake of twenty-five minutes you are prepared to put up with the inconvenience of having <Col N="45" /> the time different from that of two countries alongside of us, with which we are economically very much bound up&mdash;a different time from England, Scotland and Wales, and a different time from six of our own counties in the North-East. I submit that would be a disadvantage out of all proportion to a mere matter of twenty-five minutes.  I would like to hold a mass meeting of the cows of this country and ask them how many of them are milked at four o'clock in the morning &mdash;what proportion of the bovine population of this country is milked at that hour.  As I said on introducing this Bill, it is simply a question of balancing one thing against another, and looking for the greater gain.  Now, what is the disadvantage?  When you come down to practical terms and get away from rhetoric, what is the practical disadvantage? And what proportion of the population is seriously affected by it?  Set against that the gain to practically all classes in the country other than the farmers&mdash;to all the town dwellers in Ireland, to the people in the shops, to all professional people in the country.  At heart, while they dearly love to bluster a little, the Farmers' Party in this Dáil is not unreasonable, <Col N="46" /> and it knows as well as I do that the Summer Time that was introduced into this county for the last five or six years has made little or no difference to them.  One point that was stressed particularly in the Second Reading was the point about children going to school.  It was pointed out by Deputy O'Connell that that is easily adjustable, that it was merely a matter of representations to the Minister for Education, who will, no doubt, show himself eminently reasonable.  Deputy Byrne's amendment suggests that for the sake of twenty-five minutes you are to suffer all the practical and commercial disadvantages of having a different time from Britain, and having a different time from six of our own counties in the North-East.  I submit that it is not worth while.  I strongly urge the Dáil to reject the amendment.  It is an amendment, although Deputy Byrne would not admit it even to himself, that is purely sentimental. He wants to get back to the real old Irish time.  If he succeeds, a great many people in all Ireland will have cause to regret it, and they will pay for the indulgence of sentiment.</P>

      <P>The next amendment is by Dr. McCartan &mdash;To add to Clause 1, Sub-Section (1), after the words &ldquo;of West European time,&rdquo;&ldquo;provided the Local Authority, i.e., Corporation, County Borough, Urban Council, or County Council so decide.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>At first sight this may seem a very confusing proposal on my part.  It might seem that Dublin having one time and the county having another would be very confusing.  I think the question would depend entirely on what time the trains would run.  I agree with the Minister for Home Affairs that Summer Time is a good thing for the cities, but I maintain that it is not a good thing for the agricultural districts.  In other words, it is a good thing in England, because England is a manufacturing country.  It is a bad thing in Ireland, because Ireland is an agricultural country, or largely an agricultural country. And as agriculture at the present time is our staple industry, I think we should look at it as above, or at least equal to any other industry in the country. I move this motion in the interests of agriculture in this country.  I saw recently that the French Chamber were discussing the Strasburg as against the Greenwich time, and a despatch to the London <i>Times</i>, of March 28th, says:&mdash;&ldquo;The measure has already been laid before the Chamber, and it is anticipated that it will have the united support of the Deputies who represent agricultural interests.&rdquo;  Agricultural interests in the Dáil seem to be taken as a joke, and the agricultural representatives seem to be taken as a joke also.  As I said, it is our most important industry, and its interests should get serious consideration. The farmers would be benefitted if the clock were put back instead of forward, but they do not wish to inconvenience the rest of the population.  They wish to be let alone.  I do not see why in the interests of the workers in the cities and the towns, or any other interest, the farmers should be inconvenienced.  If Dublin, for instance, wants to have new time, or Summer Time, by all means let them have it, but that should not be allowed to interfere with other parts of the country whose interests would be better served by sun time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said, in favour of the Summer Time Bill, that our commercial relations with England and Ulster are so important <Col N="48" /> that it would cause great confusion.  I saw in the United States while I was there the effect of observing different times.  The States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey are separated by the Delawar River.  The amount of intercourse, commercial and otherwise, between the two States is indicated by the number of trains and ferry boats across the river.  I know that from two or three wharves you get ferry boats crossing every ten minutes, and trains cross certainly every hour or every half-hour.  Many of the people living in New Jersey work in Philadelphia, and some of them who live in Philadelphia work in New Jersey, and they seem to get on very well notwithstanding the observance of different times.  I never saw any inconvenience, and I lived there for part of a summer. Further, I saw trains going from New York to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to New York where there were different times, and there was no inconvenience. There is a Stock Exchange in New York, and a Stock Exchange at Philadelphia, and there does not seem to be any inconvenience with regard to commerce between the two States.  Each place was allowed to do as it pleased, and there was no inconvenience.  I think if the trains ran here at the old time there would be no great inconvenience.  The only inconvenience would be our intercourse with England.  That is the only really important thing.  Our commercial intercourse with England, I think, is no greater than that of France with England, and yet the French and English times are different.  I know that there is a good deal of feeling that because a thing is adopted in England it should be adopted here, but conditions in the two countries are entirely different.  Another feeling&mdash;and I do not think it is enforced upon us by the terms of the Treaty&mdash;is that if it rains in London we ought to put up our umbrellas in Ireland!</P>

      <P>I think it is my own fault that I allowed Deputy Dr. McCartan to wander a little from his amendment, and I think the Minister is following him too far.  We have already passed an amendment that Summer Time shall be one hour in advance of West European time, and the question on this amendment is whether it is to be a matter of local option or not.  I think the discussion on the amendment ought to be confined to that, and I ought to have confined Deputy McCartan to the question as to the advisability of local option.</P>

      <P>Speaking on Deputy Dr. McCartan's amendment, I cannot accept the theory that it would be a good idea to make time throughout this country dependent on the majority vote of an Urban Council.  When I was very young I heard a song in which there was a refrain &ldquo;If you want to know the time ask a policeman.&rdquo; Deputy McCartan suggests that it might be altered with advantage, and that it should read &ldquo;If you want to know the time ask the Urban Council.&rdquo;  Simply, the effect of this would be, worked out to its logical conclusion, that in any Urban area you could have a different time prevailing from the time prevailing in the county, because the County Council might opt for one time and the Urban Council might opt for another.  If there was a Board of Guardians over in the corner of the county it might opt for something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a flippant amendment and a fantastic amendment.  It is an amendment altogether unworthy of the Deputy who proposed it.  He professes to be speaking in the interest of the agricultural <Col N="50" /> community.  While we all welcome any solicitude for agricultural interests from Deputy Dr. McCartan, I do not think he has in this matter taken a very intelligent line in support of those interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to be convinced as to the usefulness of the amendment that has been moved in this case by Deputy Dr. McCartan.  I do not think he has gone sufficiently far to explain the difficulties in the way of the operation of the amendment.  We have the difficulty of a County Council fixing a different time from that selected in the urban area or in the borough area.  We all know that the time-tables for railways are worked out at the headquarters of these railways.  We can all imagine the difficulty there would be in the County Dublin, for instance, where you have men like Deputy Byrne, of considerable personal influence, preferring thirty-five minutes, and people who for sentimental reasons prefer the old Irish time, as against the provisions of this Bill.  We can imagine the morning mail starting from Kingsbridge according to the time suggested by the Government, and arriving at Inchicore to find the old time in operation there, and passengers being obliged to wait for an hour until the train would we allowed to proceed beyond the signal.  If Dr. McCartan realises difficulties such as these, and if he wants to convince members of the Dáil as to the usefulness of his amendment he should have given us an explanation of these matters.  I do not think there is any use in throwing water on a drowned rat, but Deputy McCartan has stated that the Farmers' Party are being made a joke of in this Dáil.  I think that he, or anybody who moves an amendment such as this is entitled to be joked at, particularly when he does not explain the real difficulties that I refer to.</P>

      <P>It is in the interests of the farmers of France, and of the farmers of America not to have Summer Time, and I suppose the interests of the Irish farmers are as important as the interests of the farmers of these two countries.  Deputy Davin referred to the difficulties in connection with the railways, and the differences of time along the lines.  In America, where I saw it in practice&mdash;I am speaking from experience&mdash;the railway times were the same. You left Philadelphia at a certain time according to the platform clock, and it was the same time that was in operation until you crossed into New Jersey, where the time was different.  And so it is here.  Supposing Dublin adopts Summer Time and Kildare does not, the train from Kildare would have to run at the old time, but it would not make any difference whether it ran at one time or at the other.  It would be a question for the railways themselves.  The railway time would be the same all over the country.  If you lived at Kildare and you left Dublin at 12 o'clock and arrived at Kildare, you would reach the latter place at 1 by the clock but it would be 12 o'clock in Kildare.  That was the way in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  It may be said I do not know a lot about farming, but I was raised upon a farm, and the farmers are looking ahead on this matter.  I had a communication from the Secretary of the Farmers' Association in my district, and I suppose the Minister for Home Affairs had the same, asking that the Dáil would not enact Summer Time.  I had one when I was going up for election and I had another since, and I am voicing the view of my constituents when I ask that this be made a matter of local option.  The people in Tullamore do not mind what you do in Dublin, but they want to have the right to do what suits them and suits their needs in their own district.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  The Minister has made out a very good case for the <Col N="52" /> application of this Bill to the towns and the cities, and I, for one, would be very sorry to oppose the application of this Bill to towns and cities if it applied only to towns and cities.  I urge the Minister very seriously to give consideration to this amendment.  He evidently wants to serve the interests of townsmen and city men, and I submit to him he could do that without applying this Bill to the entire country.  To take such a wide scope to accomplish a small thing is like the action of the Chinaman: When he wanted to roast his pig he set fire to his house.  It is the right of the town dwellers and the city dwellers to get the extra hour in the evening, and, if necessary, to get up an hour earlier in the morning, but why insist upon another man getting up an hour earlier when it is not necessary?</P>

      <P>The Minister says he does not.  Well, I come to that point. The attitude the Minister is facing is difficult.  He wants this change to come in and not be a hardship to anybody. He says to the majority of the Irish people, &ldquo;You can ignore this law.&rdquo;  I say that is a very unfortunate bit of advice to give to any people.  It is time now to make laws that will be respected. We have ignored laws long enough, which were of an injurious character to our people; but some of these laws were most desirable, yet because of their source we ignored them and fought them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, may I say I am not inclined to suggest any disregard of a mandatory law.  That certainly would not befit me in the position I hold.  This is a law which says that the official time of the country will be so and so, and anybody who does not like it need not take any notice of it.  There is no law that can compel Deputy Gorey to get up an hour earlier than he wants to, or to set his clock at any time other than the time he wants to.  That is not suggested by this Bill.  What is suggested is that the official time of the country shall be one hour in advance of a certain period, and anyone whom that does not suit need not take any notice of it.  I am not advocating disregard of or disobedience to a mandatory law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite aware of that distinction, but I say it is too fine for the man in the street.  He is told this is the law of the Dáil, and that he ought to respect the law of the Dáil, but if he wakes up and says, &ldquo;Am I to get up according to the law of the Dáil?&rdquo; and his brother says, &ldquo;You can have another hour's sleep, for this is one of the laws you need not mind&mdash;you can ignore it&rdquo;&mdash;the effect would be very bad.  This amendment gets out of that difficulty. It gives power to the County Councils to say that the law does not apply to their area if they wish.  That is a sensible thing to do, and it will make for respect for the law.  It does not interfere with the artisan in the town, or the city, and that is quite right.  All it says is that that particular law does not suit our rural areas and we do not want it. That is a very sensible arrangement, and it guards against the danger that arises from having one law that is to be obeyed and another that can be ignored. This law does not affect only the agricultural industry, it also affects the fishing industry.  Take the mackerel industry. The men, in order to get their nets out, have to get to certain places by train, and formerly they got to these places after six hours' work, but under this Bill, they will have to get there after five hours' work, and that is a serious handicap. The argument that we must have uniformity with England or any other country reminds me of the old Unionist argument.  The man who wants that kind of uniformity will also object to the Gaelic language, because he wants uniformity.  This desire for uniformity applies a thousand-fold stronger in the case of the language.  You cannot ignore the fact that the sun does not come to us as soon as to other people.  We have to put up with that, but it stops longer with us than with other people. Now, with regard to the time table, as far as the trains are concerned, that does not present any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway companies hitherto have fixed their time-tables to suit themselves, and they will do so in the future.  Last year the auctioneers through the country put &ldquo;new time&rdquo; and &ldquo;old time&rdquo; on the posters announcing their auctions, and that got over their difficulty.  We were told that the Minister for Education can regulate the school hours.  That is very satisfactory, and I am sure he will do so. <Col N="54" /> The Postmaster-General, I suggest, ought to be able to give an assurance with regard to the Post Office.  If the people who work, say, up to 7 o'clock Summer Time come to the Post Office and find when they get there that the Post Office people are going to bed there will be a great deal of inconvenience caused.  They go there at 5 o'clock, according to their time, to find that the Post Office has been closed at 6 o'clock.  If a locality decides, in its own wisdom, to go by the old time, the Post Office should meet the wishes of the locality just as the schools do.  If the trains go an hour earlier, and the postman has to make up his letters an hour earlier, the people there will have to find that out as they had to do with regard to the trains hitherto.  I think, if you allow the County Councils to have local option in this matter, you will preserve all the advantages of this Bill, without its disadvantages.</P>

      <P>I would not give the weight of a match for a vote on either one side or the other, on any of these amendments, only this one, and I am certainly going to oppose Deputy McCartan's amendment.  Supposing we had Deputy McCartan and Deputy Sears in the one town, and suppose Deputy McCartan went to the Co. Council and got them to adopt a particular time, and that Deputy Sears went to the Disrict Council and got them to adopt another time, then you would have Co. Council time and District Council time in that area, and then, of course, the chapel bell might be rung at another time altogether.  What is time?  What is the definition of time, or what is the duration of time?  It is not easy to have any convention with regard to time.  The day is not 24 hours long, it is only 23 hours 58 minutes and 57 seconds, and no convention that can be laid down&mdash;no clock, at least, can be made that you can rely upon as an exact convention of time.  The day is not the unit.  The year had to be taken as the unit.  Suppose we take the day as a unit, well, take half-way between sunrise and sundown, that is what we call noonday, and ordinary people will think that the middle of the day is&mdash;the ordinary sun's time&mdash;12 o'clock for that place.</P>

      <P>We know if we went by the sun's time in a place that in one part of the year the sun's time would be a quarter of an hour in advance of the clock's time.  I think that occurs about the 1st of May or some time in April.  It would be in advance sometime&mdash;going on towards November it would be a quarter of an hour behind the sun's time.  Therefore, the day could not be taken as the unit, nor even the year cannot be taken as a unit, because even a leap year, which comes once in four years, would not compensate for the irregularity in the timetable. I think it is about every four hundred years that there is one leap year that is not counted.  As I have stated already, the only thing we want is to <Col N="56" /> have a proper convention of time.  If we were to have local option every man would go by his watch; he would wind it up and would go by it, or he would wind it up and let it off and say &ldquo;this is time, and I will depend on my watch.&rdquo;</P>

If city people like it we have no objection, but apart from a few of the large cities I do not think that the smaller towns are in favour of this measure at all.  It may be all very well for places like Cork, Limerick, Belfast and Dublin, but the ordinary country towns do not want it. They will go by whatever time is fixed for the rural areas, because that is what suits them.  With regard to what Deputy O'Donnell asks as regards a definition of time, the only answer I can give is that I know the difference between day and night, and the sun's light is good enough for me.  We are going to vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>For some time past there have been very suggestive items of news appearing in the London papers in regard to conditions in the Army here. One of the latest is a dispatch which appeared in the London <i>Times</i> of April 7th. The Dublin correspondent of that paper says:&mdash;&ldquo;Rumours concerning proposed changes in the National Army have been in circulation in Dublin during the past few weeks.  It is impossible to trace them to their origin, but the general feeling seems to be that the Civil arm of the Government does not exercise sufficient control over the Army, and that the combination of the offices of Minister of Defence and Commander-in-Chief does not make for military efficiency.  There is a movement on foot to bring the Army more directly under the Civil Authorities; but the matter is extremely delicate, and is not likely to come to a head until the Dáil meets next week after the Easter Recess.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Morning Post</i>, of April 9th, two <Col N="59" /> days later, there is another article on the same subject.  It was copied into the <i>Belfast News Letter</i>, of April 10th.  In that article very serious statements are made which call for an explanation or a statement of some kind from the Government. It is suggested in that article that the Commander-in-Chief or the Minister for Defence intrigued while in the Army to put at the head of the Army the members of a secret organisation.  If that is so, it is a serious offence.  It is serious if that was the objective, and I think that it should be denied, or there should be something said about it.  The article states: &ldquo;Two things were concentrated upon&mdash;the raising of the gunmen stalwarts of the Irish Republican Brotherhood to the superior jobs at Portobello and elsewhere, and the elimination of British officers and others who, it was suspected, might behave inconveniently in case the flower of bright Republicanism should suddenly blossom on General Mulcahy's baton.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, the article states: &ldquo;The general idea of the intriguers was to make the Irish Republican Brotherhood the connecting link between the Republicans and the Free State Army.  Needless to say, Cosgrave, O'Higgins and the rest of the Cabinet knew what was on foot long before General Murphy discovered it, and they have been working hard to get the Free State Army really under Cabinet control, but until the last week or two, Portobello has been too much for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on it is stated: &ldquo;With Hurley at Portobello a game began to be positively apparent, and the Cabinet finally screwed up its courage, or to be more accurate Kevin O'Higgins screwed up the rest of the Cabinet's courage, to do something about it.  It has been done, and not, one may believe, without a good deal of opposition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally it is stated: &ldquo;The Army Council has been abolished, and Mulcahy ceases, as President of that triumvirate, to exercise supreme control over the Free State Forces.  He remains Minister of Defence, of course, but that is a constitutional position in which he is closely under the supervision of the Parliament.  In place of the Army Council, Military affairs are placed in the hands of a Cabinet Committee of Defence consisting of five members.  These are Cosgrave (President), O'Higgins <Col N="60" /> (Vice-President), Mulcahy, McMahon, and McGrath, the Minister of Labour. To this Committee two military advisers have been appointed.  They are Generals Murphy and Dan Hogan.  The latter is a brother of the Minister of Agriculture and a young man who, though lacking Murphy's experience, showed himself, when in command of the Limerick area both able and resourceful and, what is more to the point, a pertinacious rebel hunter with no friends in the enemy camp.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know that statements by individuals are very hard to get into the Press at the present time.  We know also the Government has a Publicity Department. This is evidently given out by somebody or other, and anyone who has experience in the running of a Government knows that to do things he has to get items of news printed in an out of the way paper and let them come back then and be copied somewhere else.  This news has been copied into the North of Ireland papers and printed in England, but it is not allowed to be printed in the Free State.  Perhaps the idea is to keep the people who are intimately concerned with the Free State affairs in ignorance, or perhaps the thing may be a newspaper story and may have no foundation, but I think the whole thing is sufficiently important to have an authoritative statement on the matter from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard of this matter being raised in the Seanad this evening.  I have not seen the <i>Morning Post</i> article nor the article that appeared in the London <i>Times</i>, and I do not know anything about them.  I have not read those papers; and I am not in the habit of learning what is happening in this country from papers that are published outside of this country.  It appears to me there is an attempt in this case to drive a wedge between the Government and the Army.  There is no such chasm as is indicated in this article.  There is as far as I know, an evident hostility in this article, evident as far as opposition or hostility to both the Army and the Government is concerned.  I do not know what is behind it.  It has not come from Government sources that I am aware of.  It has not come through any source over which the Executive Council has got any control that I am aware of, or that any other member of the Government that I know of is aware <Col N="61" /> of.  It is one of those things which occur very often during the lifetime of any Government.  I have read articles dealing with other Departments, other than the Army, in some papers that are hostile to us, and they are articles which could only have been written by some person who was moved by no other motive than an endeavour to shake confidence in the Government or in the staple conditions that are gradually evidencing themselves in this country. The most recent cases that have come under my notice are in connection with the Sailors' and Soldiers' Housing Act, and the apparent idea behind it was that we were hostile to that Act, and that the Minister for Defence was himself hostile to it, and did not wish to see the Act put into operation.  Now, there has been no discussion, good, bad, or indifferent at any time between the Minister for Defence and myself in connection with that Act, or between the Minister for Defence and the Executive Council. We agreed to appoint General Sir Bryan Mahon as a Trustee of this Act some time ago, and we have not at any time indicated an unwillingness or any desire to interfere with the occupation of houses provided under that Act by people for whom they were intended&mdash;that is, ex-soldiers of the Great War, as it is called. I do not know if it be the intention of members of the Dáil to raise matters which appear in newspapers not circulating, or, at least, not published or printed in the country, and under the control of the Government.  At any moment those questions may arise.  I have seen some foreign newspapers which make extraordinary comments upon the situation here.  I have met people from other countries who have come here and who have told us that they were amazed, after reading those newspapers, to find the condition of affairs existing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the intention be to disturb a situation which is gradually approaching normal conditions in this country I think that this Dáil is entitled to pay no attention whatever to the newspapers that start a hare of that sort, and which have not certainly got the best interests of this country at heart.  As far as I am concerned the Minister for Defence as a member of the Executive Council has my entire and implicit confidence, and there is no intention, as far as I know, of interfering with <Col N="62" /> his position.  I do not know, except for the purpose of exploding those things, that there is any use in bringing them up here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The fairly insistent suggestions in rather highly placed and influential British newspapers, from time to time, that in the first place the control of the Army had passed from hands that were guided by National inspiration, and that actually the control of the Army had passed to hands that had Imperial training might have some implication to some of us, but we can leave it, I think, to the common sense of the English people to deal with anything there might be in any implications of that kind.  The fact that those things appear in English newspapers would mean nothing to us if there was not stirred up, as a result of that, criticism of somewhat the same kind here.  The main criticism we find at the present moment is that the Army is not under civil control, and is not responsible to or not responsive to this Parliament.  That is a position that I and everybody associated with me in the Army are most jealous, should be absolutely safeguarded, I think that the members of this Dáil and the public at large, though they might be inclined to slip into little criticisms of one sort or another, from time to time, must feel fundamentally that the Army is perfectly responsive to the Government in its actions.  There is another point that I feel, from time to time, more or less put into the dock about.  I feel from time to time to be more or less put in the position here in this Dáil and elsewhere that I am more a soldier defending the Army in any blessed thing that the Army does than a responsible cog in the Government machine, for controlling the Army, and I feel that I am put into the position of standing up for and defending an inefficient Army and saying that it is efficient.  I think that anybody who has his eyes about him can speak for the efficiency of the work that the Army has done.  We have taken a very, very scattered situation and gradually pulled the threads of it so tight that you are able to see in the rough what the general effect of the work of the Army has been, in some of the southern counties by the documents you got recently.  And it speaks of the final work of control in the Army that the operation in which the unfortunate Liam Lynch lost his life the <Col N="63" /> other day was dictated from Headquarters here by wireless 24 hours before that.  You have an Army as efficient as it has been possible to give you, and, I think, you should fully realise it and fully realise that there is no other group but the group that is controlling the Army at the present time that could have given you that Army.  The dragging into public of this particular matter drags also into public in a suggestive kind of way that there is something dark and sinister and mysterious, at any rate, in the minds of those who are controlling the Army, and you have it pointed out that the &ldquo;Boo&rdquo;&mdash;I.R.B.&mdash;is there.  If the spirit of work and the spirit of obligation, and the spirit of true disinterestedness, and a true appreciation of the country's strength and position-if that spirit which Tom Clarke and MacDermott and Pearse embodied, if that is the spirit, which for libelling purposes you can call the I.R.B., then that is our spirit.  The men who are specifically mentioned in this article as being heinous persons grappling the Army for their own sinister purposes and getting it from under the control of the Government, who are they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the men who practically controlled your Army for the last three or four or five years, and the spirit in which they control the Army to-day is the spirit in which they controlled it yesterday. We find ourselves to-day with Collins and Griffith gone&mdash;a nation that for decades past has leaned itself upon some national leader of one kind or other, We find ourselves to-day, whether for good or ill, without, perhaps, anything in the shape of a national leader.  A national leader alone would not have sustained us in the holding together of this country under the strain of the past three or four years if you had not built up around him national institutions.  You find yourselves to-day without a national leader, and&mdash;who knows?-without a National Party.  And we are concerned in the Army, at any rate, in providing you with, and holding for you, a national institution that will be at the service of this Government and that will be a strength to this country.  When people lightly talk of the Army and lightly criticise the Army, let them consider that particular position, and let them also consider that those who are controlling the Army at the present time and dealing <Col N="64" /> with the military situation are digging deep down the roots of that institution. I think those who control the Army to-day have fairly well made it to be realised to the country what they feel with regard to the Army.  We do not believe we are organising an Army here in Ireland for war.  We do believe that it would be as disastrous at any time to get into war with a neighbouring country&mdash;whether we were to emerge from it successfully or not&mdash;as it was disastrous for France to get into war with Germany.  We are not building a war machine.  We are not building a machine that, as somebody said, is simply &ldquo;a band of armed men preying on the country.&rdquo;  We are building a machine that, in the first place, has pulled the country through the very difficult situation it got into, and which, in the second place, will be the home for the development of all those particular characteristics which will go to make an Irish character we may be proud of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper which has been quoted from has for several years set itself out to libel every man in this country who is trying to do good work in the national cause.  The Dublin special correspondent-a very able, flippant newspaper writer-has been particularly offensive in his regular attacks upon the character of those who have been leading public affairs in Ireland during the past few years.  He has sometimes been able to get hold of information respecting intimate matters concerning Government.  Frequently he was able to get hold of such matters under the old regime, but he has occasionally been able to get hold of such matters under the new regime.  But no matter what truth there may be in any specific statement, the general character of his writings discounts everything which is truthful in his articles.  Nobody on this side of the Channel, and I do not think very many on the other side, will read those articles except for the purpose of extracting a laugh, or feeling that he is a word-manipulator at any rate.  The statement of the Minister for Defence is reassuring&mdash;I should not say reassuring&mdash;it is a further assurance that he, at any rate, desires to keep the Army under the control of the civil authority.  I, for one, never doubted that that was his desire and intention, and I believe that if the Army were under his control we would have much less to complain of and to criticise than we have. <Col N="65" /> I fear that it is not sufficiently under his control and that that fact is responsible for many of the things that we would much prefer we did not hear of or see.  I shall not pursue that at the moment, because I shall have to take another opportunity of raising matters in connection with the conduct of the Army.  I feel that we ought to say that the Minister <Col N="66" /> has our confidence as the head of the Army, and we hope that his spirit and his determination will really and in fact inspire the Army, and that it will not be allowed to be over-ridden by those who would undo the good work he tries to do.</P>
