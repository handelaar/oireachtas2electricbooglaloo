      <P>The answer is in the negative as regards the Dáil election, and the date for Municipal elections is at present the 12th September.  Both dates depend on the date fixed for the coming into force of the Register, and the printing is not yet sufficiently advanced to admit of the latter date being fixed with certainty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether, with reference to reply given by the Minister for Agriculture on 20th June, 1923, it is intended to introduce an Allotments Bill during the present session of An Dáil; whether such Bill would apply only to the <Col N="2" /> larger urban centres, as indicated, and whether he considers it expedient that the administration of allotments should be undertaken by separate Government Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone into this personally and exhaustively and I find that the sub-office at Finglas Road was discontinued on vacancy as the needs of the district were considered to be fully met by the existing offices in the locality.

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that it is alleged that on Friday, June 15th, about 100 members of the I.T.G.W. Union, concerned in the County Waterford Farm Dispute, who were waiting to receive dispute pay on the roadside at Newtown, Co. Waterford, were ordered off the road by Drill Instructor McFadden of Carroll's Cross, who was in charge of a party of military; that on the men adjourning <Col N="4" /> to an adjacent school, Drill Instructor McFadden followed them, and after placing a guard on both doors of the school, addressed the men, using very offensive and threatening language, and in the course of which he is alleged to have stated he was there to uphold the rule of the rifle, and that, if necessary, he would take out some of those present into the adjacent field, and put the red badge (the badge of the I.T.G.W.U.) through their hearts with a bullet, and to ask whether the Minister will order that an inquiry will be held into these allegations.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the allegations and have had no representations on the matter from any person, nor any statement of the alleged facts.  I am having inquiry made with a view to ascertaining to what extent, if any, any soldier on the occasion in question exceeded his duty.  The troops are acting with tact and discretion in their very difficult task in Waterford.  In view of the serious nature, and the possible inflammatory tendency of such suggestions as are contained in the question, I regret the Deputy should make a question in this particular form take the place of representations to me in some other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to approach civilians in the matter.  A certain allegation has been made with regard to the action of certain soldiers. They are not even allegations.  I am going to make an inquiry of the Army officials who were present at the time, as to what exactly took place.  If, as a result of these inquiries, any further action on my part is necessary, that action will be taken.  As a preliminary step, that is the action I am going to take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill of which I now move the Second Reading codifies the existing law with certain alterations and changes in relation to the prevention of corrupt practices.  In the law as it stands at present are embodied sections of quite a number of Acts, such as the Representation of the People Act, 1850, the Corrupt Practices Act, 1854, the Ballot Act, 1872, the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1883, the Parliamentary Election Corrupt Practices Act, 1885, the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1895, and the Representation of the People Act, 1918. Besides codifying the law, certain changes that the experiences we have had in this country have shown to be necessary, are being made.  There are new penalties for personation and new powers are given for arrest, and for other steps for the prevention of personation. Heretofore a police officer could only <Col N="10" /> take a person in charge for personation if he were directed to do so by the Presiding Officer.  Under this Bill it is proposed to give him power to act in the same way as he would in the case of any other offence against the law being committed.  It is proposed, therefore, to indemnify the Returning Officer and policeman in case he acts without malice.  Of course if there is malice proven, or if there is anything else wrong in that way the indemnity would not hold.  The matter of personation has been regarded as almost a sort of legitimate practice in the past.  Both sides have caused men personating to be arrested, and then there was a sort of exchange of prisoners at the end of the day, and the offenders on both sides were released.  The thing continued in that way, and at the next election these people probably felt there was no danger in impersonating and they were quite ready to do it.  Personation has become a habit, and it is a matter that it is very necessary to take such steps as we can to put an end to it.  We also propose to provide that the offence of personation can be dealt with summarily.  It is one of the things for which it is very difficult to secure a conviction if tried before a jury, and it would be more difficult if during the next few months people were brought before juries on charges of personation. There will be certainly a great likelihood that in any jury that might be empannelled there will be somebody who had been guilty of the practice himself. We feel it is even more important to have a certainty of conviction if there is evidence given that proves the case and that there should be a conviction rather than that the punishment should be very severe.  If a man gets five or six months imprisonment it will serve to deter him quite as well from practising offences of this sort as if he got a much longer term.  It is a matter in which people should feel that the risk of being detected and punished for it is very considerable.  We have had to make provision in this Bill for the carrying out of a Referendum.  It might be argued that there is no need for personating agents at a Referendum.  I think in very many countries where the institution of the Referendum exists there is nothing in the way of personating agents appointed, but in view of recent practices we feel that some provision should be <Col N="11" /> made that would allow machinery to be set up to detect and prevent personation. No sort of State machinery can be set up.  If you take your Presiding Officer he will not do anything, ordinarily speaking, to prevent personation.  The Presiding Officer is a man from the locality generally; he is paid a certain fee for acting for the day.  He is not going to do anything in the ordinary way that will incur odium if he can avoid doing it, and any amount of personation might go on, and the Presiding Officer might certainly take no steps to stop it. He would allow it to go on.  You cannot appoint from the State personating agents either, because you would be in the same difficulty.  A man employed in four years for a day is not going for the sake of the fee he gets or the hope of being employed again, to offend his neighbour or to take any strong action.</P>
      <P>If agents were appointed and paid by the State the money would be spent without result.  We have provided machinery in this Bill which we think will enable political parties to be brought into action.  There can be appointed, if a Referendum is demanded, a man who will challenge the Bill.  He will have power to get personating agents to attend in the booths and to stop people who are endeavouring to personate.  On the other hand, if the Bill is passed&mdash; as it must be passed by the Dáil before there is a Referendum&mdash;there can be appointed somebody who will act as sponsor, who will appoint somebody as agent in each county who will have power to send people to act in the booths in case personation is attempted.  The machinery is not perfect, but it seems the best that can be devised.  This work that may be done by political parties in furtherance of their own politics, with a view either to have the Bill carried or defeated, seems to be the best that can be accomplished. It certainly does seem necessary, in view of the extent to which personation has been carried on in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain other changes have been made. For instance, in the past, it was illegal to hire cars for elections.  Of course, cars were continually hired and the prohibition was rather in the nature of a farce. Then it was illegal to make payments for bands, ribbons, etc.  It does not seem that there is any real objection to spending <Col N="12" /> money on them, and in any case money was always spent in that way. We have withdrawn the limit of expenditure that a candidate may incur.  It was very difficult to fix upon a limit that would be suitable in the present circumstances, with Proportional Representation. The limit which might be reasonable in a three-member constituency might be inadequate in a nine-member constituency, where there would be a large number of booths scattered all over the constituency.  On the other hand, if you allowed the sum that would be reasonable for a nine-member constituency, it would be too much for a candidate who would seek support in a more restricted area. There is also the fact that the law was entirely ignored in this matter.  The agents habitually made returns showing an expenditure of a few hundred pounds, whereas, the expenditure really amounted to £1,400, or £1,500.  It seems to me to be better simply to insist on a return being made and to hope that in the future we shall have accurate returns&mdash;a thing that was not done in the past.  In that way we could come down on people who expended money in a way that was forbidden in the Act, and we would not trouble at all so much about the entire amount of money spent.  It is doubtful whether expenditure on the part of any candidate would be likely to influence the result in the same way that it might have done in the past, when there was a straight fight between two candidates.  Those are matters that are new and that are capable of being improved.</P>
    <P>There is not much new in principle in the Bill.  It is mainly a codification of the existing law.  The changes are chiefly changes of detail, and it seems to me that a good deal of attention might be given to the consideration of the clauses in Committee, but as the general principle of the Bill is one about which there cannot be a great deal of difference of opinion, I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the whole membership will be glad to support the Second Reading of this Bill.

I think it is, therefore, not necessary to go into any considerable <Col N="13" /> discussion on it at this stage. I desire to raise one small point that may be of importance or of no importance. The short title of the Bill is &ldquo;The Prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill, 1923.&rdquo; The long title of the Bill deals with corrupt practices and illegal practices, and makes provision for &ldquo;the prevention of such practices and abuses at elections to Seanad Eireann, and at a Referendum and for other purposes connected therewith.&rdquo;  Presumably, that means connected with &ldquo;abuses.&rdquo;  I raise the point whether Section 50 is strictly within the title, and if it is not whether we should not amend the title so that there may be no ruling out of order later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill on which there will be general agreement in the Dáil.  One might go further and say that there will be general agreement in other places, even amongst those who might in the past have been professionally or otherwise responsible for a good deal of the electoral guile that this Bill is intended to counteract.  The purpose of such a Bill must necessarily enlist general support.  I remember being very deeply impressed at the last election by the statement of a foreigner at present in this country who happened to have witnessed a good deal of the wholesale personation that then took place.  He was a Scandanavian, and he stated to me impressively, because of his ingenuousness in the matter, that in Scandanavia, whether in Norway or Sweden, any person guilty of impersonation would be regarded and treated as a criminal.  Of course, such persons are criminals&mdash;they are not merely lieing, they are robbing.  They are robbing other people of what is their essential property, as citizens.  The Minister in proposing this Bill justly stated that it was not, in fact, more than a consolidation of previous enactments in the matter, with certain slight amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without expressing any general disagreement with the Bill, or with that procedure, I would like to say that I would have liked to have thought that this Bill could have been so drafted as not merely to penalise offences which it does do and adequately and satisfactorily does, but if possible to do what is admittedly a much more difficult thing to attempt to do, and that is to obviate some of those abuses.  I think it would be admitted that any attempt to obviate <Col N="14" /> abuses of this kind would be very difficult, but it would have been worth the attempt.  It has been attempted in other countries with a great deal of success. Let me touch upon the single case of impersonation, a great evil which it is necessary to penalise and obviate if it is possible to obviate it.  In other countries it has been found possible that a voter shall bring with him his attestation as a voter.  Now, I know that is a very difficult thing to do.  It has been done in several countries.  Methods have been outlined by which it can be done in Ireland.  I think it is not impossible to do it, and I suggest it would be worth while to get the voter when he comes to register his vote, to hand in some form of certificate which would be a proof that he or she was the person so certified on the register.  That, however, has not been done.</P>
    <P>One other omission I desire to draw attention to, which, I hope, it will be possible to obviate in the Committee Stage, but which it is right to refer to in this stage, because I think it is a very glaring omission.  Inasmuch as it would be very difficult for any private Deputy to deal with the matter adequately by an amendment in Committee Stage, because of the lack of machinery, I suggest to the Minister that he might think over the question of intimidation in the meantime. Intimidation is not dealt with in this Bill.  Intimidation has very markedly occurred not only in one election, but in several elections.  I would like to have, in any prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill passed by this Dáil, a definition with a very stringent penalty that any person even professing to interfere with the normal course of an election should be held open to some penalty of a drastic kind, and that the parading of arms or of any weapons whatever during the course of an election should be penalised in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>Having studied the procedure adopted for the taking of referendums in other countries I am slightly surprised at Section 23, and the adoption of a definite sponsor and a definite challenger.  It is undoubtedly a very carefully thought out matter in the Bill, and may be regarded at this Second Reading as a principle of the Bill, but I do not know that a procedure of this kind is adopted for referendums in other countries, and I am not sure that the principle is the right <Col N="15" /> one.  I think it would be very much better to leave the matter to the elector acting by referendum without bringing the question of personalities in at all. The Minister will perceive instantly what I am referring to.  If you are going to get a challenger put down by name, and a sponsor put down by name under any motion carried by referendum, the question underlying that referendum will undoubtedly be tied up with the merits and demerits of the personal qualities of the sponsor.  That is inevitable, and is a thing that is highly desirable to avoid.  In other countries the question is put down so that it will be possible for an elector exercising the referendum to record his opinion, yea or nea, in respect of a particular measure, having taken his or her conclusion on that matter without a very clear recognition of who might be the sponsor, or who might be the challenger.  If it be possible to remove the question of those personalities it is very desirable that it should be done.  It is a case of procedure, and I think what has been done in the Bill in this regard is not the very best that could have been done.</P>
    <P>Certainly I am bound to say that so far as I am concerned, I regard it with a considerable amount of apprehension.  I hope it is not the case that the procedure of the Referendum will be made any more cumbersome than it need be.  It is unnecessarily cumbersome.  It is adopted in all Constitutions, and in all Constitutions it is not confused with any question of who might be in favour of the Bill or who might be against it.  There are two other omissions to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister. The first is: Has it been decided that the returning officer or the presiding officer, whoever he may be, shall not be absolved from responsibility if, considering all the circumstances, he were to regard it as his duty, but without any advice from the personation agent, to cause an arrest for personation?  I know a case that occurred at the last election in the constituency which I represent, County Dublin.  I drew the attention of the Presiding Officer to the fact that personation was occurring on a very large scale, and he replied that he knew it was occurring on a very large scale, that within his knowledge three persons had on that morning come forward, purporting <Col N="16" /> to represent certain persons, and he knew personally they were not those persons. I asked him why he did not cause their arrest, and he said: &ldquo;Because I might be mulcted in certain fines.&rdquo; Now, I think that a presiding officer or a returning officer should be empowered to cause the arrest of any people for personation, and if he can show in any subsequent action that he acted on the reasonable belief that personation was occurring, he should be absolved from all penalty.  I want to refer to Section 26, Sub-section (2), which seems to argue against the case that I have been making. It says: &ldquo;No action or other proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any Returning Officer or Presiding Officer in respect of the arrest by his direction without malice of any person on a charge of having committed the offence of personation.&rdquo;  If I read that Sub-section correctly, I believe it is open to this interpretation, no presiding officer so acting would be supposed to have acted except under the first Subsection of that Section, by which he is motived, if I may use the word, by the personation agent in question.  That is a matter of small change in wording, but it does incorporate a principle.  The Minister can cause the wording to be so changed that the presiding officer need not act on any motive furnished other than his own reasonable presumption.</P>
    <P>The last matter is with regard to registration.  As I read this Bill, I have not found in it any reference to wrongful registration, which is one of the gravest evils in connection with elections. I know a constituency in which it was claimed, and rightly claimed, that at the last election six thousand persons who did not exist were registered.  We know there are a number of persons who are supposed to have died and who vote. That occurs, but this is even more remarkable. Six thousand persons were registered who had never lived, and that has become a very considerable art in this country, the registration of persons who are fictitious but who, nevertheless, are very potent.  I would like the Minister to state that he will regard unlawful registration of that kind as an offence to be punished in exactly the same manner as impersonation.</P>

      <P>I think there is very little to be said about this Bill, except that it will be generally welcomed by <Col N="17" /> everybody who wishes to see purity in the public administration or common decency in public life.  It would be possible, under the different clauses of the Bill, to deal with people who are not prepared to accept that.  I think that a Bill of this kind is equally desirable in the case of Local Government elections, and one cannot fail to notice that the title of this Bill only makes it applicable to elections for the Dáil.  I would like to know from the Minister whether or not he intends to introduce a Bill of a similar kind to be applied to the Local Government elections which, we are now informed, will follow immediately after the elections for the next Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the point that Deputy Johnson made as to whether Section 50 comes within the Title or not.  I see that it is somewhat doubtful, because the removal of the limit for expenditure seems to me to help to take away the connection with the free postage as with the matter of electoral abuses.  I will look into that matter. The object of course is to obviate abuse by personation.  That is not so very easily done.  We have taken certain steps as well as the proposal of penalties to obviate that.  The most important of these has been the increase in the number of polling booths and having smaller compact areas around each polling booth so that a personating agent will have a good chance of knowing everybody in that area, and so preventing people wrongfully voting.  The question of the identity card was considered by the Committee which was set up pursuant to a Resolution of the Dáil, and they reported against it.  If in this country for police purposes everyone had to carry an identity card it would be easy to use that card for preventing personation, but when people have not cards we would find perhaps when we come to an election that only a small proportion of the electorate would be equipped with their cards and we would defeat the idea of the Constitution, and I think we would be going altogether along wrong lines.  The ordinary bulk of the people, even if they did not interest themselves very greatly in politics, have as much title to take part in the election of representatives as the organised active bodies who, perhaps, have their own particular interests more in view than the inert mass of the people.  Then <Col N="18" /> if we have not a very elaborate form of identity card it has been felt that the abuse would be rather increased than diminished.  A simple form of card might be traded and might be bought and sold for the purpose of making personation simple and safe.  Intimidation is dealt with in the Bill; it is one of the forms of undue influence. Section 5 says &ldquo;Every person who shall, directly or indirectly, by himself or any other person on his behalf, make use of or threaten to make use of any force, violence, or restraint&rdquo; and so forth.  I think those words cover intimidation quite sufficiently.  One cannot look at any Bill that may be referred to a Referendum simply by itself. No matter what we do, regard will be had to the people who proposed it and to the people who opposed it.  I do not think that the appointment of an individual to take charge of the organisation and the machinery to prevent personation either for or against a Bill is likely to prevent the electors dealing with the Bill on its merits any more than the debates that would have gone on in the Dáil or Seanad would so prevent them. I do not think there is really very much substance in that.  It certainly was intended that the Returning Officer should be absolved from responsibility if he acted <i>bona fide</i> and without malice, in ordering the arrest of any person whom he found engaged in personation.</P>

I would really like to know the constituency where there were so many as six thousand fictitious names.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> The first four clauses of this resolution concern matters which are already familiar to Deputies from the text of the Bill as printed, and from the explanations which have been given in the Dáil.  The clauses indicate the specific charges on Public Funds to which the general provisions of the Bill may give rise.</P>
    <P>Clause (a) covers the provision which will be found in Sub-section (5) of Section 1 of the Bill.  The advance which may be made under this clause from the Central Fund to the Land Bond Fund will arise only in the event of the Guarantee Fund being insufficient to meet the demands upon it.  Any advance so made would be subsequently recoverable from the Guarantee Fund, so that ultimately the provision would entail no charge on the Central Fund.  The provision is, however, important as affording the best security that the State can offer to the holders of Land Bonds.</P>
    <P>Clause (b) is intended to cover the provision which will be found in Sub-section (7) of Section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Clause (c) relates to the expenditure for which provision is made in Sub-section (5) of Section 37 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Clause (d) covers the general provision made in Section 58 of the Bill for enabling the Land Commission to have the necessary Funds for carrying the Act into effect, and it also covers the minor provision appearing in Sub-section (7) of Section 34 of the Bill of which any Land Agent, Solicitor, or Land Clerk, who performs duties on behalf of the owner of any land will be remunerated out of Public Funds as may be directed by the Land Commission with the assent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Clause (e) of the Money Resolution is new and Deputies will no doubt desire that I should explain it at somewhat more length.  It will be remembered that when the Land Act of 1903 was being passed a special provision was inserted for the purpose of safeguarding Trinity College, Dublin, from the hardship which it was apprehended the College would suffer through having superior interest in land belonging to it redeemed on terms which would involve a loss of income to the college.  It was felt at the time that it would not be proper that an educational institution should be allowed to suffer in this manner by reason of the adoption of the scheme of Land Purchase, and, <Col N="22" /> accordingly the Act provided that a sum of £5,000 should be paid every year by the Government to the Public Trustee so that he might make use of this money in order to indemnify the college against such loss of income.</P>
    <P>Payments under this arrangement have been made annually to Trinity College since 1903.  The greater part of the money provided was, however, not required for this purpose, and a considerable balance has accordingly accumulated in the hands of the Public Trustee.</P>
    <P>The college have for some time been bringing to the notice of the Government the general needs of the institution for further financial assistance, and also the possibility of their existing resources being impaired by the further steps which are being taken under existing Acts, and which are proposed to be taken under the present Bill for the completion of Land Purchase.  In this connection the College have also pointed out that before the Treaty the British Government had endeavoured to provide that the college should be given additional financial assistance to the extent of an annual State grant of £30,000.  This whole question has been very fully examined for some time past on the part of the Government and it has now been possible, subject to the approval of the Dáil, to obtain an agreement with Trinity College on the lines indicated generally by Clause (e) of this resolution.  In consideration of the terms here indicated the college have formally undertaken that they will not approach the Government for financial assistance for at least a further three years, and, of course, no assurance is given on behalf of the State that an application even after that time can be entertained.  It is part of the settlement that the college waives any further claim to indemnity in respect of the future operations of Land Purchase.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to put to the Dáil as part of this arrangement that a sum of £5,000 out of the University Vote should be devoted to the College also. Last year the sum so allocated amounted to £6,000, and in the previous year Trinity College received, I think, £12,000 from the British Government.  I accordingly move the Resolution.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the deletion of paragraph (b) from this Resolution. <Col N="23" /> I take it the proposals of the Bill, of which this Resolution is an essential preliminary, are divided into two parts, one of which is the transfer to the Land Commission, that is to the State, of rentals, as the Minister for Agriculture pointed out in his speech on the introduction of the Bill, and the giving of legal power to draw rent for certain lands. Those powers having been transferred to the State, then the process of re-transfer to the tenants, or to such other persons as may be agreed to, takes place, with the abrogation of the right to draw rentals.  I take it, in agreeing to decide to bring in this Bill for the compulsory transfer from the present landlords of tenanted land, that the Government intends the Bill to provide for the payment, to these present landlords, of a certain sum as compensation for the compulsory abrogation by the State of a right which, for many years, has been exercised with the consent of the State.  The State gave and the State will take away.  The Bill provides for certain compensations for the landlords from whom this power to extract rent is being taken, and it is a fair question to ask, what is the basis on which the compensation is to be calculated?  That brings me to the second, or corelative, part of the Bill. An inquiry is to be made, and it is assumed that the tenants will be able to pay for a certain number of years a certain sum of money annually.  That is to be the basis of the compensation to be paid to the landlord.  I want to know, therefore, why anything additional should be paid to the landlords?  The right to extract rent which is being cancelled under this Bill is a right which was given by the State.  The rental which they have been authorised to extract and to collect, has been fixed, in most cases, by Judicial Courts, and the State in its wisdom, at least the Minister in his wisdom, has put forward in the Bill a certain suggestion as to what is a reasonable charge to levy upon the future tenants.  Now, presumably, that charge which is for a period of years, is to be levied on the future owner, the present tenant, and has been arrived at on some basis of reason.  It is presumed to be what the tenant in the ordinary course of operations will be able to pay.  I assert that it is a guess, that a rental of this <Col N="24" /> kind, fixed in the way that is provided, is simply a leap in the dark, and is to be either a charge upon the tenant, the future owner, or upon the agricultural community, or upon the consuming public in favour of those persons who have in the past had a legal sanction to extract rent.  It is not based upon any knowledge of what the future will be. You cannot predict the course of prices, you cannot predict the course of nature, or future harvests.  You simply assume that the harvests, given good culture, will produce at least as much as in the past, and chance the question of prices. Having decided, as a matter of convenience, that the price to be charged the tenant towards the purchase shall be so and so, the proposal in this Motion is that there shall be added to that which the Minister and the State consider a fair charge upon the occupier&mdash;the man who does the work on the land&mdash;a sum, at the expense of the average taxpayer and the common fund, in the interest and for the benefit of the present land owner.  It seems to me if the demand of the tenants for purchase is being fairly met and that the tenants agree to pay a price, that that is the sum and no more which ought to be paid to the present landlords.  I do not see the justice nor the equity in calling upon the general taxpayer to hand over to the landlords this sum of 10% on the purchase money with an additional 2% for the costs fund.  Whatever is a fair price to charge the tenants that is the fair price to pay the landlords.  If it is a fair price to charge the tenants anything more than that is an unfair price to charge upon the common Exchequer, and is unfair to the community, for the benefit of the present land owners.  If the argument were to run that the price that is fixed for the transfer of this right to extract rent for the landlord is the price fixed in the Bill, and if that is a fair price to pay the landlord, then that is a fair price to charge the tenant.  I think the proposal in the Bill to ask the common taxpayer to pay the extra 10 per cent. is not justified by the facts.  Inasmuch as the Minister has fixed the sum of money which for a period of 60 or 70 years will mean an annual charge upon the produce of the land, if that is a fair price, then again I say that is the price that ought to be paid to the landlord on <Col N="25" /> the basis of the Bill that has been presented to us.  That, in short, is the reason I have put forward for the deletion of paragraph (b) of this Resolution. I think no case has been made in favour of imposing this charge upon the taxpayer, and taking the figures that have been quoted, it will run to something over £100,000 a year, and in a few years considerably over that as a matter of fact.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance can promise that that amount is likely to be available to hand over as a gratuity to the landlords.  I agree with Deputy Gorey in his interjection some time ago that this 10 per cent. was in strict truth a bonus to the landlord rather than an assistance to the tenant.  I am sure the Bill will be greatly improved by the deletion of the clauses which are foreshadowed in this paragraph of the Resolution, and I propose to ask the Dáil to support its deletion.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to admit that Deputy Johnson has put the case against the 10 per cent. very fairly.  At the outset in order to avoid misunderstandings we will have to christen certain things in the Bill.  The Bill itself refers to the purchase money that the vendor is getting as the price.  Let us take this old case of £100 rent.  £1,505 is the landlord's money.  That is called the price.  £65 capitalised at 4¾ per cent. is £1,368.  That is called the standard price in the Bill.  The price is the standard price plus the addition of 10 per cent.  I merely want to have the names quite clear, so that we will not be at cross purposes when we are referring to the price and the standard price.  The standard price is the tenant's annuity capitalised.  The price is the standard price plus 10 per cent.  Deputy Johnson stated the case in one sentence.  He said if the money for which the tenant is making himself responsible is a fair price, then that should be paid to the landlord and no more.  But if the money which under the Bill the landlord is actually getting is the fair price, then that is the price which should be paid and that is the price the tenant should make himself responsible for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is fairly stating what he said on the question.  There is a lot to be said for that point of view.  I will be equally frank with Deputy Johnson, and <Col N="26" /> I will say that if this were a new problem, or even a problem which had come into existence within the last five or six years, if it were not, in fact, a very old and very embittered problem, and a problem around which a great number of vested interests have grown up, and if, in addition, the European war, which has upset the money market all over the world, had never taken place, then I would say, and I have no hesitation in saying it, that the tenant should pay the full price that the landlord is getting.  But we are back to the old difficulties that even a new parliament, after a very short time, begins to find itself up against&mdash;we cannot legislate in a vacuum.  This is a very old problem.  It is the historic Irish economic question.  It was our only economic question for the last 30, 40, or 50 years, and, of course, it is even much older than that.  A great number of vested interests have grown up around it.  It is a sort of common consent in the country that different considerations should apply to the land question than to any other economic question.  That is the fact that is well fixed in people's minds.  It is well fixed in the tenants' minds.  The small farmer, or his son, who lives in the country thinks&mdash;and it has been taught to him&mdash;that he has some better title to the land that adjoins his boundary fence and which happens to belong to a landowner than, let us say, the workman in the docks, who sees the ships of some big shipping company coming in every week, thinks in regard to these ships.  The workman in Dublin never dreams of going to the State and asking for the loan of money in order to get a share in some ship that comes into the docks.  It is altogether different. There is a totally different atmosphere, a totally different point of view.  These are the expediencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have got to recognise that.  It may be illogical, it may not square with Deputy Johnson's rigid notions of economics, but the facts are there, and we have got to face them.  We cannot afford to legislate in a vacuum. Deputy Johnson states that in his opinion this price is a guess.  I hope I have made it clear that I do not agree with him, either that the price which the tenant is making himself responsible for is the <Col N="27" /> fair price, or that the price which the landlord is receiving should be paid by the tenant, and I have given my reasons. I will examine these reasons in a minute. I come to the point now which he makes, namely, that this price is a pure guess. That is not very helpful.  If the Deputy would give us his idea in figures of what the price should be and give his reasons&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose he will, at a later date&mdash;and give his reasons, then we could put one figure against the other and we could decide which of us was guessing.  But I have not that advantage. The Deputy has not yet given the figures, but I daresay we shall receive them when we come to the price Sections of the Bill. For the moment I simply reiterate the statements which I made on the First and Second Reading in regard to this particular question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fixed this price to the landlord on its merits, and on the merits of the question itself.  We fixed it in view of the fact that we cannot afford to acquire property compulsorily and to pay a price for it which would be less than its price to a Banking Institution, especially having regard to the fact that the particular property with which we are dealing was a favourite investment for Banking Institutions, Insurance Companies, Charitable Institutions and private individuals here, in England, and in America.  That is a matter of fact.  It simply does not admit of doubt, not for one moment; that was partly because the price or value of property itself had been, since 1881, regulated by the Land Courts.  That was a very important matter from the investor's point of view.  From the point of view of the Bank, he had definite figures to go on.  He knew where he was in regard to them.  Having regard to the fact, also equally important, that the value of this property regulated by law had not increased, had not shared in the general inflation in the value of property caused by the war, we had to keep that in mind.  We had to fix a price which would not eat into the security value of this land.  Otherwise we would be giving notice to the investor here and elsewhere that Ireland was not a place in which to invest money.  We fixed the price from that point of view, and we fixed the price, I repeat it, from the point of view of <Col N="28" /> giving justice to the landlords, and when I say giving justice to the landlords I mean exactly what I say, giving justice to the landlords, all the circumstances of the case being taken into consideration. I do not think I have any other political dogma, except that one man is as good as another.  I think that is the only political dogma worth fighting for.  I hope, though there may be many Deputies here who have a great many more dogmas, that they will at least share that with me.  We will begin with that.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the standard price to the tenant.  I pointed out on the First Reading that Land Purchase was essentially a Stock Exchange transaction&mdash;that is, the State borrows money from one individual or body and lends it to another.  The State has to borrow money at four and a half per cent. at least for this purpose, and when you borrow money at that price you cannot lend it at less.  I pointed out also, that if we could borrow money on the terms on which money was borrowed for the purposes of the 1903 Act and the 1909 Act, we could pay the landlords' very nearly £1,600, and yet leave the tenant paying an annuity of £65.</P>
    <P>The tenants put up a very strong case from their point of view.  I do not admit their case for a moment.  They have put up a case, a very vocal case, that they should have purchased under the previous Acts.  I pointed out before the reasons of their failures to purchase under the previous Acts.  These reasons are many and complicated and I need not go over them now.  No doubt we will have them from others.  I was willing to go a certain distance to meet them, and the Government was willing to save them from the consequences of the dearness of money due to the war.  To do that we had to find just this 10 per cent. having previously settled the price as a fair price. That 10 per cent leaves them paying an annuity which is considerably less than the annuities paid by previous tenant purchasers.  We had to take all this into account.  We had to take expediency into account to some extent.  It might be easier to deal with these 70,000 unpurchased tenants if 400,000 other tenants had not purchased already.  But they have purchased.  A man is living in a parish down the country; he knows the annuities his neighbours are paying, and <Col N="29" /> the conditions of previous Land Purchase Acts, and naturally gets prepossessions and prejudices which, by the strict logician might be waived aside, but for which we are inclined to make allowances, commensurate with the case. It was to make up to the tenants that money remember, for reasons over which we had no control, that we paid this 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the tenants, having regard to all the facts, particularly to the fact that they did not purchase previously, and having regard to the present conditions of agriculture, should not be allowed this 10 per cent. and that the State should not make some concession in this direction.  It will only cost us £50,000 a year, which is only a small price to complete Land Purchase.  That it costs only £50,000 is the answer. Everyone who knows the country, everyone who knows the reactions of this question, the artificial reactions, will admit that £50,000 is a very small price to pay for this settlement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the costs, I do not intend to enter into an argument with Deputy Johnson as to whether the landlords are entitled to the land, or whether as a matter of expediency they should get a certain compensation for taking it away from them.  That argument will lead us nowhere.  There is a lot to be said for both sides.  Parliament is entitled, I take it, to acquire any property it requires in the National interests.  I do not think there was ever an Act passed for the compulsory acquisition of property, except, perhaps, the 1909 Act, that did not pay the cost of making title for the owner from whom the property was being taken.  Surely if the price is a fair one, you should not compel a man to go to a solicitor, to go to a barrister, or conveyancer and put him to all the costs of making title.  It is for the State he is asked to do it.  It is for the benefit of the State he is making the title.  It is the State is compelling him to make title.  If the price itself is fair, if it makes no allowance for costs, then, surely, in the interests of ordinary equity and justice, the State should make some contribution to the costs.  I hold that the State should pay the full cost if the price is fair.  Again, expediency intervenes. We have not as much money as we would like to have, and we have not made provision for the whole costs. <Col N="30" /> We have only given them 2 per cent. That 2 per cent. will be allotted at the discretion of the Judicial Commissioner, and I certainly think that that discretion should be retained.  Because there are many cases of very poor landlords.  After all, we are dealing with the landlords who did not sell, and who did not sell in many cases because their estates were heavily encumbered.  The price under previous Acts would be no good to them. Hence, they did not sell.  We are dealing with them now, and it is only right that the Judicial Commissioner should be in a position, in a very bad case where a price is causing hardship, to give a bigger proportion of costs than in the case of a really well-off landlord into whose pocket the whole price was going.  In any event, the price does not include the costs.</P>
    <P>We are taking the land compulsorily and compelling the owner to make title. In that state of affairs it is the duty of the State at least to make a contribution towards the cost.  The price here does not include the cost.  The price under the 1909 Act more than included the cost, and in connection with the price mentioned in the case of every other Act, for instance the Acquisition of Land Act for railways or any other purposes, full costs were always paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the case a little clearer from my point of view.  From what Deputy Johnson has stated one would imagine the State is going to assist a great deal towards the settlement of this land question.  What the State is really doing is this: it is going to issue a million pound notes, if you like, with the name of, perhaps, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>and they are going to hand those to the seller of the land. All the State is going to lose on the whole business is £45,000 per year, but there is a provision in the Bill under which 5/- per cent. is to be paid by the tenant, and nobody has yet told us whether that 5/- per cent. is not making provision for this advance of interest.  We have not seen the figures of the Sinking Fund.  My belief is the tenant is paying the whole lot later on, before the 68 years have elapsed. However, we will hear about this from the Minister.  What really is being done <Col N="31" /> is that papers are being printed and handed to the landlord, and 4½ per cent. is being paid for a certain number of years.  There is no talk at all about the State subsidising the landlord or the tenant.  I do not believe we should make the Sinking Fund.  We in the farming line do not want doles.  We want to base calculations on actual facts, and we would like to see that our industry will not be a claim on the State.  I should like to repudiate the statement which Deputy Johnson, inadvertently I admit, made. It was to the effect that we are being subsidised by the State.  We are not being subsidised, and I believe a Sinking Fund is based on the fact that the £45,000 will be paid by the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to relieve the Deputy's mind on that matter, if he has any misapprehension about it.  It is not the case.  Clause (b) is part of the bargain.  There were two parties to the bargain and they could not meet.  The State, realising the difficulty of this problem, realising the importance of having it settled, surveying the whole situation and finding that one party would only give a certain price, and that the other party could not accept less than a particular price, makes up the difference. I do not subscribe to the statement made by Deputy Johnson that what the State gives the State can take away.  If you establish that principle you make the legislation which would be enacted by the State the scope of every political chance that is conceivable.  You damage the credit of the State.  What the State undertakes to pay to-day it may possibly repudiate to-morrow.  That is a rather serious proposition for a young and a new State.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is an eternal one.  I never heard of it before.  I never heard it of any State which prospered and never heard it of any State which would honour its bargain, and make its bargain and keep it. We have got to give evidence of our good faith.  In this particular case you might as well say: &ldquo;The day after we will take away from the tenants what they have bought from us; we will dispose of any contributions they have <Col N="32" /> made towards the liquidation of this Land Bond Fund, and we will hand over to another order of the State the property we have already taken from the landlords.&rdquo;  It would be within the power of a Capitalist Government coming here to say: &ldquo;We will stop work, as far as labourers are concerned, for one day in very week so as to punish them for looking sulky some mornings or not turning up to their work in time.&rdquo;  That is a bad system to go on.  It is the old absolutism of the Czars and it is time it was rubbed off.  The State has many liabilities and responsibilities towards every section of the community and every section of the community has liabilities and responsibilities towards the State.  The State has not got absolute power with regard to this.  It has powers within the limitations of natural justice, and it dare not go a single inch beyond those limitations.  The question in this case is, are the tenants getting off too cheaply or are the landlords getting too much?  I think an examination by an unprejudiced person will give but one answer.  That is that in one case they are giving all they can afford and in the other case they are getting as little as it is possible to give them with any degree of justice.  Deputies smile, but if they consider and look at the bargains made under the 1903 or 1909 Acts, the smile will be the other way.  In those cases there was option of purchase and option of sale but there is no option in this case.  You are ramming it down people's necks whether they like it or not.  You are passing an Act to acquire land and finish what has been done up to this.  If the case be that this is improper and that it is too much and that you are asking the State to contribute too much towards the solution of a problem that has baffled very able legislators for more than 50 years, then I make you a present of your judgment.  Take it criticised from another point of view&mdash; that it is too much to one particular section of the community, the landlords and the tenants.  They might equally retort that the half million we have struck for Unemployment Insurance is too much. Manufacturers of light and heavy commodities might come here and say: &ldquo;we are being taxed too much and you ought to pay us; we should get a contribution from the State instead of having our particular manufactures taxed.&rdquo;  It is <Col N="33" /> the business of the legislator to distribute the burden evenly, to relieve it where it is too heavy, and make it light wherever it is possible.  It is a very popular thing to attack the landlords' interest&mdash;very popular.  There are very serious reactions in that, if that be the line of policy that is going to be taken. The success of this particular Bill depends upon the success and the credit of the State.  Damage that, and there is no use in your trying to pass any Act to finish up land purchase.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has, of late, indulged himself and us in the enuciation of quite a number of interesting, though not original, theories with regard to property.  It would not, of course, be quite fair to twit him with the fact that the doctrines he professes in one session are not quite consistent with those which he advocates in another.  In his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill he uttered words which excited my inward applause.  I regret to find him to-day drawing away from the position that he took up then. I had understood from many of his previous remarks that he believed the land belonged to the people, that the land was the property of the Nation.  Very good!  That is still apparently the opinion on the 3rd July.  On a certain date in June, Deputy Johnson was willing to take the sane, practical man's attitude, and declare, that, after all, he was not going to stand by the doctrinaire view too steadfastly, that so long as the land was cultivated he was well satisfied. Very well.  Here is the way to have the land cultivated, and cultivated in the interests of the Nation.  Give it to the peasant proprietor. I still have the assent of the benches on my left.  The way to have the land cultivated is to give it to the peasant proprietor, but notwithstanding Purchase Acts&mdash;and one great Act as late as 1903 &mdash;there are still 70,000 unpurchased tenants in the country.  How are we to secure proprietary rights in the land for these 70,000 tenants if the infamous tribe of landlords, mortgagees and all the rest stand between the realisation of that great benefit for the Nation and the former class?  Must the sale remain an uncompleted thing?  Are no inducements to be offered?  The Minister for Agriculture <Col N="34" /> made an absolutely complete case just now when he pointed out the business aspect of this transaction.  I am trying, as I have stated, to learn the great art of taking notes.  I wrote down: &ldquo;The price fixed was fixed on its merits; we could not take land at less than a bank would give.&rdquo;  The land is the very type of investment which banks seek after and all those who are looking for a safe security, such as religious orders, love to have their funds invested in the land. That is a solid fact which even Deputy Darrell Figgis in his most imaginative moments would not seek to controvert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing which I always expect to hear propounded from the Labour benches is the right of man to justice. Let me quote Burke:&mdash;&ldquo;Justice is the great standing Policy of Civil Society.&rdquo; It is not Policy written with a little initial letter &ldquo;p,&rdquo; but written with a capital; not policy in the common &ldquo;politician&rdquo; sense of mere devices of expediency, but Policy in the best and highest sense&mdash;the National Policy of equitable treatment according to the natural rights and the acquired rights of mankind.  If justice is the great standing Policy of Civil Society, the next question to ask is: The Policy of what; and what is Society?  Obviously the Policy of the State.  Deputy Figgis is beginning to be afraid that I shall launch out, <i>more Figgis,</i> on a disquisition on the State and on Society.  It is sufficient, for my purpose, to mention them and pass on. The State is merely the citizens in their collective and corporate capacity.  The citizens in their collective and corporate capacity exercise control over each citizen and over all citizens in the name of the common sense of most citizens.  Amongst those citizens to whom the equities have to be exercised are landlords.  Deputy Johnson asked us to go into the history of landlordism and to see how the landlords of to-day came to be here.  Surely, there is no sense in that.  It is to invite us to behave as children.  Are we to go back to the beginning of the world, and to reverse all the reverses of the battle fields, to overthrow all dynasties and to begin all over again?  That is simply a proposal to substitute anarchy for civilisation. I am not a bit more enamoured of landlordism as a thing, or of the landlords of Ireland as a class than Deputy Johnson is.  Neither am I enamoured of the National weather.  I take the Irish <Col N="35" /> weather as I find it.  I saw in an American paper recently the remark of a politician that he took politics as he found them, and he found them particularly rotten. I take facts as I find them, though they may be particularly rotten.  Here is the solid fact, that land is the great sought-after investment, and that the land is owned or professed to be owned by a certain class of men, some of them unable to sell, though willing to sell, because of incumbrances.  Transfer of the land from these men could, no doubt, be secured by absolute spoliation.  I wonder does Deputy Johnson, who claims the doctrine of justice being the great standing Policy of Civil Society, propose spoliation&mdash;taking the land by violence and giving naught.</P>

      <P>His objection to the 10 per cent. in other words is a deduction from his theory with regard to what the landlord is entitled to get.

      <P>I must be particularly dull, and particularly confused if the Chairman is under the impression that I have lost sight of that being the proposition.  The proposition, as I understand it, is that this payment of 10 per cent. shall not be made to the landlord.</P>

      <P>No. I heard sufficient of Deputy Johnson's speech to know that he argued that if the price to be paid by the tenant was a fair price, then that was the price the landlord was to receive.  If the price the landlord was to receive was a fair price, then that was the price the tenant was to pay.  According to that argument, there was no room for a plus or for that 10 per cent., because there was equality.  That is what I think I heard the Deputy argue.  Am I not right?</P>

      <P>My contention, not rebutted, is what lies behind his mind is the idea to which he gave full and explicit expression before.  However, I will pass away from that.  I suppose I have said more than is sufficient on it. Why should not the State bear the ten per cent.?  As the Deputy argued it, or as it appeared to me at any rate in this unhappy frame of mind in which, according to the Ceann Comhairle, I at present stand, he argued that this ten per cent. was in the nature of a bonus.  Did he not repeat with approval the interjection of Deputy Gorey that it was a bonus, and that bonus is to be paid according to him out of the taxpayers' pocket.  Now, all the time the argument is made agreeable to the public by being presented in this light, that the citizens of Ireland are to be subject to a financial contribution for the relief of the landlord.  I invite him to put it the other way&mdash;although my friend Deputy Wilson will not allow it to be put in that way&mdash;namely, it is a levy upon the citizens of Ireland for the relief of the unpurchased tenant.  And why?  Because, as the Minister has just shown, £1,505, the purchase price to the vendor at £100 a year, if reduced by ten per cent., the plus, gives £1,368, which is the standard price or the price the tenant <Col N="37" /> is to pay.  So the tenant has to pay a considerably smaller amount and the reason is because the amount which is sufficient to induce the vendor to sell is made up by this contribution of ten per cent.  Therefore, the proper way to look at it is, it is an expenditure of public moneys in securing that there shall be no more unpurchased tenants, and now that brings me to the point which the Chairman, I am sure, will insist is the point, should the State provide that ten per cent.?  That is precisely one of the functions of the State, if you accept the account which I ventured to give of it a few moments ago.  The State is the individual citizens in their collective and in their corporate capacity, doing for the individual what he cannot do for himself. The individual, as a unit of ordered organised society, is invested with the power to do to himself an advantage which, as an isolated individual, he would never be in a position to secure.  The State here comes to the relief of that section of the citizens, the unpurchased tenants, and secures for them a benefit which so many of their neighbours secured twenty years ago, and from which they were shut out.  Now, in all those bargains, in all payment of price, we look to see what has been purchased. What is bought here is peace, not for the farmer merely, but peace and quiet settling down to industry to the benefit of the entire nation.  The contribution of this ten per cent. secures a huge benefit, not to-day or to-morrow, merely, but for all the succeeding years, and not to the farmer, merely, but to every citizen. Is it not right and fair that we should not put this ten per cent. contribution upon the farmer, who is hard set, even now, to meet the price so reduced?  The farmers make a case&mdash;I am a diligent student of the case they put up in all its various forms&mdash;that those terms which the Minister for Agriculture thinks so good, but does not pretend that they are either delightfully or extravagantly good, are harsh ones.  I dare say, in the case of some farmers, they are.  Certainly, to many they are not tempting.  Is it from these men we are to exact, by legislation, that additional contribution which induces the vendor to part with the land?  I think, in every fair, broad, and long view of the situation, it is really the duty of the State in this case <Col N="38" /> to supply the wherewithall that will enable this transaction which brings peace and advantage to the nation to be carried through.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Gorey begins, I may say the effect of paragraph (b), if it remains in the Money Resolution, if it is passed in Committee, and subsequently agreed to by the Dáil, will be that the State can pay a contribution to the price.  Deputy Gorey may keep in mind the fact that an amendment could be moved in Committee, making the State contribution to the price 99.9 per cent.  If paragraph (b) is deleted in accordance with Deputy Johnson's amendment there would be no provision for the State making any contribution to the price.  That is the exact effect.</P>

      <P>I thank you for this guidance, but I do not think I need it. About the State contribution&mdash;I refrained from commenting on it on the First Reading and on the Second Reading, and I refrain from contributing to the debate now, except in so far as to mention something that may, perhaps, be interesting. Under all our previous purchases we had State bonuses&mdash;bonuses very far in excess of the 10 per cent. proposed in this clause.  I am not able to give you the exact figures, but I am right in saying it was very much in excess of 10 per cent.  Under the 1909 Act the less the price was the more the bonus was.  Under the 1903 Act the more the price was the more the bonus was, so that I do not think anybody can contradict me about it, because they do not know enough about the figures.  To say 12 per cent. would not be strictly a fact.  But what I want to say is that those 70,000 unpurchased tenants as citizens of the State contributed their share of this bonus. They are a very small proportion of the State, but they have borne their share. Perhaps their Minister for Agriculture could give me the number of purchased tenants.</P>

I have said I will not refer to the case that is made for this 10 per cent.  I see that bank charges are named, investments of charitable institutions are named, and I think we are really getting at the actual facts when we mention some of these concerns.

      <P>Certainly it was not exactly delicacy when he spoke of this Bill being a compulsory Bill.  He was ramming down the people's necks the proposition of purchase.  They could not help themselves.  This State, which has not a right to undo that which a previous organisation of the State did, is applying compulsion to make landlords give up their lands to the tenants at a price fixed by the State.  Well, if that is not the State undoing that which the State did, I do not know what it is, and for the President to deny so fiercely the proposition that the State, having passed laws allowing landlords <Col N="40" /> to draw rents from occupiers, and saying &ldquo;Henceforward you shall not be allowed to draw rent from occupiers except on the terms that we lay down, and then only through our operation, for a limited number of years,&rdquo;&mdash;if that is not undoing what was done, I do not know what it is.  It is quite a common practice, of course, for the State to come along and say that something that was done once shall be repealed, and that something being done now may be repealed at some other time.  Because, to make an assertion that a State can do these things does not mean to say that it ought, at the first opportunity, to do so.  I am sufficiently a conservative, Deputy Magennis will be pleased to know, as to realise the necessity for something like continuity in a State policy.  I am afraid of the Ceann Comhairle or I would attempt to follow Deputy Magennis.  The question at issue is whether this sum, or any sum, should be paid out of the common Exchequer to the landlords, over and above the annual sum for a certain number of years which the tenants are called upon to pay.  I consider, in all the circumstances, bearing in mind the history of land purchase, the fact that the landlords have had long notice that there would be, at some point, a compulsory deprivation of this power which the State gave them to extract rent from their working tenants, that there is no injustice in saying to these landlords, having had such notice, that the price which may be considered to be fair for the tenants to pay out of the annual produce of the soil&mdash;that part of the produce of the soil which the tenants can, year by year, afford to pay in annuities&mdash;may be for a number of years handed over to the landlords in compensation for this compulsory acquisition.  That is a fair proposition, and to my mind would be in justice and equity quite sufficient compensation for the compulsory re-acquirement by the State of these lands.  Ministers think otherwise.  They think it is necessary that something additional should be paid.  Well, that is purely a matter of expediency, a matter of consideration, whether it is enough or too much, or whether anything should be paid at all.  Landlords say it is not enough.  None of them have come along and said that it was too much, but some of them feel that it is better than they <Col N="41" /> might have had, and they are prepared to accept it for fear that the next Dáil might not be so generous.  There is no question of principle in it, no question of justice, only the question of a bargain.  The proposition as stated by the Minister for Finance was, that if the buyer and seller of a beast in a fair cannot agree, and the State thinks that the prospective purchaser ought to have that beast as he could make better use of it, then the State comes along and says &ldquo;We will split the difference by paying the difference ourselves.&rdquo;  I quite agree with the President that that is a position which might frequently be taken.  I am not disputing that as a principle, but I think that in this case, in view of the position of the landlords to the State and to the tenants, and in view of the notice they have had in regard to the coming of compulsion, and in view of the rents they have drawn during the last 20 or 30 years, awaiting this day of compulsory acquisition, in view of all these circumstances, there is no necessity in justice for this extra 10 per cent. to be paid out of the State coffers.</P>

      <P>Before the matter is finally put to the vote, one point occurs to me.  I had not the opportunity of listening to all the speeches, but in those I have heard, with the one exception of Deputy Gorey's speech, the assumption was always taken that this 10 per cent. contribution by the State, in order to complete and make possible this purchase, is a contribution that is to be given to the landlords.  That has been confidently assumed, both in the case made, and also in the case responded to. Why is it not assumed that this 10 per cent. contribution is a contribution being made to the tenant in order to enable him to purchase satisfactorily under the present conditions?</P>

      <P>Satisfactorily to the tenant.  That is an assumption that I think would entirely alter Deputy Johnson's case which has been addressed purely upon the point that the landlord is to receive this benefaction instead of the farmer, and, as Deputy Gorey already pointed out, that those who still remain unpurchased tenants will have a contribution made in their assistance by those who have purchased, just as they in their turn in times past made a contribution to those who purchased at an earlier stage.  That, I take it, is the assumption under this Section of the Financial Resolution, and I believe, if it be looked at from that point of view, the entire case made by Deputy Johnson disappears.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the State bridging the difficulty, but I think the amount that should be fixed for that purpose would be more equitable as regards the bonuses that have been given in this respect under previous Land Purchase Acts, which covered the kingdom as far as I know, if the portion of them now which are attributable to the area outside us were commuted, and that amount placed as a bonus at the service of the unpurchased tenants.  That I think would be more equitable than any bonus sum.  However, I suppose the difficulty will be met in the Bill, but I think that it is not a remission of taxes, as far as I can see, and I think it could even afford to be higher than it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move to insert a new section before section 4 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From and after the first gale day in the year 1920, interest upon any mortgage charge or incumbrance charged upon or payable out of the purchase money of lands taken under this Act shall be and be deemed to have been payable and recoverable at the lowest rate only, if more than one, reserved by the instrument creating such mortgage charge or incumbrances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a common practice, in drawing mortgages, to provide that the interest shall run at 5 or 6 per cent., or whatever the rate may be at the time, and then to provide that on prompt payment, or within a week or a month of the date on which the interest is due, that interest at a lower rate, say 4½ per cent., will be accepted in full discharge.  During the last two years there has been a general cessation of the payment of rents, and the consequence is that those landlords whose estates were encumbered have been unable to pay interest to their encumbrancers, with the result that what is known as penal interest, that is to say interest at the higher rate, has been accumulating against them, not through any wilful default of their own, but because they were unable to obtain the means to discharge their own liabilities. That, of course, is a considerable hardship upon those landlords who are now compelled to sell and from whom, but for some such amendment such as I suggest here, that panel interest would be recoverable in full for the period during which they were unable to discharge it.  Also, while sales are going through, during the investigation of titles there will be a cessation of payment to the landlord of the interest on his bonds until the title is clear, and of all payment on the mortgages until they will have cleared their title of the encumbrances. During that period also through default, interest at the penal rate will be accumulating against the fund which is ultimately to go to the landlord.  I have discussed the matter with representatives both of the encumbrancers and of the landlords, and I think it is only a reasonable thing that these encumbrancers, who were entitled to charge the higher rate of interest by reason of default, <Col N="49" /> should be compelled to forego that charge where the default was not the default of the landlords.  It was not a case with the landlord of collecting his rents and putting the money in his own pocket and not paying the interest to the encumbrancers.  It was a case that he had not got the money for the time being to meet the interest charges, and now, especially as the arrears of rent upon which that interest was charged, are going to be paid to him subject to a considerable reduction, it seems fair to me, and I suggest to the Dáil it is only fair that that reduction should fall also upon those encumbrancers who, in many cases, have been the cause of preventing the landlords from selling their lands earlier. I suggest that this amendment is fair, and should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the object Deputy Fitzgibbon has in view&mdash;that is to say, that mortgagors should not be met by penal interest.  That, I think, is what he aims at.  He points out that there may be a normal rate of interest mortgaged in the deed with a penal rate becoming payable on account of delay, but I think his amendment goes somewhat further than he intends.  The Deputy, I think, will agree that there may be a third rate of interest in the deed&mdash;that is to say, a normal rate, a penal rate, and a lower rate.  If his amendment were accepted, payment would be in accordance with the lowest rate of interest, and I do not think he intends that.  I have drafted an amendment which I think meets the case he puts forward. It read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the instrument creating any mortgage charge or incumbrance payable out of or charged upon the purchase money of lands taken under the Act provides that interest shall be accepted at a reduced rate upon prompt payment, no higher rate shall be due or recoverable in respect of arrears of interest or on account of any default or delay in payment of interest upon such mortgage charge or incumbrance pending the completion of the sale.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, I think, makes it clear that only penal interest is barred, and that the normal rate of interest runs.  If the Deputy moves that amendment, I am prepared to accept it.</P>

As I said, the price we have calculated does not include <Col N="51" /> costs.  We are making the owner liable for the costs of making title, and, as the price does not include costs, I put it to the Dáil that in equity we should at least make a contribution towards the costs.  It will be helpful also to relieve the owners of heavily encumbered estates.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Sub-section (2), before the proviso, line 39, to insert a new proviso: &lsquo;Provided that no payment under this section shall exceed one-half of the costs actually incurred by the vendor; and&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a provision that the payment under the section shall not exceed one-half of the costs actually incurred by the vendor.  The Minister has told us that the 2 per cent. will not be enough, and that being so, it is clear that the proposition is not to bear the whole of the costs.  Then the question is, what proportion of the costs is to be borne out of this Costs Fund?  My amendment is that not more than one-half should be borne.  We are not now dealing with the question of principle.  Notwithstanding the argument of the Minister that it is customary in the purchase of other classes of property for the costs to be borne by the purchaser, in this case the costs are not to be borne by the purchaser, but only part of them.  What part of them? What proportion?  My proposal is that the proportion should be limited to one-half. There is no other limiting motion. It is to be left to the discretion of the Commissioners as to whether they will pay one person 50, another 75, another 90, and another 100 per cent.  This amendment is that there shall be a definite limit of one-half of the actual costs incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that in very many cases one half of the actual costs incurred will be considerably more than the Land Judge would be likely to allow.  The late landlord ought not to be limited in this case as is proposed. But for the compulsory taking of what we must regard, at any rate, as his property by the State for the purpose of resale to the tenants, these costs would not be incurred at all, in most cases the encumbrancers <Col N="52" /> have been perfectly ready to leave their encumbrances as they stand and draw their interest or annuity, whichever it might be.  In many cases that has gone on for 50, 60, or 70 years. It is not making the title to the Land Commission that really costs so much as the clearing by the landlord of the people above him who have to be paid out of the purchase money before he can get the balance, whatever it may be, that is left to him out of what the State has paid him for his land.  The landlord converts what is an annuity, in the shape of rent, into a capital sum, and all the other people who have capital charges upon that annuity that the landlord has hitherto received from his tenants have to be paid off in capital sums out of the capital sum into which his annuity has been converted. It is in the clearing up of the title to these and getting rid of them, in order that he may get the residue for himself, that the costs are really incurred. That is expense which has been directly forced upon him by the State by its act in taking the property from him which produced the annual sum, and giving him a capital sum instead.  If there is anything in the Bill which ought to be borne by the State, which for public purposes has altered the character of his property, it seems to me that it is the costs put upon him to enable him to get the property in its new form.  The 10 per cent. is another matter.  The 10 per cent. bonus was justified by the Minister. I agree that it did require justification. He made a case, which the Dáil accepted, for the contribution by the State of 10 per cent.&mdash;part to the landlord and part to the tenant, one or the other as the case may be&mdash;but a contribution to bridge the difference between the price which the vendor was willing to take, or is being compelled to take, and the price which the purchaser was willing to give.  This Costs Fund seems to me to be an entirely different matter, and to stand on the pure principle of justice.  Where you put a man to expense by taking his property, which he would otherwise not have been put to, you ought to shoulder that responsibility just in the same way as a railway company or a comporation which takes land for public purposes have to pay the costs of showing title. This is not so much a question of showing title by the person from whom the <Col N="53" /> State has taken the land as clearing up the title by him for the purpose of getting his own property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy really realises what the effect of the amendment would be.  We have now agreed to the Costs Fund, and his amendment suggests that nobody should receive more than one-half.  Take a small estate which would be more likely to be heavily encumbered than a large estate.  When you come to make title the probabilities are that it is more difficult to make title, as perhaps there are more mortgages, more superior interests, more complications of all kinds.  It might be much harder and much more difficult to make title to an estate of £2,000 or £3,000, heavily encumbered, than it would be to make title to an estate of £5,000, £6,000, or £10,000 not encumbered at all.  It is only right that the Judicial Commissioner should be able to exercise discretion and give more costs to such an owner, because he has been put to much more difficulty and to more expense to make title, and also because he is less able to bear the expense of making title.  I do not see anything against that.  In all equity it is the fair course.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is, in case the Minister for Finance thirty years hence exercises the option he has to purchase these Land Bonds at par&mdash; and presumably he will not undertake that transaction if money is dearer, but only where a profit would be made, and we assume that he will make a profit&mdash; that that profit should be passed on to the tenant purchaser.  As the Bill now stands the purchaser must pay 4¾ per cent.  Supposing that the Minister for Finance thirty years hence could raise money at 3½ per cent., he would be able to save 1 per cent. to the State. That would be a profit.  On twenty millions that one per cent. would amount to £200,000, which would go into the Central Fund from the pockets of the tenant purchasers.  In order to be just I think that these people, who will be the last in Ireland paying rent, as nearly everyone on the land will then own it, should get the benefit of that £200,000 to enable them to get some decadal reductions.  I have not made a calculation, but I am pressing the amendment as the Minister has provided for contingencies.  We are legislating for thirty or sixty years in advance, and we should make some provision for contingencies.  The contingency in this case would amount to the enormous sum of £200,000 or, spread over 30 years, to £6,000,000.  That should be passed on to the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the terminology of this particular amendment is acceptable.  In essence the principle of it is practically in operation at the present moment, and has been for a considerable time.  That is to say, any person reducing an annuity practically gets the sum owing in respect of a particular purchase transaction. It is practically extinguished in Stock, so that, instead of paying cash, you practically extinguish whatever is due by the purchaser by an equivalent amount of Stock.  It might cost a little more, as there are certain expenses incidental to and inseparable from a transaction of that kind, which are added on.  This particular amendment would perhaps involve the State in a loss or prevent the State from getting a small, or a relatively small, sum which <Col N="56" /> they are entitled to at the present moment. I do not think the Deputy intends that in any transaction that takes place under this Bill that the person purchasing would get an advantage which is not enjoyed by persons who bought under the 1903 or under the 1909 Acts.  I know something about this, as I was interested for the last couple of years in finding out what it would cost to redeem an annuity.  I found it was possible to purchase Land Stock at a very considerably reduced price, and that some little advantage would accrue. You got practically an investment at something like five or six per cent., and I think that is all the Deputy intended when he put down the amendment.  Subject to what I have said with regard to certain small costs that are consequential and inseperable from a transaction of the kind, at present any person has the right who has bought under the 1903 or 1909 Acts, and the same thing would apply as regards this Bill.</P>

It is valued in the market at £720.  Here is £600.&rdquo;  And Deputy Gorey, being a meek, humble individual, hands over the £720 worth of <Col N="58" /> stock for £600.  Where is the profit? Deputy Wilson holds there is a profit of £120, which is to be handed to the tenant. I cannot understand his point.  Is the figure £480 or £720?  It appears to me to be a financial puzzle which can only be elucidated by Deputy Wilson or Deputy Gorey.</P>

      <P>The matter is a little bit confused.  If the Minister for Finance 30 years hence can get money at 3½ per cent.&mdash;that is quite probable&mdash;it is his business to pay those people off at par.  It does not matter who holds the Bonds.  It is the Minister's duty to reduce the amount of interest payable to those people.  He will gain by that probably 1 or 1½ per cent.  One per cent. will realise about £200,000, which is really too much to give to the State, and which is taken out of the pockets of 70,000 or 100,000 people, who will possibly be the last people in Ireland paying rent.  I think that is a fair proposition, and I hope the Deputies will vote in accordance with pure justice.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to know where is the profit.  I have been trying to find out, and I cannot, and I have not been told.  As far as I see, this amendment is not a sensible one: it does not lead us anywhere.  There are three parties to this transaction&mdash;the people selling, the people buying, and the State.  Whatever the people who are selling get, and whatever the people who are buying get, certainly the State is getting nothing for the liability.  The representatives of one of the three sections come forward here and say that if there is to be any profit out of this transaction&mdash;and they have not indicated where the profit is to be&mdash;a certain <Col N="59" /> party to that transaction is to get that profit.  If the matter were to be dealt with equitably it ought to be dealt out between the three sections, granted that the three were beneficiaries.  It appears to me that there is one section bady served by a burden which the other two sections have enjoyed putting upon it. Thirty years hence, supposing money is cheap, this section that has borne the brunt may possibly be repaid to some advantage.  We are told if there is any profit it is a section other than this section that is to benefit.  I could not recommend that from the point of view of the State.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the purpose of this amendment. As far as I can see, it means that whatever guarantee you have had by the setting up of the Guarantee Fund goes by the board.  The State is putting up a considerable contribution towards the solution of this problem.  We look for some guarantee in respect of annuities that should be paid.  Where they are not paid we call upon this Guarantee Fund. The Guarantee Fund is made up of moneys which in the ordinary course would be paid to local authorities in relief of rates.  In order to secure that the Guarantee Fund will have moneys, certain sums are paid into it.  This amendment would take out those sums.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Such arrears of grants shall be forthwith paid to the County Councils concerned before any of the sums so collected shall be paid into the Guarantee Fund.&rdquo;  If the dispute be regarding certain delay which took place by reason of the fact that annuities are not paid, I think it is unreasonable, because those Land Commission annuities are generally just a month or so in arrears. That month or so may be a period during which the charge will fall upon <Col N="67" /> the Central Fund, unless there is some other method of finding the sums necessary to pay the dividends on the Sinking Fund.  If there be a loss, that loss ought to be shouldered by those responsible for it.  I do not understand the amendment, unless it be to discount the value of the Guarantee Fund, or to compensate people living in the neighbourhood, or to compensate County Councils in the neighbourhood of which Land Commission annuities are not regularly paid.  If they are not paid, on whom should the responsibility lie?</P>

      <P>If it should fall on the Land Commission, what is the strength of the Land Commission to bear it?  The Land Commission must be fed from somewhere, and it is not even fed from here.  This fund only feeds when the land annuities are not paid.  The time arrives when the land annuities are paid.  If the purpose of the amendment be that directly they are paid they should be sent back at once without delay, I say there is no unreasonable delay, having regard to the fact that normal Government machinery is thrown out of gear when people do not discharge their debts.  The State is security for most of those things, and the State naturally looks to something on which it can draw in the event of those land annuities not being paid.  If the dispute then be as regards delay in restoring moneys to the Guarantee Fund, I say there has been no unreasonable delay.</P>

This amendment is dealing with the machinery that held good under the previous Acts, and we want the County Council to be relieved, and the first payments made into their funds for any of those annuities out of the Agricultural Grant.  The operation was that a certain amount of money had to be withheld from the Agricultural Grant to make good the deficiencies on annuities.  The common impression through the country is that the Land Commission was not <Col N="68" /> stringent enough in exercising its rights in collecting its annuities.  We do not refer to the people who were only a month or so in arrears.  We refer only to bad debts, and we want to get the defaulters in that respect dealt with more energetically. If the Central Authority had all the responsibility instead of the County Council, they would be more energetic. This amendment is not dealing with the operations of this Bill, but with the operations of the previous Act.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with this amendment.  I do not agree with it, because it reduces to some extent the central administration.  There is no use in telling me that only certain people do not pay.  Within the past few days we had to draw very heavily on this Guarantee Fund to pay the interest due on the 1st July.  Just imagine what our position would be if there was not a fund to draw on in order to make up the sum necessary to discharge the interest honourably due by us in connection with the previous Acts.  The whole finance of this would break down, and our credit would be very seriously damaged.  We had that Guarantee Fund to draw on, which made it different.  The local authorities in the area under the jurisdiction of which those particular holdings are situate, will feel this change.  There is no other way that we know of to bring it home to them equitably.  A sum of over £1,000,000 is distributed from the funds raised in taxation to relieve local taxation.  A certain amount of that is ear-marked as a sort of security for the payment of those Land Commission annuities.  It is so used to make good whatever has been drawn out of the Guarantee Fund to make up the difference of the sums we have collected in respect of Land Commission annuities and the sums we have to pay to discharge the interest and sinking fund charges on land stock taken up by people in good faith, believing we would pay interest on the sinking fund to pay them their dividends, and make good the ultimate taking up of the land stock that has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you in any way weaken that Guarantee Fund, you are weakening the credit of this transaction; you are weakening any confident anticipation that we had from the beginning that this Stock would remain at a fair price.  It is most essential that it should remain <Col N="69" /> at a fair price, because the basis of the Act was that it would be practically <i>par.</i> If you reduce the security a person has by taking away the security of the Guarantee Fund in any way, you are reducing the security that the person has who invests in Land Stock.  &ldquo;Arrears of Grants shall be forthwith paid to the County Councils concerned before any of the sums so collected shall be paid into the Guarantee Fund.&rdquo;  Arrears of Grants in that case means something that has been withheld.  Very good. These arrears of Grants shall forthwith be paid to the County Councils from what?</P>

      <P>The State, in the first instance, collects this from all the taxpayers.  It divides it into certain compartments.  One compartment is called the Guarantee Fund.  When the Land Commission annuities collected are insufficient to discharge the interest and the Sinking Fund, we take it from a particular compartment and make good that amount, and we hand out the interest and the Sinking Fund.  That is now what happens.  &ldquo;Arrears of Grants shall be forthwith paid to the County Councils concerned.&rdquo;  You have got to pay them and you find an empty box.

There is a period of suspense during which it is not known whether or not this particular Fund will be called upon to discharge any sums to make up the unpaid Land Commission annuities.  Before it is made available for County Councils at all the money passes through a Guarantee Fund into the compartment I have mentioned, the box or the fund, or any other means of keeping it for the time being.

In any case where a hanging gale is customary any payment of rent shall be deemed to have been made in respect of the gale next after the gale in respect of which it was actually made.</P>
    <P>(3)  Compounded arrears of rent shall be payable as to so much thereof as does not exceed 75 per cent. of the annual rent, immediately after the date of the passing of this Act, and as to the balance, if any, on such date or dates before the appointed day as may be prescribed by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>(4)  Compounded arrears of rent shall be collected and accounted for to the person or persons entitled thereto by the Land Commission in accordance with rules made by them: Provided that the Land Commission shall when paying over the amount collected first deduct therefrom income tax and such sum to go towards costs of collection as the Land Commission consider reasonable and proper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in order to give <Col N="73" /> effect to the demand that I made on the Second Reading, and to the promise made by the Minister.  Since the Second Reading things have not mended.  On last Thursday I saw a judgment asked for and decree given on behalf of a landlord named McArthur against a tenant in County Dublin.  On Tuesday last two bailiffs were sent into the house of a farmer named O'Neill, also in County Dublin, at the instance of a landlord named Caulfield.  Two or three seizures of cattle have been made in County Tipperary against unpurchased tenants.  I will not refer to the numerous cases that occurred previous to the Second Reading of the Bill, but they have been numerous and they have been all over the country, and I think it would be a national shame if this Legislature that proposes to deal honestly between man and man and section and section were to allow a few people of any particular section to get at the back of the Bill, to get in front of their neighbours, to get in front of the people of their class and do what I cannot regard as anything else but a crime against the State and a crime against the intentions of the Legislature. The Bill provides for nothing but to put these people on the same level as the rest of their kind, but they tried to evade the Bill.  There is nothing unreasonable in this Amendment, and the promise of the Minister confirms us in this view. It is only just, equitable, and right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment in that form. What I said the other day, I think, in answer to a question by Deputy Gorey, was that if it became clear that there was a policy amongst the landlords to get in in front of the Bill, I would put in a provision in the Bill making it retrospective so far as rent was concerned as from the date of the introduction of the Bill.  Retrospective legislation is absolutely unsound except in very special circumstances. I think the Dáil will agree with that, and it would be necessary to have very special circumstances, such as a general policy on the part of the landlords to negative the arrears provisions in the Bill, before we would be justified in legislating retrospectively at all.  Now, there has been no such policy.  First of all, the Dáil should remember that this section is only affected by decrees that have been enforced.  It makes no dicerence <Col N="74" /> to a tenant if a writ has been issued, or if legal expenses have been incurred before the passing of this Bill, provided that the decree has not been enforced. If a writ is issued, judgment marked, and everything ready for the enforcement, but no enforcement or execution takes place, and the Bill passes while that state of affairs is in existence, then the landlord only gets his compounded arrears of rent.  There is no question of costs or expenses.  Let us not confuse the issue by dealing with writs that have been issued, and judgments marked, and legal expenses incurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted one particular case where judgment was marked.  I quoted another case where the bailiffs were sent into a man's house, and I quoted two other cases where cattle were seized.  I quoted only one case where judgment was marked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So I am right, the Deputy did quote a case where judgment was marked.  I am entitled to disabuse the mind of anyone who has not had the advantage of Deputy Gorey's knowledge on this subject that these provisions are not affected in any way by proceedings that have not been executed, by the fact that writs have been issued and judgment marked, provided that they have not been enforced.  Let us stick closely to the decrees that have been enforced.  I have returns that in 75 per cent. of the counties not a single decree for rent has been executed.  The Deputy knows that.  He will not contradict that, and he is capable of a good deal of contradiction at times.  I am sure if I looked into the figures I could say more than 75 per cent., but I will put it now at 75 per cent.  There have been only one or two decrees executed on an average in other counties.  I think Galway is the highest, and there were seven there.  I suppose there are <Col N="75" /> at least 1,000 cases where rent is due for the last two years.  Let us be fair to landlords.  I do not say what their reasons were, but as a class they have not executed decrees.  That is a fact, and the talk about execution of decrees and putting the farmer out of his home, all this loud talk that would give the impression that evictions were taking place all over the country, has simply no relation to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody said evictions were taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not, and what is more, all this loud talk as well about what the farmers would do if we tried to execute decrees does not impress us a bit.  Landlords have not tried to execute decrees, and there is no use blustering about it.  We will not discuss the question of what we would do if we tried. It would lead nowhere.  It is absolutely unsound to say that a man should not take advantage of his legal rights while these legal rights are in existence.  A man is entitled to take advantage of his legal rights while they are in existence, and a man is not entitled to assume that every Bill that goes before the Dáil will be passed.  As a general principle I think that is sound.  I hope a good many Bills will be introduced into the Dáil between this and the disappearance of the Irish nation from the face of the earth that will not be passed, but the mere introduction of a Bill does not hold up a man's rights at all, and as a corollary from that it is unsound to legislate retrospectively.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact, and I want to put this seriously to the Dáil in the interests of justice, that we are dealing at least with about 10 per cent. of landlords who are pulling the devil by the tail, who are in an extremely bad way, who perhaps are owed two or three years' rent, and who I know as a matter of fact, if the mortgagee came down on top of them&mdash;and the mortgagees have a great many inducements to do so &mdash;and forecloses he gets the whole estate, and he probably makes a bit out of the sale of the estate.  Many of the mortgagees are fully alive to that, and everyone here knows as well as I do that at least ten per cent. of the landlords who have not a penny, and whose mortgagees are pressing them, are in a desperate <Col N="76" /> position, whatever the reasons may be.  That is the present position, and I think it is only fair to assume that the small percentage of decrees that have been executed have been executed by landlords of that sort.  That is only a fair assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be, if you did not know the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy give us different facts.  You may get a landlord who will execute a decree out of pure cussedness.  I am talking about the general body of landlords who have not executed decrees as a body, and where they did execute decrees it is only fair to assume that they did it absolutely under compulsion of their own creditors, and that they had no alternative but to let in their mortgagees to foreclose and get the estate.  Hence, all the equities are not on one side, if you take the facts and leave out the question, for the moment, whether the landlords have even an academic right to their rents&mdash;take the circumstances as you find them.  Any fair-minded man&mdash;even Deputy Gorey himself in his cooler moments&mdash;will agree with me that there is a certain amount to be said on both sides in all the circumstances, in view of the fact that so few decrees were executed, and in view of the fact that there are so many landlords absolutely on the rocks.  Now, on the other hand, though I am doubtful of the wisdom and justice of doing it, I will go this distance with the Deputy&mdash;I will agree that any rent paid since the introduction of the Bill should be adjusted and should be appropriated towards the payment of arrears under the Bill.  I will not agree that the costs should be recovered.  This is purely a bargain, and I put it forward as a bargain.  The landlord who had to execute his decree did not get ready money, and it is not such a hardship upon him.  Let us take a case, say, where the rent is £100, and that that has been recovered.  The arrears would be £75, so that that sum of £100 can be appropriated towards a year-and-a-quarter instead of a year.  It would not mean payment in money; but to recover the cost from the landlord now, in a great many cases, would really be looking for blood out of a turnip.  So I go this far with the Deputy&mdash;and I think it is a fair proposition, in all the circumstances&mdash;I <Col N="77" /> will agree to accept an amendment in this form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any judgment or decree obtained in any proceedings against the tenants of a holding to which this Act applies for the recovery of rent or for the recovery of the holding for non-payment of rent after the 20th day of May, 1923, shall be vacated, and if any rent, or arrears of rent, shall have been levied or recovered under or in consequence of any such judgment or decree in excess of the sum to which compounded arrears of rent would have otherwise amounted, the amount of such excess shall be set off against the moneys to become payable by the tenant to the Land Commission in lieu of rent as hereinafter provided, and the equivalent payment by the Land Commission shall be proportionately reduced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That leaves out the costs, and deals with the rent only.  It is a sporting offer, and I hope the Deputy will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a sporting offer, put forward by the Minister on behalf of the landlords who have sent out these writs, but there is nothing sporting about it for the people against whom the writs have been issued.  The Minister began by telling us that if it was the policy of the landlords to issue these writs he would accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>If the policy is wrong, the act of the individual is wrong, and therefore cannot be justified even by the flippancy of the Minister.  To my mind the Minister is merely clapping on the back the individual landlord who has enforced his writ.  He has done more; he has actually issued an invitation to all the landlords who have a judgment marked to enforce that judgment between this and the time the Bill becomes <Col N="78" /> law.  He is really issuing an invitation to the landlords to go on and enforce their writs and that at least they would get their costs.</P>

      <P>It does not matter who would get the costs, because the costs do not begin to mount up until the Sheriff goes out.  I want to have the Minister's reasons as to why the individual is right, and the general body of the landlords wrong.  The Minister made the statement that the issuing of writs did not operate in 75 per cent. of the cases.  We have only 26 counties, and in the counties of Cork, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary, Galway, Dublin and Donegal writs have operated.  It does not matter if the Sheriff had not to go out, but I can produce Sheriff's letters and threats, and the Minister can produce some that I handed to him.  It is perfectly true that in these counties writs have been made good, even though the soldiers were not actually called out to assist in their execution; the writs were made good by terror and threats.  It is true in the case of one landlord that he was driven by his creditors to take action, and it was about time that the creditors drove him. That was the case of Leader in Cork.</P>

      <P>No, he trains grey hounds.  In Kilkenny, Wexford, Galway, Carlow and Tipperary the writs were made good by landlords who were not in want, but they did it through pure cussedness and malignity.  I admit that the Cork case was a pressing case, but none of the others were.  I have made myself acquaínted with the particulars in all these individual cases, and I can say that the Minister's contention about creditors pressing falls to the ground absolutely except in the Cork case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made an offer to adjust the rents, but what about the costs? The costs, once the soldiers are sent out, are practically in all cases much in excess of the reduction that the tenants would get.  In almost all cases you would have a small rent with big costs.  I repeat that, except in the Cork case, the making good of these writs was done through pure malignity and cussedness.  This is <Col N="79" /> the sort of thing that the Minister claps on the back, the class of individual landlord who has created chaos in the country for generations, and who, because of his actions in the past, has made it necessary for the Government to introduce a measure of compulsory land purchase. That is the class of individual who has been the curse of this country for generations. I am not satisfied, nor are my people satisfied, with the amendment which the Minister has suggested we should accept.  I hope Deputies in the Dáil who represent agricultural districts in this country will not follow the Minister's lead, but will speak out on behalf of the people they represent.  I propose pressing my amendment to a division, no matter what alternative amendment the Minister may bring in.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Gorey presses his amendment to a division, it is my intention to vote for it.  At the same time I would like to remind the Deputy and his Party that when the Bill giving the Sheriff power to bring out the military to execute decrees against tenants for the arrears of rent was going through this Dáil, they voted for it.  It was only yesterday they gave their support to what is known as the Flogging Bill, and now they speak as if they regretted having done so.  I think Deputy Gorey's amendment is an honest one, and for that reason I intend to support it.  I stood up merely to remind the Deputy, in case he should forget it, that he voted for the Bill which gave the military power to go out and seize cattle.  I am sure he regrets that now.</P>

      <P>I regret extremely the attitude taken up to-day by the Minister for Agriculture.  Listening to his speech to-day and to the speech he delivered on the Second Reading of the Bill, one would be almost inclined to think that it was not the same man was in it at all. In my opinion, his speech to-day is an invitation to the landlords to do their utmost against the tenants.  The landlords actually have the machinery ready, and it seems to be an invitation to them to put it in motion against the unfortunate tenants.  On the last day he more or less told us that he would bring in a clause somewhat on the lines of the amendment put forward to-day by Deputy <Col N="80" /> Gorey, but, judging from the speech he has just delivered, he wants now to get the whole lot of the landlords throughout Ireland to enforce their decrees.</P>

I said that in these circumstances I would make the terms of the Bill retrospective as from the date of its introduction, and that is exactly what the amendment I have read does.  I have not been guilty of any deceit, as, I think, has been suggested.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt you. I say that many landlords are getting writs executed in several parts of Ireland. Deputy Gorey gave the Dáil several examples.  In my opinion, the arguments of the Minister for Agriculture put forward in the Dáil to-day will be a great incentive to landlords to execute the decrees they have broadcasted all over the country.  I do not care what the Minister himself may think, but his attitude to-day towards this amendment is altogether different to what it was on the Second Reading of the Bill.  He has put up the case of the impoverished landlords from the North to the South, but he never mentioned the cases of the impoverished tenants&mdash;not a single one. I say, with all due respect to his impoverished landlords, that there are many tenants vastly more impoverished than the landlords, and they have got absolutely no way of making a living.  The depressed condition of the agricultural industry for the last two years has left many a tenant in a very impoverished state indeed.  I do not care how hard set a landlord may be, his position cannot be near as bad as that of an unfortunate tenant.  I am certain you would find very few landlords lying hungry in nooks and corners around Dublin, but I can assure Deputies in this Dáil that there are many tenants in that position.</P>

      <P>I think a very fair case has been made out in favour of this amendment by the Deputies on my right.  I have listened carefully to the reasons given by the Minister for Agriculture for his refusal to accept the amendment, and I must say they do not convince me.  He has stated that if he discovered it was the policy of the landlords as a body to get in before the Act he would take measures to prevent that. I confess that is all the more reason why he should take those measures.  If there were only two or three, or even a dozen, who must be the very worst of the landlords, that is all the more reason why they should be restrained, and why they should not be allowed to get the benefits. There are some benefits to be got&mdash;benefits which the more decent of the crowd refuse to take advantage of.  I think that is all the more reason why Deputy Gorey's amendment, as it stands, should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I read into the Minister's speech, and I generally read aright, that his statement here in the Dáil carried costs.  I read that into it, and I saw a letter from a very high-class solicitor to tenants telling them to tender their rents, less 25 per cent.  At the top of the letter the Minister's statement was quoted, to the effect that the amount claimed would include costs.  I have here a case where one and a half year's rent was collected, and the costs amounted to £60.  If the landlords through the country begin to collect these rents, and act as in the cases I have mentioned, the costs will really amount to as much as rent.  Having regard to what was said on the Second Reading, and having regard to what the solicitor read into the Minister's statement in the Dáil, which was quoted in the letter I referred to, that costs were included, I think a very good case has been made for Deputy Gorey's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case made by Deputy Gorey and his friends is a convincing one, and is also a very moderate one.  After all, the object of this Bill has been before the Dáil for quite a long time&mdash;long before the 28th May&mdash;and where actions were taken and costs incurred on processes up to the 28th May, that must have been done with the intention <Col N="82" /> of getting an advantage over the tenants before this Bill came into operation. They knew the Bill was coming, and knew it would be compulsory.  They knew it would be compulsory provided they did not agree, ultimately.  They knew there would be compulsory purchase in the absence of formal agreement, and that to me is pretty convincing that when a landlord adopted the policy of proceeding in the Courts he was trying to take advantage of the interregnum. Now, it may be that the Minister does not care to legislate retrospectively.  That is what he has said, and he has a very good precedent, but there is no good reason why in this case the principle of the moratorium could not have been enforced. I think Deputy Gorey's amendment ought to be supported, and I propose to vote for it.</P>

      <P>I have seldom listened to as much patent humbug as I have heard from the Farmers' Party this evening. I heard Deputy Doyle get up and work himself into a passion, and more or less suggest that I was running away from the terms I had promised some time ago.  I think the whole tone of Deputy Gorey's speech was to that effect also, but the climax was reached when Deputy Wilson got up and said he read into my statement an intention on my part of including costs.  Now, I will take the Dáil into my confidence.  I discussed this matter with the Farmers' Party.  I discussed it with Deputy Gorey, and I told him, not once, but twice or three times, that I would not include costs in any retrospective legislation if I accepted such an amendment. So that all these mock heroics, all this simulated anger, is mere bluff.  It would suit me to get up and talk about half-starving tenantry, like Deputy Doyle&mdash; there is nothing so easy&mdash;the poor fellows that are lying in corners and I do not know what other places he mentioned, and who have not the price of next morning's breakfast.  I could do that as well. Every member of our Party could get up and carry out the same performance and, I suppose, get the same advantages from it.  I do object to patent humbug of that sort after I had discussed this amendment and made it perfectly clear that I was not going to accept an amendment including costs.</P>

      <P>A terminological inexactitude. I will leave it at that.  I will not enter into the question any further. I will leave it to the Dáil.  I am inviting the landlords to go ahead, notwithstanding my statement that &ldquo;Any judgment or decree obtained in any proceedings against the tenants of a holding to which this Act applies for the recovery of rent or for the recovery of the holding for non-payment of rent after the 20th day of May, 1923, shall be vacated, and if any rent, or arrears of rent, shall have been levied or recovered under or in consequence of any such judgment or decree in excess of the sum to which compounded arrears of rent would have otherwise amounted, the amount of such arrears shall be set off against the moneys to become payable by the tenant to the Land <Col N="84" /> Commission in lieu of rent.&rdquo;  That is the invitation to the landlords to go ahead.  If Deputies think that is an invitation to landlords to go ahead I am sure I could not convince them.  But the plain meaning of it is, and the intention is, that any rent that is recovered now will be adjusted later on, and the tenant will get the credit for anything which he has paid over and above what he should have paid under the Bill.  I made the point before, and I make it again, that only an extremely small proportion of the writs that have been issued have actually been executed.  I had the lists from the Sheriffs, and I read them out to Deputy Gorey and other Deputies at a meeting which I had with them.  Deputy Gorey is as good a judge as I am, having seen these returns, as to what the exact proportion is.  I have not them with me at the moment.  The returns I had at that time were dealing not with writs issued or writs that had been executed since the 28th May, but writs that had been executed this year.  Only an extremely small percentage were executed, and in most of the counties no writs had been executed at all.  So there is no question about it.  There was no policy.  As a matter of fact, in spite of all these mock heroics and of all these appeals for the poor impoverished tenants, for whom I have just as much sympathy as the people who talk so loud, there has been no such policy.  That is the fact. That is the truth, and it is right that the truth should be stated even where it does not suit.  It is a fact, and every man who thinks out the question for himself and looks at the question squarely and does not deceive himself about it, knows it is a fact that the likelihood is that in the few cases where writs have been executed they have been executed by landlords whose mortgagees have been pressing them.  That is a fact, and any amount of mock heroics will not hide it, or any amount of talk about the impoverishment of the tenants will not hide it.  I do not know what we ought to be afraid of.  I do not see any reason for it.  The time has passed when it was necessary to get up and do a certain amount of tub-thumping. If we want legislation passed we have our own Parliament now; we are not dealing with an English Parliament with a Tory majority.  We can pass any Act we like.  There is no occasion to make misstatements in order to get an <Col N="85" /> Act passed&mdash;none whatever.  The fact is, the truth is, the equity of the case, if anyone cares to look at it, is this, that it is only right to assume that in the few cases where writs have been executed it is by reason of the fact that their mortgagees have been pressing these particular men.  These two facts, apart from any histrionics, bear examination, and I invite any Deputy who disagrees with me to examine them and to show that they are wrong.  If they are wrong, then let us alter our policy, but if they are right let us base our policy on that.  I say that these facts are facts, and are there.  In order to meet the case&mdash;it is purely a bargain&mdash;I made an offer to Deputy Gorey to accept that amendment as a pure matter of expediency.  Any Arrears Act is a matter of expediency.  You cannot treat an Arrears Act in the same way that you would treat any other Act.  The legislation connected with an Arrears Bill has always been based on a question of expediency.  We all know that.  We can chop and change and discuss that, and draw deductions from it, but that is the fact.  We were trying to make a bargain, and when you are dealing with arrears you do it on the same principle that you make any other bargain.  I want to make a bargain.  The Government regard themselves here as the trustees of fair play in the matter, and to my mind the facts which I have stated represent fair play, and no amount of histrionics will alter the facts.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the proposal that the Minister has made is one that, as far as possible, meets the equities of the case put forward on behalf of the tenants.  I am sure that the Minister, like other Deputies here, is in sympathy with the claims put forward on behalf of the tenants.  He has had that sympathy all through his career, as most of us here have had, and that sympathy would lead him to go as far as he possibly could, in the circumstances of the case, to meet the claims of the tenants.  But, at the same time, he is confronted with the position of the landlord who is beset by incumbrancers and who is being pressed by them.  In these circumstances he has got to consider the equities of the situation, seeing that the landlords are now being handed over to the State without anybody to look to for sympathy, and are supposed to be out of touch with things as they are at present <Col N="86" /> in this country, and to have no means by which they can get their side of the case considered.  Unfortunately in the past the landlords had all the weight and all the influence, and were able to order and direct in whatever way they liked the destinies of the tenants under their control. Now the position is reversed, and we are placed in the position which the landlords formerly occupied.  The question for the Minister then is, is he to pursue the same policy that they pursued in the past?  I think he cannot consistently or logically pursue that system, and I think he has gone as far as he possibly could.  Undoubtedly some landlords who have not been beset by incumbrancers have pressed recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not back them up.  I believe that the proposal the Minister lays down, that from the 20th May any such action taken, decrees enforced, sought or obtained will be adjusted, and that whatever money is received on foot of these decrees will be on the condition that the tenants will get the full benefit as if they were not decreed at all, is a very fair interpretation of the situation, and that the Minister has gone as far as he could. We would all wish that landlords had not the power to execute decrees to recover money.  There may be instances, however, where, unfortunately, it would be necessary.  With a great number of tenants it has not been necessary, as they have done their best to meet their obligations, and it is only when force of circumstances prevented them that they held back.  Some of the tenants unquestionably are deserving of our sympathy <Col N="87" /> and consideration, but others amongst them are people who took advantage of the situation, and they are not in sympathy with us or with the nation.  I think the Minister has steered a course so as to meet the situation all round.  I think the farmers, if they persist in an extreme view, are not guided by the requirements of the situation or by the real merits of the case.  That is not advisable in an Assembly like this, where every member should feel some sense of the responsibility that is placed upon him, apart from his predilections, and should take into account all the circumstances and not be guided by one side only.  I think the Minister has met the case in a very fair and reasonable way.</P>

      <P>The most the Minister said was that he did not think it would be fair to preclude men from taking advantage of the law that they would be entitled to take.  He thought the question of costs would be extreme.  I thought I convinced the Minister that he should adopt a reasonable view of including the costs.  I was convinced when proposing this amendment that he would have accepted it, not only for over-payments, but for costs also.  When I put it down I was not inspired by extravagant statements or wild claims.  I brought the amendment up to the most reasonable point, and that was the date of the introduction of the Bill.  That should be sufficient warning to any landlord, whether he was encumbered or whether he was driven by creditors or by those who lent him money.  I did not make any extravagant claim, but confined myself to the last possible date, May 28th, which this could date from. I have no regrets or recantations to make as to the attitude I took up with regard to the Public Safety Act.  What I did then I would do again.  Our Party would not question this matter at all, only to make their position clear.  Deputy Lyons probably was not here at the time, or I do not think he would have referred to the subject.  We hear too much about impoverished landlords.  A good many Deputies talk for political reasons, and not on the merits of the case.  I am surprised that men who know so much about the circumstances should go out, including Deputy McGoldrick, who has now gone to the Lobby.  Probably other Deputies will come back and vote on the Division after listening to the speeches beyond in the bar.</P>

      <P>I am not a bit impressed by the argument of the Minister about these landlords, because with the exception of one man I know that they are not impoverished.  I have personal knowledge of the facts.  A certain section of these landlords go and take advantage and enforce these decrees after the introduction of this Bill.  Why should they be let off scot free, and why should the others be in a worse position?  Why should one law apply to the men who have executed decrees and another law apply to the men who have not?  The men who have executed these decrees are the cream of the bad ones.  If this is a question of costs, it is a big thing for some tenants, because you have the most vindictive of the landlords&mdash;men like Dobbyn, of <Col N="90" /> Waterford, men who have gone into the Bankruptcy Court and heaped costs upon the tenants, which is quite different from going into the Civil Courts.  These are more serious matters perhaps than the Minister considers.  But the facts are there; I do not think that we are unreasonable in this amendment.  As a matter of fact, I think we brought it down to the last date to which we could bring it down.  It is absolutely reasonable. It is not for political reasons we are pressing this amendment.  It is for pure justice.  A certain element in the State has endeavoured to evade the Legislature, and we ask the Dáil to penalise them for that meanness and for endeavouring to get at the back of the Bill and the back of the common law.  I do not think we are unreasonable.  These men did what they did with their eyes open.  I do not think that it is just that they should be permitted to evade the law.  It is not reasonable.  It is not for the purpose of politics that this amendment has been put up; it is in the interests of justice between man and man that I press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is anything unreasonable in this amendment or anything that ought prevent the Minister from accepting it. There is nobody knows better than he does the position with regard to the farmers and agriculture.  You have it in the evidence that has been put before us in the Agricultural Commission.  If you take up <i>Stubb's Gazette</i> you will find lists of farmers there, and you have lots of the tenants in a more impoverished state and unable to meet their liabilities than the landlords.  There was another case made by the Minister that there were only a few cases of tenants in different districts in which seizures had been made.  Of course, there were only a few seized, but these would be seized to intimidate the remainder of the tenants in the districts.</P>

He knows the value of investments and how they have depreciated.  His sympathies are like our own, with the tenant.  My sympathies are with the tenants too, but that does not compel me to overlook all things else. I have to consider all the merits of the case.  I consequently stated that I believed the Minister has met the situation in a way that seems to me to be just and equitable, and in that way I am prepared to accept the Minister's recommendation and to vote against this amendment of Deputy Gorey, seeing that it is not in any sense proportionate to the equities of the case at the moment, and that it cannot have any chance of being accepted.</P>

      <P>Apparently there has been considerable misunderstanding about this matter, and, possibly, other people may be in the same case as we <Col N="92" /> have been.  I certainly never believed that I had given the impression to anybody&mdash;I am not talking now about the Dáil but outside&mdash;that we would not only recover from them any rent which they had recovered, but that we would recover the costs as well.  However that impresson may have got abroad, it is a revelation to me that it did.  To meet that case I will make a slight modification.  I will make another offer.  I will change the date from the 20th May to this date. Everybody will have sufficient notice after this debate.</P>
      <P>I will alter it to read as follows: &ldquo;Any judgment or decree obtained in any proceedings against the tenants of a holding to which this Act applies, for the recovery of rent or the recovery of the holding for the non-payment of rent, after the 3rd July, 1923, shall be vacated, and if any sums shall have been levied or recovered under or in consequence of any such judgement or decree, in excess of the sum to which compounded arrears of rent would have otherwise amounted, the amount of such excess shall be set off against the moneys becoming due.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Dáil to the insanitary condition of the jail in Wicklow.  On account of rumours the Wicklow Council directed their Sanitary Officer to inspect the gaol, and admission was refused.  The reason that I bring forward this motion is that my town is a seaside resort, and we are afraid of an epidemic.  I also wish to state that the most friendly relations exist between soldiers in the barracks and the civilians in the town, as also between the prisoners and the Governor and soldiers in charge.  In the interests of all concerned, an inspection should be made of the gaol, and those grievances should be removed.  This jail had been condemned by the British military authorities for over fifteen years.  The windows and doors are broken, so what must the inside be like? The prisoners are confined, three in each cell.  Seventeen out of 103 have mattresses. The remainder of the prisoners in the cells are sleeping on the bare floor, and it is only within the last week that some straw has been brought into the prison.  A number of these prisoners have been ill owing to the stench coming from the bottom cells.  One is in hospital from double pneumonia, and if a death takes place it will not be in the interest either of the Government or the townspeople. The happy relations hitherto existing will cease to exist if a crisis takes place.  This being a seaside resort, the people are dependent on the holiday makers who come to Wicklow.  As this is very warm weather, and such a number of prisoners are confined, the matter is a very serious one.  I am not aware that any Act has been passed which denies the right of the Sanitary Authority to visit the prisoners. As to the relationship between the <Col N="97" /> prisoners and the Governor, it is of the best.  The prisoners cook for themselves, but, unfortunately, the food that sick prisoners require is not available.  There are seventeen prisoners in very ill-health at the present time.  An appeal was sent by the Commandant of the prisoners to the Governor for some extra exercise in a larger space, and also they asked for more lavatory accommodation.  The water supply is insufficient.  They also appealed for milk for the sick patients.  The doctor, who visits the place, resides in Gorey, and at the present time a doctor should give a daily visit when the number of prisoners is so large.  Out of 103 prisoners one is in hospital suffering from pneumonia, 14 are ill in bed; 24 are ill, but not in bed, and about 30 are generally unwell.</P>
      <P>These prisoners have appealed to the Governor, but up to the present they have received no reply.  While we hold the Ministers here technically responsible they may not be aware of those complaints generally, and I am sure when they are brought to their notice they will have a number of prisoners removed to a more suitable place.  There are 30 of the prisoners in&mdash;merely for their political opinions&mdash;and the majority of this 30 have signed an undertaking over two months ago.  One man is up to 70 years of age, and there are amongst them, young boys.  I ask that those men should be released as they have signed their undertakings, and as there are no charges against them.  The space for exercise is a very small one for men able to take exercise.  It is 45 yards by 25 yards for a number of prisoners.  We appeal to the Ministers to have an inquiry into the whole matter, and it would not only be in the interest of the prisoners, but in the interest of the town.  As I have explained, we are of opinion in Wicklow that if something is not done immediately an epidemic may break out.  The Medical Officer of Health said to the prisoners that he could not do much for the men who were either lying in bed or lying on the floor.  He suggested to give them iodine and something else.  On the 25th June an appeal was sent from the Commandant of the prisoners to the Governor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is bad for the prisoners is equally bad for the soldiers on guard, because they have to live in the same cells.  I believe the Governor, to show <Col N="98" /> his friendship, and because of the good feeling that existed between the soldiers and prisoners, gave up his own bed to some of the prisoners who were ill.  The following letter was sent by the Commandant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I enclose herewith a list of men who are now ill in bed and who are otherwise unwell, and I must draw your special attention to the following, which require immediate remedy, as, otherwise, I can only inform you that very many men will have their health permanently injured, if detained under existing conditions, for a very much longer period.</P>
    <P>He goes on to explain about the lavatory and all the other things that are in a bad way.  There are no washing facilities, and all the conditions tend to ill-health.  I am sure it is not the intention of any man&mdash;though people outside may say otherwise&mdash;or of the Government, to injure the health of any prisoner while in their charge.  I would ask them to have inquiry made in this case and to have the grievances remedied, not alone in the interests of the prisoners, but in the interests of the civil population.  I am referring only to the jail in my own constituency, and when I bring forward the question, I trust that the wrongs will be righted, and that the prisoners will have little to complain of in a short time.  It is impossible to improve the conditions of the jail.  Under the British system prisoners were not asked to remain there over-night.  If the trial of a prisoner did not come off before the County Court Judge in time, he was brought to Dublin.  We do not want to treat prisoners in a way in which criminals were not treated under the British law. We should treat them in a way which would enable them to forget the past, so that each one would work for the benefit of the country in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to voice my opinion with regard to the visits of sanitary officers to the different jails.  In <Col N="99" /> the town of Athlone there were about 900 prisoners at one time.  I see the Minister for Defence shakes his head at that which gives me the impression that he disputes the figure.  In any event, there were between 700 and 800 prisoners, and the space for exercise was not sufficient.  The washing facilities were inadequate.  General McKeon got the prisoners to be a little more careful with themselves, and through doing so, probably they have succeeded in improving the conditions.  However, I would like that the Sanitary Officers and the Visiting Justices should be allowed to inspect all these prisons and see how the prisoners are being looked after.  They are prisoners of the Army Council, and the Army Council must be responsible for them while under their charge.  If any of these men contract disease through neglect, bad food or bad sanitary arrangements, and if they die, then there is nothing else but to accuse the Army authorities.  I do not want to say harsh things, because I anticipate that in the near future the prisons in Ireland will be empty.  I certainly want the Minister for Defence to release as many of those prisoners as possible.</P>

      <P>I hope I made myself perfectly clear that most friendly relations exist between the prisoners and their guard.  They have no complaint but on the question of food.  In other places the treatment may be different, but in Wicklow Jail the food is of the best and their relationship with the guard is of the very best.  They only complain that the food is too coarse for sick men.</P>

      <P>As I understand Deputy Everett, while he may have the idea of the welfare of the prisoners in mind, he has brought this matter up, not so much from the prisoners' point of view, as in <Col N="100" /> the interests of public health.  Some time ago a discussion took place here on which some of us requested that the sub-sanitary officers in the various towns should be allowed into the barracks.  I am still of opinion that that is absolutely necessary in the interests of public health. Apart altogether from the prisoners, the soldiers in the different barracks are living under intolerable conditions.  I know that in Wexford the medical officer attached to the barracks resigned because of that fact.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The sanitary conditions of jails and barracks in which prisoners are detained.&rdquo;  Now, Deputy Corish succeeded himself one evening in getting a very strict ruling on this question, and if it hits Deputy Corish now he must be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that, but if the soldiers and prisoners are in the one barracks, I think I can raise this matter.  I think if I can prove that, in consequence of prisoners being housed in barracks, it is not beneficial to the health of the soldiers, I will be in order in raising it.  Some time ago, as I said, the medical officer attached to the Wexford unit resigned because some of his representations in connection with this matter were not listened to, and the sanitary arrangements were not, according to what he thought, in the interests of public health. Another doctor was appointed and there was no more about it.  If the sanitary officers appointed by the councils were permitted to visit barracks and prisons this sort of thing would not go on, and I say again that it is in the interests of public health that these people should be allowed in.  During the period which we have gone through, officers and people in charge of barracks were not able to give the attention to these matters that they required.  That is quite understood. But if you have visits from sanitary officers these things could be attended to.  The English Government used to permit their barracks to be visited by the sanitary officers, and I do not see any reason why the Irish Government, which ought to be more interested in public health, would not do the same.  I would press this point again and hope that the Minister for Defence will reconsider the matter from this point of view, and allow the sanitary officers to visit the barracks.</P>

      <P>There are such a large number of prisoners that we are necessarily restricted in our accommodation for them.  The Government has spent a very large sum of money in providing suitable and adequate accommodation. If there are any places in which prisoners are housed in anything like unsuitable conditions it is principally as a result of the shortage of accommodation produced by the destruction carried out by the prisoners themselves in other places.  Wicklow Jail would not be used for prisoners but for that particular destruction. We are quite aware of the unsatisfactory condition of things existing in Wicklow Jail.  The matter has been under special observation and investigation by us, and it is not proposed to continue it as a prison.  An idea of the shortening of accommodation for prisoners produced by destruction by prisoners is given by the figures which I have here. In Newbridge damage to the premises was £8,500; at Maryborough damage to the extent of £5,500 was done; at Mountjoy to the extent of £9,000, and at Hare Park Camp to the extent of £130.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say there are places where the present conditions are not ideal.  Just as the conditions in Wicklow are not ideal for the prisoners, neither are the conditions in Wicklow ideal for the troops. We want to give as little as possible unnecessary inconvenience in taking buildings from the people generally, and Wicklow Jail being there, we have made the best use of it up to the present, and it has not been satisfactory, but we could have provided better accommodation for the prisoners there if this particular destruction had not taken place.  We are, at the present moment, clearing out for the purpose of handing them back to the civil authorities certain of the jails. For instance, Waterford Jail has been entirely cleared out yesterday.  The greater portion of Mountjoy has been evacuated also, and it is proposed to clear in a very short time Limerick Jail.  The necessity for putting the Ministry of Home Affairs in a proper position for dealing with their particular side of the question has delayed rather longer than we anticipated <Col N="102" /> the clearing out of Wicklow Jail, but the conditions there are kept under close observation, and it is anticipated it will be cleared shortly.  On the question of the general sanitary and other conditions in prisons, a very considerable amount of propaganda&mdash;and propaganda is described in Irregular documents as the art of spreading the truth, &ldquo;truth&rdquo; underlined&mdash;has been carried on as regards the present general conditions.  I feel it necessary, therefore, to place before the Dáil, as this particular question has arisen here, the report by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who sent a mission here recently, and who were permitted any facilities that they required to visit any of the prisons.  I propose to put the whole document on the Records of the Dáil, but there are certain extracts I would like to read here now.  The Report states that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a result of numerous representations made to it on the subject of the treatment of prisoners in Ireland, the International Committee of the Red Cross, appointed MM. Schlemmer and Haccius to go to Dublin to obtain authority from the Irish Government to institute an inquiry of a purely nonpolitical and technical nature into the position of the said prisoners.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross were received by Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Walshe, Secretary, and General Morrin, Director of Army Medical Services. A mutual understanding was arrived at as to the nature of the facts to be investigated, and as to the character of the intervention of the International Committee of the Red Cross so as to determine the exact lines in which the activity of the Delegates should be directed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Considering that the character of the International Committee of the Red Cross confers on it the right and the duty to intervene when an appeal is made to it, and when the principles of humanity, which should be recognised by the belligerents as much during wars as following them, are publicly involved; considering also that the nature of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the experience gained by it offer every guarantee of the impartiality of its inquiries, and of <Col N="103" /> the manner in which all leanings towards any but purely humanitarian considerations should be avoided&mdash;the Irish Government decided to grant the authority requested by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and to accord to the Delegates every facility for visiting the prisons and internment camps of the country and of making a report on the treatment of those detained in them.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;M. Schlemmer then returned to Geneva in order to report on the result of the negotiations, and on the welcome accorded by the Irish Government to the application of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;M.R. Haccius was delegated to visit the prison camps from the point of view of their organisation and accommodation, and of the sanitary conditions of the internees.  We give the following extracts of information from the report submitted by our Delegate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;The total number of prisoners and internees is about 11,500 men and 250 women.  Our Delegate visited the principal camps comprising a total of 7,369 prisoners.  The treatment of these prisoners is devoid of all hostile spirit and the general principles adopted by the 10th International Conference of the Red Cross are observed.  The Government refuses the status of &ldquo;prisoners of war&rdquo; to the prisoners, but in reality treats them as such.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Delegate particularly draws the attention of the Committee to the fact that nowhere did he find a wounded or sick prisoner left without medical treatment.  On the contrary, he found everywhere a carefully organised medical service.  The serious accusations made on this subject appear to him unfounded.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Delegate was not able to visit the prison at Kilmainham where 250 women are detained, but has no reason to believe that the treatment there is different to that adopted at Mountjoy.  Thirteen of those prisoners had been on hunger-strike since the day of their arrest to obtain their release or immediate trial, and not as a protest against the prison regime.  This fact is, moreover, verified by their written statements. <Col N="104" /> The Delegate did not consider it his duty to insist on getting into touch with these prisoners, fearing that his intervention, misinterpreted, would only encourage them to persist in their attitude, and give rise to a new case of strike.  During his sojourn three of these prisoners were released.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The buildings of the old &lsquo;North Dublin Union&rsquo; are in the course of alteration for the reception of those detained in Kilmainham. These buildings, with the surrounding gardens, will fulfil all desirable hygienic conditions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The instructions given by the International Committee of the Red Cross to its Delegate exclude certain representations and sworn inquiries bearing on individual complaints.  It is a fact that searches have taken place in various private hospitals, but the working of these hospitals has not been interfered with.  There are grounds for the complaints of overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The complaints regarding the prohibition of correspondence with prisoners' families, sanitary conditions, and food in the camps are unfounded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to certain of the camps visited, in the case of Tintown, where the number of prisoners is 3,200, they reported that there are 72 men in the infirmary, and 25 men in the surgical hospital, that &ldquo;there are no epidemics, but that a certain number of men who arrived lately are affected with scurvy, and have been isolated from the rest while being treated.  Wash houses with water supply in the enclosure of the camp.&rdquo;  The Mission reported on a visit to the internment camp at Gormanstown, that there are 1,500 prisoners there, and they found that there were 7 men in hospital, and that there were no epidemics.  In Newbridge where there are 1,969 men they found there were 39 in the infirmary, and that each prisoner was provided with an iron bed, pillow, mattress, sheet and two blankets, such as in Tintown.  They found that there was a great difference in the neatness of the rooms, and that this entirely depended on the prisoners themselves.  In the same way in Mountjoy, &ldquo;the interior service of the prison was kept clean by <Col N="105" /> the prisoners themselves.  Soap and materials supplied.  There is a vast difference in the cleanliness of the cells. Some internees scour the floor, and keep their blankets well beaten, while others take no care to keep their cells clean.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Generally, they found that the greatest possible attention was paid to the conditions under which the prisoners were housed.  The food, and the manner in which the food was cooked and provided, was good, and the sanitary accommodation was so adequate as to overflow the use to which the majority of the prisoners actually put it.  In respect of Kilmainham, the Red Cross Delegation did not visit it, but as late as June 15th we find ladies writing from Kilmainham, and saying: &ldquo;I almost forgot to tell you I am enjoying this place fine, and don't care how long it will last.&rdquo; Another writes: &ldquo;Don't take any notice of the Bantry people's talk&mdash;this is a great place.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that eight cattle, three of which were the property of James Malynn, three of Michael Brennan, and two of Joseph McGrath, were seized by National forces from the lands of Mr. Matt. Farrell, Ballymore, Westmeath; whether Mr. Farrell rented these lands to the above-mentioned persons for grazing purposes.

      <P>The cattle referred to in the question were seized by troops, as they were trespassing on lands which have been seized illegally by Mr. Farrell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> About two years ago Mr. Farrell forcibly took possession of these lands. His claim was subsequently adjudicated upon by a District Court in April, 1922, and was rejected.  Mr. Farrell's appeal to the Circuit Court was dismissed with costs in June, 1922, and an ejectment decree was executed on Mr. Farrell in August, 1922.  Mr. Farrell immediately resumed forcible possession of the lands and retained possession until the lands were again cleared by the military authorities on the 9th ult.  There can be no doubt but that Messrs. Malynn, Brennan and McGrath were aware that they could acquire no legal grazing rights on the lands in question from Mr. O'Farrell, and that they were grazing the lands illegally.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the sale of the seized stock will be retained by the military authorities pending a decision by the Dáil on the general question.</P>
