      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that Michael Piggot, Harbour Road, Kilbeggan, Westmeath, has lodged, a claim for £10 15s. 6d. in respect of money taken from him by armed men on January 19th, 1923; and further, whether the Minister is aware that the money mentioned was the property of the Midland Great Western Railway Company, who are now pressing for payment of same, and as Piggot is in poor circumstances will the Minister expedite his claim.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of the receipt of a claim for compensation from Mr. Michael Pigott. In connection with a case of the kind mentioned, perhaps I may take the opportunity to remind the Deputy that the provisions of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, expressly preclude any award of compensation in respect of the loss of coins, Bank or Government notes, or currency of any country, other than those taken away from the premises of a bank.</P>

Until an award by the Commission has been notified to me no question of payment will, of course, arise.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether Terence Myles, a late employee of the Dublin Corporation Cleansing Department, aged 60 years, having 30 years' continuous service, retired more than a year ago, having been recommended for a pension of £2 11s. 6d., being two-thirds of his average wages for the preceding three years; whether this pension has been sanctioned, and if not, will the Minister state the reason for the very long delay in deciding this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as stated in the first part of the question. This is one of some sixty cases where sanctions have not been given.  In awarding pensions to their employees the Corporation have adopted a policy to which there are two main objections: (1) that irrespective of length of service, pensions have been granted on the basis of two-thirds of the existing emoluments; and (2) that emoluments of a temporary nature have been included and deemed as substantive for purposes of calculation of pensions.  This is an indefensible method of procedure.  In April last a fully explanatory letter was addressed to the Corporation indicating the general principles warranting the granting of and the amounts of pensions, and the Corporations were invited to reconsider the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the fact that this course has not been adopted any delay which has occurred is referable.  It is understood, however, that effect has been given to my authorisation that pending the determination of the cases the employees concerned might be paid temporarily according to their years of service.  Presumably under this arrangement Mr. Myles is being paid <Col N="1864" /> some twenty-nine sixtieths of such amounts at a rate fixed on basic wages, together with appropriate allowance in respect of any increases which were founded on the enhanced cost of living.</P>

      <P>The question of amending the Asylums Officers Superannuation Act, 1909, has been under consideration, and it was intended to introduce an amending Bill, but it was not found possible to do so this session owing to the pressure of other business.  No decision has yet been reached with regard to giving retrospective effect to any amendment.</P>

An order under Section 61 entitled the &ldquo;Registration of Electors (Defence Force) Order, 1923,&rdquo; was issued on the 20th April last, and the requisite claim forms were distributed by the Ministry of Defence.  All members of the Force who returned these forms claiming to vote by post have had their names entered on the Postal Voters List and ballot papers will be dispatched to them, not later than the day after <Col N="1865" /> nomination day, but no person can vote in respect of a constituency other than that in which he is registered.</P>

      <P>There are already constituencies in which the complete register is ready and available for publication.  In any such case there is no objection to the supply of the register, on payment of the prescribed fee, to any person who wants it.  If the sale of portion of an incomplete register were permitted prior to publication, it would not be possible to guarantee that there would be no discrimination as the supply to individuals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible, for instance, to be sure that the Registration Officer would give as readily a part that had just come in to one person as to another.  There would be no means of knowing, from the point of the public or the people outside of official circles, that any particular part was ready or in, or that a part was really ready or not. It would be impossible for a person to come in, knowing that a particular part was ready and to demand it, and on the <Col N="1868" /> other hand it would be easy for the Registration Officer to say that one part was not ready when asked for it by one person, and that it was ready when asked for it by another.  The matter really introduces a certain element of informality and laxity which would make it impossible to be quite certain that there was no discrimination.  Nothing wrong might occur, but, on the other hand, if it did occur, there would be serious ground for complaint on the part of any person discriminated against.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The necessity which compels us to introduce this <Col N="1872" /> Bill is the Damage to Property Act and the Compensation Commission, both of which have drawn entirely upon the resources of the Valuation Offices, and on the officials of that office, and have interfered with the ordinary work which that office normally performs.  It will be quite understood that with the very large number of claims to be considered by the Compensation Commission, and with the immense amount of work that is inseparable from the Damage to Property Act, the Entire resources of the machinery of the State will be called upon in order to discharge the duties that would properly fall upon the Government in connection with these two institutions. The Compensation Commission deals with pre-truce cases, and the Damage to Property Act with post-truce cases.  In normal circumstances quite a number of valuations are listed for revision each year.  That revision work cannot be undertaken if we are to deal with the compensation Commission and with the Damage to Property Act properly, so that it will be necessary to suspend that revision, and this Act is for the purpose of suspending it.

      <P>The first amendment is a purely verbal one.  There are Boroughs in the country which are not County Boroughs.  The Bill was made to read &ldquo;County or other Boroughs.&rdquo; I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in the amendment&mdash; Section 56 line 27.  To add after the word &ldquo;county,&rdquo; at the end of the line, the words &ldquo;or other.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The next amendment includes in the definition of local authorities not only committees of the directly elected local authorities but committees wholly or partly appointed by them.  A similar amendment was put up by the same Senator in the case of the Electoral Law Bill, and was accepted.  This simply brings the wording of the definition of the Electoral Abuses Bill into line with the wording of the definition that was inserted in the Electoral Law Act in the Seanad.  I move that we agree with the Seanad in the amendment&mdash;Section 56, line 33.  To insert after the words &ldquo;Committee of&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or wholly or partly appointed by.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Amendment 3 is an amendment which was carried against me in the Seanad, but I would recommend the Dáil to accept it.  As the Bill went up to the Seanad, there was no maximum limit of expenses.  The Seanad seemed to be almost unanimously in favour of inserting a limit, and it carried this particular amendment.  It fixes the limit a great deal higher than the limit in the Act of 1920.  That Act fixed the limit at 2d. per Elector on the Register, so that in the case of a 3-member constituency, <Col N="1874" /> where there will be roughly 30,000 voters on the register, the scale that was adopted in the Seanad would give a limit of about £500 in a borough constituency per individual, and £625 in a county constituency.  In the case of an eight-member constituency there would be £13,033, and in the case of a borough £1,666.  In the case of a county constituency there is practically no limit, so far as the larger constituencies are concerned. It is a limit that may be gone up to in the smaller constituencies.  In view, as I say, of the Practical unanimity of the Seanad in favour of inserting this amendment and of the necessity of passing the Bill on account of the business there is and the shortness of time, and in view of the fact that the limit is fixed so very high in a great many constituencies, it cannot operate as an effective limit at all, I would recommend the Dáil to accept it. The amendment is:</P>
      <P>Delete Part III. of the First Schedule and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">PART III.&mdash;MAXIMUM SCALE.</P>
      <P>The expenses mentioned in Parts I. and II. of this Schedule, other than personal expenses and the fee, if any, paid to the election agent (not exceeding in the case of a county election seventy-five pounds, and of a borough election fifty pounds, without reckoning for the purposes of that limit any part of the fee which may have been included in the expenses first above mentioned) shall not exceed an amount equal&mdash;</P>
      <P>in the case of a county election to fivepence for each elector on the register;</P>
      <P>in the case of an election for a borough to fourpence for each elector on the register.</P>
      <P>Where there are two or more joint candidates at an election, the maximum amount of expenses in Parts I., II, and III. of this Schedule shall, for each of the joint candidates, be the amount produced by multiplying a single candidate's maximum by one-and-a-half and dividing the result by the number of joint candidates.</P>

      <P>I think, Sir, as this is a matter that concerns elections to the Dáil, and is altogether alien in that regard, at any rate to the Seanad; that this is the House that should determine the limit, because it is a question of limiting expenditure to curb corruption, to preclude as far as possible opportunities for bribery, let us say, under the cover of election expenses.  As the Minister has pointed out, this is in practice setting up no limit at all.  If we had time, I am quite sure the Dáil would not accept this amendment but would send it back again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might draw attention again to the fact that in the original Bill there was a limit put to the expenditure of election agents.  In the case of a University constituency there will be no limit if this amendment is accepted.  It seems to have been deliberately deleted.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That it is hereby declared that the Bill entitled The Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923, which has been passed by this House, is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety, and that, accordingly, the provisions of Article 47 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eíreann shall not apply to that Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This resolution, which the Dáil is asked to pass, is rendered necessary by the decision given in the Courts, which mean that the Defence Forces Bill passed by the Dáil, and which was yesterday passed in the Seanad without amendment, could not come into force for seven days.  That would mean that legally I would have no power in the meantime to have or control an army or to discipline them, and that I would have no power to detain in custody military prisoners convicted of offences punishable under the military law.  For that reason, and in order that the Defence Forces Bill may have legal effect as from the time of its passing, it is necessary to have this resolution passed by the Dáil. A similar resolution was yesterday passed by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am not going to oppose this resolution if it be deemed a matter of necessity.  I only want to say that it was the intention of the Constitution that certificates of this kind should be used very sparingly, and that they should be the exception rather than the rule.  This is the third resolution of this nature that we have been asked to pass within two days.  I mention the matter, not for the purpose of <Col N="1877" /> opposing the resolution or to throw any obstruction in the way, but to urge that certificates to make one of the provisions of the Constitution null and void, if they are used, should be used sparingly.  I should be reluctant to think that the Minister for Home Affairs will press for a certificate on the Intoxicating Liquors Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what grounds Deputy Figgis has for his reluctance to believe that the Minister for Home Affairs would press such a claim. There is at least as much necessity for that as for this.  This Bill was a Bill of 200 odd clauses.  It was submitted to us last week, and it was asked that it should not be considered in detail because there was need for regularising the acts of the Army in the past and putting the Army on a legal footing.  It was made a temporary Bill, to last twelve months, and it was not suggested that it was a matter of supreme urgency.  But for the suddenly disclosed intention to dissolve within a week or two there would have been time given for consideration of this Bill.  It was only on account of the sudden decision to dissolve, and because the consideration of the Bill in detail would require considerable time, that the Dáil was persuaded to agree to its passing as a temporary Bill without full discussion.  There was no suggestion made that it was a matter of immediate urgency.  Now we are asked to say that it was.  The Minister has not yet told us where the immediacy is, and surely seven days is not going to make it impossible. There is no sign whatever that there is any intention on the parts of two-fifths of the Dáil or the majority of the Seanad to move for the holding up of this Bill for ninety days.  There is not the slightest sign that the country is wild about the Bill, for or against.  The country knows nothing about it.  This procedure suggests that it is a cheap matter and a small matter passing a resolution of this kind, and that it need not be considered.  The Constitution does not matter; it was passed in a hurry and to achieve certain objects, and those objects having been attained, they can be thrown overboard.  We, at least, ought to show some semblance of respect to that child of the Provisional Parliament, and unless there are good grounds stated here for this resolution, I think the Dáil should not agree to it. <Col N="1878" /> Deputy Figgis points out that it was only to meet cases of extreme urgency that such a proviso was inserted.  We ought to be told where the urgency lies before being asked to pass this resolution.</P>

      <P>The necessity for passing this declaration arises out of the very unexpected decision of the Court given yesterday.  While not agreeing that that is a proper and justified decision, it is necessary formally to accept it.  The necessity for passing this resolution does not arise, in our opinion, out of any particular clause in the Constitution, but out of a misinterpretation of such a clause.  The effect of the decision of the Court given yesterday, together with the effect of the decision given a day or two ago that a state of war did not exist, puts the Executive Council and those responsible for the Army in the position that, if we do not get this declaration passed now, for the next seven days there is no soldier in the Army who can be held to be responsible or subject to his immediate superior officers; there is no military prisoner, no prisoner convicted of any charges brought against him by his military superiors who, on a <i>habeas corpus</i> application, may not be set at liberty; there is no officer in the Army who has any legal right to arrest any soldier in the Army who has committed an offence either against the military law or against the civil law.  It is to obviate a state of affairs like that, which I am sure the Dáil does not wish to have existing, that because of this exceptional decision in the Courts yesterday it is necessary to get this resolution passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  First of all, there was a resolution in the Dáil on the 18th of September, 1922, introduced by Deputy Gavan Duffy, stating that it was the opinion of the Dáil that Ireland should join the League of Nations, and that application for admission to the League shall be made forthwith.  There was an amendment by the Minister for External Affairs: &ldquo;That it is the opinion of this Dáil that application for admission to the League of Nations should be made as and when the Government finds it advantageous,&rdquo; and that was passed.  Subsequently discussion took place in the Seanad, and the Bill was introduced into the Seanad this week.  It has been passed by them, and it is now before the Dáil.  It really carries into effect the purpose of the resolution passed in the Dáil in September.  I do not think it is necessary to say anything further about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Could one have a little further information, which I was rather expecting the President would take this opportunity of providing, to deal with what is meant by the words in this section.  &ldquo;It shall be lawful&rdquo;&mdash;I am reading the sentence without its parenthesis in order to get the continuity of the sense&mdash;&ldquo;for the Executive Council to give to the League such guarantees as shall be thought proper by the Executive Council and be acceptable to the League, of the sincere intention of Saorstát Eireann to observe its international obligations.&rdquo;  I am in favour of the general principle of Ireland joining the League of Nations. and have always been, but there are certain procedures of the League of Nations that have been a <Col N="1880" /> little disquieting.  If certain obligations were required of the Saorstát, which were to be left to the Executive Council of the day, and if they should decide that Ireland shall be called upon to fulfil her international obligations by furnishing, say, an army in a certain place far removed from Ireland, and in matters that do not in the least degree affect Ireland, surely in a matter of that kind the Oireachtas as a whole should have a voice in this decision, and should have a voice in any matters that might lead to so unfortunate a matter&mdash;that the matter should not be left entirely to the Executive Council.  I was, therefore, hoping to have the time to draft some amendment, but not having the time, I put forward a suggestion now to the President, both as guarding the Dáil and as guarding the Executive Council, that if these guarantees be asked for, the Executive Council shall first lay them on the Table of the Dáil, and that they should normally become of effect unless exception were taken to them.  At the present moment there is nothing in the objection that I make.  There is no danger that I imagine might be likely to arise, but it could arise in the future, and I think it desirable for that to be inserted now in order that the Executive Council should have the Legislature behind it in giving such guarantees as may be put upon it by the League of Nations.  If this were passed as it stands, if the Executive Council were to be called upon by the League of Nations to give certain guarantees which it did not feel it was justified in giving without consultation with the Parliament, in that case I am not sure whether this Act, having been recited before the League, would not empower the League to request the Executive Council to take these decisions in too great a haste, without it being possible that the Parliament could be consulted.  I would think that that would be wise, and I hope the President would see the justice of the points I am making, that some safeguard of that kind should be required; that the matter should not be left entirely between the Executive Council and the League, but that behind the Executive Council Parliament should always appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it will be conceded that in a matter of this kind we are not claiming more than any <Col N="1881" /> other nation which has joined the League of Nations, and it is open to question whether, if any meetings of this kind of bodies which have duly accredited representatives on behalf of certain nations, whether in every case in which matters come up for consideration and that decisions have to be taken, it is at all likely that there is a possibility of coming to an agreement if every such question and decision must be submitted to the representative Parliaments by the representatives of these Parliaments in such a body as the League of Nations.  Let us assume, for a moment, that the matter to be decided is the limitation of armaments, and that that limitation should form the basis of some ratio to population and that the assembled delegates there say, &ldquo;This is a matter upon which we must receive instructions from our respective Governments before we come to any agreement,&rdquo; what likelihood is there of any agreement on a matter of that kind?  What usually happens, as I take it, is that a body like this, composed of the representatives of various countries, considers certain proposals, discusses them, amends them, perhaps, from their original introduction, and adopts them.  They are then submitted, I assume, for ratification to the various countries, and they are ratified.  Some simplification takes place there, but why not, if matters which are the subject of consideration by bodies like the League of Nations, go further than submit them to Parliament, and submit them to a referendum?  Why not carry that system out in regard to every item of legislation which comes before us?  We are not claiming that the consideration of every matter which is the subject of legislation in Parliament could not be more democratically pronounced upon if it were submitted to the decision of the people, but we know that society in regulating its life and work, adopts simpler methods of procedure, even though it is not a cast-iron approval of the most extended possible conception of the democratic idea, although a reactionary democratic might say it is not really the democratically expressed will of the people unless it has been subscribed to by them.  I would say, from my experience of public matters, that it would be open to any section of the community to claim that every matter under <Col N="1882" /> the consideration of Parliament should be submitted to the consideration of the people.  You see at once how difficult and complicated it would be to get decisions upon cases, and how extremely expensive it would be.  We know that while each country in considering a question of that kind will have its own paramount interests before it, and will not be in a position to appraise the value of representations made by other countries, there would be no possibility of agreement. If each country considered only its own needs and requirements there is a possibility that each would instruct its representatives that they could not go beyond a certain distance.  There would be no finality in these matters.  I am satisfied, from the explanation given by the Minister for External Affairs in the Seanad in regard to this matter, that there are sufficient safeguards to protect the respective countries who are in the League of Nations by the codes regulating the business of the League in that respect.  The obligations incurred in joining are set forth in the Covenant, especially Articles VIII-XVII.  They are usually summarised in the following sub-heads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Limitation of armaments.</P>
      <P>(2)  A mutual guarantee of territory and independence.</P>
      <P>(3)  Admission that any circumstance which threatens international peace is an international interest.</P>
      <P>(4)  An agreement not to go to war.</P>
      <P>(5)  Acceptance of machinery for securing a peaceful settlement, with provision for publicity.</P>
      <P>(6)  The sanctions to be employed to punish a breach of the agreement in (4).</P>
      <P>(7)  Similar provisions for settling disputes where States not members of the League are concerned.</P>

I would like to say that I had not spoken about a referendum of the people at all.  I never touched on it or imagined it.  I was not speaking of the decisions taken in Council together. That never entered my imagination.  I was dealing with something that was quite clear and explicit, and that is to be done in this phrase, &ldquo;Such guarantees <Col N="1883" /> as shall be thought proper as between the Executive Council and the League of Nations.&rdquo;  The President has said that in Council it might be thought desirable to adopt disarmament.  Everybody would be delighted if that was so, but I imagine the Executive Council would need no extraordinary consultation to bring about that.  But supposing it brought about the reverse.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Stage of this Bill I want to make it clear that it does not purport to be anything like an exhaustive treatment of the problems which arise with regard to the liquor traffic in this country.  In considering that I have always recognised what I think most of the Deputies will accept as axiomatic, that there are too many licences for this particular trade in this country, and that such abuses as exist, and such abuses as arose in the past, are due very largely to the fact that there was scarcely enough of legitimate trade to go round, and that you had the spectacle of people breaking the law to pick <Col N="1884" /> up the crumbs that fall from the table of those in a more substantial way.  I think that the problem will never be adequately dealt with until some provision is made considerably to reduce the number of licences.  I do not propose to go into comparative statistics, but I think that every thoughtful person is aware that there are too many public houses per head of the population.</P>
      <P>To deal with that aspect of the thing would involve some scheme of purchase, and that must be another day's work for some future Parliament. This Bill in its 12 sections merely aims at checking certain existing abuses and anomalies.  I have not attempted to deal with all the abuses that exist, on the assumption that they will continue to exist, and the only cure is complete abolition of the provisions which give rise to them.  I have not, for instance, attempted to deal with or touch in any way the <i>bona fide</i> traveller. It remains to be seen whether such abuses as arise from that are abuses incapable of being dealt with by the new police force when it has grown to its normal strength.</P>
      <P>But I do say this, in a quite fair and reasonable spirit, that the members of this trade themselves must realise that if these abuses continue, and if they prove to be impossible of treatment by normal vigilance and exercise on the part of the police, then some Minister or Ministry in the future will have to face that fact if it is doing its duty in a responsible spirit.  We will have to deal with that question either by way of an extension of the distance or by the abolition of the privilege.  No personage has so much abused his legal privileges as the <i>bona fide</i> traveller, and if he is abolished by law, he will be abolished for the reasons that he abused his legal privileges up to the point when they became a nuisance.  I just say that.  The members of the trade really have, in this matter, their future in their own hands, but I do believe that if the grave abuses arising out of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic are not found to be amenable to normal vigilance and treatment by the police force, that fact will have to be faced.  This Bill in its first section deals with hours:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor or to open any premises <Col N="1885" /> for the sale of intoxicating liquors on any day not being a Sunday, Good Friday, or Christmas Day before the hour of nine o'clock in the morning or after the hour of half-past nine o'clock in the evening.  This sub-section shall not apply to any licensed person who is the owner or lessee of a theatre, music hall, or other place of public amusement.</P>
    <P>The effect of that will be to leave untouched the hours on Sundays, Good Fridays, and Christmas Day, and to leave the hours of the ordinary week-day from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  Some Deputies seem to think that because there was no special mention made of the hours on Sundays, Good Fridays, or Christmas Days, some point might arise in the future about that.  I do not think that can be so.  Indeed, I am quite satisfied that it is not so, and the existing law will stand except where altered by the provisions of this Bill.  Therefore, the statutory hours and regulations with regard to Sunday, Good Friday, and Christmas Day will remain as they now are.  Sub-section (2) of Section 1 deals with theatres, music halls, and places of amusement that have licences, and provides that:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor in any theatre, music hall, or other place of public amusement at any time being more than thirty minutes before the commencement of a performance or entertainment or at any time being more than thirty minutes after the end of a performance or entertainment or at any time after ten o'clock in the night.</P>
    <P>The second section of the Bill is simply an enabling section to deal with a situation that might not arise half a dozen times in the year.  But it might happen that on some occasion, in a town or in a village where you have a large concourse of people, that a situation might arise that would almost get out of hand, from the point of view of being dealt with by the small number of Guards that would be established in that place.  That situation might either arise in the first instance from drink, or it might, having arisen from some other cause, be greatly intensified by the fact that the licensed establishments were open and doing business.  We submit, <Col N="1886" /> for the consideration of Deputies, that at the request of the responsible police officer the District Justice should have power, if he is satisfied that a case of grave abuse prejudicial to peace and order has arisen and is in fact taking place in any town or village, to order the immediate closing of the houses if he is satisfied that it is expendient that the sale of intoxicating liquors should cease, and that he may order the immediate closing for the remainder of that day of all premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor in that village or town.</P>
    <P>I put that up for the consideration of Deputies, believing that if it is embodied in the Bill and conceded, it might be a very useful provision at some time in the future to prevent grave trouble arising in the form of riot or artificial excitement of that kind.</P>
    <P>Now, the third section deals with penalties for opening during prohibited hours.  It is purely a consequential section, and is to transfer the existing penalties which referred to the existing hours to the altered hours provided for in the Bill; and Section 4 deals with exceptions from the application of the Act and the regulations about hours.  It says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this part of this Act shall be construed to apply to sales of intoxicating liquor to lodgers, or to the sale of intoxicating liquor in packet boats, or in canteens in pursuance of any Act regulating the same, or in a registered club as defined by the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, or shall preclude the sale at any time at a railway station of intoxicating liquors on arrival or departure of trains, or the sale of intoxicating liquor to <i>bona fide</i> travellers within the meaning of the Licensing (Ireland) Acts, 1833 to 1905.</P>
    <P>These are the proposed exceptions to the general rule of hours.</P>
    <P>Now, Part II of the Bill deals with clubs.  Clause 5 says:</P>
    <P>(1)  In order that any club may be eligible to be registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, the rules of the club shall (in addition to the matters mentioned in Section 4 of the said Act) provide that no excisable liquor shall be supplied to any person (other than members of the club lodging in the club premises) before the hour of nine o'clock in the <Col N="1887" /> morning or after the hour of half-past nine o'clock in the evening on any day.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall not apply to any club which at the passing of this Act is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act. 1904, until the expiration of the certificate of registration of such club which shall be in force at the expiration of two months from the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>Now, the force of that is to bring the club hours into uniformity with the hours of licensed establishments, except for people who are genuinely lodging upon the premises, and who would be in the same position as residents in a hotel.  They will not apply to existing certificates, but would apply upon application for a renewal.  I have heard that section commented upon, but I want to know a case against it.  After all, is it right or proper or a healthy thing for the country that under the guise of clubs little all-night drinking shops should spring up all over the country?  I am afraid that to an extent that is the tendency, and that that is what has been happening.  Deputies may say that that should be provided against when applications are made for certificates and for registration and that we should be very strict and careful in considering the rules of the club.  In reply to that, I have only to say that a club may make an excellent start and degenerate very rapidly, and I do not see a case for the extension of the hours for the sale of drink in clubs beyond the ordinary hours.  After all, a twelve and a-half hours day is a long time for drinking, and a man who could sit out all that time should have a pretty good head.  At any rate, I will be interested to hear from Deputies who oppose this section the case against it.  I think it is substantially true to say that a big proportion of the night crimes that are committed and have been committed throughout the country are attributable to these clubs.  Men coming out of them in the small hours of the morning, not in a very responsible frame of mind, are in just that mood that their grievances loom very big, and they come out and take vengeance upon their neighbours.  I think it would be a sound thing, and a healthy and a good thing, for the country to make the hours in the clubs the same as in licensed premises, except for people <Col N="1888" /><i>bona fide</i> lodging upon the premises. Passing to Section 6, it is largely consequential upon Section 5.  It provides that clubs may be searched by the police, and that a search order may be issued authorising their inspection, and it provides a penalty for persons refusing their names and addresses.  I think, if Section 5 is approved, it will be agreed that it will be futile and inoperative without Section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 7, in Part III of the Bill, deals with offences and penalties.  It provides for forfeiture of a licence on conviction of certain offences::</P>
    <P>(a)  Selling illicitly distilled spirits, or</P>
    <P>(b)  Having possession of illicitly distilled spirits, or</P>
    <P>(c)  Harbouring, keeping, or concealing illicitly distilled spirits.</P>
    <P>I will not treat the House to another tirade upon poteen and its effects upon people, but I do not think it is seriously questioned that it is a grave evil, and up to quite recently it was a growing evil, and it is necessary for a healthy State that it should be stamped out. Sub-section (2) of Section 7 says:</P>
    <P>Whenever a spirit grocer as defined by Section 81 of the Licensing Act, 1872, shall be convicted of an offence under Section 83 or Section 84 (which sections relate to the consumption of liquor on or near the premises of a spirit grocer) of that Act, the licence of such spirit grocer in the case of a first such offence may be forfeited, and in the case of a second such offence shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>That is to deal with a case of a man who goes outside the terms of his licence. Licences to spirit grocers are granted upon certain very definite conditions, and a breach of these conditions should involve the forfeiture of the licence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 doubles the fines.  It reads:</P>
    <P>All and every fine or other money penalty imposed by any of the Licensing (Ireland) Acts, 1833 to 1905, or the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1831, the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1854, the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1855, or the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1857, or authorised by any of those Acts to be imposed, shall on and after the passing of this Act be and the same are hereby increased to double the amounts respectively mentioned in those Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> I do not know whether Deputies will accept the details advanced in that section, but these fines were fixed at a period when money had a very different value from what it has to-day.  Amongst the representatives of the trade to whom I spoke in reference to that section there was no serious demur.  It was recognised that the maxima of fines fixed a great many years ago&mdash;in 1833, 1854, and up to 1905&mdash;were fixed at a time when the purchasing power of money was very different from what it is now.  There is a case for the doubling of the fines just the same as there was when we were dealing with the District Justices Bill for doubling the fees and expenses in connection with the Courts which had been fixed a great many years ago.</P>
    <P>Passing on to Part IV., which is miscellaneous, it deals with a variety of matter&mdash;the powers of granting new licences. It says:</P>
    <P>(1)  The power of granting new licences conferred by Section 4 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, shall only be exercisable where the increase of population referred to in that section amounts to an increase of not less than twenty-five per cent. in the census return last published before the date of the application for the new licence, over the population of that city or town as stated in the next preceding census return.</P>
    <P>(2)  A new licence shall only be granted under the said Section 4 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, in substitution for two or more such existing licences as are mentioned in that section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Section 3 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>I have put in a new section in the original draft&mdash;that is, Section 10&mdash;which covers the case of hardships which I found existed on a very fairly large scale throughout the country.  During the years that the magistrates were not functioning people had not the ordinary facilities for applying for a renewal of certificates, and this Section 10 is to cover them and to provide, because of that, that the licences ought not to be held to have lapsed during the period that the traders were carrying on without a formal certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with restrictions of the sale of methylated spirits.  Dublin <Col N="1890" /> Deputies are aware of the extent of this evil, and are aware that the drinking of methylated spirit is a growing evil.  It is a problem that has proved difficult in other countries, and I do not for a moment believe that the provisions of this Bill are final or adequate treatment on that, or do anything more than go some way to check the evil.  This Section forbids the sale of methylated spirits between the hours of nine o'clock on Saturday evening and nine o'clock of the following Monday morning, and it provides that the name and address of the buyer of methylated spirits must be known to the seller or vouched for by some person known to the seller.  He must state the purposes for which he requires the spirits.  It also provides that a book, just as in the case of poisons, shall be kept, and the names and addresses of purchasers entered into it, together with the purpose, or alleged purpose, for which the spirits were bought, and the quantity sold, and the date.  It also gives power of inspection to Excise officers and police.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is the last section, and it simply closes a certain loophole which existed in the past with regard to poteen-making.  I think there was a decision of the Courts that a bog was not a &ldquo;place&rdquo; within the meaning of the Act, and consequently bogs were largely used.  Section 12 states:</P>
    <P>In the construction and application of Section 19 of the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1831, the expression &ldquo;room or place&rdquo; as used in that section shall include and be deemed always to have included any building whatsoever, and any yard, garden, field, bog, or other piece of ground, and any cave or other underground place whether natural or artificial, and any boat, vessel, or other structure on, in, or under water.</P>
    <P>I hope that if that section passes it will be found in practice to be sufficiently comprehensive.</P>
    <P>That is the Bill.  We have gone through its provisions.  I do not believe there is any provision in it that would not react for the benefit of the country, and that would not help appreciably to restore normal, decent conditions of life within the country.  I hope that the Bill will receive substantial agreement amongst Deputies.  If there is serious objection taken to any portion of it, I am <Col N="1891" /> prepared to reason that out and to attempt to meet such objection.  I have brought in the Bill that I think ought to pass.  The twelve provisions, I think, would be for the benefit of the country and for the benefit of the people of the country.  While I say that, I realise that now, at the close of the Session, I could not persist if any serious opposition were to crystallise around any particular section.  So it is simply in the hands of Deputies.  I think that no provision ought to be objected to without a good and reasonable case being put up against it.</P>

      <P>I am in a position somewhat different from the man in the picture&mdash;&ldquo;twixt love and duty.&rdquo;  I am in the position, twixt hate and duty.  I agree pretty well with everything the Minister said about this Bill&mdash;at least about the necessity for some such Bill&mdash; and probably with all the clauses of the Bill in a general way.  But I think it would be a dereliction of duty to pass the Bill without the people interested and affected having had some opportunity to examine and consider it.  It seems to me that we are being driven to the choice whether this Dáil is to be a House of the Oireachtas&mdash;a Legislative Assembly &mdash;or whether, as I hinted last night, the Constitution under which we are going to work for the future is to be one, not Parliamentary in the sense that it is generally understood, but a Constitution which approximates to that of the Russian Soviet Republic, where there are gradations rising from College to College to the Central Executive; the full responsibility is placed upon the Executive, and the rest have simply to record agreement.  I think that we are being driven to that choice.  I would prefer, if we are going to choose the latter, that we should do it quite openly and with our eyes open.  It is not desirable to recast the conception of the Constitution by these rather unthought-out methods. That is not the openly avowed intention, and probably is not the intention of the Minister for Home Affairs, but that is the effect of this kind of procedure.  Take this Bill in its present form.  The Minister <Col N="1892" /> has not suggested that the House should sit for, say, another fortnight, so that the Bill can be circulated and considered, and the effect of these various Acts which are referred to in the Bill can be examined.  It strikes me that we are asked to do too much in this Bill in the short time at our disposal.  As it is, it raises questions that have caused enormous trouble in other countries, and in this country we are going to solve it&mdash;at least we are going some distance towards solving it in the mind of the Minister&mdash; by this Bill, which is not to receive consideration. While I would personally like to see most of these provisions in operation, I think it is not right for us to pass a Bill of this kind and turn it into an Act of the Oireachtas without proper consideration and examination of the effects upon the citizens of the country. Take Section 1.  It makes no distinction between city, town, and country.  It allows a person who is the owner of a public-house and is licensed, and who is also the owner of a theatre or music hall, to get outside the provisions of the sub-section. I suppose that is not the intention, but it shows the necessity for examining closely not merely this section, but all the sections of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section 2 allows the owner of a theatre or music hall an extra thirty minutes.  Section 1 says that this sub-section shall not apply to any licensed person who is the owner or lessee of a theatre, so that if he is a licensed person and is the owner or lessee of a theatre he may keep open his public house beyond 9.30 in the evening.  As I say, that is not the intention, but it is the effect.  It merely shows the necessity for an examination of this Bill.  I do not want to go into the details or to raise various points of that kind.  As a matter of fact, I only received the Bill at 11.30 last night, and I have not been able to examine it.  But that lapse is obvious, and it shows the necessity for closer examination than the Bill can get if we are to deal with it thoroughly.  My objection really is to the wide sweep of this Bill.  It brings into its operations all sections of the community who are interested in the traffic of intoxicating liquors&mdash;not only the consumers, but the <Col N="1893" /> retailers&mdash;and it seems to me that we would be doing an injustice&mdash;we would not be carrying out our duties and responsibilities fairly&mdash;if we allowed this Bill to pass in a hurry, simply on these grounds that those who are generally affected and likely to be affected have had no opportunity of considering the Bill or its implications.  While that is true in a general way there is something to be said, perhaps, for the intention of Section 1 to limit the hours of sale, because, as a matter of fact, to a very great extent the hours have been voluntarily limited in the way they are to be legally limited by the Bill.  The effect of Section 1, at any rate, would be rather to extend to those who have not come into the voluntary agreement the necessity for falling into the arrangement which has already been arrived at.  It is rather to do for this trade what has been done in other trades, that where the most interested parties have come to a voluntary understanding, then that voluntary understanding shall be ratified by law so as to cover the remainder.  I think, to that extent, an exception might be made in regard to the hours of opening, but I would draw attention to this point that the hour of half-past nine is general and covers the whole country. In many parts of the country half-past nine, legal time, is half-past eight in practice.  In the towns they will be working on legal time&mdash;summer time&mdash; and a mile out they will be working on old time.  I can see that there you would have complication.  The effect of the half-past nine closing will be, of course, that men will not have as long an evening in which to enjoy what they consider to be the one pleasure in life. Perhaps, one unforseen effect which I hope commends itself to the Minister, and will commend itself to the Dáil, is that men who look to these few hours recreation&mdash;recreation in its literal sense &mdash;will say &ldquo;We are quite willing to cut the hours of entertainment&mdash;the clock hours &mdash;but we must have the same number of hours of entertainment, and therefore, must have a shorter working day.&rdquo;  That will, probably, be one effect of the Bill&mdash; an indirect effect&mdash;in the towns, that the hours of work will be cut by, say, one hour.  We will be closing at half-past four instead of half-past five, so that the number of hours recreation in the public <Col N="1894" /> house will not be reduced.  The position that I would take up as regards the Bill would be this, that because of the general agreement between the parties interested in this trade regarding the shortening of the hours of opening and the fact that such agreements are, already, to a very great extent, in effect, that portion of the Bill might be agreed to, but that the remainder which affects new interests which have not come to agreement, and do not understand the implications of which there can be no criticism, ought not to be pressed forward. I do not know what amendments would be required, but it seems to me that Section 1 itself would be quite enough, unless it may be that already the Minister may have power to reduce the hours of opening.  In the many Bills that have been passed I would not be surprised to be told that there was a section or an unrepealed clause of some old Restoration of Order in Ireland Act or something of the kind in which the Minister has power to effect this shorter opening of public houses.  If that were so, it would be better to bring about this prohibition in that way for a short period.  However, assuming that that is not the case, I am prepared to support the section dealing with the hours of opening, but I would urge that the remainder of the Bill ought not to be pressed at this stage, unless the question of the extent of the Session has been reconsidered, and that we might go on for another week or two.  In that case I have no doubt that the Bill can receive proper examination, and I would be quite glad to facilitate its passing in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire briefly to support the view put forward by Deputy Johnson.  There are matters of contention in the Bill, not so acute in regard to details as in regard to general principles, but there are such matters, as the Minister would himself frankly recognise.  The real necessity for this Bill at this moment, is to get sufficient regulation with regard to the hours of opening and closing.  That is the prime necessity.  That is why some Bill of this kind has been urgently called for, and there has been a very clear need for it, because the hours <Col N="1895" /> have been very irregular in different places and the regulations now in force had a very inequitable effect.  That has been admitted, and it is because of that that there has been a desire that there should be a clear regulation as to the hours of opening and closing.  But once we leave that, as a matter of consent, we come to other questions where there is not exactly the same degree of consent and, so far as I am personally concerned, I think that outside that matter, having read the Bill once or twice, not with such care as would be required, it is a good Bill, and I have no objection to many parts of it where objections are, nevertheless, raised.  I am not now dealing with the thing from a personal point of view.  I am not looking at it from the public point of view, where there is consent in the public mind.  There is consent among all the interests concerned that there should be some clear regulation laid down as to the hours of opening and closing, but there is not that measure of consent in other matters.  The Minister himself, in proposing the Second Reading, very reasonably and very fairly indicated his apprehension in this regard, and suggested frankly that he would not press matters where there was likely to be, I will not say contention, but the lack of such agreement as would be required. I think Deputy Johnson has put the matter quite fairly, and I support him very heartily and strongly upon it, that the present Bill should be confined to the question of the hours of opening and closing, having regard to the matter that he raised as to the application of Summer Time and Sun Time and God's Time and every other time that there may be or may not be; that there should be a Bill now to meet that pressing need as to the question of regulation of hours, and that all other matters should be left over until they can be thrashed out in much fuller detail and with much greater care than is possible now at the heel of a Session.  I urge the Minister, therefore, to confine the Bill to this matter, and to leave all other matters over, except that personally I would very much desire to see Section 11 put through, because I do think that evidence has been brought home of the very great evil that exists in Dublin at <Col N="1896" /> present in regard to the consumption of methylated spirits.  That, I state, as my own personal view.  Generally speaking, I would like to suggest that the course put forward by Deputy Johnson be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is in accordance with the fitness of things that a Bill to promote temperance should be proposed and should be criticised with such a spirit of temperance as Deputy Johnson and Deputy Figgis have so admirably displayed.  I am very glad&mdash;it is the first time I have really been glad &mdash;that Deputy Gorey is not present to-day, or he would have registered with his accustomed emphasis the damning admission made by Deputy Johnson that the hours of labour for the working man will automatically adjust themselves to the closing hour as fixed by the Bill.  I know that he does not mean that either by way of incitement to the workmen or as his serious and considering belief of the attitude of the work man towards his work.  It is merely an attempt to intimidate us from carrying through certain portions of this measure. Like Deputy Figgis, I consider this is a good Bill, but I do not propose, as he does, to eviscerate a good Bill and take from its organism some of its most useful provisions.  I can well understand why Deputy Figgis, who considers this a good Bill, should want Part II omitted.  You, Sir, and possibly many of your colleagues, had the pleasure yesterday evening of seeing a delightful sketch in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Deputy Figgis on his way to the golf links. Now, one of the operations of Part II with regard to clubs would bring this unhappy state of things to pass, that when Deputy Figgis, golfer, not legislator or statesman, should arrive, on a sultry summer evening, at the 19th hole he would find himself like the poor dog in Old Mother Hubbard: &ldquo;When she went there the cupboard&mdash;in this case the bar&mdash;was bare, and so the poor dog got none.&rdquo;  If Deputy Johnson had lived in the middle ages he would have disputed with Duns Scotus, the right to the title of Doctor Subtilis.  The subtlety that he displays on all occasions excites my envy and admiration.  With regard to Section 1 he has exercised it very effectively to-day.  He had discovered <Col N="1897" /> that the Sub-section does not apply to any licensed person who is the owner of a theatre; that the theatre-owner or lessee may keep a publichouse in any other locality open to a later hour, and he considers that because that might be read by a rival subtle interpreter out of the measure, that we should postpone it in order to get time to consider it further, whereas half the Section would inform him, if he read it aright, that it does not apply to any licensed premises which are in or part of a theatre, music hall or other place of public amusement. I should have thought that he would have advocated, inasmuch as the bar of the Dáil is admittedly a place of public amusement and as he proposes to have all-night sittings in the future, that the wording in this should be made more precise in the interests thereof.</P>

      <P>I am surprised Deputy Figgis did not utilise his opportunities on behalf of hotel owners. It has always been a grievance to the playgoer in Dublin that when the performance is over there is no place open to him.  Unless he is a clubman he has to go home hungry or thirsty, or both. Many will recollect that a short measure was introduced by one of the Irish Parliamentary Party into the British House of Commons, and it was passed, providing for that.  If you read Section 1, Sub-section (1), and Section 4, I would suggest that it is possible to put into one or other of them a provision allowing intoxicating drinks, such as wines, for example, to be sold if taken in conjunction with some repast, however light, during an hour, say, or half-an-hour or forty-five minutes after the normal closing hour.  Personally, like Deputy Johnson, I am speaking as between love and duty, being, if I may be egotistical enough to contribute a chapter to my own autobiography, a practical teetotaller.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, practical, not theoretical.  I do think that it is quite fair in a city like Dublin or Cork where there are a large number of pleasure-loving people whose enjoyment really begins in the evening, having been <Col N="1898" /> hard at work during the day, that the possibility that they might require refreshment should be provided for in this way.  I think it would be easy to amend the Bill in that respect.  There is one very excellent provision in Part 1 which I applaud most heartily, and that is Section 2, which the Minister read, enabling a District Justice in his discretion where he thinks it necessary for the welfare of a district or village to close licensed premises.  That is a very desirable innovation.  There is another thing also which I think is admirable, and I am quite sure that the respectable members of the licensed trade, and that means the vast majority of the members of the licensed trade, will also applaud it, and that is in Part 3, the increase of penalties for offending spirit grocers. The spirit grocer, as we are all aware, if he is not strictly scrupulous and conscientious, is really a danger to the community. It is notorious in the northern towns, with which I am familiar, that under the heading of &ldquo;groceries&rdquo; debts are run up by women without the knowledge of their husbands, who are, of course, answerable for the debt.  What is really provided is drink.  The spirit grocer has opportunities, and he is subject to a form of temptation from which the others are exempt, and even the most worthy will succumb, or may succumb, when the temptation is very great.</P>

    <P>In one of the preparations of a cinema film the controller attempted to induce a negro to lie down with a lion, and when he protested vigorously he was told that the lion was quite harmless, that he had been brought up on milk.  I need not point the moral of the negro's reply, &ldquo;I was brought up on milk, too, but I eat meat now.&rdquo;  The opportunity oftentimes makes the culprit.  I think it is a very desirable thing to hold out a threat that on a first offence the licence could be endorsed, but on a second occasion it is imperative not to endorse it, but to make it forfeit.  That is the effect of Sub-section (2) of Section 7.  A public house licence, or a licence to sell intoxicants, is really a monopoly granted by the State.  It is a privilege which society gives, and that privilege ought to be exercised carefully, and it ought to be very carefully watched on behalf of he citizen.  I remember as a child at a Belfast pantomime, when the subject of <Col N="1899" /> Sunday closing and early closing was one of the burning questions of the hour, the popular song had the refrain, &ldquo;Why they close the pubs, and keep open the clubs I haven't the slightest idea.&rdquo;  I never dreamed that long years afterwards I should be called upon to listen to the elements of an idea in answer to the question.  It is a matter of common knowledge that the better class clubs that are very well conducted and carefully controlled by the managers could not really keep the bar on paying terms if they were not allowed time a little longer than the ordinary public house hours.  So it seems to me that Section 5 might allow that hour to be 10 o'clock in the evening instead of 9.30 with regard to those clubs that are satisfactory in their arrangements.  Of course it is possible that that would not be long enough, but it is also possible that the whole question of Part II. might be reconsidered to some extent, because it is very necessary to distinguish in practice between what the Minister spoke of as an all-night drinking shop and what is really a regularly and properly worked place of recreation. As regard Section 11, which has won the approval of Deputy Figgis, as he does not want methylated spirits, I think it would be well to include ether also.  In some of the Northern counties where they are of a very inquiring and scientific disposition it was discovered that a man could be drunk three times in the afternoon for an expenditure of 2/-, that is eight pence per &ldquo;drunk.&rdquo;  Ether, I need not say, is a very deadly drink, and it is much more desirable that intoxication by way of inhalation of ether should be stopped than intoxication by methylated spirits.  There is a certain amount of alteration in the licensing laws which are really to be described as drastic, as regards the limitations and restraints on licences of the legitimate traders.  It is all the more incumbent to leave no opening possible for the illegitimate trading in intoxicants, and if people have recourse to chemists and druggists to procure methylated spirits they should not be permitted to procure ether instead. That is really the one amendment I should be particularly anxious to have introduced here.  Remember the number of people in villages and country towns in Ulster who are absolutely drunk <Col N="1900" /> on the afternoon of fair days is almost beyond calculation at times.</P>
    <P>That sounds an exaggeration, but it is really true.  The demoralisation which sets in as a natural sequence to drunkenness through ether is unfortunately greater than the drunkenness that is merely traceable to whiskey.  That is not an advertisement for whiskey, but is intended to be an attack upon the use of ether.  As regards the Bill in its entirety, I should like to make it plain that it is only legislation by way of partial amendment.  It is not an attempt, as the Minister has said in his speech, to make the amendment which the situation really demands, and which I have no doubt we would attempt to make if the time at our disposal were more than it is but instalments are always welcome, and viewing this as an instalment of a greater measure and an instalment that makes for the public welfare and for the reduction of the opportunity for the creation of riot, disorder, and the demoralisation of the people which a too great indulgence in politics has brought about, I thoroughly welcome and approve of it.</P>

      <P>I desire very briefly to support the point of view put forward by Deputy Johnson, and I think the Minister is to be congratulated on showing an intention and desire to deal with licensing abuses; but having shown that, and having got a Second Reading, I think he ought to drop so much of the Bill as is not urgent, because an even more important principle is the principle that we should not rush legislation.  I do not think that any case can be made for rushing, without due consideration, a great many of the Sections of this Bill. I think there is urgency for Part 1 of the Bill, and perhaps for Section 10, but I am going to ask the Minister if he can see his way to drop the rest of the Bill after he has got through his Second Reading.  I think he will have done a good deal by getting the whole Bill as far as Second Reading Stage, because that is an indication, and as an indication it will be very useful.  I am, if it be possible, even more innocent than Deputy Magennis on this question, and I am certainly quite impartial, but in the very short space of time in which this Bill has been before us and before the public, I have already had representations <Col N="1901" /> from a number of very reputable persons, all well known persons in the City and County of Dublin, pointing out certain obvious objections to the Bill, which make me feel very strongly that it is wrong that any undue haste should be shown.  If an immediate decision is to be asked for, the Minister ought to give some very explicit reasons why that immediate decision is necessary.</P>
      <P>I admit fully that there is an immediate necessity for dealing with the opening and closing hours as Part I does, because the confusion created by the pre-war system of ours, and what I may call the war hours introduced by emergency regulations, has caused very considerable annoyance and unfairness. That part of the Bill has been very cordially welcomed, and I do not suppose there will be any objection to it.  Section 2 is also a courageous and useful proposal, which gives power for the closing of licensed premises in places where disorder should make that necessary.  I would ask the Minister's consideration for one point on that Section.  The Bill, as drafted, proposes that &ldquo;a District Justice may be satisfied on the application of a Civic Guard Superintendent or Inspector.&rdquo;  I think that application should be a sworn statement or an affidavit. I do not think the District Justice should be empowered to close the licensing places in a town or village except upon evidence taken on oath. The effect of his order may very seriously prejudice a great many people, and it is desirable that the person causing the orders to be made should pin himself on oath to the statements upon which the magistrate is asked to act, particularly as cases of this kind are liable to be brought up afterwards in the High Court, and it would be very undesirable to have to deal with cases where Justices had ordered a closure, having before them only a statement unsupported on oath of a gentleman who might be acting in a panic and acting without due consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will agree that it is necessary to strengthen that particular Section by making the oath a condition precedent.  It seems to me that we had one or two examples of the danger of rushing this measure.  First of all, Deputy Johnson discovered that you could keep your licensed house open <Col N="1902" /> all day and all night provided that you had a theatre or a music hall.</P>

      <P>With regard to that, I desire to say that I think that strictly and technically Deputy Johnson is probably right, but the words of the Section are taken bodily from a British statute which has been in force for a long time, and no case has ever cropped up of a person attempting to keep his public house open all night simply because he owned a theatre up the road.</P>

      <P>It touches this principle, that it shows a trap in this Section, and as far as I know there may be many other traps in other Sections, all of which goes to show the danger of hasty legislation.  I do not think any responsible person connected with the licensing trade, and certainly no responsible person connected with the registration of clubs, would take the view that the hours for ordinary licensed premises should be the same as the hours for clubs.  I think the position has only to be mentioned for everyone to see at once that clubs should have at least one hour longer for remaining open than ordinary licensed houses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy pretends a strange innocence.  Surely it is obvious that places that are under control in the way clubs are, and which licensed premises are not&mdash;places used by many people in large part as a means of recreation, and which are not intended for drinking purposes, but where drink is merely accidental&mdash;are in a different category to places where drink is the main <i>raison d'etre.</i>  I take it that in bringing in this Bill the Minister, as he has told us, consulted the interests concerned, but I question whether persons interested in Section 2 were consulted.  I think their rights should be consulted because a serious injustice might be done to them under the Section&mdash;if a place which is not a drinking place, ordinarily so-called, is treated as if it were a public house just because drink is sold there. <Col N="1903" /> There is a distinction there, and some distinction ought to be made, and I fancy the Minister will recognise some distinction ought to be made.  I cordially agree with him when he spoke of putting a stop to the reprehensible practice of all-night drinking.  I agree with him in endeavouring to stop a practice of that kind, but I believe that there ought to be a difference made between two very distinct categories, because I think we should not be committed to putting two distinct categories of case into one category without proper consideration.</P>
      <P>I think everyone will agree that proper consideration is impossible if this Bill is rushed through before the Elections.  I support the suggestion that Part 1 be proceeded with in order that fixed definite, and reasonable hours be made uniformly applicable to licensed premises and that Section 10, dealing with the invalidation of licences owing to non-renewal during the troubled times, be also proceeded with, as I think it is an excellent idea to remedy that injustice, but I think that the rest of the Bill can stop at the Second Reading, because the Minister will have asserted a useful principle by getting it that far.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Part 1 of the Bill which fixes the opening hours from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  I understand that an agreement on that portion of the Bill has been arrived at between the employers and the employees.  There is a real desire on the part of the members of the licensed trade to help the Government in their efforts to keep the trade the cleanest possible in the country.  I hope if there is to be any difference of opinion amongst members of the Dáil that they will all agree with Part 1, and let it go through.  As regards Part 2, dealing with clubs, there are some very good clubs in the city of Dublin, which supply meals to their members, and the management of them is very careful, in fact it could not be better.  I know that the Committees of some of these clubs have spent considerable sums of money on improving their premises, and I hope that, if we cannot agree to delete this clause relating to clubs, that, at all events, the members of the Committees which control them will be afforded an opportunity of interviewing the Minister. I hope if the hours are to be fixed for <Col N="1904" /> clubs that they will be given at least one hour more after the ordinary closing time for houses in the licensed trade in the country.  If one hour is granted it will do away with the cause of complaint which the Minister makes of some clubs in the country being drinking shops until two and three o'clock in the morning. I hope that the Minister and the authorities will do all in their power to crush out drinking dens of that type, but as regards the good class clubs, many of which we have in the city of Dublin, I hope he will, at least, consider the advisability of granting them one hour after the ordinary closing for licensed houses in the city.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Gavan Duffy I wholeheartedly support Section 10 and I think it ought to be carried.  With regard to a Sub-section in Part 3, dealing with spirit grocers, complaint has been made to me by spirit grocers that whilst they are anxious to do everything that is right they think that at least they ought to have an opportunity of consulting with the Minister on that clause, and if that can be arranged I believe a satisfactory agreement can be arrived at between the spirit grocers and the Minister.  I congratulate the Minister on the attempt he has made to deal with this question in a satisfactory way.  Part 1 of the Bill is such that all Deputies in the House will agree with, and I hope that it will be got through all its stages before the Dáil dissolves.  The other portions of the Bill, with the exception of Section 10 which I think might be passed, could be dealt with in the new Dáil, especially the sections dealing with spirit grocers and with the regulations for clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that the Section dealing with club regulations ought to be dealt with immediately I would ask him to consider the advisability of granting clubs at least one hour more for remaining open than the hour fixed for closing in ordinary licensed premises. I believe a proposal of that kind would meet with general acceptance in the House, and I may say that the clubs are most anxious to help the Government to see that there shall be no abuses on their premises and that there shall be nothing in the nature of a two o'clock in the morning trade.  There is a general desire amongst the licensed trade that the opening hours for ordinary licensed <Col N="1905" /> premises should be from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Like most Deputies I am thoroughly in favour of Section 1. I desire to point out in this Section there is no mention made of Sunday closing. In connection with that I would like to point out that there are about 17 houses in what are known as the &ldquo;added areas&rdquo; which since the year 1900, although they pay rates and hold a seven-day licence, are prohibited from opening on Sundays. This Section I takes a certain number of hours off their ordinary week-day trading hours, and perpetuates the exclusions as regards Sunday opening under which they have been penalised at considerable loss since the year 1900. Though they hold a seven-day licence and pay the same duty as people who are allowed to open on Sundays they have been denied the right to open on Sundays from 1900 to 1906.  In the latter year what was known as the Clancy Act was passed in the British House of Commons.  It was thought at the time that publicans in the &ldquo;added areas&rdquo; could open on Sundays under that Act, but a case was brought into Court and it was decided that owing to a flaw in the drafting of the Act that the publicans had not the power to open on Sundays.  As the decision in the case was against them they have been since obliged to keep closed on Sundays.  I would ask the Minister to make some provisions in this Bill whereby these people would be allowed to open on Sundays, as it is a great hardship and wrong that while they are obliged to pay duty on a seven-day licence, they are still prohibited from opening on Sunday.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies Johnson and Byrne in the views they have expressed on Section 1.  As the Bill only came into the Deputies hands to-day, and as there are some contentious Clauses in it, I think with the exception of Part 1, which might be agreed to, that the remaining Clauses should be left over to the new Dáil.  I do not see the necessity for rushing these contentious Clauses at the present time.  The administration of the licensing laws ought to have improved considerably of late, in view of the fact that we have the Civic Guard in practically every town and village in the country. <Col N="1906" /> I quite agree that there should be fixed hours for opening and closing.  There will not be any contention about that part of the Bill, at least it seems to be the opinion of Deputies that there will not.</P>
      <P>As regards the other portions of the Bill that are contentious&mdash;and some of them are very contentious&mdash;I say that no expression of opinion has been got from the people concerned in the matter &mdash;at least from country representatives &mdash;and there is no necessity to rush the remaining portions of the Bill through. We can deal with Part 1 of the Bill today if the Minister agrees.</P>

      <P>This Bill, I understand, is to regulate closing hours in Dublin City and County.  That has been made pretty clear by the Deputies who have spoken.  If it is necessary to regulate closing hours in Dublin and to pass legislation, if the licensed traders cannot agree to closing hours, surely that legislation ought not to be applied to all the other traders down through the country who do agree on a reasonable closing hour.  The licensed traders in the country are restricted by four hours in this Bill and that is a very serious restriction.  I think it would go a long way towards closing down many of the traders down through the country. That is my conviction about it.  I have not had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the licensed trade in the South of Ireland or of getting the opinion of their Organisation on the matter. I do not know really what they require, because we only got this Bill this morning.  But I support the other Deputies in the opinion that we ought to have an opportunity of consulting with them before we pass such a drastic measure as this.  If we do restrict the traders' business by four hours a day, I think we ought to reduce their licence duty by 25 per cent.  What is good for Dublin may be very bad for Cork, Waterford, Limerick and other places Until we know exactly what those people require I do not think that we should pass this Bill.  They are a large section of the community; they have vested interests in the country and they deserve the same consideration from the Dáil, as to the farmers, or any other section of the community.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I think that the Minister deserves to be congratulated on this Bill, because I think it is a good, solid, Bill, and in the main it is for the benefit of the nation. Part I, which fixes the hours, is fair enough.  Perhaps the question of the spirit grocery and club is contentious. I am against all-night drinking.  At the same time I am not a Pussyfoot.  I may have some original ideas as regards the licensed trade in Ireland.  The inference to be drawn from Deputy Johnson's statement is that there was no other pleasure for our people except non-Pussyfootism. On the Continent they have cafes where people can go and get anything they like in the way of non-spiritous refreshments at practically any hour.  That is a phase of the National life that might be considered later on.  Perhaps it would be a complete revolution in the licensed trade.  There was a point raised about methylated spirits, or &ldquo;blowhard&rdquo; as it is known in my part of the country.  I have some experience of it; I do not mean personal experience, but some years ago in Waterford there was a regular epidemic of drinking of methylated spirits.  We did not then have the stable conditions that we now have in the country.  We had to take the law into our own hands and we did adjust it to a certain extent.  As regards the point about ether raised by Deputy Professor Magennis, they may indulge in that in Belfast, but I do not think that in Dublin or in the South they have attained to that refinement of vice.  At the same time I think these are matters that ought to be embodied in the Bill.  I think on the whole the Bill is a good one, and that it aims at the advancement of the nation.  On that ground I support it.</P>

Nevertheless I would like to join with those who urge the Minister not to press parts of this Bill which are not urgent. I quite agree with him in that part of his opening remarks in which he said there was a great need for limitation in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquors, limitations in the number of licensed houses and in the conditions under which they sell.  I would wholeheartedly <Col N="1908" /> support him in pressing as urgent certain parts of the Bill, but I think it would be regrettable if other parts did not get a fuller and more careful consideration than we can give in the limited time at our disposal.  I refer in particular to the clause in reference to Clubs.  Though I accept and agree with parts of the Minister's speech, I do not agree with him in that part in which I understood him to say that he considered that clubs were on the same level as licensed houses.  They seem to me to be on quite a different footing.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that I think they are on a different footing, and that that would at any rate partly establish a case for their hours of closing being made different from the hours of closing of licensed houses.  I think they do come in as a kind of halfway house, if one may say so, between the private home and the licensed house. I think it might do more harm than good if we were to rush through without giving the Bill full consideration and without regarding from a proper point of view the case for clubs receiving special treatment.  I notice, for instance, that in this Bill the canteen is allowed more time than will be allowed to licensed houses.  It would be rather a curious situation if a Civic Guard could go into a canteen after 9.30 and refresh himself in the way which has been referred to and a member of a club could not do the same.  I think Deputy Professor Magennis was quite right in his reference to the Clubs, particularly the Golf Clubs. Probably if we had sufficient time to consider the matter we could name some later hour for the Club than is named for the licensed house.  The question of all-night sittings might, perhaps, arise, but I do not know that I am prepared to make any suggestion in that connection. I really think that it would be advisable if the Minister would give the Dáil sufficient time to consider any of these provisions that are not of immediate urgency.</P>

While I agree with the main provisions of the measure, <Col N="1909" /> there are some provisions which I believe could be amended and ought to be amended when the Committee Stage is reached.  What is right for the City of Dublin does not in many cases suit the country districts.  I would have no objection at all to any portion of this Bill if it were made applicable only to the Metropolitan area of Dublin.  I am sure nobody else would have any objection to that either.  But the closing and opening hours in the City of Dublin and the closing and opening hours in the country do not suit equally well.  In the country you have fairs and markets and people living considerable distances out of the towns and they require different treatment from the city community.  So far as the traders in Dublin are concerned I do not know exactly their views, but I am sure they have come to an agreement with their employees and perhaps, with the Ministry, as to the hours which should be adopted.  As far as the concluding Section of the Bill is concerned I believe it does require a good deal of consideration.  At the same time I do not think we should hang up the Bill.  It may be possible to give a little more time to the clubs than to the ordinary licensed house.  I do agree that Sections 10 and 11 should be put into operation immediately.  The sale of methylated spirits is on the increase all over the country, and I think there is no man who would not be glad to see the greatest restrictions placed upon it.  I am glad to see Clause 10, which deals with licences, which might be taken in some instances as having lapsed, included in the Bill.  I am prepared to support the general principles of the Bill and I hope to get the amendments which I have indicated carried on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Deputy that that is probably so, and that elsewhere, outside the English speaking countries, these things are done much better.  But that cannot be brought about by legislation.  There is general agreement in the Dáil that the Bill should not be rushed, and that most of the provisions, outside Part 1, should get a longer time for consideration.  But I doubt if there is even urgent or desperate necessity for proceeding with Part 1.  If there is, as we understand there is, agreement between the main bodies concerned with regard to the question of hours, what is there to prevent that voluntary agreement from being carried out for a month or six weeks or two months?  Is it necessary for agreements, voluntarily arrived at by the various parties, to get the seal of law before they be carried out?  If that is the position, it shows very bad intentions on the part of some one or other of the bodies to the voluntary agreement. Apart from that, there is objection, I think, to the other part of the Bill being taken now&mdash;even to going into Committee&mdash;because there is a difference of opinion on the question of Clubs and other questions like that.  I do not agree with Deputy Hughes that it is very necessary and very urgent that the sale of methylated spirits should be dealt with immediately.  I think there are already provisions in existence which can deal with the sale of those spirits. Certainly, on every part of the Bill, except the first part, there is general agreement that it should not be taken before the dissolution.  It would be well, I think, if the Minister could meet all those views and leave over the contentious part of the Bill.  I do not think it is even necessary to rush the first part of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to join the number of Deputies who would like to see some change in the second part of the Bill.  I am not very much of a club man myself, but I would like to see a distinction made between the club and the <Col N="1911" /> licensed house.  I think there is a case for distinction.  It has been pointed out already that there is a vast difference between an institution whose primary object is the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and an institution where the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor is only incidental.  In a decently-conducted club the sale of intoxicating liquor is a very small item.  A club, to a certain number of our fellow-citizens, is a kind of home.  Sometimes it may be a refuge.  There are not many comforts or amenities left, and if you make harsh conditions about the hours of consumption of drink in clubs, you will remove one of the last of these comforts. I cannot conceive the Minister bringing in a Bill in which he will give permission to the Civic Guard to enter a private house on inspection after 9.30, and, as I said already, a club is in the nature of a private house to many men.  It may be their misfortune, but it is so, and I think you should regard it in that light and do something to extend the hours during which drink can be consumed in decently-conducted clubs.  I am not making an appeal for rich clubs in contradistinction to poor clubs.  The club is the prerogative of every citizen, rich and poor, and, properly conducted, it should be permitted every comfort that is possible.</P>

I do not see that we have a right to make reservations in law in favour of any section of the community, and to drive into clubdom every person who might feel that it would be to his advantage to be able to get a drink at times when he could not get it in the ordinary way.  I agree with another point, that I think it is not possible to have a uniform system with regard to legislation in this business as between <Col N="1912" /> the larger cities and the villages and towns in rural areas.  I think that legislation in the past has taken notice of the different circumstances that prevail in relation to rural villages and towns and the larger cities, and the same rules did not apply in past legislation regarding the hours of closing and opening, and other matters as well.  It may be that it would be a terrible hardship in some cases where markets are held, some of them as early as six o'clock in the morning, and to which people come from long distances, to say that houses should not open till 9 a.m., because some of these markets are over before 7 o'clock, particularly in towns in the West, and to a certain extent fairs and markets have to take place early.  It would be a very great hardship in that case to say that public houses should not open before 9 o'clock.  I am in favour of the general principles of this Bill if it can be accommodated to the requirements, but I am not so much concerned with the vested interests of the trade as I am with the service to the community.  I think that that is the main object, how the trade is to be managed that the community may get the service they are supposed to get, and that, at the same time, abuses may be kept down.  Whatever this Bill may be, it is only a superficial affair and it must only be temporary in its operations, because if we, as a nation, have any interest which it is really important should be put under proper conditions, it is this important interest of the licensed trade.  Before any attempt is made to put it upon a basis on which it could safely rest in the interests of the nation, in the interests of the people, and in the interests of the revenue that it so largely produces, a very intricate and very extensive inquiry must be made into all the aspects of this business and legislation that would deal with it in this way must be based upon information so received. This should be an inquiry made in the interests of the various elements, whether those engaged in the trade or those who use the publichouses now and again, and the question of the revenue collected.  I think it is a poor system of collecting revenue and that we should discover a better one.  but at present there is no other way of getting revenue to the same extent.  It is unfortunate that the present system exists, and perhaps <Col N="1913" /> will exist.  Then there are so many intricacies with regard to the clause that deals with new licences&mdash;25 per cent. of increase in population in ten years will justify the granting of an application for a new licence.  This must be surrounded by a great many safeguards if it is to be ratified and passed into law. In regard to the valuation of premises and structural arrangements, these matters need to be well safeguarded, and there is in addition, a stipulation that two other licences must be wiped out. There are certainly two anomalies, as the Minister himself has stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that these are the main things which I wish to refer to at the moment, as the representative of an area which has nothing in common with cities like Dublin and Cork.  Nearly every town has a separate system of its own, and would claim a separate service, but at the same time I think some uniformity can be arranged.  I accept the general principle as a temporary measure to meet and deal with evils that are rampant.  I am thoroughly satisfied with the clause that deals with illicit distillation.  It is a very important clause, and a very urgent one, but I am not so much concerned with the clause dealing with methylated spirits, an evil which in the area I come from we are not so conversant with.  In the rural districts we know very little about it.  These things are city abuses and will require city remedies.  But the question of illicit distillation is a different one altogether, and is one which threatens very serious damage to the community as well as seriously interfering with the revenue of the country.  There are drastic powers in the Public Safety Act to deal with that and the penalties are very severe. The penalties in the Bill with regard to the spirit grocer are very drastic, that on the first offence he may lose his licence, and on the second he must lose it.  I do not know that these powers can be made so drastic.  They seem to pertain too much to the desire to legislate off our own bat, without consulting the general interests of the community, and I think before we carry penalties as drastic as this we should take into account their effects upon the people who are represented in this case.  I will support the Second Reading of the Bill as a temporary expedient, but only as a <Col N="1914" /> temporary expedient, to meet the necessity as it exists at present.</P>

      <P>There has been so much agreement on the general principle of the Bill that I am a little curious to know what it is.  It is very necessary that I should discover what it is, because Deputy McGoldrick has qualified his approval&mdash;&ldquo;I am in favour,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of the general priciples of this Bill if they be accommodated to the requirements.&rdquo; Well, if I am to accommodate the general principles of this Bill to the requirements I must know what they are.  Frankly, I do not know what they are.  The Bill consists of a number of provisions which I considered necessary to deal with anomalies and abuses which exist in connection with the sale of intoxicating liquor, but there are a number of provisions. They scarcely hang together, and I do not know what the general principle of the Bill can be said to be unless it be that it is necessary to see that the sale of liquor is carried on decently and without abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the general principle, it is one that does not leave much room for disagreement, but in fact the tendency has been to discuss this Bill as if it were something vague and ethereal, and not to come down to bedrock.  I know where the shoe is pinching; I know there is scarcely a Deputy in the Dáil who has any doubt about any Section except Part 2, which deals with clubs.  If that is the difficulty and doubt, we should come out and say so.  I had a high opinion of the intellect and integrity of this Assembly, but I do believe that we are not able to make up our minds as to the hours at which clubs should cease to sell drink to non-resident members. We have been urged to leave out all of this Bill except Section 1.  &ldquo;The other provisions are all fine, each in their way, but it would be much better that the next Parliament should consider them, and, therefore, throw overboard all the ballast and get Section 1 at all cost.&rdquo; I agree there is an anomaly which Section 1 is intended to redress, but I do not agree that Section 1 is of any greater importance than other Sections of the Bill and certainly from the angle of my Department, which is the angle of order and peace and decency of life in the country, Section 1, although it is important, <Col N="1915" /> is not even as important as certain other Sections of the Bill.  I think on this matter of clubs we can find accommodation which would get over the qualms of Deputies, and their obvious nervousness to deal with the matter.  I put down that provision, that they should cease to sell drink to non-resident members after the time that licensed premises close, largely with a view of hearing the case against it.  It was scarcely put up, it was hinted at, but I think I can put up a better case against it than has been put by any Deputy; that whereas the licensed premises are open all day primarily for the sale of liquor, the club is a different matter where men who have been engaged all day at their particular business congregate in the evening.  There is a case for that, but it is a question of degree.  I do submit than any decent club, any club that does not exist simply and solely for the purpose of consuming alcoholic liquor, would be well satisfied with an hour's latitude after the licensed premises close.  If the Deputy put up an amendment to that effect in the Committee Stage, I would be prepared to accept it.  Now, there are clubs and clubs; there are clubs where it would be correct to say, as Professor Magennis said, that the sale of drink was an accident, and that it was not in any sense the object of the club, that the club was social, or cultural, with some link or association for the purpose of meeting together in a friendly way in the evening, and so on, and that they run a decent and respectable place.  There are clubs that do not quite answer to that description, and it is not a hardship to any club to ask that it be closed definitely for the sale of drink at a reasonable hour in the evening, say, 10 o'clock or 10.30.  But we should be able to agree as to what is thought a reasonable hour.  There is no occasion for any of the timidity displayed with regard to it.  Deputies circled round the Bill, and said that they agreed with the main principles, but one would have preferred to hear what they disagreed with.  One would have preferred to hear whether they disagreed with the regulations in regard to the sale of methylated spirits, or with Section 7, which deals with certain offences for which licences are to be forfeited, if the holder of a licence <Col N="1916" /> sells illicitly distilled spirits, or has possession of illicitly distilled spirits, or harbours, keeps, or conceals illicitly distilled spirits.  Sub-section (2) of Section 7, which deals with the spirit grocer, and the conditions under which he would lose his licence is as just and as reasonable a Sub-section as there is in the Bill.  This man gets his licence on definite conditions.  The State gives him a licence that he will sell drink for consumption off the premises, and if he goes outside the terms of that licence, and in fact turns his place into a kind of illicit publichouse, and proceeds to sell drink otherwise than within the terms of his licence, there is a complete case for the withdrawal of that licence. Then, going round the Bill, there has been no objection to Section 10.  Section 9 Deputy McGoldrick misunderstood. Licences could be granted on condition that it could be shown that one's existing licence had lapsed or disappeared. This, so far from facilitating the granting of licences, is an additional restriction, that in addition to the new licence two lapsed licences must be shown, and the population increase as between one census and another is reasonably fixed at 25 per cent., but it seems to me that if we were quite frank, if we did not simply get away from the sore spot, if we faced up to this question of clubs and discussed it in a reasonable way, it would not be impossible to find substantial agreement as to the hours at which they should close.  I am aware that there is a sensitiveness because of the time.  Deputies throughout the Session are content to represent their constituencies broadly, and to carry out in a broad and general way the wishes of their constituents. That is adequate, but coming near the <i>dies irae</i> they are more inclined to consider the individual constituent than they are normally throughout the greater part of the Session.  It is felt, in dealing with this question of clubs, that one may come up against the views and wishes of individual constituents who are club members.  But I think no decent member of a club, and no decent club will, put up a case that these clubs ought to be all-night drinking shops for non-resident members.  They will surely agree that there ought to be a limit.  I would suggest that a reasonable limit would be 10.30, an hour after the time <Col N="1917" /> at which ordinary licensed premises close.  If we could get agreement on that, I see no reason why the Bill should not be considered as it stands.</P>

      <P>I want to put up this.  There has been talk about hasty legislation.  I have not brought any Bill before the Dáil which got more Departmental scrutiny than this Bill, and concerning which more opinions were asked. There is not a State Solicitor or District Justice, or Civic Guard Superintendent in the country, but was asked to comment in detail on the Bill, and when a new recommendation or something out of the ordinary came up from any quarter that was sent round for their opinion, and a good deal of time was given departmentally to this Bill, so when one speaks of hasty legislation it is not in the sense that there was any rush in the preparation of the Bill departmentally, because the Bill has been practically under the consideration of my Department for the last five or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has had more careful scrutiny given to it and there have been more opinions asked in connection with its provisions than has been the case in relation to any other Bill that I have been responsible for.  I would like this Bill to go into Committee as it stands, so that as we take it Section by Section Deputies could say what are the definite things they disagree with in it.  There is nothing very technical or very profound about it.  There is, I am sure, general agreement, for instance, on Section 1, that it is proper to try and check the sale of methylated spirits, and to try and ensure that this spirit will not be sold for consumption as drink.  Sections 9 and 10 are, I think, non-contentious, and Section 7 could at least be discussed.  If any Deputy holds the view that a licensed person ought not to lose his licence for selling poteen or for keeping it or harbouring it on his premises then that view could be discussed. Then, as regards the Section dealing with doubling the fines, that was considered reasonable by representatives of the trade itself.  The real part that needs discussion is Part II and I think we could discuss that in a reasonable way and let Deputies state their views about it.  I would like very much <Col N="1918" /> that the Bill with all its 12 Clauses would go into Committee.  I am prepared, if pressed, to throw out ballast and to leave out contentious Sections, but I think there is no Section in the Bill on which agreement could not be arrived at, and I think that all the Sections will be useful if carried.  I think as regards the suggestion about clubs that if an hour extra were conceded there might be general agreement in putting that Section through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be out of order, but I want to put this to the Minister: He has asked that the Bill should be considered, and that we should go into Committee on the whole Bill.  I for one am quite prepared to allow the Bill to go into Committee if he on his part will allow us to have time to consider it.  Let me point out a practical difficulty that one is in.  We saw this Bill for the first time at 11 o'clock last night, and some Deputies did not receive copies of it until this morning. I find in reading through this Bill references to the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1831, and to the Revenue Act of 1889, and to several other Acts.  It is very true, no doubt, that the Bill has had ample consideration from the Minister's Department, and that those connected with the Department know all about these Acts that I have referred to, but we do not know about them, and yet we are asked to take the Minister's word that it is a perfect Bill, and that it satisfies all requirements. We are asked, in fact, to take the responsibility off his shoulders, and that, I submit is not proper.  If the Minister will say that there is a possibility of having the Bill considered, and of giving us time for the drawing up of amendments, and of seeing how far agreement can be reached on details then, I for one, am quite prepared to support the main clauses of the Bill, but I am confident that some of them will require to be amended.  These amendments will have to be considered, and I suggest it is asking too much for a Bill of this kind, requiring consideration, not only by the Dáil, but by the Dáil after consultation with the people interested, to be rushed through in this hurried manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The submission I make is not unreasonable. Deputy McGoldrick, rather late in the day, I think, comes forward and <Col N="1919" /> says that Bills of this kind, and important Bills of any kind, ought to be given very careful consideration.  I think I can say that the Dáil generally has shown an interest in this Bill which it has not in much more important Bills, Bills requiring much more important consideration than this one.  Deputies are quite eager to discuss this Bill, which is of small moment, comparatively, but they have allowed three months' legislation to go through within the last three or four days without a word.  I suggest that we are now asked to do too much.  It is not a mere matter of difference of opinion about a clause or a section.  What I object to is the principle of rushing a Bill of this kind through the legislature without ample consideration.  There is no plea put forward that it is of vital urgency.  That plea is not put forward, that the safety of the State is in danger if this Bill is not passed.  There is no grave complaint about the regulations as to hours, or that there has been a tremendous increase within the last week in the sale of methylated spirits, or that the clubs have degenerated within the last fortnight to the stage at which they must be closed up at 10.30 p.m.  These arguments are not put forward, and we are not told that this is a matter of extreme urgency.  I think that even the hours question has not been proved to be a matter of urgency, but inasmuch as there is general agreement on that question not only here, but outside amongst the people interested, that matter, I think, without any prejudice to any principle in the Bill, could possibly be accepted and passed, but the general provisions of the Bill are being put to us to be passed at top speed without their having any possibility of consideration, either by the Dáil or the country.</P>

If the Minister feels that Part II ought to be added to the Bill I am agreeable to that course. I think as regards the question of clubs that as between <i>bona fide,</i> social or cultural clubs as the case may be, and those that are not <i>bona fide</i> clubs but are merely clubs as a sort of justification for all-night drinking shops, as the Minister termed them.  A distinction should be made, and that the Section of the Bill dealing with clubs would require rather more careful consideration than we are in a position to give to the Bill if we are to go straight into Committee now for that purpose.</P>

Hence I do not think it would be fair to rush this particular Section through the Dáil before Deputies who represent country constituencies are afforded an opportunity of consulting their constituents. Traders in the country form a considerable section of the community, and in licensing duties and in other respects, they contribute large sums to the revenue of the State.  For that reason.  I think their representatives in this Dáil should be afforded an opportunity of consulting them before this Section is passed.  The requirements of the licensed traders of Dublin and their attitude towards this measure were stated here to-day by the Deputies from Dublin City and County.  The traders in the country should be afforded a similar opportunity.  The amendment I submit is a reasonable one, and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

It is highly advisable to have uniformity with regard to the closing hours, and to end the anomaly of people stepping out of a licensed establishment here and crossing the road to one where they can remain longer.  The case for any discrimination in favour of the country is not a strong one.  They really gain on one night of the week; they gain on Saturday.

If Bills are going <Col N="1924" /> to be dished up to us in the way they are being dished up, none of us will have an opportunity of consulting our constituents, if such a thing is necessary. I would like to ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he has consulted any representative of the licensed trade.  It would be interesting to know if he has met them and what the opinion of the spokesmen of the trade has been on this particular matter.  I do not think that it is necessary or wise for Deputies to send wires to sections of their constituents on every subject that is brought before this Dáil.  We are elected here to form the best judgments we can, and whenever the occasion arises to decide for or against a certain matter.  I certainly do not consider it desirable, so far as I am concerned, in voting on a Bill to say that I had no opportunity of discussing the matter, especially in a Bill of this kind that affects every section of the community.  If, for instance, there was a strike on, over the question of wages, I do not know whether Deputy Hennessy would put up the arguments that he has put up on this occasion.  I think it is unfair to put up that argument.  The reason I rose was to ascertain from the Minister whether he has seen people who could speak on behalf of the whole licensed trade of this country, and if so what were their opinions with regard to the matter.</P>

The first question that arises in connection with the matter under discussion is what are the advantages to be derived, and what are the forces behind the case that is made for a very slight reduction of the hours in this case. Those of the public who have some knowledge of the present law with regard to licensed hours, know that from seven o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night are hours that mean in the case of employees, employment for very long hours.  It may be alleged that there are <Col N="1925" /> regulations with regard to hours and so on, but we know that no organisation of in-police forces, or no organisation of inspection that could possibly be inaugurated could deal with all the abuses that might take place with regard to such regulations as may be made.  One of the first cases that is made for a cutting-down of the hours is to relieve a certain section of the community that may possibly be overworked, and which in the past, as everybody knows, was very much overworked&mdash;persons engaged in this particular trade.  Deputies ought to bear that in mind.  I think there was scarcely any employment that called so much upon physique of the person engaged in it as this particular one.  Regulation of hours will, at least, limit the possibility of further strain on the employees engaged in this trade.  The second question is whether or not there is a general consensus of opinion in favour of this.  As far as I know, here in the city of Dublin, there is no real objection to the hours that have been in operation for some years. Recently they have been departed from and extended.  There is no great case for the extension.  There was no volume of opinion in Dublin, as far as I know, in favour of it&mdash;in favour of differentiating between the people of the Metropolis and the rest of the country, no demand that the people of the Metropolis should be restricted so far as any time they might spend in these institutions as compared with the rest of the country. In any case, I believe that the principal business that is transacted in the country is transacted on Saturday, and we are giving an extension of half an hour in that case.  I do not think the Deputy has put up a case to extend the hours or to give advantages to his constitutents that are denied to the Metropolis.</P>

      <P>The present hours are I understand from 7 to 11, outside Borough areas.  It is proposed under this Bill to reduce the hours by 4 hours per day, or 24 hours in the week, as these people close down on Sundays. As I pointed out previously, they are paying very heavy licence duty.  They do very little business during the day. It is only in the evening, for an hour or two, that they do any business, and the reason I put forward my amendment is that this reduction of hours will hit them very severely, and that in many cases <Col N="1926" /> they must close their doors.  I do not stand for abuses or for any illegitimate trading.  I am with the Minister there, and I am not speaking for electioneering purposes.  I hope I shall convince the Minister on that point.  Perhaps, I might retort that the Minister himself standing for a Dublin constituency might be thinking of electioneering.  The Minister has not stated that he has consulted the South of Ireland traders on this point. If he has, and if they are agreeable, I will withdraw my amendment.  As was stated here a moment ago, people going to fairs and markets require refreshments in the morning before 9 o'clock.  Anybody who has had any experience of the country knows that light refreshments are necessary in the morning, and that 10 o'clock at night is not an unreasonable hour to keep a house open.  The licensed traders generally are not men who abuse their licences.  If there is a very small section of them who commit abuses that is no reason why the whole body of the vintners should be come down upon.  I must press my amendment.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a question which he has not answered. If he is in a position to answer it I would like him to do so.  I would like him to say whether or not he has seen representatives of the licensed trade and what is their considered opinion on this matter.  I am quite prepared to accept the considered opinion and judgment of those who speak on behalf of the licensed traders and who may enter into an agreement with their employees with <Col N="1927" /> regard to the hours.  I am particularly anxious that in every area throughout the country, including the Dublin area, public houses in the same town or district, or even throughout the entire country, should open and close at the same time.  No matter what one might like to think to the contrary, we know perfectly well that the people who keep their houses open after the regular hours &mdash;the hours agreed upon between those who employ assistants and their employees&mdash;are the people who sell poteen and bad drink and who in every way defraud the people who pay high prices for the liquor they consume.  I want all publicans to be put on an equal footing, so that no man will be able to take advantage of the person next door or to sell bad liquor or open during irregular hours.  That is why I would like to know from the Minister what is the considered opinion of those who speak on behalf of the trade, not alone in Dublin but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>There were interviews between representatives of the trade and officials of my department and the impression I got was that they were satisfied with those hours and substantially satisfied with the provisions of the Bill.  They had no serious objection to urge to any of the provisions of the Bill.  I take it these men were representatives of the trade interests not merely in the city of Dublin but the trade interests throughout the country, and I accepted their view as such.  The necessity for uniform closing hours is obvious.  If you have a certain hour here in Dublin and a different hour for the country you will have the anomaly of people changing out of one house into another which happens to be across the border.  I think twelve and a half hours in the day is long enough for the sale of liquor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was of the opinion that the first Bill to be introduced here for restricting the hours of licensed traders would include a clause to reduce the cost of liquor or the duty which is going to the Exchequer of the Saorstát, so that customers could obtain the liquor at a cheaper rate.  According to Section 1 the hour at which public houses will open in the morning is 9 o'clock.  We must remember that in country towns people <Col N="1928" /> have to travel from 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning to markets and fairs in the towns and sometimes they reach these towns in the winter time at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Surely those people are entitled to a little refreshment in order to warm up their systems and fit them for the business transactions of the day. I do not disagree with the fixing of the hour for closing at 9.30 p.m.  I think a public house which closes at 9.30 p.m. has had a long enough day.  The extra half-hour which is being given will cater for such people as I represent here, and I can assure the Dáil that the workers of Westmeath and Longford are not people upon whom the public house acts as a magnet.  As I have said, I am quite satisfied with the closing hour, but I would urge the Minister to fix the opening hour at, say, 8 o'clock and thus give an opportunity to the traders in the towns where fairs and markets are held to provide necessary refreshment for the people who come to these fairs and markets. In the country the same person who sells intoxicating drink also sells provisions, and in some cases you will find the publican engaged in the drapery and boot trades as well, while in addition he is in a position to book your passage to the United States.  I would certainly agree that the Minister should bring in a Bill to the effect that the licensed trader should not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to impress upon the Minister the desirability of having the houses in the towns open before 9 o'clock.  In many cases working people may have their accounts in licensed houses and if something is forgotten overnight the worker may have to go to work next morning without his breakfast if the shops are closed until 9 o'clock.  Then we have a certain number of people in Ireland who cannot go to work in the morning until they get a drink.  If you close the public houses until 9 o'clock in the morning there will be officials and clerks and traders in other businesses and artisans and workers of different descriptions who will be late for their work because they will have to wait for the public houses to open in order that they may get a drink.  I was <Col N="1929" /> pleased to hear the Minister adopting the labour attitude and saying that these people working behind bars are working very long hours.  I presume this Bill is introduced in order that the President may prove that he as one man is going to give them shorter hours.  That may have something to do with it, but I do not think it has.  I think the Minister, with his usual good humour, mentioned that simply to try to draw the opposition to vote with him.  I ask the Minister to extend the opening hour by an hour, which would be appreciated.  Since we have got the Civic Guard I am happy to say that on Sundays in towns where previously the public house doors were open they are now closed.  He has his men and I think they are doing their work.</P>

I am not sure whether or not it is a fact that in Britain it is the person who is licensed and in Ireland it is the place.  A person is licensed in respect of a place and that makes a difference in the phraseology here.  Therefore I will move, subject to whatever correction the Minister will make, to delete the words &ldquo;who is the owner or lessee&rdquo; and to substitute, after &ldquo;person,&rdquo;&ldquo;in respect of&rdquo; the theatre, music hall or other place of amusement.</P>

I do not object to that, provided that the power is exercised with proper control.  I suggest that the least that can be done is to put in an amendment after the words &ldquo;Ghárda Síochána,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;supported by his sworn statement.&rdquo;  The effect of that would be that the local police superintendent or inspector could only get this closing order from the District Justice on swearing an affidavit, or swearing verbally, that the circumstances are as stated in this Section.</P>

I believe that a police inspector if he cannot swear an affidavit, if there be great urgency, should at least have to make a statement on oath.  It is not asking very much to go before a District Justice and make on oath his reasons for that application.  It need not necessarily be written.

The Superintendent, I assume, is in close touch with all the Civic Guard stations in his area.

      <P>I do not think it is reasonable.  The rank of Superintendent in the Civic Guard at present would correspond in a general way to that of a County Inspector in the past, and the inspector to the lower rank of a District Inspector, but it is a question that such a situation as that that the Sub-section is intended to deal with, might occur in any town other than the county town, where the Superintendent would be resident, and generally stationed, and he ought to be able to entrust and delegate a power of that kind to the lower officer, an Inspector.  Otherwise it would mean that at any event of any importance occurring at all within the county it would be absolutely necessary that the Superintendent himself should be present. The rank of Inspector in the Civic Guard presupposes a certain common sense and responsibility that is adequate for dealing with a matter of this kind, particularly when you consider that after he has come to a certain conclusion, he has got to satisfy the District Justice of the state of affairs that prevails, and showing the necessity that exists for that.

      <P>I want to suggest an amendment to line 33.  The wording of Sub-section 2 seems to me to be open to considerable doubt.  &ldquo;Whenever a District Justice is satisfied on the written application that grave abuses prejudicial to peace and order have arisen and are actually taking place.&rdquo;  I do not myself understand what &ldquo;grave abuses prejudicial to peace and order&rdquo; that may be actually taking place may mean.  The expression is one that I am not familiar with in any Act dealing with a breach of the licensing laws, and it is very ambiguous. I suggest that that should be altered to &ldquo;whenever the District Justice is satisfied on the written application,&rdquo; and so on, &ldquo;that in the interests of the preservation of public peace and <Col N="1935" /> order it is inexpedient that the sale of intoxicating liquor should take place&rdquo; you have got to satisfy a District Justice that it is essential that public houses should be closed in certain places for a particular period.  That can only be where there are grave dangers to public peace and order.  I think it would be better to use some expression of that kind, rather than to put it upon the Superintendent or Inspector to say there are grave abuses, and not saying what they are, or to describe something or other which may or may not be the grave abuses that are actually taking place.</P>
      <P>Surely what is contemplated in this Section is that where some mass meeting of people of a tumultuous character is advertised to take place that the police authorities can come to the District Justice and get an order to close the public houses before the people should actually be in the public streets.  It does seem that some expression such as I suggest should be put into the clause, for instance, some words like this: &ldquo;That in the interest of the preservation of public peace and order it is expedient that the sale of intoxicating liquor should be prohibited.&rdquo; I will move as an amendment to substitute these words instead of the words in lines 32, 33 and 34.</P>

      <P>That is much wider than was originally proposed. Written application made by the police to the effect that there was a riot going on is not nearly so wide as what is now proposed, because what is now proposed enables you to give the policeman power, without any sworn statement, to get the public houses closed down generally because of something he thinks may happen.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Gavan Duffy that Deputy FitzGibbon's amendment, while perhaps more in accord with practice in legal departments, does very greatly increase the power of the District Justice and does very greatly widen the intention of this Section.  He has not to wait until there is reason for closing down the public houses because of certain abuses that are in being, but <Col N="1936" /> he can, as a kind of precautionary measure, say that these houses must be closed down.  I am not sure that they have not got such power to-day.  They have certainly exercised that authority. Whether they have legal power or not I am not sure, but it is done.  I think the Section as it stands, or at least the intention of the Section as it stands, is better in this Bill at any rate.  Whatever may be done under future licensing laws it is better to confine the power of closing the public houses to the time when the trouble has actually begun and not as a preparation for trouble which may come.  It really gives power that has not been sought for in the negotiations leading up to this Bill, and I suggest that the powers of the Bill should not be widened at this stage.</P>

      <P>If there are existing provisions which enable Justices to close publichouses in anticipation of a riot, it would necessarily follow that the same powers would exist when the riot actually took place.  I cannot conceive that there is any legislation that enables public houses to be closed before a riot that does not exist to enable them to be closed when the riot takes place. <Col N="1937" /> I am under the impression that the draftsman in framing this Bill was himself under the impression that he was giving the District Justices power that the other Magistrates had of closing public houses when there was trouble on, and assuming, as I do, from the way the Section is drafted, it is only for the remainder of the day that the closing can take place, that it barely confines the possibility of shutting public houses down to a state of affairs in which it would be absolutely essential that they should be shut down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing power, I am advised, is that in the case of a fully fledged riot the District Justice has the power given him by the District Justices' Act, which formally vested in the Resident Magistrate, that he might close up public houses in a town or village. We drafted this Section with a view to dealing with a state of affairs not so intense as a fully fledged riot. There might be, in a particular town, excessive drinking on a very large scale constituting a problem overtaxing the resources of the police situation in that town, and with every possibility&mdash;I will not say of riot&mdash;but of possible assaults throughout the town in a great many places, and so on.  In a situation of that kind it would be a useful power, used with discretion and judgment, if the police could make application to a District Justice and satisfy him of the need for closing down the public houses, I do not anticipate the necessity for closing down for the remainder of the day or that that would be necessary, but I can quite easily imagine that a situation would arise in which the power of closing for two or three hours would be extremely useful.  I think it is simply a matter that the power ought not to be given in such a way as to be restricted to actual riot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGibbon; I feel, is right in suggesting that if you have all the elements of very serious trouble you ought to be able to intervene before the explosion takes place, and to take steps to prevent its taking place However, while I said that I personally would be prepared to accept Deputy FitzGibbon's amendment, I would be content with the Section as it stands, and it is one of the Sections in the Bill that if there was not any keen general objection to <Col N="1938" /> or suspicion about I would be keenest about.  I believe it would be a useful power, but I believe a situation that would require its operation would not occur more than half a dozen times in the year, though the power would be a useful power to have.</P>

      <P>On this Section I would like to know whether this would be the proper time to move a new clause dealing with the point made by Deputy McGarry earlier in the day.  As Deputies are aware, in the year 1900 there was an Act passed extending the boundaries of the City of Dublin, and taking in some of the outlying districts. Through the faulty drafting of the Bill at Westminster licensed traders in Fairview area who were brought in under the extension of the boundaries of the City, and who had seven-day licences were debarred from carrying on their trade on Sundays.  There are some three or four houses in the Fairview district that have seven day licenses, and owing to this faulty drafting of the Act of 1900 they are closed on Sunday, although they <Col N="1939" /> hold seven day licenses and pay for seven-day licences.  In 1906 the matter was brought before the Courts and a decision was given that owing to a fault in the Act disqualification applied to these publicans.  In view of the fact that these people are paying very high rents and very high taxation.  I ask the Minister if he would say that in a future Dáil this matter would be considered and the claim of these traders allowed, and they would be given the same facilities for carrying on their trade as other people who are paying seven-day licences.</P>
      <P>If a promise is now given that the matter will be considered, and if the Minister will say that he will go into the question later on, and if he finds that an injustice has been done we will see that it is remedied, I am prepared to leave the matter at that, but otherwise I would have to move a new clause embodying the right of those traders, and, I presume, this will be the time to do it.</P>

All shades of opinion are in favour of the extension of that hour.  We have strong temperance advocates who are of the opinion that we might advance the hour, and I think it might be done.  Certainly 9.30 would be regarded as rather a harsh regulation by a great many reputable citizens who are members of clubs, and I do not think that any abuse could occur if the hour of 11 p.m. was put into this Section especially as Section 6 make provision for the most stringent kind of inspection.

      <P>The Deputy has said that all sections of the Dáil have supported the idea embodied in his amendment. I asked for some reasons why any difference should be made between a public house and a Club.  Deputy Gavan Duffy kindly responded to that invitation and gave what he considered to be satisfactory reasons.  They were not satisfactory to me.  I cannot understand why any special consideration should be given to those men and women who become members of Clubs as against those who do not.  I suppose the public house is verily what it has often been called &ldquo;the poor man's Club.&rdquo;  He does not pay a guinea a year, or five shillings a year, or three-pence a night for the privilege of having a seat in a Club, but he goes to the public house and takes his drink.  He talks politics, perhaps the virtues of the Government, perhaps the merits of Mr. Alfred Byrne, who perhaps is seeking the voters' support at an election.  All these things are discussed around a table&mdash;I think I am out of date; they are generally <Col N="1941" /> standing at a counter nowadays, or sitting in a cubicle, in the country at any rate.  However, the public house is used as a poor man's Club, but he has to cease at 9.30 p.m.  There is very great inducement for him to join a Club so that he can go from the public house to the Club, where he may have more pleasure or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I am not able to understand why special facilities should be given for the consumption of intoxicating liquor to the man who joins a Club as distinct from a man who pays over the counter day by day, or night by night, and I require to have the difference made clear to me. I am open to conviction.  I have been in a few places which are called Clubs&mdash; they have a billiard table, a card table, and sometimes dominoes, and they help to pass the time while the appetite is being satisfied or created.  The amendment rather suggests that that should be allowed for an hour and a half longer than in the case of the other person who goes to the public house either for a &ldquo;night-cap&rdquo; or for a conversation.  I am not able to see the difference and I have yet to be convinced that there is any reason for any difference in the treatment of the two classes of the community. It may be said that Clubs, speaking generally, are more satisfactorily conducted than public houses.  I do not know.  I think the public houses are generally under greater supervision; there is more publicity at any rate and consequently less likelihood of abuses. It is said that the public houses exist for the one purpose&mdash;to sell liquor&mdash;whereas in the Club the sale of intoxicating liquor is incidental.  No doubt that is true in many cases, but the incidents happen very frequently.</P>

      <P>I could quite understand Deputy Johnson's argument if his premises were right.  They are not.  Deputy Johnson is attacking this amendment on the assumption that the club is the rich man's monopoly, and that he is to be allowed to enjoy himself when the other man is turned out of the public house.  I think the Deputy overlooks the fact that there are in this city of Dublin a number of clubs for working men and other men connected or linked by trade interests or other interests&mdash;men who can in no sense be described as rich men, who use these clubs constantly, to whom the clubs are a very great convenience and a legitimate source of recreation.  He described the public house as the Poor Man's Club. He has overlooked the fact that in this city at all events whatever may be the case elsewhere there are a number of clubs which will come within this Bill&mdash; I have no doubt the Deputy on my right could get particulars if he thought proper&mdash;many of them consisting of working members, which would be affected by this decision.  When I was speaking of the hardships of closing down the supply of intoxicating liquors at 9.30 in places where people come to rest and talk in the evenings and which are not primarily places for drinking at all, I had one or two of these very clubs in my mind.  This is by no means a question of making a distinction between rich and poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to confine my inference to rich and poor, but to those who join clubs and those who do not.  I am quite well aware that a large number of workmen join clubs. But so far from the provisions of the Section as it stands hurting those people, if they join clubs legitimately for the purpose of recreation and pleasure and enlightenment, the provision would not be a hardship at all.  It is only in so far as they use those clubs for drinking purposes that there is any hardship entailed. I do not see why a man who is not a member of a club if he wants a drink of beer, porter or whiskey must go to a publichouse at 9.15 p.m., whereas if he is a member of a club he may delay his nightcap until 10.45 p.m.  My mind is not fixed on this matter, but I require to be convinced that there is any legitimate distinction <Col N="1943" /> to be drawn between the two sections of the community and to be shown why one section should have a preference over the other.</P>

      <P>I looked for some arguments from Deputy Johnson and I have not heard any.  His whole argument is based upon the abuse of a figure of speech.  He starts off by telling us that the public house is the Poor Man's Club thus making a distinction between clubs and clubs.  Now that is nonsense.  The public house is not the Poor Man's Club. I would be sorry for the poor man if it were.  I hope we shall have better clubs for the poor man some day.  Talk to any publican in Dublin and tell him he is running a Poor Man's Club and he will smile.  His business is to sell drink and sell as much drink as he can and make as big profit as he can.  That is what his house is for.  It is not there in the interests of the poor man.  It is an unfortunate thing that the poor man has no other club to go to.  I am not speaking on behalf of any class.  It is not a case of setting up one class against another. There are poor men in Dublin who do belong to clubs and they have no opportunity of going to these clubs until the evening, when their work is over.  It is easy to see that this legislation would be a hardship on them and it is well known that frequently you never want a drink until you feel you cannot get it.</P>

I think if you extend the hours for clubs it will provide a very powerful incentive to those people who frequent these other licensed premises to join clubs.  They will go there instead of going to the places they have been in the habit of going.  I think both should be left on <Col N="1944" /> the same level.  A preference should not be given, and in this case I do not think the preference is being given to the people who are the most deserving. They have at home the company and the comforts that other people have. In my opinion no preference should be given to the members of clubs over and above what other people enjoy.  If you give such a preference, you are using yourself as an advance agent for the recruitment of members of clubs.  That is the only thing this amendment will do.</P>

      <P>I am not much of a club man, but I do think that, in fixing this early hour, what Deputy Johnson refers to as the &ldquo;night-cap,&rdquo; will be partaken of much earlier than it would be, and will be continued to a later hour.  If you say that a man shall not purchase a drink after 9.30 he will probably start at 9.15, when otherwise he would delay it much longer.  Instead of diminishing the consumption of drink, I think this will increase it, and much more harm will be done by fixing the early hour than by fixing the later hour.  There is a fundamental difference between the place that lives by the sale of liquor and the place where the sale of liquor merely comes in incidentally.</P>

I am also encouraged by Deputy Johnson's statement that his mind was not clear on the point and that he had not come to a definite decision on the matter yet.  I have in mind at least one club.  It has 1,000 members. They are all workmen.  I know that some of them come in by train after long journeys when other houses are closed.  Their club is a Railway Workers' Club.  It provides meals, and it has billiard rooms and other facilities for amusement.

If the Dáil curtails the rights of the clubs to the ordinary public house hours, some of those clubs that have been organised and kept together by workmen will not be able to pay their rent.  These clubs are mainly supported by their own members.  A few are made up of a rather good-class worker.  I do not think Deputy Johnson's desire is to injure the Workmen's Clubs.  I hope the Minister will agree to this amendment. If he wishes to have the names of, at least, three or four good class Workmen's Clubs in the City of Dublin, I will give them to him.</P>

      <P>The case is certainly neither strong or entirely convincing. Yet you do get the germ of an idea for discrimination.  I can visualise a certain kind of club, where members go and play games and read, which does not exist primarily or largely with a view to the consumption of liquor.  But there are other clubs throughout the country that are very different. and I have been really thinking more of rural conditions than the conditions here in the City.  I know that a great deal of night crime has resulted from these rural clubs that have sprung up.  The city is not entirely one way either, because when I was a student I remember a workmen's club which I think had more medical students amongst its members than workmen. They only went there after hours.  I think it is a case for a reasonable compromise. I suggested an hour before as a possibility.  I did not suggest one and a half hours.  I will vote against and strongly oppose an extension to 11 o'clock.  It may be said that there is not much difference between 11 o'clock and 10.30 o'clock.  A man turning out at 10.30 will go home.  At least, he will find everyone else gone home and a fairly deserted condition of things in which he can follow his own sweet will unobserved. Men turning out at 11 o'clock will hang around talking until 12 o'clock, and by that time there is a very satisfactory condition of things for the would-be criminal.  I am speaking now, essentially, <Col N="1946" /> of rural conditions in the rather lonely areas.  I would myself be prepared to accept an amendment giving an hour's latitude, on the understanding that that would be very much on trial, and that we would have this matter looked into very carefully and reported on by the police, and with the full intention of removing that additional hour if, in practice, it proves to be an abuse. I will oppose, and ask anyone I can influence, to oppose the 11 o'clock amendment.</P>

      <P>Would there be any grievance if this matter were left over until the new Dáil has a chance to consider the position?  If it is a matter of urgency I do not suppose there will be <Col N="1947" /> any opposition, although these are two long sections and we have not read them. I am told that they deal with legitimate grievances that are not likely to be controverted in any way, but what is the position of these licensees if the matter is left over, say, for two months?</P>

      <P>There are a few outstanding cases of hardship.  During the year, when things were at their hottest, people simply carried on without certificates.  There are a few cases where premises were burned down in one way or another, and when the owners applied for a renewal of licences in respect of new premises they were informed that no licence was attached to the old premises at the time it was destroyed, and that therefore no licence existed to be renewed.  There are a few cases of that kind, sufficient to convince us of the necessity for putting in a provision to deal with them.  All over the country people carried on during these years with no licence at all, simply with acquiescence on the part of police, and some licences lapsed.  I would like very much to get Section 11 through.</P>

      <P>No. I was going to ask permission to remind the President, as Minister for Finance, that at the close of the debate on the Estimates for Intermediate Education the Minister for Education was good enough to declare his sympathy with the claims made on behalf of the secondary teachers and it was understood that there would be a Supplementary Grant, or something in that nature, to increase the amount for the remuneration of secondary lay teachers.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it was not my intention to make any statement with regard to it.  I should say that many representations have been made to me by the Minister for Education, by the Ceann Comhairle, by Deputy Magennis, Deputy O'Connell and others, regarding the necessity for increasing the sum which we intended to devote to this purpose. I think that a case has been made.  I am perfectly satisfied, personally, that it is a good case.  I had intended to introduce the necessary Resolutions to provide for a larger distribution of funds in respect of that service, but all that has occurred in the last few days, the pressure of business, and so on, has prevented me.  I should say that the Executive Council is at one with me as regards this matter.  I cannot give any guarantee that they are <Col N="1950" /> going to return.  I do give this guarantee, that we will recognise and hand on to the people who come after us, that we will regard this as an obligation on the part of the succeeding Ministry to discharge.  The sum involved is something like £30,000 or £40,000.  It is a very considerable sum, having regard to the present condition of our finances, but we realise the case that has been made, the urgency and justice of the demand, and so far as we are concerned we can only say that if the time permitted we would have discharged it.  I do not think that it is reasonable to ask us to do more than that.  If time did permit I would have undertaken that during our term of office.</P>

      <P>If time permitted, I think the question I am raising could be raised by a question or series of questions.  The matter arose only in yesterday's papers, and I had not time to deal with the matter by way of question. This advertisement appeared in yesterday's paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Postmaster-General invites applications from Irish persons or firms who are prepared, under licence from him, to undertake the establishment and operation of a `Broadcasting' Station in Dublin for the supply to the public, by means of wireless telephony, of concerts, lectures, theatrical entertainments, speeches, weather reports, etc.  No application will be considered which has not been received on or before the 20th August.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Applications should be addressed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;THE SECRETARY,</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;General Post Office,</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the same paper appears a paragraph which states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Postmaster-General has had several conferences with the Irish firms interested in broadcasting, and has placed before them an outline of the scheme which he would be disposed to sanction.  The firms in question have, however, failed to agree among themselves, and the Postmaster-General is <Col N="1951" /> therefore reconsidering the situation. In the meantime applications from any genuine manufacturing firms, who have not hitherto applied, will be received.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcGarry" hpid="Captain McGARRY Captain McGARRY">
      <NameTxt>Captain McGARRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have good reason to believe that that paragraph was sent out from the Postmaster-General's Office.  One would have thought that that advertisement should have appeared in the papers before the conference.  I do not know the firms with whom the Postmaster-General has had a conference. I do not know the method he employed in selecting them, and I do not know what method he adopted to find out what firms were interested in broadcasting in this country.  Some time ago I was approached by two groups of people in Dublin who wished to start a broadcasting company.  They asked me if I could find out some particulars from the Postmaster-General.  I interviewed him several times, and I am sorry he is not in his place.  He suggested that it might possibly be taken up by the Government as a monopoly.  He was not prepared to make any statement with regard to broadcasting and listening-in, but he also told me immediately any arrangements were being made he would inform me.  He has not done so.  I do not know what the intentions of the Government or the Postmaster-General may have been, but I think I may be pardoned for assuming that if those firms with whom he had conference had not failed to agree that the Dáil would have been presented with what Mr. De Valera would call a <i>fait accompli,</i> without having one word of hint from the Postmaster-General as to what his intentions were.  When the British broadcasting company was being established, Mr. Kellaway, the British Postmaster-General, kept the British House of Commons informed step by step as the negotiations proceeded.  It was a very necessary thing in view of the fact that the Government were involved in agreements, licences and concessions in every single step of the Bill.  The Postmaster-General is reported to have submitted a scheme which he would be disposed to accept.  Would it be any harm if the Dáil were to know that scheme?  I do not think business of <Col N="1952" /> such magnitude as broadcasting, which is going to involve the expenditure of a large amount of capital, is going to be dealt with in a hole and corner manner by the head of a Department without the knowledge of the Dáil.  The last sentence in the paragraph is &ldquo;In the meantime applications from any genuine manufacturing firms, who have not hitherto applied, will be received.&rdquo;  That paragraph is probably the result of confusion in the mind of the person who dictated it as to the difference between broadcasting and listening-in, or reception.  I think everybody knows that broadcasting is the sending out of the messages, and listening-in is the reception of the messages. So far as manufacturing is concerned it does not enter broadcasting to any great extent, but the manufacturing of the instruments for the reception and listening-in is a very big industry.  It would seem that there is an attempt to make the firm who gets the concession for the manufacture of the broadcasting instruments, the manufacturer also for the reception or listening-in apparatus.  If that is so there are two dangers.  The Postmaster-General, if that is his idea, is creating or endeavouring to create a monopoly.  I do not think that is his intention. I rather think that is a matter of confusion.  Not alone would he create a monopoly, but you and I and every citizen of the State, who has to pay for his licence will have to pay more for their sets, and you will encourage the manufacturer of amateur sets which will pay no licence. You can take up any technical paper in England and you can find there sets advertised for 5 guineas up to £25, say, for an ordinary serviceable set of 150 to 200 miles range.  When the British Broadcasting Company were starting they did not ask for a monopoly for manufacture.  A group of representatives of these manufacturing firms came together; they took the risk; they spent several hundred thousand pounds on the broadcasting business, and they did not ask that these firms should have a monopoly.  They welcomed competition with all other manufacturers, and they let everyone who wanted to make these machines make them and sell them, provided that they got the royalty.  At the present time in Ireland there is no firm which manufactures these sets.  It will be a long time before they manufacture <Col N="1953" /> them, and if you had a firm in Ireland to manufacture the sets, I wonder then, does the Postmaster-General know that there are 700 patents involved, and to get the use of these patents will, practically, mean 700 arrangements with the patentees.  Unless you are only going to broadcast &ldquo;Phil the Fluter's Ball&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bonnie Mary of Argyle,&rdquo; you have got to have agreements with Press Agencies, the Composers' Association, the Playwrights' Association, the Stock Exchange, the Commercial and Maritime Agencies, for political and general information, and the Meteorological Society for weather reports, and so on.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Postmaster-General will place a scheme before the House.  I think a Committee of the House should be formed to go into and report upon how the Broadcasting business is to be started here.  Any company started here in Ireland at the present time would have to be satisfied to lose money for several months.  The loss would gradually become less as the number of users increased.  I shall be glad to know if the Postmaster-General would appoint a committee so that he could give the House all the information possible.</P>

      <P>The Postmaster-General is, unfortunately, absent on important business, and he has left me the legacy of his proof.  I take it that the Deputy will have no objection to my giving his reply to the House.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the transfer of the Post Office Services from the British Government on the 1st April, 1922, permits for the installation and working of Wireless receiving apparatus were issued by the Irish Postmaster-General to experimenters and other persons who complied with the conditions laid down as regards the apparatus and aerial to be used and on payment of a fee of 10s. a year.  On the outbreak of the disturbances in the country in July, 1922, these permits were withdrawn at the request of the Military Authorities and all persons in possession of wireless apparatus were required to surrender it to the Post Office for safe custody.  The sale, importation or manufacture of wireless apparatus was also prohibited.  This general prohibition against the use of wireless apparatus has not yet been removed. For some time past, however, special permits have been given on specified conditions with the approval of <Col N="1954" /> the military authorities for wireless receiving demonstrations at fetes and other entertainments organised for charitable and public objects.</P>
    <P>Applications were received from some Irish and British firms for a licence for the establishment of a Broadcasting station in the Free State.  The consideration of the British applications has been deferred for the present, but in order that all persons or firms in Ireland interested in the matter might have an opportunity of having their claims considered, notifications were made in the Press inviting applications.</P>
    <P>Numerous applications were received, and after examination and sifting three main companies were left.  As it was considered that only one Broadcasting station, which should be in Dublin, was warranted if there was to be a reasonable chance of success the firms were asked to confer together with a view to uniting in a joint scheme.</P>
    <P>The parties having failed to agree on a plan of co-operation the Postmaster-General summoned them to a Conference and laid down the general conditions on which he would be prepared to grant a licence for broadcasting.  These were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That a Broadcasting Company should be formed with a guaranteed capital of not less than £30,000, which would undertake to erect and operate a Broadcasting Station in Dublin.</P>
    <P>2.  That the Company should be open to any <i>bona fide</i> firm or person carrying on business of manufacturing wireless apparatus in the Free State on taking one or more shares in the Company. The Board of Directors should consist of seven members nominated by the constituent Companies.</P>
    <P>3.  That the licence should be for five years and to be renewable thereafter at the pleasure of the Postmaster-General. Power would be reserved to terminate the licence at any time for failure to fulfil its conditions.</P>
    <P>4.  That the importation of wireless sets or component parts of sets should be confined to the Company and its members.</P>
    <P>5.  That the Company would be at liberty to manufacture and sell wireless receiving apparatus and would receive a share of the fee to be charged by the <Col N="1955" /> Post Office for licences in accordance with the following scale:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Ordinary Licence Fee, £1 a year. Company's share, 12s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Private Constructor Fee, £2 a year. Company's share, 32s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Schools and Institutions Fee, £1 a year.  Company's share, 12s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Hotels, Restaurants, Public Houses, &amp;c. Fee, £5 a year.  Company's share, £4 10s.</P>
    <P>Occasional Licence Fee, £1 each. Company's share, 12s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Traders' or Dealers' Fee, £1 a year. Company's share, £1.</P>
    <P>Amusement Purveyors' Fee, £1 a week.  Company's share, 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>These terms were found to be generally acceptable to the three firms referred to, but while two of them were willing to join in the formation of the proposed Broadcasting Company they could not see their way to co-operate with the third party.  The Postmaster-General met the representatives of the firms in a further Conference and endeavoured to induce them to reconsider their attitude, but without success.  He explained that he could not grant a licence to a Company which sought to exclude another Company from participating in the concession, and stated that unless agreement were reached he would have to terminate the negotiations and consider the whole question again. As agreement between the three firms has not been reached the whole matter is now being reconsidered and further applications are being invited.  In the meantime it is not possible to release wireless apparatus generally.</P>
    <P>I may add the Postmaster-General also said that if the statement was unsatisfactory, or if the Deputy was not perfectly satisfied, he would undertake to meet him and go into the matter with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcGarry" hpid="Captain McGARRY Captain McGARRY">
      <NameTxt>Captain McGARRY</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement is not satisfactory.  First of all, £30,000 is not sufficient, and secondly, what I feared would occur has occurred as indicated in the last portion of the statement.  The Minister by only allowing this Company to do Broadcasting would allow them to import all their machinery and they can get for that any price they like.  You <Col N="1956" /> will encourage the manufacture of this machinery from which you will get no revenue.  I think also the Postmaster-General was quite wrong in picking out three or four firms and suggesting that he would come to terms with them without giving other people any opportunity of coming forward and saying what they were willing to do.  I think the answer is most unsatisfactory.</P>

I knew nothing at all about this until within the last week or ten days, when certain of the people concerned came to me with regard to the matter.  I am quite prepared to discuss this at any time very fully, but I am perfectly sure that it ought to be postponed and nothing done until we have a new Dáil.  I urge that very strongly and for reasons which I say frankly I do not want to bring in here now.  I feel very strongly on this matter, but I leave it at that, that no action whatever should be taken until a new Dáil is elected, and that no action should be taken until the consent of the Dáil is first got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I wished to raise a question in regard to the printing of the Register of Voters, I think a very considerable grievance has been created quite unnecessarily.  It seems that a circular was sent out on May 31st to the Printing Offices as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The dates fixed for the printing of the Register 1923, are set out below.  The first copy may be expected by the printer on June 12th.  The last copy will be delivered July 7th, and the final copy on July 21st.&rdquo;  Now, in the case of which this is a sample&mdash;one of many&mdash;instead of the first copy being delivered on June 12th, it was July 10th when the first copy was delivered, and the last copy was delivered on July 26th instead of July 7th.  Certain dates were given to the printer in which to get this work done.  Certain arrangements were made which allowed in this particular case&mdash;the case of Galway&mdash;five weeks and four days as the minimum time for the contractor.  On July 26th the balance of the copy of 29 divisions, the balance <Col N="1957" /> being 9, was received by the printer, but on the same night 16 divisions out of the total 29 of the Register were taken away from the printer because he had not finished them and could not finish them by the end of the period.  As a matter of fact they only got 16 days to do the whole of the work for which they were allowed in the contract five weeks and four days Now in the case in question, 16 divisions, more than half in number of the total register, were taken away from this printing firm, and the printers were disemployed and the firm lost the contract, and the preparation which he had made for carrying out the contract had to be cancelled and certain loss sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one case only, but several similar complaints have come from quite a number of towns in the country.  The responsibility is the responsibility of the Stationery Office or the Registration Officer and not the responsibility of the printer.  We heard on an earlier occasion that the registers were being taken away from one printer and sent to another.  I want to ask this definite question: Is it true or not that any of these registers have been taken away from the original contractors and sent to England or to the North of Ireland to be printed.  I would like a definite answer to that question, and I would like further to have some assurance, because the damage is done, that where it is clear the printers had sustained loss by virtue of the failure of the Stationery Office or the Registration Officer to supply material in time and according to contract, they will be recompensed for the loss.  We are told, and of course I quite understand, that the circumstances required this to be a hurried job, and that they were such that it was necessary for the Government to transfer the printing from one place to <Col N="1958" /> another so as to insure that the Register would be prepared in time.  But the printers ought not to be allowed to suffer for that.  I want an assurance upon these two points: first, that none of this printing which it was proposed to send elsewhere has been sent out of the jurisdiction of Saorstát, and secondly, that where firms have lost because of the removal of these jobs they will be recompensed for the actual loss they sustain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question as to whether any printing was sent out of the Saorstát, I have to say that every possible effort having been exhausted, and every possible attempt made to get the work done in time in the Saorstát, and then finding that fifteen hundred pages could not be done here we sent it out.  It is being done in England.  It is the only case in which that has occurred, and it is by reason of the fact that it could not be done here.  We got our information from our advisors and from people who are more than advisors, as to whether it could be done here, and we found it could not.  As regards the second question, I am not in a position to say whether the printers can be recompensed.  It is a question I suppose of ordinary contract. If we made a contract and we broke it they have got their remedy, but I am not prepared to grant compensation for merely exceptional circumstances or to rectify everything that is set forward as an injustice.  They have the same opportunities as any other person, if a contract that they made was broken and its terms not carried out.</P>

      <P>We have not yet come to a decision as to whether when notice is given that a matter will be raised on the adjournment on one day that it can be carried over to the next day, if circumstances occur which make it impossible to take it on the day for which the notice is given.  This is a very exceptional day, and it might be possible to raise the two matters on the adjournment if Deputies agree to that.  Deputy McGarry's notice could be taken first and Deputy Johnson's afterwards.</P>
