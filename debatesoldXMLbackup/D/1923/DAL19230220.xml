      <P>There is no indication as to whether the question refers to the Minister's religious duties, family duties, official duties, or personal duties as to his health.  If it refers to either or both of the first two, I have no information which would enable me to answer the question; if it refers to the third I can only say that I have no reason to find fault with the Minister's attendance to his duties, and as regards the last I may say the Minister has had an operation within the past week, the success of which may best be left to time to observe.  A member of the Dáil has been attached to this Ministry for some time previously, not to do duty in the absence of the Minister, but rather to assist him.  Two other members of the Dáil are also assisting.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that in June, 1922, the Macroom Rural District Council agreed to hand over the cottages and plots to the tenants, free of rent, subject to sanction of the Local Government Departments; that no rents were demanded or paid until last month, when the Council served a demand for rents and arrears; that many of these tenants are at present unemployed and unable to pay arrears; that the cottages are in a bad state of repair; and whether he will make some arrangement whereby the tenants can keep these cottages.</P>

      <P>Sanction was refused to the proposal of the Macroom Rural District Council that they should hand over all labourers' cottages and <Col N="1477" /> plots to the tenants free of rent, but the Council have been asked to forward to the Ministry a draft scheme for sale of the cottages to their occupiers.</P>
      <P>The rents of the cottages in question are very low, varying from 6¼d. to 1/1 per week.</P>
      <P>I will have an inspection made of the cottages, and will make inquiry into the cost of repair.</P>
      <P>A scheme of sale cannot be entertained where tenants have endeavoured to evade their obligations because of unsettled local conditions.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that under the Union Amalgamation Scheme for County Sligo, the Clerk and Workhouse Master of Sligo Union were removed from their offices and not appointed to any positions under the new scheme, although Sligo Workhouse was made the County Home and Hospital, and these officials had given respectively 21 years' and 11 years' satisfactory service; whether the pensions of these officers were fixed in April last in accordance with the Local Government Act of 1919, a British statute which was adopted by Dáil Eireann, but have not yet been paid; whether these officers were engaged up till September last in the adjustment of accounts necessitated by the amalgamation; and whether he will use his influence, either to secure employment for these officials, or at least the payment to them of the pensions to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Amalgamation Scheme for Sligo County the posts of Clerk of the Union and Master of the Workhouse, Sligo, were abolished.  The holders of these positions were at liberty to present themselves for examination for employment under the County Home Committee, but omitted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions for these officers were proposed by the Sligo Board of Guardians, who purported to act under Section 8 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, at a rate which appears to have been unduly generous.  While it is true <Col N="1478" /> that this Act was adopted by Dáil Eireann, it was modified, however, in so far as it conflicted with Amalgamation Schemes of the County Schemes (Temporary Provisions) Decree, 1922.  The following special provision dealing with this matter was also included in the Sligo Amalgamation Scheme:&mdash;&ldquo;Each officer whose service is over ten years shall be granted superannuation at the rate of one-sixtieth of his or her present salary and emoluments for each year's service.  The length of service shall be taken as the actual number of years served, with the addition of 50 per cent. of such actual service, provided that in no case shall the superannuation exceed two-thirds of the present salary and emoluments of such officer.  This addition of 50 per cent. of the number of years' service is granted as compensation for the abolition of office, and the officials whose offices are abolished shall have no further claim beyond what is provided for in this section.  The amount of an officer's emoluments shall be calculated on the basis of the average of such emoluments for the three completed years prior to his retirement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as concerned the continued temporary employment of these officers the Ministry intimated on the 26th October last that no objection would be made to a payment additional to pension of an amount representing one-half of the former salaries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will observe that under Clause 10 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923, it is proposed to seek power to enable the Ministry to determine the amount of such pensions in case of dispute.</P>
    <P>I will see that no avoidable delay takes place in the matter.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is really one of a dispute by the County Home Committee.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of a notice which was issued from a meeting of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, held at Ballyduff, Co. Waterford, on January 21st, and which appeared in the Waterford <Col N="1479" /> newspapers on January 26th, as follows: &mdash;&ldquo;Notice.&mdash;That where farms are to be let for grazing, intending purchasers will be required to give an undertaking that they will till at least 20 per cent. of their taking, or, as an alternative, give employment at the rate of two men to every 50 acres.  This also applies to farms grazed by the owners, otherwise we, as representing the unemployed agricultural workers, will have to take other measures to save them from immediate starvation, which must soon be their lot if the present system of grazing is allowed to carry on.&mdash;For District Committee, J. Foley, Secretary&rdquo;; and to ask what steps the Government intend to take to protect the legal rights of the citizens if the terms of the said notice are attempted to be put into effect.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the notice quoted by the Deputy. Compulsory tillage formed the subject of a discussion in the Dáil last September, as a result of which the Government appointed the Committee on Agriculture, which is at present inquiring into the condition of farming generally in An Saorstát, including the place of grazing in our agricultural life.  Whatever may be the evils of the grazing system, they must be dealt with by well considered legislation, and the Government will not tolerate for a moment, in any part of the country, irregular action by individuals or groups of individuals who may be seeking to usurp the functions of the representatives of the people in this or any other matter.</P>

It has been stated by her father that she was &ldquo;organising Sinn Féin,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;her action was perfectly constitutional,&rdquo; but correspondence between the Divisional Adjutant and the Divisional Quartermaster of the Irregular forces in the Cork area suggests very definitely otherwise, and, in my opinion, warrants the detention of the lady.</P>

      <P>The Railway Protection Repair and Maintenance Corps is divided into two classes&mdash;A and B. Class A is mainly composed of Railway men who, owing to the dislocation of the Railways, were thrown out of employment.  They are paid the nominal railway rates of wages for six days of the week, but allowances are not paid to their dependents.  Class B consists of soldiers in receipt of ordinary Army rates of pay.  Allowances are paid to their dependents at the rates set out in my reply to a question on the 12th ultimo.</P>
      <P>Railway passes are issued to officers and men proceeding home on leave, provided that not more than one such pass is granted to an officer or man in any six months.</P>

      <P>There is no reason. It was a convention adopted.  The Railway men when first taken on to form the nucleus of this Maintenance Corps, were taken on because they had no employment.  They were in receipt of no grant of any kind from any Association and the Government made use of them to form a nucleus and build up their Railway Protection Maintenance Corps.  They were taken on to perform <Col N="1481" /> what was ordinary soldier's work which covers the full seven days of the week, and we undertook to pay them the rates which the Railway Companies were paying at that particular time.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following resolution :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this Dáil hereby approves of the Railway and Canal Commission (Extension of Time) Order, 1923, made on the fifth day of February, 1923, by the Executive Council, under Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922), and laid before this Dáil on the twentieth day of February, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Resolution requires a little explanation. The Department of Agriculture holds considerable areas of land at <Col N="1483" /> present which were acquired under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916.  The land was acquired compulsorily for the purpose of allotments and at present is set to plotholders.  Under the Act the powers of the Department to hold the land only continues to the 31st August, 1923, unless extended by the Railway and Canal Commission.  The Railway and Canal Commission was a United Kingdom body and is now gone out of operation in the Saorstát and it is necessary to provide some substitute for it to exercise the powers of the Railway and Canal Commission. This is what the Order does. This Order provides that a Commission composed of the Executive heads of the Ministry for Home Affairs, and the Ministry for Local Government, should exercise the powers of the Railway and Canal Commission in the Saorstát, and it is proposed that this body should make an Order extending the time during which the Department can hold the lands.  That body will have power to extend the time for three years or for any lesser period.  This Order has been made by the Executive Council and it is laid on the Table of the Dáil and it will be completed by resolution of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister enlighten us as to this? Have the two Ministers appointed to exercise the duties of the Railway and Canal Commission been appointed to exercise all the duties or only the duties with regard to this particular matter with which we are dealing to-day?  The <Col N="1484" /> Railway and Canal Commission is a very important body indeed, and it has always been recognised as having judicial functions of the highest order and for that reason the head of the Commission was in each of the three countries formerly comprising the United Kingdom a Judge specially selected for his qualifications to deal with the grave legal questions that came before the Commission. They dealt with the legality of raising or reducing rates, providing reasonable facilities on railways and canals, and a vast number of very important and difficult legal questions. The Commission contained two permanent officials, one representing railway interests and the other representing traders' interests and they were presided over by a Judge whose rulings on questions of law were conclusive.  That is to say, he ruled questions of law because he was a trained lawyer.  They were all on equality when they came to questions of rates, and matters of that sort.  Now, if two Ministers are to be taken away from the duties of their own Department to sit and decide questions, that may take a week or so or a continuous session to decide, the Ministerial duties of these Ministers are bound to suffer.  On the other hand, surely the country is entitled to have a Commission dealing with these other matters belonging to the Railway and Canal Commission and have them dealt with by some properly qualified lawyer as President.  Perhaps it is my own fault, but I have not read this Order and I would be indebted to the Minister if he would make it clear that these Ministers are only appointed to deal with these questions of land now in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, and not the general question of railways and canals.</P>

I do not expect from him a speech such as would be necessary in introducing the promised Bill, but I think it would be an advantage if he would take the opportunity that this Commission provides, at least to give some indication of the mind of the Government in regard to the allotment movement and whether they intend to continue to assist it, or rather to encourage it.</P>

With regard to Deputy Johnson's point, a Bill is to be introduced dealing with the general question of plot-holders.  The main difficulty in the way is this.  At present the Department of Agriculture acquire land and they have to acquire it at the market value.  They have to let it to the plot-holders at a tillage rent, a rent which would pay them and which would warrant the sowing and selling of crops. There is a big difference between the market value of the land about Dublin and the land for tillage purposes, and the State has to pay it.  Everybody wants to have everything paid out of taxation and we are trying to solve that problem as well as we can.  We are endeavouring to make plot-holding a self-supporting proposition.  These are the <Col N="1486" /> real difficulties and the Bill will be shortly introduced.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That this Dáil hereby approves of the Railway and Canal Commission (Extension of Time) Order, 1923, made on the fifth day of February, 1923, by the Executive Council, under Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922), and laid before this Dáil on the twentieth day of February, 1923.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That this Dáil hereby approves of the Revenue Commissioners' Order, 1923, made on the 5th day of February, 1923, by the Executive Council, under Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922), and laid before this Dáil on the 20th day of February, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order has been circulated, and it is rendered necessary by reason of the fact that some body must take control of the question of Revenue and Customs and Excise.  The purport of the Order is to create one body of Commissioners to perform in the area of our jurisdiction the functions formerly exercised by two bodies&mdash;the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue are responsible for the care and management of all Inland Revenue Duties, Income Tax, Super-Tax, Corporation Tax, Stamp Duty, and Estate Duties, etc.; and the Commissioners of Customs and Excise are responsible for all Customs and Excise Duties.  It appears to the Executive Council that having two bodies functioning would be expensive, and that all the functions hitherto discharged by the Commissioners of the respective bodies&mdash; Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise &mdash;could be discharged by a single Board. and that is the purpose of this Order. The Commissioners in this case will be three in number.  The Commissioners of Inland Revenue and the Commissioners of Customs and Excise consisted of four Commissioners, who held their appointments under Royal Warrant.  That is set out in Clause 7.  In Clause 9 it is pointed out that &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners shall in the exercise of their duty <Col N="1487" /> be subject to the control of the Minister for Finance, and shall obey all orders and instructions which may be issued to them in that behalf by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; In that connection I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that in this clause the control of the Minister for Finance will extend to Civil Service matters, but will not affect the computation of any individual as to his liability to any tax.  The position of the new Board of Revenue to the Minister for Finance is much the same as that of the Judiciary at the present moment to the Minister for Home Affairs.  It will be observed at once that it is a most desirable method of arranging these matters.  Clause 10 sets out the location of the chief office, and also makes provision for such other offices in such other places as may be deemed necessary.  The provision for having the chief office in Dublin is necessary, as the Taxation Acts of the late United Kingdom specifically provided for the maintenance of the chief office in London.  As regards the days and hours the office shall be opened, it will be noted that all the staffs of the Inland Revenue are Civil Servants, subject to Civil Service conditions as regards hours and holidays, and the Inland Revenue being now responsible to the Minister for Finance by Clause 9 are not given any extended powers to define what holidays they would like to appoint for their staffs.  The point of the provision is to be found in such matters as arranging the opening and closing of bonded houses and warehouses.  Clause 12 indicates the provisions for making Orders under this Order, where any Order must be signed by two or more Commissioners. That is the law as it stands at present, and this clause gives power for such Order to be signed by one Commissioner. Section 1 of the Inland Revenue Regulations provides that the appointment of Commissioners is to be made by his Majesty the King and other controlling Commissioners of the Treasury.  The appointment by the King and control by the Treasury no longer exists because of the provisions in Clauses 7 and 9 of the Order.  Section 3 of the Inland Revenue Regulations states that the Chief Office shall be in London, but that provision is rendered inoperative by the clause I have <Col N="1488" /> mentioned, that the Chief Office of the Inland Revenue shall be in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law certain documents, such as warrants to collectors, etc., have to be signed by two Commissioners. I have already explained that one Commissioner will do the signing in future by reason of the passing of this Order.  It is, I think, due to the Dáil that it should be mentioned that the appointments to be made under this Order are three Civil Servants of experience who have been closely associated with the work which they will be required to discharge in connection with these Commissionerships. The Press, as usual, has rather overstated the case, or, I should say, has given some indication as to the personnel.  It is not a correct statement. This Order must be passed by both Houses.  It was introduced last week into the Seanad.  I was not aware that the Seanad would be sitting this week, and it was before the Seanad last week in consequence.  Now, under the Adaptations Act, it is necessary to have it passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas under Section 7 (1) of the Adaptation Act.  The Executive Council may create a Statutory Board of Commissioners to replace any Board which was in existence before the 6th of December.  Under Section 7 (2) it may apportion or combine the functions of two or more of these Statutory Boards of Commissioners, and it is only an Order under Sub-section 2 that acquires the approval of each House by way of Resolution.  The Executive Council must first pass this Order, and it has so done, as enacted on the 5th February.  I move the resolution.</P>

      <P>I have no criticism to make of the Order, and I am prepared to vote for the motion, but I would like just to underline the statement that was made by the Minister, and ask for consideration of a point of view in regard to the personnel.  Our minds have been disabused as to the truth of what purported to be semiofficial information in regard to the personnel, but I want to urge upon the Ministry that it is desirable that the three persons to be appointed should have had experience of the Irish Excise and Inland Revenue.  It would be a mistake to overlook the fact that you have in Ireland in the service of the Saorstát, experienced officers who are quite capable <Col N="1489" /> of doing the work that is necessary, and who have decided to remain under the Saorstát when they have the opportunity to go across the water; and bear that in mind, as a reason why preference should be given to such Civil Servants rather than appoint other Civil Servants, Irishmen, perhaps, but who declined to go into the service of the Saorstát when they had the opportunity, having had long residence in England.  One knows how much weight is given in the Civil Service to opportunities for promotion, and I have no doubt that when Civil Servants were considering the question of whether they would accept transfers or not, they had in mind the probabilities of promotion due to seniority coupled with ability, and if that opportunity for promotion is to be taken from them it is not likely to add to the amount of content and good feeling within the service. I suggest that these considerations should be borne in mind when the Ministry are making these appointments.</P>

These men have been brought up, and are bound up in red tape, and will continue to be bound up in red tape to the very end.  It is quite necessary you should have men of either financial or commercial ability in order to counteract these hide-bound rules that obtain in nearly all of the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>In the case of Income Tax there are peculiar Irish provisions. No one knows these provisions, or has more practice of them than the gentleman who has been appointed Chairman <Col N="1490" /> of this Board.  I think that will be admitted, even in the Civil Service.  In England the Commissioners both of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have been and are Civil Servants.  Now, one other thing I would like to say is that the personnel of the Ministry of Finance is exactly the same as under the late Ministry of Finance, and the two gentlemen belonging to the Ministry of Finance whom we have in mind for appointments to these Commissionerships are gentlemen who were appointed by the late Minister for Finance, holding the same positions then as they do now, and I think, had he lived, he would have made these appointments himself if the gentlemen in question had been willing to accept them.  Every appointment to be made is on the recommendation of the Chief Officer of the Department.  I do not think that any individual Deputy would be in a position to question the nomination made by the responsible head of the Department because of the absence of previous knowledge of the fitness of people for these positions.  Considerable criticism has been indulged in, both in the Press and in private representation to the Minister for Finance, regarding promotions and appointments, and so on. Now, I submit, that this is rather unfair. One must be guided in these appointments by some sort of standard, or by some person.  As regards the standard it is obviously unfair to think that it would be possible, having regard to the experience that we have had, that you could set up such a standard, and one must be guided then by the responsible heads who have been entrusted with the control of the particular Department.  From that policy we have not departed, and such recommendations or promotions or nominations that we have made we have made on the authority of those who were appointed by the late Minister for Finance, any how as far as the Ministry of Finance is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion on the paper is designed to do away with the Committee Stage of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Bill, wholly if it is possible, or at least to a very big degree. That Bill, in the first place, is highly contentious; it introduces principles about which there are sharply divergent opinions, and upon which, if possible, some form of agreement or compromise should be reached.  In the second place the Bill is highly technical, and, therefore, much more suitable for discussion round the table than in Committee of the whole Dáil.  Parts of it are very far from meaning what they seem at first sight. Let me refer the Dáil to one or two sections. I need say nothing about Part I. of the Bill beyond this, that it seems to me eminently desirable that the operations of the Shaw Commission should be legalised.  That is a matter which will require some drafting.  If the Ministry agree with that view the drafting could be much better agreed upon in a Select Committee than in a Committee of the Dáil.  But the part of the Bill which has interested people most is Part II.  Now, I think one of the most astounding things in Part II is the discovery that no compensation whatsoever may be recovered by any person who had his house in O'Connell Street destroyed by the National troops.  I do not suppose that that was the intention of the Ministry, but that again shows how technical this Bill is, and what a careful examination of it is required.  If that statement is correct &mdash;and I challenge contradiction on it&mdash; Section 14 will require very considerable amendment, the kind of amendment that can much more easily be agreed upon in Select Committee than in a Committee of the whole Dáil.  The Dáil will notice that under Section 14, Sub-section 9, I think, it is specified that to recover for <Col N="1492" /> such damage as has been done in O'Connell Street you must prove that the destruction was wrongful.  I do not see the Government making the case, or bringing in a proviso to the Bill to make the case, that destruction by their own troops was wrongful.  Therefore, the thing as it stands excludes damage done by their own military operations, whether that was intended or not.  I assume it was not.  If not, I think there is a strong case for careful examination of that particular section in Select Committee.  Then again, take the question of consequential damages.  I have every sympathy with the desire of the Ministry to see that no fraudulent or fancied claim for consequential damage is paid.  I have every sympathy with that.  But, in the desire to do that, they go, in the opinion not merely of many Deputies in this Dáil, but of many people outside, a very great deal too far, by cutting out consequential damage altogether.  My submission to the Dáil is, that that is a case where you want some form of words embodying an agreement or compromise between the two views&mdash;one the view that no consequential damage is to be paid, and the other the view that, provided you can make that consequential damage reasonable, it should be paid.  Amendments of that kind are not easily worked out on the Committee Stage of a Bill.  We have had previous experience to that effect. To give the Dáil a case in point.  Supposing a newspaper office was destroyed, I venture to say that the damages which that newspaper would normally recover would be to, at least, 40 per cent., and probably more, consequential damages&mdash; loss of advertisements, and all the rest of it.  I think every reasonable person will agree that you must find some form of words which will ensure that a person so damaged will get reasonable consequential damages, and not be deprived of what is called consequential damages altogether. There is again the question of personal injuries.  That matter is one which gives rise to considerable difficulty, and I realise fully that the Government is entitled to say these Criminal and Malicious Injury provisions were never intended to apply to a civil war, to military operations properly so-called.  But, while admitting that, I put it to the Government that there are many things that happen, and that have happened during the course of such operations as <Col N="1493" /> we have had in Ireland in the past few months, which while connected with the civil war are not directly due to military operations, and clearly ought to be the subject of compensation; clearly should not be taken out of the operation of such a Bill as this merely because they are personal injuries.  That is a matter which wants very careful discussion and consideration. I do not want to deal with the matter at any length now.  I merely want to emphasise some of the salient points which are more easily dealt with, as, I think, round a table than in this Dáil.  After all, you are dealing with big sums of public money.  This, I take it, is not intended to be a Party measure. It should be a measure backed by the general agreement of the Dáil, and in trying to find the best means of securing that general agreement, it seemed to me that a Select Committee would probably be the more convenient for all Parties. I had at the back of my mind the hope that when that Committee is appointed its instructions would include a power to the Committee to invite the Seanad to send some of its representatives to meet that Select Committee, so that there would be general agreement, at least on many portions of the Bill, if not on the whole of it, not merely in this Dáil, but also in the Seanad.  Therefore, I say that this motion, if adopted, both saves time and secures a method by which a considerable amount of agreement on the main heads of the Bill ought to be obtained. There are a number of minor, but also important matters, which, as the Dáil knows, have given rise to differences of opinion.  All of them, I think, are matters which will be much more easily dealt with round a table.  The necessity of checking the proposed power of re-opening cases; the desirability of amending Sections that deal with certain classes of things for which no compensation is to be paid, and certain classes of persons to whom it is proposed to pay no compensation; the wisdom of providing that the Judge shall have something more than a mere power to recommend under Part II.; the question of appeal from the Judge's recommendation or Order; and the very complicated reinstatement provisions; these are, I think, all matters upon which a very substantial measure of agreement could be reached if the different Parties in this Dáil, by their representatives, met in a small Committee <Col N="1494" /> and talked the matter out, rather than meeting, as we would do here, if the Committee Stage were reached in this Dáil, and having amendment after amendment, division after division, upon matters that ought not, most of them, to be contentious, but that ought to form the parts of a generally agreed Bill.  I hope the Dáil will share my views that this is probably the best method of avoiding waste of time upon this measure, and of securing a large measure of agreement. I beg to move.</P>

      <P>I do not know, sir, that much of a case has been made for referring the Committee Stage of this Bill to a Special Committee.  A Special Committee has been considering this Bill&mdash;a Ministerial Committee&mdash;and it appears to me that to restrict it now to another small Committee would scarcely achieve the purpose which the Deputy had in view.  I do not know whether the Deputy has read the Bill very carefully, or whether most of those who have criticised the Bill in the Press have either taken pains to consider the history of this question of Criminal Malicious Injuries, or the extent of the public purse in the matter of compensating those who have suffered loss.  The Deputy referred to Clause 14 (9), but evidently he did not observe that there was a Clause 10, Sub-section 2<i>(a).</i>  So that I think that his case for saying&mdash;or the case that he made out&mdash;that people who had property damaged in O'Connell Street would not get compensation, would scarcely hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that whatever rights and privileges people had under the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts, whatever legal rights they have, that they were scarcely negotiable rights.  The Deputy will probably admit <Col N="1495" /> that.  And these are negotiable rights that are given here under Clause 10, Sub-section 2 <i>(a)</i>, to people who had property in O'Connell Street, and whose property was injured, and who made a claim for reinstatement.  I do not know that it is likely that the purpose that the Deputy has in view would be at all served by restricting the number of members on the Committee considering this Bill. Even in a Party it will be admitted that suggestions come from the humblest members of a Party, which are often valuable additions to any discussions on those matters.  Restricting it to a smaller number would probably eliminate any such suggestions that would come in that way. As a matter of fact, one of the best provisions that there is in this Bill came from suggestions that were made by certain people&mdash;not direct suggestions from them&mdash;but from some of the criticisms that they made, or some of the criticisms that we managed to extract from them. We got one of the best suggestions that there is in the Bill in this way.  It is not exactly what a person would bring to bear on it in Committee, but rather the scope of the suggestions that might come; a thing which, I think, is most essential to the consideration of a very large Bill such as this is.  The question has been raised regarding consequential loss, and a great Press campaign has been started for the payment of consequential loss. But it will be observed that there has been no suggestion whatever given by any of those economists&mdash;and from one direction, at any rate, I suppose the people making the criticism would regard themselves as national economists&mdash;no suggestion has been made of any sort or kind as to where the money is to be raised, or how it is to be raised to meet this Bill.  If people are suffering from the delusion that there is a big balance in the National Exchequer to meet such outgoings as this, the sooner they are corrected in these delusions the better. You can give whatever compensation you wish, but if you are going to give compensation in excess of what is put up here, or even what is payable within the four corners of this Bill, you will have to consider the question of how you are going to get the money to pay that.  I suppose that it is possible to collect a majority of people comprising this State to take claims for consequential losses&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is one of the reasons why I think it ought not be referred to a small Committee&mdash;that the number of people who consider it the more extended it is, the more varied, the particular claims that they have in mind will be urged; and members will see very clearly that it is impossible to table such a Bill as would meet all the cases of claims of compensation.  Another point that was made by the Deputy was, I think, that some greater provision might be inserted in the Bill&mdash;some greater authority given to the Judge in connection with the payment of claims for personal injuries.  I may be wrong, but I think I gathered that was one of the suggestions that was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now a Select Committee considering a question of that kind will have before it the great popularity that would accrue to that Committee&mdash;a small Committee which would be irresponsible, and which would not bind the majority in making such recommendations.  In other words, it is not a question here of roping in every possible interest.  But it is a question of having a certain sum of money to distribute over a certain class of people, and how best to distribute it. That is not best met by a small Committee considering it.  It ought to be by the whole Assembly.  It is a matter for which every Deputy will sooner or later, perhaps, be called upon in his own constituency to answer for, and to make a case for.  Every possible information ought to be at the disposal of every Deputy. If Deputies have received representations from their constituents, it is obvious they would wish to be on this particular Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that it might be possible for this Select Committee to be representative of the Seanad, I would not approve of it.  I do not think it would serve the purpose the Deputy has in mind.  I do not think it would be for the <Col N="1497" /> good of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  I think the consideration of a Bill of this character ought first to be taken here by the House, with the popular view, dealing as fairly and as equitably as possible with all classes of the community, and then submit it to the Seanad, which is composed of a different personnel, and is differently weighted to us.  We could then have their view as to the equitable discharge of the nation's liability to those who have suffered.  I do not know that any case has been made for the reference of this Bill to a Select Committee, and I cannot agree to it.</P>

      <P>I am divided in my thoughts as to whether I should welcome the statement of the Minister, or regret it.  I feel that if it were the intention to have a business-like Bill emerge with a chance of an understandable discussion on disputed questions, the motion should be passed.  I think the Minister is under a misapprehension when he suggests that once the Bill is referred to a Select Committee, non-members of that Committee are precluded from making suggestions, and that once it emerges from this Select Committee, it does not come before the Dáil for discussion on the Committee Stage.  It may quite well do that.  As I say, I am divided as to whether I should welcome the decision of the Minister, because I feel some malicious delight in having the whole question discussed in public.  I think it is well, perhaps, that for the entertainment, if not for the education, of the public, the whole matter should be discussed openly in the Dáil. It will be certainly a less business-like proceeding than would take place if it had gone through a Select Committee in the first instance.  In view of the decision of the Minister, I do not know if the Deputy proposes to press this matter.  If he does so, I shall support him.  If he does not, I shall go away with some feeling of demoniacal delight.</P>

      <P>I think the President would have served the purpose which he had intended in this Bill better I am bound to say, if he had accepted the motion that he has now intimated he will oppose.  I feel that in a matter of this kind there are distinct advantages in having it discussed by the whole Dáil in Committee.  These advantages are obvious.  They are public advantages; but there is a general principle underlying <Col N="1498" /> the committal of a Bill to an Assembly of this kind, or a Select Committee which an Assembly of this kind may appoint.  I take it to be&mdash;and it will generally be found to be&mdash;that Bills are referred to Select Committees rather than to the entire Assembly in Committee, when the nature of them is such that any amendment would involve very technical drafting.  Clearly this is a Bill of that kind.  As regards any amendment intended to be introduced into this Bill, if it were to go before a Committee of the whole Dáil it would be very difficult to get it into such practicable shape as would make the Bill legally watertight. It would be quite easy to do it in a Select Committee across the table where the discussions could be allowed a considerable amount of latitude.  When Deputy Duffy first mentioned to me about moving this, I felt a considerable amount of regret that he intended to move it, much for the same reason that Deputy Johnson has expressed.  There are great public reasons why many of the matters should be discussed in the open Dáil; but the real reasons that should weigh in our minds, apart from public reasons, are reasons of efficiency with a view to obtaining the competent drafting of this Bill.  If certain changes, that are undoubtedly necessary, are to be adopted, they will require a different method of procedure.  That better procedure would have been a Select Committee.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the real effect of the suggestion is meant to be that this should be referred to the <i>intelligentsia</i> of the Dáil, and that the ordinary members of the Dáil should not be regarded as capable of discussing it. There is no advantage that I can see to be gained from the point of view of having a Select Committee, and by having a discussion apparently carried on without any formality or order.  That will simply prolong discussion; it will not aid discussion.  The drafting has to be done by an individual.  Suitable drafting will be best achieved by having the individuals, who want amendments, going carefully into what they want, and how it should be put on paper, and bringing their amendments forward in good and well-considered form before the Dáil. Nothing in the way of good drafting will be got by any looseness or informality. I think, therefore, unless there is a suggestion <Col N="1499" /> that this is a question for the <i>intelligentsia</i> there is no case at all for reference to a Committee.</P>

      <P>The Dáil will always choose its members to put on that Special Committee, and it will choose them because, perhaps, of special qualifications, or the special interest that they take in the Bill.  All the Deputies do not take the same interest in one Bill that they do in another, nor will all be taking the same interest in this Bill. There is one argument which neither Deputy Gavan Duffy, Deputy Figgis, nor anybody else has mentioned, and it seems a big argument in support of referring this Bill to a Special Committee. The argument is that the Special Committee can bring in the Legal Adviser of the Government to assist them in going through the Bill, clause by clause.  The Dáil cannot do that unfortunately; it can only do it through the mouth of a Minister. Like my colleague, Deputy Johnson, I would much prefer, if it were to be merely for public show, that the Bill should be gone through in Committee of the whole Dáil, because we all could make a good deal of propaganda indeed from every single line of the Bill, but that is not our particular desire at the moment at all.  It was a business desire we had in supporting the motion, if it is pressed, because we are inexperienced in all these things.  We have not been engaged in legislation before, and this is one of the first of those Bills which, if I might say so, is real legislation as apart from legislation consequent on the Treaty or something else.  Therefore, we support the motion.</P>

      <P>I would be very pleased if the Government had accepted this motion, but as they have not accepted it it seems to me we should not gain anything by pressing it. It appears quite clear that whatever report may come back from this Select <Col N="1500" /> Committee, if they report against those propositions which the President appears to regard as vital portions of this Bill, we shall have to go back into Committee of the whole Dáil again; we shall have to go back into Committee and to have Party divisions for the purpose of getting rid of those portions of the report of the Select Committee of which the Ministers do not approve.  Now we have it definitely stated here that the real reason for this Bill&mdash;of course, most of us knew it before&mdash;is that there could not be money found to pay all compensation, even all proper compensations, in full, and that, therefore, we must cut our coat according to our cloth, and that some matters, which would be matters of proper compensation in a State that could afford to pay proper compensation, must go by the board.  The Government have made up their mind that certain classes of compensation cannot be met.  If this Bill is referred to a Select Committee, and the Select Committee, as a matter of justice or expediency or anything else, considers that certain classes of compensation, of which the Government do not approve, should be paid in full, and re-draft this Bill or recommend a whole number of amendments in Committee to carry out their views, then when we go back to the Committee of the whole Dáil we are at Party grips again and will have to divide and re-commit the Bill and nothing is gained.  If I believed that the report of the Select Committee would be accepted generally then I should be entirely in favour of referring this Bill to the Select Committee, because I quite agree with the Deputies who said that this is a very technical Bill.  Almost any amendment introduced into it may involve other amendments which will have to be carefully considered.  We will have to take our chance of that, but I am afraid that neither time nor anything else will be gained&mdash;in all probability a great deal of the time of those who serve on the Select Committee will be lost&mdash;if this motion is referred to a Select Committee, except we have general agreement that the conclusions arrived at by the Select Committee will be adopted when the Bill comes up on the Report Stage.  I see no prospect of the acceptance of that proposition. Therefore I think referring it to a Select Committee would be only a waste of time.</P>

      <P>If the President has definitely made up his mind that he will not have a select Committee, I agree with Deputy Fitzgibbon that there is no use in my pressing the motion to a division, because you must have the good-will of the majority of all concerned.  But I appeal at the eleventh hour to the President, who himself, it seems to me, needs the services of a Select Committee, or else he cannot have read the Bill very carefully. He talked to us about O'Connell Street. If he reads the Section he will see that what I said originally was right, that the Section he quoted only applies to ordinary criminal injuries, and not rebellion injuries, and that no compensation would be paid if the damage was done by the Army.  I ask the President to give a little further consideration to the question of referring this matter to a Select Committee, in view of the fact that there is support in all quarters of the Dáil for that suggestion.  I am not going to press the motion.  It is useless to have a Select Committee, unless those concerned are willing to try to come to some arrangement by that method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept this amendment.  It was felt that it would be very desirable to get rid of postal voting altogether, but that in the case of members of the Defence Force of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;especially at the present time&mdash;they ought not be deprived of the right of voting, and if they were allowed to vote otherwise than by post we might have the undue influence on the result of an election that the movement of a large garrison into a particular place would have.  Consequently, there was no other way of dealing with them than by allowing postal voting.  But there could not be any better case made out for the members of a ship's crew than for many other classes of people who might be absent at the time of an election, and who might be unable to vote.  The number affected will be so small that we do not think it is desirable to introduce or to extend this principle of postal voting to people other than members of the Defence Forces.  The numbers affected can seldom have any influence on the result of an election. There is, as we feel, no logical reason for allowing members, say, of a ship's crew, and not other people, who might be absent from a constituency on business on the day of an election, to vote. It is a matter of very small consequence, but it is opening the door, and would lead to proper demands from further classes to be put on the postal voters' list, with the result that the object we <Col N="1504" /> had in view, to abolish postal voting, except for one particular class, would be defeated.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having accepted this amendment, but I think the words used in the new sub-section are susceptible of a little improvement.  There is to be only one voters' list in the University and that one should be a postal voters' list, whereas the wording implies the possibility of another&mdash;&ldquo;The name of every elector in a University constituency shall be entered on the postal voters' list for that constituency.&rdquo; The intention is that there shall be only one voters' list and that a postal voters' list, and that the name of every elector in the University constituency shall be entered <Col N="1505" /> on such list.  It could be amended by keeping the present words and adding &ldquo;And there shall be no other list.&rdquo; I suggest that it requires some alteration. It takes the present form because of what was deleted in the last clause. This is dictated by the desire to supply the deficiency set up by the last deletion.

The object of the amendment is to have the other Under-sheriff appointed to act in his own county as deputy returning officer for such duties as the returning <Col N="1506" /> officer may not have to do personally.

      <P>Before proceeding with this I would just like to raise a question of order.  This introduces what is practically a new principle, and I submit that it is hardly within the spirit at least of the Standing Order to submit this on the Report Stage.  The Minister has considered it not at all necessary to re-commit the Bill for consideration in Committee, but this is a clause which would necessitate consideration in Committee, and if it were passed the possibility of amending it ought to be given <Col N="1510" /> to the Dáil.  I just raise a question as to whether it is in order to move an amendment of this kind raising an entirely new proposition at the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The amendment does not introduce a new principle I think, but it adds to the category of persons who are disqualified from filling a certain position, and just as we have accepted the amendment to increase the class who would be possible voters I think we can accept this amendment as well.  It adds a certain class of people to these disqualified but I think pending a more explicit Standing Order than we have at present it is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is practically the same as that of some of the sub-sections of 51. It is for the purpose of keeping the Dáil clear from certain charges that might be laid against it.  For instance we are keeping out an undischarged bankrupt because we think that while there may be genuine misfortune and nothing else, still there are people who have defaulted, and it is undesirable, and would not add to the honour or to the reputation of the Dáil, if any undischarged bankrupts should be members of the Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now a member of a local authority who misuses or causes to be misused, or mis-spends public money, seems to us to be equally deserving of being put upon this list with the undischarged bankrupt.  Up till recently the operations of the surcharge did serve, to some degree, to safeguard the interests of the ratepayer in any particular locality.  It prevented the illegal spending of public money.  But there are often people, members of public boards, who cannot be made to pay the amount of a surcharge and who know that they cannot really personally be made responsible for the amounts that have been struck out by the Auditor, and are quite regardless of any censure that is implied in the effect of a surcharge.  In the past people felt it an honour, sometimes it was regarded as a local honour, to be surcharged.  It was regarded as quite in the game to defeat the law, because that was regarded as part of the plan to defeat an alien authority.  Now, in the future it would be undesirable, from <Col N="1511" /> the public point of view, that that outlook should persist.  It would be undesirable that people should regard it as proper to break the law, and proper and commendable to be able to avoid the consequences of breaking the law.  The rule for the future should be, if the law is wrong and the central administration is bad, to take the proper steps to alter the law and to improve the central administration, but it is very undesirable that there should be among public representatives, or any section of them, a spirit to defeat and defy the law.  We will have to assume in this Assembly, and must assume, that for the future the law will be equitable; that the administration of the law, so far as it concerns the central authority, will be in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil, and will be in accordance with the wishes and desires of the people If that be assumed, and it seems to be the proper thing to assume, then the person who is breaking the law and makes himself responsible for improper payments, and avoids facing his responsibility of paying the amount of the surcharge, should be regarded as one whose public conduct has been contrary to the interests of order, and as one who is equally entitled to be disqualified with, say, an undischarged bankrupt.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  I do not think that it can be regarded as too severely penal.  It cannot be regarded as too drastic, certainly in the case of a person who is conscious that his own goods are not to be seized, and who has made suitable arrangements that nothing of his can be taken possession of, and who, being aware of that immunity, proceeds to spend public money of which he is only trustee, in a way that is improper and illegal.</P>

      <P>The Minister will find if he reads and understands the Sub-section as it is printed here, that it is completely spoiled.  The blemish is a slight one, as it happens to be a full-stop after the word &ldquo;paid&rdquo; in the first paragraph of the new sub-section, and the result is that the remainder of the clause is unintelligible.  The intention is that where any member of a local authority is surcharged, and where the sum so <Col N="1512" /> surcharged or charged shall not have been paid within one month after the date on which the charge is made, or in cases where an appeal is pending but by the full-stop occurring after the word &ldquo;paid&rdquo; in the first paragraph <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> being put in paragraphs, Sub-clause <i>(a)</i> is left absolutely without meaning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the clause is of a different character.  I object to the new sub-section because it is striking at a body of people that we have a right to assume have gone into local public life with a clean and honest intent, just as the Minister says we have a right to assume that the administration of the law will be honest and clean in intent. It seems to me that the Minister has very little faith in the future public life of this country, because what seems to be dominating his mind is that people are always going to be scheming and conspiring to do dirty things in public administration and legislation.  There have been instances, I have no doubt, where local Councillors have done what the Minister suggested, divested themselves of all their property rights and then paid away money which they had no right to pay.  But there have been very many more instances where members of public authorities have been surcharged for paying away moneys illegally without intent to do so, and with no deliberate purpose of defrauding or of maladministration. This clause penalises these men.  And there have been many other cases where moneys have been paid, and where men have made themselves liable to surcharge for a good public purpose and for the purpose of drawing attention to evils and forcing the Legislature to amend the law. But one of the evils of this proposal is that the Minister himself, who is a political appointment, retains to himself the right to veto the rights of certain citizens to attend this Dáil. It is not right that the Minister who is the nominee of a political body should have in his hands the power of saying that so-and-so because of a certain misdemeanour&mdash;if it is assumed to be a misdemeanour&mdash;shall not have the right to be elected and take his seat in the Legislature.  This amendment retains in the hands of a political Minister a right to prevent a possible opponent taking his seat.  He is judge and prosecutor at the <Col N="1513" /> same time.  That is not a fair position for him to adopt.  There is another objection to this clause.  It is assumed that the people who will aspire to membership of the Dáil are in a different category from those aspiring to be members of the Seanad, or, alternatively, it is assumed that the character of the Seanad does not matter, because it is not intended that this disability will apply to membership of the Seanad.  I think no case has been made out for adding to the number of disabilities.  I think that this particular insertion coming so late rather suggests an afterthought determined by certain local events in connection with the Dublin Corporation. Now, it is not desirable, I think, to build up legislation on transient events of that kind, and, where matters of great principle may be involved, to prevent men who are imbued by principle from having a right to take a seat in the legislature. In so doing they are overriding the intention of the Constitution.  I would urge that this clause should be withdrawn, and if it is not withdrawn we should not agree to its insertion.</P>

      <P>I see one very great weakness in the clause; that is, payments are frequently made which are technically illegal, but for which there is some equitable justification.  This clause, if adopted, might have the effect of placing members of the Dáil at the mercy of a Minister who might not choose to exercise fairly his equitable jurisdiction in remitting their surcharges, and for that reason, because I feel there is that weakness in the clause&mdash;although from other points of view such a clause is very necessary, and might perhaps be incorporated in law when further reforms have taken place&mdash;I am not inclined to press it.</P>

The Minister may recollect that he replied very vigorously in refutation of the case set up by Deputy Johnson in favour of another amendment.  I took the liberty of pointing out to him that his argument was destructive to this and the President agreed&mdash;not publicly, but as I understood from his apparent communication with the Minister.  I was under the impression&mdash;and I think the Official Report will bear me out&mdash;that it was agreed then to give no permission, so that it would thus read: &ldquo;a person either temporarily or permanently in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; The proposal to give him permission is just as objectionable as the contrary proposal. My recollection is subject, of course, to correction by the Official Report, which unfortunately I have not got.</P>

      <P>The Minister on the occasion of our discussing an amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson, gave a great number of reasons why a member of the Civil Service&mdash;especially of the higher Civil Service&mdash;engaged in an administrative position, should not aspire to Parliamentary honours, because he would have to canvass, and would have to cultivate the favour of some electorate, and in doing so it would be necessary for him to criticise his own official superiors, and either to praise or blame the policy of the Ministry, in whose employment he was at the time.  The Minister dilated very effectively upon the evil results of that being allowed, and unless he has changed his mind very considerably in the interval, I presume he sees himself that it is a highly undesirable thing that in the higher Civil Service the possibility should be provided for what would destroy discipline, and might really be conducive to the dislocation of some policy of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general substance of the objection made by Deputy Magennis was one that I am in agreement with.  I have felt the force of the argument that all grades of the Civil Service, except the very highest, should be able to discharge national duties of being public representatives, but whatever the argument be, either for or against that, the Minister, when the matter was proposed here, brought forward arguments very strongly against the principle.  I do not go into that now.  I say either it is right or wrong, but surely it must be wrong to allow a rule, which is nevertheless made a rule, to be set aside in one or two specific instances, according to the terms of employment, that a particular Minister might wish to accord to certain members of the Civil Service?  That is really what it comes to.  It means that, let us say, in a hypothetical case, in the future, there may happen to be a Ministry that desires to get people into the Civil Service, and to let them discharge duties in the Legislature, who could easily make it possible for that to be done&mdash;while it is undesirable that it should be done in that form&mdash; by allowing their employment to contain a specific clause or a covering letter to that effect.  If it is going to be done at all it should be done in a more careful <Col N="1516" /> way than allowing the ordinary conditions of a man's employment to allow him to be a member of Dáil Eireann, while excluding all his colleagues from that by right of their office.</P>

      <P>There is another side to this picture.  There may be a very big body of men who would be technically Civil Servants, who ought to be by the terms of their appointment eligible to become members.  It is quite conceivable that we should follow the example of well-governed countries, and allow men or women who may be Civil Servants to become members of the Legislature; to suspend the actual period of their service to become members of the Legislature. That may well be made a condition of the terms of their employment, but the opponents of this sub-section are assuming that this had special reference to individual cases.  I would think it is more likely to have reference to a body rather than an individual.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Every registration officer, returning officer, presiding officer, clerk or other person having duties in connection with the registration of electors, or the conduct of any election, who is guilty of any wilful or grossly negligent misfeasance or any wilful or grossly negligent act or omission in contravention of this Act shall, in addition to any other liability to which he may be subject, be liable on prosecution by the Minister for <Col N="1519" /> Local Government in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to forfeit to Saorstát Eireann such penal sum not exceeding £100, as the Court before whom such prosecution shall come shall consider just.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This has been introduced for the purpose of incorporating the three sections which have been deleted.  It is the one section remaining which imposes penalties. In the second part of it it deals with cases where things go wrong on account of negligence; that is, it deals with a person guilty of any wilful or grossly negligent act in contravention of this Act.  That, I think, would cover a person who negligently failed to stamp ballot papers or anything of that nature.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;2. (1) For the purposes of the preparation of the first register prepared under this Act the registration officer shall send the prescribed form of claim to each person who appears to him to be entitled to have his name entered on that register.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2)  For the purposes of the preparation of each register after the first register prepared under this Act the registration officer shall send the prescribed form of claim to each person who appears to him to be entitled to have his name entered on that register other than and except:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a)  Any person whose name is entered on the register then in force, and is shown to the satisfaction of the registration officer to be ordinarily resident and occupying business premises (if any) at the addresses recorded by such person with the registration officer; and</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(b)  any person who has elected not not to be registered in that constituency.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3)  It shall be the duty of the registration officer to record any change of address communicated to him by any elector whose name appears on the register for the time being in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(4)  The principal Postmaster in each constituency, other than a University Constituency, shall, at the request of the registration officer of a University Constituency, ascertain and state to such registration officer whether any elector whose name appears on the register for that University Constituency in force on the 15th day of November, <Col N="1523" /> is on that day ordinarily resident and occupying business premises (if any) at the addresses recorded by such elector with the registration officer.  The statement of a principal Postmaster under this section shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matters stated therein but the Postmaster shall not be liable to any person for or on account of any inaccuracy in such statement.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment 40 was put in in response to the points raised by Deputy Professor Thrift.  The purpose is to secure that there shall be as good representation as possible on the University Register every year.  In the past, I think, University Registers have not been well revised and the names of people who have long been dead have continued on them.  I think that this is about the best that can be done in the circumstances.  The Postmasters in each Constituency will certify whether the people whose names are on the register in that constituency continue to reside at the addresses given.</P>

In County Mayo it was possible, having regard to the population, to make a division, and I have put the amendment on the paper.  Personally I think there is nothing in favour of it.  I simply put it down because the majority of the Committee and the Mayo Deputies, who were present, thought it is desirable.  In my opinion it would achieve no good result. The constituencies which it would provide would be large and scattered, but I leave it to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only reason why Mayo was picked out was that certain of the local Deputies who were on this Committee desired that it should be divided.  As I say, I am unable myself to put forward any good reason for it.  On the other hand, I do not want personally to stand up against any local feeling in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, because I think that 4 or 5 to be elected is quite enough.  It is too confusing otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. W. SEARS Mr. W. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very thing I wish to point out.  We thought that 9 would be too large a number on the ballot papers, and that it would confuse the electors.  We considered that before we should increase the area we should teach the electors to creep before they walk, to vote on the small areas before they have got a very large area.  Besides, <Col N="1529" /> in considering a particular constituency itself it is difficult to get men who are known from one end of the place to the other.  I think the original intention of those who brought forward Proportional Representation was that you would find a number of men in an area who would all be known.  If you put forward nine local men in an area like that the man would not be known over the whole area, and you would have a patchwork election, where each man would be supported by his own area.  It was not the original intention of those who urged Proportional Representation at all.  I agree with the Minister that in the final counting it would come to the same thing, but let us teach the electors to know what they are doing.  They will not know what they are doing if you make the area too large.  The Minister for Local Government might go to the electors and say it all boiled down to the one thing, but that is not good enough; let him understand it himself; he would not understand it if the area were too large.  I submit he would know all about it if you commence with a moderate area first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am with Deputy Sears.  It is quite possible that where you are electing nine members you would have 27 or 30 on the ballot papers.  It is more a job, I think, for a University man than for an ordinary elector.  You want certainly a man of some education at least to make a choice between 27 or 30 candidates.  I think nine is too many if you are going to give Proportional Representation effect.  What happens is the elector will vote for two or three, and he certainly will not go down to 29 or 30, and the exercise of preference will not get any show at all.</P>
