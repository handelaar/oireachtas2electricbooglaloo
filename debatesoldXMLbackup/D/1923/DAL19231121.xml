      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in what Department the management of the Curragh of Kildare is vested, and if he will order a return showing the annual expenditure in the way of administration and the payment of salaries to Rangers and others; the number of persons employed and with whom their appointment lies; also the amount of revenue derived from the Turf Club and other sources.</P>

      <P>The management of the Curragh is vested by Statute in the Ranger, whose appointment lies with the Minister for Finance and who is an unpaid officer. Certain functions in connection with the management are discharged by a paid Deputy Ranger and Bailiffs, who have such powers and duties as the Government, with the advice of the Ranger, from time to time, think fit to direct.  The Bailiffs are appointed by the Ranger or Deputy Ranger.</P>
      <P>The expenditure, which includes the salaries of the Deputy Ranger and four Bailiffs, amounts to approximately £715 a year.  The annual rents receivable are £530, of which the Turf Club pays £47.  The rent of the Stand House, etc., is £1 a year, increasing to £50 at the 25th March, 1925.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is aware that a farm, belonging to Mr. I.C. Gibson, Rathwalkin, Kildare, situate at Ballykin, Geashill, Offaly, consisting of 120 Irish acres, and which has been in possession of the Gibson family for 70 years, was forcibly seized by a number of persons from the locality in the months of July and August, 1922; whether they drove off his stock, removed gates, threw down fences, and dismantled the two-storied dwelling house, unroofing it, and carrying away doors, windows, etc.; whether these persons drove in their own cattle, which are still grazing on the lands; whether Mr. Gibson's claim for compensation is still in abeyance, although he has had to pay all rates and charges without having derived any income whatever from the farm from the time of the seizure; whether the Land Commission <Col N="986" /> will forego payment of arrears until the claim for compensation is heard, and if said arrears will be included in the amount awarded; whether the Minister can explain the failure of the local police authorities to deal with a case of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The trespass of cattle on the lands belonging to Mr. I. C. Gibson was brought to notice last June.  It transpired that no fences existed and that neighbouring farmers could not be blamed for accidental trespass.  Mr. Gibson was, therefore, advised to fence his lands when police support would be afforded to him to prevent any further trespass, but he took no action in this direction.  He subsequently complained that a number of his gates had been stolen.  Inquiries were instituted by the Gárda Síochána with the result that one of the gates was traced.  Proceedings were instituted against persons in whose premises it was found, but before the hearing of the case Mr. Gibson wrote to the sergeant stating that he was not anxious to proceed with the matter and requesting that no further action should be taken.  In the circumstances the Gárda Síochána withdrew the charge.  The task of the Civil Authorities in such cases is rendered exceedingly difficult by the unwillingness of such persons as Mr. Gibson to render any assistance.  It is open to him to take proceedings against any person whom he finds trespassing, when the forces of the State will be used to carry out any order made by Court.</P>
      <P>Questions regarding the payment of compensation and the remission of Land Commission arrears should be addressed to the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, respectively.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the Black and Tans, whilst in occupation of the Boys' and Girls' School at Ballinalee, Co. Longford, burned the furniture and destroyed the fittings of those schools; whether the schools had but two years previously been re-furnished by Grant from the Education Board, along with local aid; whether the Shaw Commission had refused to consider the case as one for compensation for damage; whether the present building used as a school has been reported on as &ldquo;insanitary and unsafe;&rdquo; whether he will urge the Minister for Finance to make an immediate grant for the repairing and re-opening of the schools.</P>

      <P>(1) The British Military Forces occupied the Ballinalee Schoolhouse from November, 1920, to May, 1921.  They injured the building and did considerable injury to the school furniture.</P>
      <P>(2)  Forty-two dual desks and six long seats were supplied in 1917 with the aid of a State grant of two-thirds of the cost.</P>
      <P>(3)  This Department is aware that application was made by the Manager to the Shaw Commission for compensation, but no official intimation has been received as to the result.</P>
      <P>(4)  The temporary premises (Teacher's residence) in which the school is being conducted is not regarded as suitable for school work.  The ventilation is defective, but the building has not otherwise been reported to be &ldquo;insanitary and unsafe.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  The question of repairing and remodelling the Ballinalee Schoolhouse has already received attention in this Department.  The cost of the works regarded as necessary is estimated at £425, but the Manager is not <Col N="988" /> prepared to provide the local quota of the cost, viz., one-third, in view of his claim for compensation in respect of damage done to the building, and this Department is not, therefore, in a position to sanction a grant in the case.</P>
    <P>It is understood that representations in regard to the non-settlement by the British Government of the claim for damages to the Schoolhouse and equipment have been made by the Manager to the Minister of Finance, and that the matter is under the consideration of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that in the ex-soldiers' settlement at Killester, Co. Dublin, there are upwards of 500 children, who are nearly two miles from the nearest school, and whether he will take steps to provide a school for these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that there are nearly 500 children of school-going age in the Killester area, of whom nearly 300 are at present attending the neighbouring schools at Clontarf, Artane, Raheny, Green Lanes, Howth Road, Marino, and various schools in the city.</P>
      <P>Apart from Green Lanes and Howth Road National Schools, the attendance of these children at the neighbouring National Schools has had the effect of considerably overcrowding these schools, whilst a large number of children from this area are not, so far, attending any school.  There is undoubtedly necessity for the erection of a suitable school in the Killester neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>Such a school, if built for, say, 500 children, would, under present conditions, cost £12,000 or upwards, one-third of which, say, £4,000, would, under the regulations, have normally to be borne by the locality, the balance, £8,000, being provided by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty in the matter will be understood when it is considered that this balance of £8,000 represents one-third of the total grants which the Ministry of Finance consider could be allowed for the current financial year <Col N="989" /> for the erection of schools under the jurisdiction of the Free State.  The question, however, as to what can be done for the school children in this growing area is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>Miss Dunne, who has been acting in a temporary capacity as an Auxiliary Postwoman, has no claim to employment as an Auxiliary or to any particular route, and she was given the three day walk with the reduced wages attaching to it.</P>
      <P>Since the change of her duties Miss Dunne ceased to be insurable under the National Health Insurance Acts, as persons paid under an allowance who are employed for not more than eighteen hours a week on the delivery or collection of letters are exempt from Insurance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government, whether, in view of the recent outbreak of smallpox in England, and the arrival from there at the Port of Cobh last week, of a person so affected, he will consider the necessity of enforcing the provisions of the Vaccination Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Seumas de Burca)</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity of enforcing the provisions of the Vaccination Acts in this country has never been overlooked.  The duty of enforcing these Acts is one, in the first instance, for the Board of Guardians in counties in which amalgamation of Unions has not been carried out, and for the Rural District Councils in other counties.  During the recent troubles vaccination was somewhat neglected in certain districts of An Saorstát, but with the return of more settled conditions the duty and necessity of securing compliance with the existing Acts <Col N="991" /> has been consistently urged on the authorities, in most instances successfully.</P>
      <P>It became clear last autumn, with the increasing prevalence of small-pox in England, that this country must be prepared to face a possible invasion of the disease.  Warning was accordingly given to the Medical Officers of the ports and of the other principal districts having cross-Channel lines of communication.  These officers are also supplied week by week with summarised details of the known incidence of small-pox.  The vaccination authorities throughout Saorstát Eireann were advised of the danger and were urged to activity in carrying out primary vaccination.</P>
      <P>In one or two districts the number of vaccination defaulters is still unduly high, but the matter is being carefully watched.  If the local authorities fail to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of the public health of their district, the necessary steps will be taken to compel them to do so.</P>
      <P>On the 10th instant the Ministry was informed of a suspected case of small-pox in Cobh.  On the same date a definite diagnosis was asked for and instructions as to precautions were sent. On the 12th it was reported to be a definite case.  On the following day a Medical Inspector of the Ministry visited Cobh, investigated the case, and took all necessary precautionary measures.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government <Col N="992" /> whether he is aware of the fact that the salaries of each of the three Medical Officers in the Clonakilty Rural District have been recently increased by approximately £40 per annum; whether such increase has the sanction of the Local Government Department; and whether, if the answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative, in view of the economic condition of the Saorstát, and the policy of retrenchment advocated by the Government, the Minister considers it desirable that local authorities should be permitted to grant such increases when the general tendency at the moment is to effect economies in all branches of the public service.</P>

      <P>The Board of Guardians of Clonakilty Union after due notice to each member adopted a proposal to grant a scale salary of £250 a year by annual increments of £10 a year to a maximum of £350 a year to each of their three Dispensary Medical Officers, and after careful consideration a scale salary for the officers in question of £200 a year by annual increments of £10 to £300 a year was sanctioned.</P>
      <P>Every proposal of this nature is carefully investigated before a decision is given.  It was found that the existing scale salaries of the Dispensary Medical Officers in Clonakilty Union were not adequate to the responsible nature of the duties, and the area, population, and character of the districts of which they had charge.</P>
      <P>While the economic condition of the Saorstát and the policy of retrenchment advocated by the Government are of paramount importance, the health of the community must be safeguarded. To ensure this it is essential that proper provision is made for the competent discharge of the duties of Dispensary Medical Officers.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree that there has been an almost total failure of the potato crop this season.  In some districts the crop is one of the worst for a number of years, but in most districts the returns, though less than that of the exceptionally heavy crop of last year, are quite up to the average of the previous five years.  Areas in which there is a shortage of seed in the spring should have no difficulty in procuring supplies from neighbouring districts.  I am, however, prepared, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, to consider the desirability of making loans to local bodies for seed supply schemes as was done in previous years, if it is demonstrated that these loans are necessary.</P>

      <P>The application of Mr. McKeon was disallowed after due investigation on the ground that the extent of dependence which in the case of an unmarried soldier is taken to be the amount normally contributed by him to his home over and above the cost (if any) of his own maintenance therein for a reasonable period prior to enlistment was less than the minimum specified by regulations, namely, 12/- per week, before an allowance may be issued.  It was, in fact, about 10/- per week.  It should be stated, however, that the regulations are based on the recognition of an obligation on the part of an unmarried soldier to contribute to the support of his dependents a reasonable portion of his Army pay, this portion being calculated at 8/- per week in the case of a soldier receiving the ordinary rate of pay.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the Orders of the Day, may I ask, a Chinn Chomhairle, whether a request has been received by you from the Town Clerk, or from the Lord Mayor of Dublin, with a view to appearing here and presenting a petition to this Dáil, and if so, what is the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a letter has been sent to me by the Town Clerk of Dublin, enclosing a copy of a resolution passed by the Municipal Council of Dublin, asking me to make the necessary arrangements to have the Lord Mayor of Dublin appear at the Bar of the Dáil, accompanied by the Town Clerk, the Law Agent, his Lordship's officers of state, and members of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no procedure at present in the Dáil for allowing any person to come to the Dáil to present a petition, and I have had the Town Clerk of Dublin acquainted of that fact.  The question of presenting a petition to the Dáil has not yet been considered, and while <Col N="999" /> it is clear that a Deputy would have the right to present a petition himself it would require a special arrangement by the Dáil, either in general or in a particular case, to allow any person, other than a Deputy, to come and present a petition to the Dáil, on behalf of himself or of any other persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the urgency of this matter, I would ask your guidance on it.  If I were to give notice to-day and put down a motion, similar to that which was carried in another Parliament, allowing this right to the Dublin Corporation, would it be considered on Friday?  This is Wednesday, and if I were to give notice to-day would it be in time?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne consulted me about this matter yesterday, and I explained the situation to him, so that his notice is really, technically, since yesterday.  I would be prepared, if the Dáil agrees, to allow the motion to go forward on the Order Paper for consideration in Private Members' time on Friday.  The motion would be in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Right Hon, the Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin be admitted to present a petition from the Lord Mayor and Corporation of the said City at the Bar of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of your answers, a Chinn Chomhairle, to Deputy Byrne, you said that a Deputy himself would have the right to present a petition.  I did not know that that matter had been considered any more than the other, and I would think, and suggest to the Dáil, that that is a matter that ought to be dealt with by the Procedure and Privileges Committee, even before the right of the Deputy to present a petition is acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner and the method of presentation, I think, should be considered by the Committee on Privileges, and Standing Orders drawn up in the matter.  What I meant to convey was, that it might be taken for granted that, under certain conditions, and when certain arrangements had been made, the right would be accorded to Deputies to present petitions, but that the question of a person <Col N="1000" /> not a Deputy presenting a petition would require the special sanction of the Dáil.  I shall bring the matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that this matter will be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before the motion will be dealt with on Friday?  I take it that the basis of this claim is a claim which the late Henry Grattan secured from the British Parliament after the Act of Union had been passed.  As such, it has to my mind certain unsavoury recommendations in its favour, and I do not think it has ever been suggested by anybody that this country got any real advantages out of the Act of Union.  If that be the claim for urgency, I would not be inclined to give this matter very grave consideration.  If, on the other hand, the subject matter of the petition itself be the claim for urgency, we ought to have that defined, because I submit that there is no claim for urgency under the second head, and, as regards the first, I suggest it is faulty. Therefore, I do not see how the question of urgency arises at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be well to get that matter cleared up. The resolution which has been sent to me is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this Council, in the exercise of its ancient privilege of appearing at the Bar of the Commons, requests the Lord Mayor to make the necessary arrangements to present the petition (at present being signed in the City Hall, requesting the release of all the political prisoners) at the Bar of An Dáil, and that he be accompanied by the Town Clerk, Law Agent, His Lordship's Officers of State and the Members of the Council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think it necessary to advert to what is termed the &ldquo;ancient privilege,&rdquo; because, as the President has stated, by resolution passed by the British House of Commons in 1813, the Corporation of Dublin was given the right of appearing, through its Lord Mayor, at the Bar of the House and of presenting petitions.  Under that resolution, the Dublin Corporation has no <Col N="1001" /> right whatever to appear before Dáil Eireann, and that privilege, in so far as it existed, is not a privilege against Dáil Eireann, and cannot be exercised by virtue of that resolution.  I think that is clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, therefore, that that matter will not be discussed or urged.  The urgency which Deputy Byrne spoke of, I take it, relates to the subject matter of the petition rather than to the assertion of that claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I would have to enter an objection, because I do not consider, as I have said before, that any useful public purpose is served by dragging the sufferings of these unfortunate hunger strikers before the notice of the public.  It is done with one object alone, and that is to keep the unfortunate dupes still on hunger strike.  I think it is cruel, inhuman, and unworthy of any citizen of this State to persist in such action, and as such it would have my most strenuous opposition.</P>

      <P>The motion that Deputy Byrne proposes to place before the Dáil would have reference only to a matter of whether we will or will not accord to the Municipal Council of Dublin a certain privilege. The discussion on that motion would not involve any discussion on the question of political prisoners or on the subject matter of any petition now under consideration or to be in future considered.  If objection is taken to the fact that the motion has not got sufficient notice, it must go over to next Wednesday, but the matter which would be discussed on Friday would not be the question of prisoners, but the question of privilege.</P>

Subject to your discretion, we have the right to receive any Notice of Motion, and that is the only question, I submit, that we have before us.

      <P>I would suggest that the Deputy should withdraw his motion. Coming forward at this particular time, it is simply brought forward with one object.  A large number of unfortunate men are on hunger strike.  These men who are on hunger strike, consider, in the first place, that the hunger strike was a disaster from the point of view of <Col N="1003" /> their policy, and in the second place, that it should be called off.  The only effect of this motion, if it is brought before the Dáil, and if it is to lie over until Friday, will be to pin down, by a sense of honour, men who are already suffering very severely, and to keep them suffering for another day or two when they themselves are perfectly convinced that they cannot achieve anything by a hunger strike, and who consider that those who were responsible for putting them on hunger strike should order them off and give them a chance of saving themselves from more suffering.</P>

Only last week he was with us, and now he is no more.  Deputy Derham has been associated with public life for a great number of years.  He entered the national movement at a meeting which was addressed by the O'Rahilly, Dr. Hayes, and the late Thomas Ashe in Balbriggan.  During the struggle for independence of this country his family and himself have contributed their share of suffering and privation, and I think it is due to his memory and, I believe I am expressing the opinions of every Deputy here when I say that we should join in sending his family a tribute of respect in their great grief.</P>
      <P>All the Deputies present then rose in their places.</P>

      <P>I desire to move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To move for a return showing:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the number of Inspectors, medical and lay, respectively, employed either by the late Local Government Board of Ireland or by the Local Government Department of the Free State in the years 1914, 1920, and at the present time;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  the salaries paid to such Inspectors, medical and lay, respectively, in the same years and at the present time; and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand this is a matter that ordinarily, until this present moment, would have been put forward by way of a question, but it now takes place by way of a motion for a return.  It explains itself and requires no support by way of explanation from me.  There is one matter I would like to raise in that connection, and it is this&mdash;I take it that a return of this sort, to use a <Col N="1005" /> time honoured phrase, would be laid on the table of the House.  May I suggest it would be available in a more convenient form for Deputies if the return in question were to be printed either for circulation amongst Deputies or else printed in the official debates.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this motion has been seconded. Is it a matter of accommodation?  Because I perceive that any comparison between a certain position, say in the years 1914, 1920 and at present, may be used, as such information has been used in the past, not in the interests of truth, and certainly not in the real interests of the country.  I would welcome a return showing the position at the time of the signing of the Treaty or at the time of taking over by the Provisional Government, or at the first of April, 1922, comparing the staffs and expenditure then, with the staffs and expenditure now.  I say that it does not appear to me that any useful public purpose is served by giving information for such years as 1914 and 1920.  It affords opportunities for attacking the administration now on grounds that are not fair and are not just, and in the knowledge of persons making these charges they are neither just nor fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in a paper last week&mdash;I think it was the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;&mdash;a statement <Col N="1006" /> by a member of the Dáil that this was an extravagant Government and an extravagant State.  We were told that the Army in this State cost twice what the Belgian Army cost in 1914 and 1916, and half what the British Army cost in 1914.  He might as well just have told us that it was costing three times the amount to run this country than it cost the old Irish Parliament to run it, or four times the amount.  He might have said our national debt was greater than it was at the time of the Union.  Arguments such as those used by a person who has no knowledge, or an unbalanced knowledge, of his subject certainly reflects no credit on the person who uses the argument, and does not beget any real confidence in the people of the State. In asking for a return, such as Deputy Figgis has asked for here, one should at least give us some reason for the information that is required.  Some reason ought to be given as to why Departments of the State should rummage through the archives left by the British Government, and some tangible excuse ought to be given for an attempt to fill the Deputy's library other than merely moving the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new arrangement by which a Deputy moves for a return instead of asking a question which involves a very lengthy reply.  I ascertained before putting this motion on the Paper that it would not be opposed by the Minister.  I therefore took it for granted that it would be an unopposed motion, that the Deputy would simply move it, and that the Minister would promise to make the return, and that would be enough.  For that reason, I put it first on the Order Paper after the questions.  If it were opposed and became a subject of debate, I would put it down for the present as a motion by a private member, to be discussed in the time allotted to private members' business, pending some better arrangement, suggested by the suitable Committee.  I understood the matter was to go through without debate.  If it must be debated it must be debated at some other time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned I was bringing the observations I had to make to a close, and I have little to add to what I then said.  I would like, however, to make one comment upon the danger of superficial criticism in an Assembly of this kind.  This is not an assembly in which mere chance-points of a debating society should be made on a serious topic such as this Bill undoubtedly is, chance remarks and debating points which are afterwards seized by newspapers and emblazoned as if they were gospel for the edification of the public. I have in mind two or three such criticisms in particular.  Deputy Redmond, for instance, in his remarks, referred to the position of the Army and of the Commander-in-Chief.  He says: &ldquo;As far as I am aware, and I have a little army experience, there is only one Commander-in-Chief in this country according to our Constitution, and that is the King,&rdquo; and so on.  Now, if Deputy Redmond, instead of depending upon the empirical knowledge acquired during his little experiences of the Army, had studied the matter, he would have discovered that what he was stating was not constitutionally accurate.  It is a fact that in the early portion of the 19th century, the late Queen Victoria and her predecessors were titulary commanders-in-chief of the army.  In the middle of the 19th century the command-in-chief of the army was delegated, and so remained in a soldier officer until just after the <Col N="1008" /> Boer War.  I think the last person who held that delegated command-in-chief was Lord Roberts.  I do not think Deputy Redmond's little army experience was gained prior to 1904.  He might have been misled if it had, but after the reorganisation of the British Army after the Boer War, the office of commander-in-chief was abolished, so far as the British Army was concerned. This really shows the danger of making those chance observations of half-baked knowledge gained, one does not know how, in an officers' mess, or so on.  I would suggest to him he should now study our Constitution, and the Constitution of our co-equal Dominions upon this subject, and his knowledge would be considerably extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way he speaks with a similar kind of empirical knowledge, gained during a little experience of Parliamentary life elsewhere, when he says that he there discovered that the Attorney-General was a mere legal officer I would also suggest to him to correct the knowledge which he gained, whether by constant attendance within the House or in its precincts, by a study of, say, Anson's standard work on the British Constitution, and he will find a great deal indeed to learn upon the subject of the position of the Attorney-General under the British Constitution, and he can pursue his studies still further in some of the leading textbooks on Dominion Constitutions.  Deputy Cooper presents his matter so agreeably that one does not at first sight see whether he, too, is guilty of these kinds of superficial points.  But Deputy Cooper's standing is such that he is quoted as an authority, and I find certain observations of his made here on the last day exhibited in the manner which I believe Pressmen call &ldquo;framing&rdquo; in the pages of one of our leading journals.  It is headed: &ldquo;Inflated Cabinets: How Ireland compared with other countries.  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, had all a less number of Ministers than are in our Government. The Deputy also referred to the fact that in Canada they had not an Attorney-General, but they had a Minister of Justice.&rdquo;  These observations were entirely superficial and unsound.  The Deputy totted up the Ministers of the <Col N="1009" /> Federal Government of Canada, entirely losing sight of the fact that there is a complete Executive Government in each of the provinces of Canada; he totted up the Ministries in Australia, entirely losing sight of the fact that each of the Australian States has its own Executive Ministers.  South Africa is somewhat differently constituted, but it has administrative offices in the different provinces, and he swept into his comparison a country like New Zealand which has a wholly different plan, because it has, as distinct from the Federal Governments of Australia and Canada, a unitary Government.  If he had appreciated this important distinction he would have seen the explanation of the point he made with regard to the position of the Attorney-General. In Canada they have in the Federal Government a Minister of Justice whom we all had the pleasure of meeting at Geneva, and a Solicitor-General, who advises the Federal Government, but each province of Canada has its own Attorney-General, and any of us familiar with Law Reports, particularly Reports of Privy Council cases, knows that frequently contests arise as regards certain rights or privileges and whether they are vested in a province or in the Federal Government, and these cases are always fought out as between the Federal Solicitor-General and, say, the Attorney-General of Manitoba.  I refer to this as showing the great danger, because this thing has been seized upon, has been made into a headline in the newspapers.  For the purpose of making these superficial points Deputies just dip into the pages of Whittaker's Almanac, or some book of the kind, and I suggest that when a Bill of this kind is under consideration it should really receive much deeper consideration than is indicated by the observations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, may I point out to the Attorney-General that it is impossible to make a complete investigation when we only receive a Bill on Tuesday and have the Second Reading on Friday, and that one is forced to rely on ordinary works of reference because one has no time to obtain anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the circumstances are such that the consideration of the Bill is taken with perhaps some haste, before points of this kind are made it should occur to the Deputy that he should weigh them well, even if they look attractive on the surface.  I want to say, first of all, as regards this measure, in the few observations I have to make in closing, that it does not set up new Ministries. That statement has been made here by several Deputies.  The Constitution provides for twelve Ministers; this Bill sets up no Ministers.  This Bill takes existing departments of administration, sorts them out, divides them into their natural compartments and provides for their organisation, their method of making orders, and matters of that kind. It still remains possible to assign these departments in any number when a Ministry is being constituted to a Minister, provided that not less than five Ministers are appointed, and when people talk of creating a number of Government posts it has to be remembered that you have in the Constitution Ministers outside the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the initiation of the present Government a number of Ministries were left outside the Executive Committee, and the Dáil could have assigned all these to the charge of a single individual if it had chosen, and every time the Ministry is reconstituted the President of the Dáil will have it in his power to assign to any particular Ministers in his Executive as many Departments as he finds it convenient to do, and it will be for the Dáil to deal with the outstanding Departments and to assign them to one, or two, or three as the case may be.  The only new thing in this Bill is the creation of Parliamentary Secretaries, and perhaps the only new thing is that power is given to pay salaries to Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Dáil does not provide a large number of people who are able to work without remuneration, but even with this provision it is still possible that persons will be glad to serve a Parliamentary apprenticeship without stipend.  Perhaps it would be too optimistic to hope that they might even pay an apprenticeship fee for the glory of serving in one of these offices.  Subsequently <Col N="1011" /> when they have acquired the first elements of Parliamentary skill they might perhaps be paid, as Parliamentary improvers, at a somewhat more meagre rate than they would afterwards earn.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which are quite fluid and open to criticism from year to year, and to determination from time to time.  I do not think I have anything more to add to the observations I made the last day, save to emphasise this, that this is not the creation of Ministries, it is the organisation of administration; that the number of Ministers remains uncontrolled so far as this Bill is concerned, save by the Constitution and the will of the President of the day, and to suggest that before the Committee Stage perhaps we all shall have a more profound knowledge of the constitutional position of the various individual officers and Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, perhaps it may be more a point of procedure, might I submit that the Attorney-General has just stated that this Bill does not raise the question of the creation of new Ministries, but when the proposal for the nomination of certain Ministers to certain positions was before the Dáil on an earlier occasion, and certain criticisms were raised as to whether it was or was not desirable that such Ministries should exist for the conduct of certain Departmental duties, it was stated that these were questions which it would be more proper to raise when the Ministries Bill was before the Dáil.  Therefore, I suggest that if the Attorney-General is now saying that these matters which were referred to this occasion from that earlier occasion may not be raised now, or may be estopped, by such arguments as the Attorney-General has raised, then the Dáil is in the extraordinary and unfortunate position of being told on occasion A that these matters must not be raised then, because they must be raised under B, and when B happens, we are told that they should not be then raised under B, because they should have been raised under A, so that we are in the extraordinary position of not being able <Col N="1012" /> to determine with any accuracy under what thimble we may find the pea.</P>

      <P>I do not know exactly what the Deputy means. The point I wished to make was that the Ministers are not created by this Bill, that the Constitution has provided for Ministers, that this Bill provides for the division of administration into its natural distribution, and in addition contains the express power of assigning any Department or Departments to a single individual in any grouping that may be considered expedient.  I have raised no question of estoppel.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General has reason to complain of the absence of some critics of the Bill, but my cause of complaint is rather the absence of the Head of the Department concerning which I wish to make some observations. That is the Department which shares with the Ministry of Fisheries the severest castigations by the critics of the Bill&mdash;the Ministry of External Affairs.  I have no intention whatever of sharing in the expression of opinion that that Ministry should be scrapped. I think it is a very important Ministry and one that will be of great advantage to this State in international intercourse, and in raising the prestige of the Free State in world affairs, that is, provided it fully and effectively discharges its functions.  At the moment I will not comment on whether it does or does not, but this is the point I wish to arrive at: There was a provision made on the last Estimates for the appointment of several representatives under that Department in various countries at a cost of £37,290, an increase of over £20,000 from the previous year's estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know what exactly are the functions these representatives fulfil. Particularly I want to know do they deal with our external trade.  If so, why are they under this Department rather than the Department of Industry and Commerce?  I looked through the Estimates and the definitions given to these representatives, and I only found one&mdash;in Paris&mdash;who is described as a trade representative.  In Berlin, Rotterdam, Brussels and New York they are termed consuls; in Washington and Geneva representatives, and in <Col N="1014" /> Great Britain High Commissioner.  I had on a previous occasion to make adverse comments upon the composition of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which I do not intend to pursue to-day, not because I have been convinced of any error of judgement in this matter, but because I wish to refer more specifically to this particular subject. If it is contended that all the economic arteries of this nation should be under some unity of command, such as the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, why is, what I might term our overseas trade, our foreign trade, not under the control or direction or influence of this Department?  I suggest it should be.  I suggest, with all due respect to the talents of the Minister for External Affairs, that matters dealing with economic life and trade and industry are not his particular speciality and not the subjects in which he shines with the greatest lustre.  I suggest, also, that it is a cumbersome method of procedure, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce wishes to effect some beneficial result for Irish external trade in some foreign country, that he has to do so through the medium of the Minister for External Affairs, rather than through agents directly under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I should like to know, further, whether it is possible to ascertain the results that have been effected in this direction through the Ministry of External Affairs; what is the volume of our foreign trade and where it is located? I do not know whether it is possible to lay hands on data in regard to this matter, but I think it would be of importance. If these agents still remain under the control of the Minister for External Affairs I trust that when the Estimates for that Ministry are presented to the Dáil that we shall be given figures regarding the extent of the trade that is being secured or maintained as a result of the efforts of that Department.</P>
    <P>This is not really a criticism of the Bill itself, because it is simply a suggestion with regard to certain powers embodied in the Bill.  In Section 11 power is given to the Executive Council to redistribute or transfer from one Department to another certain functions, or authorities, or services, and I <Col N="1015" /> think it is extremely advisable that the Executive Council should consider the transfer of the control of the agents abroad, who deal with our foreign trade, from the Ministry of External Affairs to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order that there may be a more direct, less cumbersome and more efficient control and direction of this matter.  I have not a great deal of sympathy with most of the criticism that has been passed upon this Bill.  It is in reality merely a setting up of the framework of the State's administration. It covers a very wide and comprehensive field.  Neither do I agree with some of the comments which were incidentally introduced into the debate about the necessity for economy.  I do not think this nation is yet bankrupt, and I wish Deputies would remember that we have only just emerged from the throes of a struggle with anarchy, and that we have not yet sufficiently stabilised the State so that we can live in normal times or think in the normal terms of a State's life.  I believe some critics who have denounced extravagance would be the first to cry out for wholesale expenditure of the State's finances, if there was any outbreak of violence, in order that they might be saved from disaster.  Let us remember that the State has just emerged from one of the most terrific trials that any State could have gone through and has emerged with the possibilities of stability and security.  It is to make these definite and lasting that this Bill, I take it, is devised.  But if we have only got the possibilities, those possibilities may yet again be overthrown and the country plunged back into chaos and disorder, if those who are responsible to the State refuse to give to those who have to exercise administrative charge the necessary means to render permanent the basis of peaceful development which we have secured.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture was singularly unfortunate in allowing the College of Science to be taken from his Department and given to the Ministry of Education.  If agriculture is to be developed it is by means of research.  I would like to know how the Minister <Col N="1016" /> now proposes to supply the means for developing research in agriculture. Singularly enough he takes charge of the College of Veterinary Science but refuses to take charge of an institution which will enable him, by research, to develop seeds and plants adaptable to this country; as well as to find means for preventing diseases in them. Take for example potato blight.  There are varieties of potatoes able to resist the blight.  The growers are told how to cure the disease when it comes, but there is nothing available to show the cause of the blight or how to produce potatoes that will resist it.  Regarding animal diseases, the position of the Department of Agriculture is that when there is an outbreak on a farm, and when, say, five or six cattle are affected, if the local Veterinary Surgeon is not able to diagnose the disease the help of the Department is invoked. The duty of the Department's Inspector is not to find out what disease the cattle had but to ascertain if they had anthrax or foot-and-mouth disease. When he is satisfied that it is not a scheduled disease his duty is done.  He goes away and as far as the Department is concerned everything is all right.  There is no means by which the unfortunate farmer can be told what the cattle are suffering from and in what way the disease might be combated. I contend that as the Minister for Agriculture takes charge of the Veterinary Department, he should also take charge of research in regard to plant life.  That can only be done at the College of Science.  I think it is a mistake to allow that institution to be handed over to the Ministry of Education. I remember that there was a wheat-growing district in South Africa where a very suitable milling wheat was raised, but the straw became subject to rust.  The Department of Agriculture in that country set to work and produced a seed that gave wheat of the same milling quality with a straw that resisted rust.  If we had research in this country it would enable us to carry on the business of agriculture.  Apart from the evils from which agriculture is now suffering we want more careful research into diseases, their cause, and <Col N="1017" /> also how to get better seeds.  As to diseases of animals, I believe there should be a particular Department under the Minister for Agriculture that would investigate these diseases and find out what they are.  Half of them are not known.  At the present time there is in Co. Wicklow a disease known as &ldquo;braxy&rdquo; and the loss to this State from that disease amounts to £30,000 per annum.  It would be a very good day that investigation would reveal the cause of a disease that inflicts so much damage on the country.  If the Minister hands over the College of Science to the Minister for Education he is giving away the only weapon that can help the farmer to make progress.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite clear that this Bill is going to get its Second Reading with practically very little or no opposition.  Some such Bill is necessary.  There has been very little purely Second Reading criticism of the framework of the Bill.  In fact, there are many very good points in that necessary framework.  I, for one, think that even Deputy Wilson and the farmers will, later on, be very glad that the different branches of education and scientific work and scientific research have all been united.  We may hope for some progress and co-ordination amongst the different branches of education once we have got one Minister to take charge of them all.  But, I think it is very important, even at this stage, even though it is not strictly a Second Reading criticism, to stress, from as many points of view as possible, the objections which seem to me to lie against the two clauses, which have received most attention from the previous speakers.  I mean the clauses referring to the seven Parliamentary Secretaries and the Army&mdash;Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill, I think they are.  Even though I run some risk of coming under the lash of the Attorney-General, I will say that it seems to me in the time that I have been able to give to the consideration of this Bill, that both these clauses are open to one line of criticism. That is, that the Ministry have attempted in a Bill, which they themselves wish to be permanent in form, to meet difficulties which arise from exceptional circumstances.  I think it <Col N="1018" /> would be wiser in a Bill of this kind, which is intended to be permanent, to make it permanent and not, as the Minister for Agriculture said, elastic, too.  If the Bill is made elastic it may be stretched in a way that the framers would not intend it to be stretched.  I think it would be wiser if the Bill were made permanent, so that, as far as our lights would go, it would deal with matters which we intend to be in the future permanent, or for a long time, at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government dealt in a separate way with their proposals for meeting exceptional difficulties, I am quite prepared to admit what the Government claims, the urgent importance of meeting those exceptional difficulties.  I am quite prepared to admit that the Ministers are seriously overworked, for example, and that they need Parliamentary help at present.  Whether that will be a permanent necessity or not I do not think we can say now.  I am quite prepared to admit the need at present for all this suggested Council of Defence, for example.  The Minister for Defence the other day said what I am now about to say.  It seems to me that this proposal for a Council of Defence is assuming and taking it for granted, in a way that we cannot decide at present, whether it ought to be so taken for granted or not&mdash;the existence of a Standing Army.  We cannot now go into that question with advantage. I think this proposal assumes that that is going to be the case.  I think it would be wiser for the Government to defer such a discussion until we see what the developments in the next two or three years are going to be.  I think also that it is regrettable, at a time when there is such urgent need for economising, when the Minister for Finance himself said that he was determined to balance the budget, and that he was sure it would take the greatest cheeseparing in order to be able to balance the budget, that the Government should come in and ask for power to spend money, which they say in the same breath that they do not think they will spend, and which they hope they will not have to spend.  I think to put such power into the Bill is regrettable. I think it would be wiser to <Col N="1019" /> get powers to deal with the present emergencies in the present overworking of the Ministers in a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I hope, when we come to the Committee Stage, we shall succeed in getting from the Government important modifications of these two clauses.  I think, however, there will also be other alterations required in the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I suggest to the Attorney-General for consideration, for example, the introduction of a schedule of repealed clauses.  I do not see any such in the Bill.  As I said in the commencement, the Bill is capable of much modification in the Committee stage, and I think it is probable it will commend itself to us as far as this Second Reading is concerned, and that we will pass it with little or no opposition.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán agam le rádh ar an Bhille seo. I merely take part in this debate to deal with one extraordinary thing that I notice here in the arguments that are being used in the criticism of this Bill. And that is as regards the Minister for Fisheries.  I see here a sort of concentrated attack, or a desire to arraign that Ministry as one of those which should be scrapped for the sake of economy.  I think if there is need for any Ministry in this nation it is a Ministry of Fisheries, and no department in this nation requires the service and encouragement and guidance that a Minister could give it more than the fishing industry.  We have so many looking to this industry for their livelihood, and so many people who are so absolutely dependent upon it, and upon the development of this industry, that its importance cannot be overstated. We have, at the same time, a field for development in this industry that does not appertain to other countries.  We have a prospect of national wealth from that industry, and we should concentrate our energies in trying to obtain and secure it.  I think the arguments that have been urged to scrap and do away with that Ministry are not well or intelligently directed.  I admit that the industry, at the present time, is going through a period of stress and trial, and going through difficulties <Col N="1020" /> that appertain generally to the same industry in other countries.  But it is not at that period of stress or difficulty that we here, who are charged as a body with debating the affairs of the nation, should withdraw from that industry the encouragement which it is necessary it should get to tide it over this period of difficulty, and if possible to bring it to some prospect of success and development.  It is a bad time for the doctor to retire when the epidemic is all round.  I think now is the time that that industry should be backed up and that something should be done to get it over its difficulties and bring it along its proper road to development.</P>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the other criticisms of this Bill or with some gentlemen who, with clear optical vision, can see ghosts of British Kings and Commanders - in - Chief flying around.  Whatever credit they are entitled to for these superior discerning powers, they are certainly not doing any good to the nation by making those allegations which are absolutely groundless.  I would urge upon the Ministry to stand behind this Ministry of Fisheries and see that it is properly directed, and that it does its duty.</P>

      <P>I do not know that much remains for me to say on this Bill, except again to refer to the fact that the criticisms which have appeared in regard to it, notably in the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; and to which I have already referred, are criticisms which, on examination of the accounts or the charges made by the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; will not bear the same scrutiny as the proposals we have here.  In 1914, I think, you could purchase the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; for a halfpenny, and to-day you pay 2d. for it.  That fact is not <Col N="1021" /> blazoned in the same little frames that the Attorney-General spoke of; but it is a fact, notwithstanding.  There are other reasons, sir, which have prompted those particular references to the Ministries' Bill.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into them now as far as that journal is concerned, but I will refer to them later on if necessary.  I think, sir, you know something of that yourself.  This Bill is one of the most important measures which will come before the Dáil.  In most of the criticisms either here or in the Press, very little consideration has been given to one or two or three important matters. One is that previous to the setting up of the Saorstát there were two Governments functioning or attempting to function in this country.  The one which had the confidence of the people had naturally many of the defects of a young Government.  The one which was attempting to function in spite of the people must naturally, during the progress of the struggle, have become very much disorganised, and in that disorganised state it was handed over to us, one of the conditions being that practically every official having a certain status in the employment of that Government was entitled, under certain headlines, to demand compensation and to leave the service.  As a consequence of that particular provision, we have a very heavy charge to meet annually for a number of years to come.</P>
      <P>The real point in mentioning these peculiarities of the particular period in question is that in order to reorganise that Government machinery, certain checks have got to be made and certain administrative control has had to be secured, and in order to get that administrative control we have, during the last twelve months, had three Parliamentary Secretaries, and it is proposed in the Bill to empower the Executive Council to have seven.  It is not proposed either inside or outside the Executive Council to have at any time more than three; but it is in our judgement necessary that sufficient authority should be there to make such appointments if and when it is considered necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>We may not have called them Parliamentary Secretaries, but I suppose some time or another, when we do commence to give them a statutory position, they are entitled to some baptismal appellation, and if the name is not one by which, officially, they were hitherto known, it will be made more distinct in future.  The real question is how far it is possible in this Bill to make for efficiency in Government control.  Those who are comparing the appointments of the Ministries in this Bill with those of other States, or other Governments, compare a new State in the circumstances I have mentioned with old States functioning normally and with none of the difficulties that we have had to contend with.  I have already mentioned, in the lifetime of the last Dáil, the amount of time that is occupied in dealing with adjustments, financial and otherwise, with the British Government.  That time may not be measured in the length of service the Minister can give or the number of hours he can serve in his office. Another consideration which was present to our minds was that in our experience in maintaining a Government which had the confidence of the people from the year 1919 to the signing of the Treaty, we had a Ministry of Fisheries, and we learned that this particular service of Fisheries was an important one, one in which a very large amount of money could be lost, and on which, as a matter of fact, during the time of the First Dáil, a considerable amount of money was expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the experience we had during that time, we learned it would not be advisable to run Fisheries as a Department, <Col N="1023" /> and that the amount of money that might be expended on maintaining a Minister in control of it might be saved to the State in years to come from the experience we would have of his administration and the attention he could give to this Ministry.  For almost twelve months now the procedure which is outlined here in Clause 8 has been practically the same.  In other words, there has been an Army Council, and it is in the light of that experience <Col N="1024" /> that this proposal is put forward.  I do not know that there is anything further I could say on this Bill.  Certainly, from what we have heard of the discussion that has taken place, it is evident that the Bill will receive very close consideration on the Third Stage, and I do not propose to say anything more on it now.</P>

      <P>I beg to move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all after the word Dáil,' line 1, and to substitute therefor the words `regrets that in its outline of proposed legislation, as disclosed in the Governor-General's Address, the Government has not included any proposals for the encouragement and development of the fishing industry.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>Several weeks have now elapsed since this amendment appeared on the Order Paper.  My object in putting it down was to direct attention to the fact that in the comprehensive outline of the proposed legislation set forth in the Governor-General's Address, no reference had been made to this very important matter.  Since then we have had many discussions in this Dáil in connection with the fishing industry, and the Ministry of Fisheries, in one form or another, and we have had notice, by the Minister for Fisheries, of a Bill to make certain provision in connection with inland fisheries.  That all goes to show that the Governor-General's speech is not always to be taken as a true criterion of the programme of the Government's legislation. The proposed Bill refers entirely to inland fisheries, and my remarks will deal largely, if not entirely, with the question of deep sea fisheries.  In my opinion the fishing industry in Ireland is, or ought to be, and could be, an industry second only to agriculture itself, and I think there is very great room, indeed, for the development, and for the fostering and encouragement of this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much attention has been paid, in the past, to the development of agriculture in the country, though we all agree that sufficient attention had not been paid to it.  Possibly one reason for the <Col N="1026" /> neglect&mdash;the wholesale neglect&mdash;on the part of the former Government of this country of this important industry of fisheries, was that while England undoubtedly wanted our cattle, and our poultry, and our butter, she had little or no desire for our fish.</P>
    <P>I may say at the outset, believing as I do, that there is in this industry very great room indeed for increased action and development, I do not hold the view&mdash;it is a personal view&mdash;that there is no need at the moment for a distinct and separate Ministry of Fisheries.  I believe that economy, or so called economy, effected by savings on such matters as education or on an industry of this kind, is not true economy, and will have the effect only of increasing the waste of effort and opportunity in other directions.  The Government and the country have done a good deal for agriculture.  The credit of this country has been pledged, to a very great extent, and it may be necessary that something in the same direction will need to be done to put the fishing industry on a proper basis.  The success of the fishing industry depends, like every other industry, almost entirely on proper organisation and proper education of those engaged in it.  This organisation and education ought to be undertaken by the Government.  We have the question of production, in the first case, and the question of marketing. From the point of view of production we have to consider the people who are engaged in it, the provision of fishing gear, boats, and such matters, and also we want to have the fish.  I might say that so far as the man power is concerned, this industry is a skilled one, in the strictest sense of the word, and undoubtedly, owing to the neglect of the fishing industry during the past few years, the number of skilled men is now rapidly decreasing, and this is a matter that will have to be looked into very urgently.</P>
    <P>It is rather a strange thing that only one side of the question has really received any attention at the hands of those whose duty it was to foster it. It is almost entirely, so far as Ireland is concerned, a seasonal occupation and is concerned with the inshore fishing for herring and mackerel, whereas <Col N="1027" /> in other countries very much attention is paid to fishing for other varieties of fish rather than herring and mackerel which find a market during the greater part of the year.  There is a question of the provision of gear.  That is especially a matter in which the Government can give very great help.  There is first of all the necessity for experimental and educative work.  It is necessary that those fishermen engaged in the work should know the most suitable class of gear to use.  There is also the question of the provision of gear, and, as there is very great initial outlay required, the Government must come to help of those engaged in the industry in order that they may be able to help by short loans or some such method.  I am informed that most of the gear used in the fishing industry is manufactured outside the Saorstát. If that is the case I think there is here a great opportunity of developing what might be regarded as a side line to the industry in connection with fishing.</P>

      <P>Nets, for instance, are not made except in one place, I believe, in the Saorstát.  Barrels for curing the fish are imported.  If that is the case I think this is one of the first things with which the Ministry might concern itself because in these things the production of gear and accessories would in itself form a very useful industry. In some countries very great help is given to those engaged in the fishing industry in providing information as to the movements of fish.  I do not know whether that has been attended to here.  In some countries aeroplanes are used for this purpose. It is not so much a question of production of the fish that is necessary, as a question of marketing the fish.  Fish is a perishable food and rapid transit is really the key to the problem of marketing.  Nothing has been done, so far as I know, in the way of organising transit to suit this particular industry. The railways have made no efforts, so far as I know, to accommodate the fishermen and very often we have instances of large catches of <Col N="1028" /> fish which have to be thrown into the harbour again because they cannot be dealt with.  This provision of cheap and rapid transit is one of the first things which the Ministry should take in hands.  I do not know whether they can do that with the powers they already have.  If they cannot, I suggest that they should look for increased powers, because, as I have already stated, this is really the key to the development of the industry.  There is also the question of the provision of motor transit in certain districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arran Island Fisheries are some of the most important we have in the country, and fishing for herring especially is done in the Sound between the Arran Islands and the Galway coast. They take their fish into Galway, a distance of 30 miles.  The fishermen lose one or two days per week, and there are other delays whereas there is a harbour along the coast of Galway about nine miles from the Arran Islands at Coshla, where, if the fish could be sent by motor to Galway, the fishermen could fish and land their catches inside an hour.  There are several instances of that kind especially in the Connemara area where a motor service could be established and they would help very much in expediting the transit of fish to the markets, but in addition to transit you have the question of providing markets, and here, I think, there is a great scope for the efforts of the Minister.  The inland markets are not developed.  There is nothing being done to bring the people in the Midlands and the inland portion of this country into touch with people engaged in the fishing industry on the coasts.  The result is that whatever little fish is used in the country is, to a great extent, imported from the East coast of England with the exception of some herrings and mackerel in season. There could be a market in Ireland, if a scheme of advertising or organisation were undertaken whereby the Government would come in to help the people who want this cheap and wholesome food to get it from the people engaged in the industry.  I do not know of course, as I have already stated, whether or not new powers or new legislation were required by the Ministry to do the things which I have <Col N="1029" /> been suggesting in outline are necessary to develop the industry.  Any powers necessary I hold should be asked for by the Minister, and I have no doubt the Dáil would agree to give him these powers.</P>
    <P>There is a question which has been touched on here before, namely, the protection of the fisheries.  I am not quite satisfied that there is not at the moment sufficient protection provided for our fisheries.  Foreign trawlers are invading our fishing grounds, and more measures should be taken to increase the measure of protection for our fishing grounds.  A branch of the industry which has been neglected, I think, is the provision of curing stations.  I do not know whether in the Saorstát any form of curing fish, except one, that is the salting of fish and the packing of them in barrels, is resorted to, but I suggest that there are other forms of curing which ought to be encouraged, for instance, the provision of kippers and bloaters.  I do not know whether Irish kippers and bloaters could be provided or obtained.  I rather think they cannot.  The whole question of the fishing industry is so very wide that there are very many points which can only be touched on in a debate of this kind.  My object will be served if I succeed in directing public attention to the necessity of encouraging this industry established on the western coast: It will solve to a large extent the problem of the Connemara areas where agriculture as such is really out of the question, and where this industry is the only mainstay of the inhabitants. The matter of inland fisheries is being dealt with in a Bill which has just been introduced, as I have said, by the Ministry of Fisheries since this amendment was put down, and I have no doubt that other deputies who are more competent than I am to deal with that particular branch of the industry will have something to say to that matter in the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell dealt very fully with sea fishing, and he has not left very much for me to say. except that I might suggest, in addition to the industries in connection with it that might be developed, the making of barrels and nets, there is also an opening for the manufacture of ice to be used in connection with the removal of the fish, and this, with the other industries he mentions, if developed and fostered by the Government, would give a great deal of employment.  It is a monument to the inefficiency of the Government from which we have escaped, that the industry has remained in the state in which it is.  In fact, the English Government were only shamed into doing something for Ireland in regard to fishing by the philanthropic action of Lady Burdett-Coutts when, years ago, she enabled the fishermen of the North-Western coast to obtain proper fishing vessels.  That was a matter that ought to have been done by the Government, and it should not have been left to any individual.  Leaving the sea fishing, so ably dealt with by Deputy O'Connell, and proceeding to the inland fishing, of which I know a little, I can say that there is no doubt that in the fisheries of the lakes and rivers, we have, or ought to have, a great source of wealth.  I have seen it stated that they would be worth about £2,000,000 a year if properly developed. If the Scotch people had our rivers and lakes in addition to their own, they would have developed them to the last degree.  Somehow or other, we seem to <Col N="1031" /> have been apathetic in working them up as they should have been.  There is no doubt that in Scotland a great revenue comes to the Government through licences for fishing, and a great deal of money comes into the country in other ways&mdash;about £1,000,000, or perhaps more&mdash;through what hotel-keepers make and otherwise.  In Ireland, I am afraid, the amount received from licences is extremely small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ought to be very big, but the apathy that has been over us seems to have covered the fishing industry entirely for years as regards the lakes and rivers.  There has been no proper supervision over these for a great many years.  It is notorious that Ireland has been the happy hunting ground of the poacher.  The man with the rod and the gun practically walked all over the place, paid nothing, and had a very comfortable and very pleasant time for himself, but it was not a profitable time for the revenue of the country. This is a thing which will be for the Minister for Fisheries to settle.  I have been, for my sins, on a bench of magistrates for 30 years, and during that time I do not think I have ever seen a conviction for poaching carried through successfully.  It has been notorious that poaching on the rivers and lakes was carried on to such an extent that it would be impossible to develop them in any way until it was stopped.  Certain efforts were made to stock the rivers, but it was only putting so much more fish into them for the poachers.  A great deal of this is, of course, owing to the multiplicity of riparian owners, who do not act together, and what is everybody's business is nobody's business. The consequence was that nothing was done, and the rivers and lakes were simply left derelict.  That is not a healthy state of affairs, and it will be for the Minister for Fisheries to put a stop to, for no industry can prosper if it is at the mercy of everybody who chooses to poach.  The recent Land Acts have been greatly responsible for this.  The multiplicity of owners makes it impossible for anybody successfully to keep the rivers free from poaching, or the lakes either.  I would suggest to the Government that it will be necessary <Col N="1032" /> for them to have a much stricter control over the rivers than hitherto, either by putting life into the derelict Boards which are supposed to manage this matter, and making them see that prosecutions are carried out, and that rivers and lakes are worked for all they are worth.  Until that is done, it will be hopeless to do anything with this industry, as far as the lakes and rivers are concerned.  If they do that, I think it will be well worth any expense that they may have to incur, because I am sure that from the fishing a very large surplus will go to the Government from licences, and in other ways money will be brought into the country.  I am sure that if the Government do this they will have the country at their back, because it is a notorious fact that for years this industry has not been fostered, has not had the Government attention that it should have.</P>

      <P>To develop the sea fishing Deputy O'Connell has laid down three main factors with which I entirely agree, the teaching of the men how to fish, rapid transit, and the obtaining of suitable markets.  There can be no doubt that these three things are necessary to make sea fishing a success.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned that nets and other equipment for this purpose should be produced in Ireland.  I thoroughly agree with him that the Saorstát should be able to do its own work in that respect, but I am sorry to disagree with him in the method by which he wishes to carry out his proposal.  It would not require one, but three Ministers to carry out efficiently the proposals which Deputy O'Connell laid down.  I represent a constituency where there is a very large sea fishing population.  I know the conditions of the trade and the hardships that the men have to suffer, and I know where the shoe pinches.  Mention was made by a previous Deputy that the British Government deserved blessings for having left the fishing trade in an excellent condition. My own observation is that the intervention of the British Government Departments in the fishing trade has caused more ruin than the greatest calamity that could occur.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Deputy.  My own plan is, and I think it is a course that should be adopted by Deputies representing constituencies where the fishing population is pretty large, that the Deputies should organise the fishermen in their districts and lay before them some practical scheme that would suit their districts, and present it to the Minister for his investigation. I hope to have a little representation made of that kind myself.  To give effect to Deputy O'Connell's first suggestion, we should have trained fishermen. We should take up first of all the scientific training of the fishermen, and for that purpose the best course, in my opinion, is to employ a skipper from Grimsby, Hull or Fleetwood, with a modern trawler, and place her, with a crew of fishermen in the district concerned to learn the trade.  They could be paid on the results of the fishing, which should also pay for the overhead charges of the boat.  I understand that boats of that kind can be chartered for six months at a cost of £500.  The overhead charges, payment of the skipper, engineer and fireman, and the cost of marketing the fish, would come out of the results of the sales, and the rest would go to the fishermen.  With six such boats you could train in six months something like 120 fishermen, and in this way you would have 120 skilled skippers ready to take up this trade. It would also prove that the fish are there, and that the business could be worked commercially.  That being so, at the end of six months no difficulty would be found in setting up companies and providing capital to carry out fishing in a scientific way.  I suggest to the Minister that that plan might be adopted.  Deputy O'Connell might see in the West whether the fishermen can supply a scheme.  It need not necessarily be the one I have sketched.  I think it would be the easiest way out of the difficulty, considering the straitened financial condition in which the Dáil finds itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the necessity for <Col N="1034" /> this addition to the Address.  Our fisheries, inland and sea, have been neglected, and no attempt has been made to develop them.  We have been only tinkering with this question before and since the war, and there is no use in saying that at any time an attempt has been made at protection or development. I will deal with the question shortly of inland fisheries.  Except the State is prepared to finance the Ministry of Fisheries I see very little hope for inland or sea fisheries.  These fisheries ought to be the property of the State absolutely, and there ought to be no private ownership in inland fisheries.  To justify State expenditure, we cannot spend money in the interests of the individual.  Fish is a different quantity from anything else.  You cannot keep fish fenced in on a farm. They are passing through the sea and rivers, and what would be good nationalised in a river would be altogether wrong in regard to the land. The Ministry of Fisheries, and the inland fisheries, will never be a success until we have proper protection.  Hundreds and hundreds of miles of our streams never had protection.  I have letters from Portarlington complaining that spawning fish has been hawked round the town and sold at anything that can be got for it at present.  I have the same complaints from Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, and from every part of the country I am acquainted with, and that has always been the way.  I knew cases where spawning fish were taken in such quantities that they were salted, put into the barrels and fed to the pigs&mdash;spawning salmon taken at weirs and mills.  If a proper system were adopted this could be changed. The money at the disposal of the Boards of Conservators is not sufficient, or anything like it, to police the rivers.  The system is all wrong in a good many districts, but it may be right, or nearly right, in others.  The Civic Guard and the Military have been mentioned as being of great assistance.  In order to make me believe that statement I would like to see the exact figures, and the names of the places where this assistance has been given.  The Royal Irish Constabulary under the old <i>régime</i> were not of much assistance; in fact <Col N="1035" /> they were none at all.  Their operations were few and far between.</P>
      <P>It is not intended, I believe, to have as many Civic Guards in the Free State as there were R.I.C.  If that is so what assistance can the Civic Guard be as they will have other duties to perform? If you attach to the Civic Guard a certain number of men specially trained in protection duty, and the detection of poaching, you could easily form a very effective force for the purpose. They could always find accommodation at the Civic Guard barracks, and could be transfered from district to district as the occasion requires.  By that means you could form a very effective machine.  You would not require so many, just a few in every Inspector's district.  It has been suggested that we should have organisation amongst fishermen.  That might be possible, but I would have very little hope from such organisation, because we find that some fishermen bring out their boats in the close season and kill spawning fish as well as other people. As to sea-fishing, I am not competent to deal with that matter.  On the question of inland fishing I would ask the Government, and the Minister in particular, very seriously to consider the position and endeavour, if possible, to make it a State concern.  There is no use saying that money cannot be found. Money can be found for other things that are not necessary at all, such as in connection with the Bill which has just got a second reading.  Yet we are told that money cannot be found for an industry that would give a means of living to thousands of people.  A Government with that outlook does not deserve to be the Government of the country.  I put it seriously to the Government to make this a State concern, and to put finances at the disposal of the Minister to develop the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey issued a challenge just now as to the effectiveness of the Civic Guard and military in protecting fisheries.  I am glad to be in a position to answer that challenge.  I own a salmon fishery in Co. Sligo, and in the early part of this year, when I was a private individual, I applied to the Minister for Fisheries <Col N="1036" /> to see if he could give any protection to my water-bailiffs to check the poaching on a large scale which was going on. The Minister took the matter up with the Minister for Defence, and the latter undertook to give protection.  As a result four poachers were caught, and they were fined by the District Justice on a far higher scale than poachers were ever fined by any Resident Magistrate.  That is, at any rate, one instance in which the Government have been effective, and I know Deputy Gorey will be glad to hear it.  As the proprietor of a salmon fishery I felt rather sorry that Deputy O'Connell, in his reasoned speech, made so much reference to sea fisheries, and so little to the inland fisheries, because the value of salmon and trout fisheries is really far greater, from a financial point of view, to the country than that of herring and mackerel, although the herring and mackerel fishing gives more employment.  I am in general agreement with what he said about them, except on the question of transit. I do not think the transit question is quite as bad, at any rate where there is a railway system, as he suggested. No doubt in Belmullet and places like that, where there is no railway system, it is as bad as possible, and if the fish cannot be sold locally it has to be sold for manure.  I have been most successful in marketing fish, mostly in Liverpool and Manchester.  Even last year while the fighting was going on at the Four Courts, and when it was extremely difficult, I was able to get my fish to Greenore, and from thence to Liverpool and Manchester.  I think if it is a regular business, with regular supplies, the railway companies will make an endeavour to deal with it.  Perhaps it is lack of regular organisation and of making regular consignments that causes these complaints of bad transit to be made.  With regard to markets, particularly in the Saorstát, I am in complete agreement with Deputy O'Connell.  Not only are there inland towns in which you cannot get fish, but there are seaport towns where you cannot be sure of getting fish.  In the town of Sligo, on five days out of six, you cannot count on getting fish.  There may be an old man pushing a barrow <Col N="1037" /> round the town from whom you may be able to buy herrings, but if you want to be sure of getting any fish for a specific purpose you have to send 130 miles to Dublin.  That is actually where there is tidal water, and within eight miles of a place where there are fishermen with fishing boats.  If you go to a shop that is supposed to sell fish you probably find a couple of old hens and a rabbit in the window.  Part of the blame lies with the fishermen. Fishermen, I think, are very apt to be easily discouraged.  They do not realise the importance of keeping regular markets.  If the day looks inclement, or for one reason or another they very often do not go to sea.  They do not realise that that means that people will get out of the habit of eating fish.  I am not at all sure, although Deputy O'Connell said that fish is a cheap and wholesome food, that it is very much appreciated by the average Irishman. I think we are naturally a meat-eating people.  Historically we have always been a meat-eating people.  The ancient Irish eat a very large quantity of meat and very little of anything else.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that it is very desirable that we should eat more fish because it is cheap and wholesome and gives employment.  I gather that the Minister has some scheme of marketing, and I hope he will give some details of it when he replies.</P>
      <P>On the general question, I do not dissent from Deputy O'Connell's amendment, but I would point out that the Government have been better than their word.  Though they did not promise legislation they are promoting legislation in regard to inland fisheries, as there is a Bill down for Second Reading to-day.  What is really needed is not legislation.  As Deputy Gorey said it is administration and protection that we need more, so that if the Government resist this amendment and do not accept it I shall certainly vote with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Connell does not suggest that there should be proposals for legislation, but that there should be contained in the Address proposals for the encouragement and development of the <Col N="1038" /> fishing industry.  I suggest that there are powers in the hands of the Government at present, without legislation, which would enable them to encourage and develop the fishing industry.  Deputy Gorey has stated that he does not know very much about sea fishing, and he, therefore, prefers not to enlarge upon that.  I do not know very much about inland fishing, and I do not intend to enlarge on it.  On the principle he suggested to the Government, that inland fisheries at any rate, and possibly also sea fisheries, should be State protected, if not State owned&mdash;I think he stated State owned&mdash;I commend his advice to the Dáil, just pointing out that Deputy Gorey when he comes up against a practical proposition arrives at the conclusion the Labour Party came to some time ago.  The Minister has set up a Committee of Inquiry into inland fisheries.  I want to put to him the importance of taking into consideration the views of men who are engaged in salmon fishing at the mouths of such rivers as the Shannon. Men have been engaged for generations fishing at Limerick.  I do not know how many men are engaged in that industry in a similar way throughout the country, but there are a considerable number, and their interests are of great importance.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would be well advised to add to this Committee members of that fraternity, and I use the word advisedly because in the case of Limerick, at any rate, you have a fraternity of men whose families have been for generations so engaged. They have made it a success more or less, and generally have provided for probably two or three hundred people.  I think Deputy O'Doherty and others would be well advised before they pin their faith to plans such as were outlined to consider the situation of the fishing industry around the English coast.  We have to bear in mind that there are altogether too many fishing boats around these coasts, fishing for the English market.  I am speaking now of sea fisheries.  There are many hundreds, if not thousands, of boats laid up, not by virtue of the absence of skilled fishermen, but by the fact that fish has been too plentiful for the market to <Col N="1039" /> absorb supplies.  There were too many boats built and engined and geared, and as a matter of fact they have caught more fish than the people were prepared or able to buy.  It might well be borne in mind, paradoxical as it may seem, that the fishing industry around the Irish coast has been developed. What has been defective is that the fish is not landed and consumed in Ireland.  I would like Deputies to remember, that supposing boats were built and equipped, comparable with the North Sea, Fleetwood or Milford trawling fleets, to fish out of Western Irish ports, the fact that the market at present is in Great Britain would lead to those boats doing exactly with the fish what the Fleetwood or Milford boats are doing to-day.  They would get the fish to the English market by the cheapest and most economical routes.  Such boats as have been trawling from Irish ports have as a matter of fact sent their fish to English markets.  Some of them tried fishing out of Dublin and went to the North, but failed.  I do not think one has to look for the development of sea fishing at present from the point of view of building new high-powered boats, but rather the development of the market at home and organising supplies to that market.  That is not going to mean a tremendous and immediate development in the fishing industry. The market in Ireland is limited by the population, and, as Deputy Bryan Cooper stated, Ireland is not a fish-eating country.  I am one of those who believe that the fishing industry will probably have to be revived through the teaching of domestic economy in the schools.  If in the eight or nine hundred thousand households there were means, as well as knowledge, for the proper preparation and cooking of fish there would be a greater liking for it, and very soon a much bigger market. I suggest to the Minister for Fisheries that perhaps if he is able to induce the Minister for Finance to assist him, it is rather by advertising the value of fish as a food, and the organisation of supplies to the local market, he will find the ultimate and the greater benefit than from any other means.  I am sorry to think that may well mean a supply of <Col N="1040" /> imported fish, perhaps caught and landed at Grimsby or Milford or Fleetwood, in the first instance.  There is no use talking of marketing or of organising markets unless a fairly regular supply can be assured.  The Minister will agree with me when I say that there is no such gamble known as the gamble of the fisherman.  It is a gamble from the beginning of his livelihood to the final consumption of the fish, and it is even a gamble then if the consumer is eating tinned fish.  Deputy O'Doherty and others ought also to bear in mind that in view of recent developments the high powered vessels in Scotland, and on the East Coast of England, at any rate, are likely to be displaced by lower powered vessels, strange to say, because they are cheaper to manage.  That is a tendency which has shown itself within the last year.  It is remarkable, and perhaps, if one may say so, encouraging to Irish fishing, because if it is only possible to compete with rival fishing fleets by meeting them with the same class of boats, it will mean the provision of money, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pounds, because of the tremendous cost both in production and in running expenses.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is well advised in the line that has been indicated to encourage the market for fish in Ireland. I think he will find, by that means, that eventually there will be an encouragement to fishermen along the coasts to fish regularly and to fish for a larger variety than hitherto.  Mackerel and herring are the most important so far as our fishermen are concerned. Possibly the greater money values that are taken out of Irish waters are in trawling fishing, ground fishing, and larger trawl fishing.  But the fish are never landed here.  Certainly they are never eaten here.  I think the dependence upon mackerel and herring has been a mistake, though there is a great food wealth in these two fish.  I believe that they are only going to be made valuable to the country or to the fishermen by a very much more extended system of curing and preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, perhaps it would not be out of place for me to remind the Dáil that the predecessor of the Dáil in 1920 and 1921 appointed a Commission to inquire <Col N="1041" /> into the resources and industries of Ireland.  That Commission, as a matter of fact, reported very fully in regard to sea fisheries, and I think the report is still on sale and it is very valuable.  I would venture to suggest to the deputies who are interested, that it is worth reading and the recommendations made there are worthy of consideration at least.  But the recommendations of that report are the recommendations of Deputy Gorey, Deputy O'Connell, and Deputy O'Doherty.  I think every Deputy in the Dáil is interested as to the expenditure involved.  I believe that the expenditure would be quickly repaid and I believe it would be a very valuable investment.  Certainly, in respect to inland fisheries it would give a quick return.  When the Minister is pleading for money he should emphasise the importance of that.  I think he could easily prove to the Minister for Finance that a quick return in a high degree could be obtained from money well expended by the State in fisheries.  I am going to repeat what I have said before.  Unless there is money available I think it would be unwise to pretend to have a Department, or at least a Minister for Fisheries, who will be supposed to be doing things that cannot be done without that money.  I think that it is not much use to be making a pretence of being able to do work for the fishing industry and for the development of the industry in the country unless the means of doing that work are at hand. It would be far better to delay the operation or the pretence at the operation unless the means of carrying it on were provided.  I hope the Minister will enlarge upon the statements that have been made in the past and give the Dáil some further assurance that the proposals for the encouragement and development of the fishing industry are in hands and that the means for those proposals are being provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather interested in fisheries and fishes, but I cannot altogether agree with the Quixotic schemes propounded by Deputy O'Connell.  There are plenty of fish.  There is no doubt about that. We want the fishermen and we want <Col N="1042" /> the buyers.  Off the coasts of Ireland there are illimitable fishing grounds, rich fishing grounds where those trawlers and drifters that we hear so much about poach and to which they are absolutely tempted by a clear field within the three-mile limit of the Irish coast.  The fishing of the mackerel, which is more or less a luxury in America, and the fishing of the herring, which ought to be cured, is really the trade which ought to be cultivated, because in normal times the trade in cured herring is something enormous on the Continent of Europe.  It is the king of fishes, a fish from which most of the money is made both in England and Scotland.  The reason there are such a number of boats laid up along the sea coasts in England and Scotland is really the result of the fiscal conditions in Germany and on the Continent. That is the reason they are laid up and that is the reason for the present state of the market.  They cannot sell the fish.  They cannot sell it in Germany on account of the state of trade.  I hope that the trade in this cured fish for export will be cultivated in Ireland, and that the Minister and Department of Fisheries will do whatever they possibly can in order to encourage it.  As to why there is no reference in the Governor-General's Address on the state of the industry, it strikes me that the Governor-General, being the man he is&mdash;a man of great capacity and a man of affairs &mdash;felt it would be rather silly for him to make any reference to the fishing industry in this country because it would be based upon a report which is practically two years old.  I presume that the other Ministries turn out their reports in a reasonable time.  The Department of Fisheries turns it out practically two years after date.  I think it was in October the Report for 1921 was issued.  As far as I can remember, the value of the Scotch fisheries in 1921 was £5,000,000, the value of the Irish fisheries was about £200,000.  I hope that under the new conditions prevailing in the Ministry of Fisheries that the Report will be turned out at least two or three months after the end of the financial year.</P>

I have listened carefully to all the Deputies who have spoken, and I must say that I fully agree with most of what they have said, though not with all. We all know that the fishing industry has been very much neglected.  At the same time, I do not think it would be fair to blame the Ministry of Fisheries for this neglect.  There has been a terrible lot of poaching going on.  We all know that.  It was just as difficult for the Minister for Fisheries to stop poaching as it was for the Minister for Defence to stop the burning of houses. Deputy O'Connell referred to motor transport.  Certainly I am very much in favour of that where railway facilities are non-existent at present, or where they are not likely to be available.  In the constituency that I represent, North Mayo, there are two bays which are very rich in fish, Blacksod Bay and Broadhaven Bay.  The fish that is caught in Blacksod Bay must be sent to Achill Sound, that is the nearest place. The fishermen have in one day to catch the fish, and in the next day to take it to Achill Sound.  They can only get into Achill Sound according to the condition of the tide.  The railway station at Ballina, which is the nearest station to them, is 42 miles from Belmullet.  In that case certainly a motor lorry would be very convenient and very useful. The fishermen could fish every day and have their fish sent away every morning. With regard to the question of market for fish, if you take Athlone or Mullingar or those inland towns you will find that you can get no fish there, and at the same time the fish is going bad at Blacksod Bay and Broadhaven Bay and other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy Bryan Cooper referring to Sligo, and he said that he could get no fish at all in Sligo.  I am surprised to hear that there cannot be a man found in Sligo who would open up a proper establishment for the sale of fish, and say to himself he would open up a trade for fish in that town and district and arrange with the fishermen to supply him with what he would require. The same applies to other towns. Certainly they ought all be able to produce <Col N="1044" /> one man who would take up this business and supply fish to the district. He also said that some of the fishermen are very easily discouraged.  I quite agree with him in that.  They are very easily discouraged.  But if you take the case of one or two men who are going out in a boat with a carrying capacity of 8 or 9 cwt., I think you will not be surprised to find that they are very easily discouraged.</P>
    <P>Deputy McBride says that we wanted fishermen and buyers.  We have the fishermen; let us get the buyers.  There are plenty of fishermen, and all they want is the gear.  If they got proper substantial boats and proper gear, the fishermen are all right, and we can look for the buyers.  There is a matter I would like to be made clear on.  I have been informed that the territorial waters embrace the three-mile limit, and that in some places the fishing limit is nine miles.  The result is that foreign boats can fish between the 9 mile limit and the 3 mile limit.  I would like to be made clear upon that matter, and if that is the case I do not think it is very fair to Irish fishermen.  I hope the Minister will accept a lot of the advice that was given here.  I am sure all the Deputies can be of great assistance.  If they all interest themselves as much as some of those who have spoken, I am sure they can render assistance to the Minister and help very much in this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to impress upon the Minister for Fisheries the great importance of hatcheries.  For the past 2 or 3 years the trout coming up the rivers have been all destroyed, and the result is there are very few fish of that type at the present time. Around Mullingar there was a small experiment carried out last year, as a result of which fifty thousand trout have been turned into the Co.  Westmeath lakes, at practically a nominal cost.  As Deputy Gorey said the other day, fishing is nearly as important a matter as the farming industry, because the lakes are teeming with wealth and teeming with food.  It is really a most important matter.  I do not intend to go into the details of the various causes of the fishing trouble, and I go no further than to impress upon the Minister the <Col N="1045" /> desirability of developing the fish-hatching industry.  That is the way to produce the fish, and if they are supplied to the various lakes in the manner I have mentioned, in a few years, if they would not be poached, there would be plenty of fish.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which may be news to the Deputies, because it is a thing that is not generally known.  It is in connection with pike, the fish that destroy the trout.  All the young trout in the lakes and rivers are simply food for the bigger fish.  About March or April in each year the pike go into the shallow waters to spawn.  At that period you will get pike up to 30 pounds in weight.  I have been myself responsible for shooting thousands of them.  In Belvidere Lake the number destroyed in the month of March would amount to thousands.  The result of destroying pike is that the young fish get a chance to thrive.  I wish to emphasise the necessity of preserving the young fish and the great possibilities that exist with regard to hatcheries.  I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of devoting a great deal of his attention to the industry with a view to restocking the lakes that have been depleted by poaching, especially in the spawning time, during the last two or three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this question presents such difficulties as I have heard pointed out.  I have some experience of sea fishing.  In two areas of the county I come from, there were, three or four years before the war, five landing places.  One of these landing places contributed, in dues, a sum of £500 to the County Council.  As the dues were small, a very large quantity of fish must have been disposed of to realise a sum of £500 in dues alone. I think if the collection of these dues is taken charge of, in some shape or other, by a Government Department, or by the Minister for Fisheries, it would provide a basis of security to enable the Ministry to assist in properly equipping and fitting out fishermen who would be unable to buy gear themselves, and this, I contend, would help in the development of the industry.  If such a scheme were introduced, making provision for the security that I speak <Col N="1046" /> of, I do not think the cost to the State would be very much, if it were to assist in properly equipping the fishermen in the country engaged in the industry. In this connection, too, the assistance of the County Councils might be invoked. These dues could be collected in the manner I suggest, and could be availed of as a security for the development of the industry.  It may be, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, that the times have changed as compared with the period of three or four years before the war, and that the conditions that obtain now are altogether different to what they were then.  It may be, too, that the market for fish is not as good now as it was then, and that although you might have as good catches of fish, that the return in dues, owing to the financial condition of the country, would not be as good as it was some years before the war.  I know that you have the fish and you have also the fishermen.  These latter constitute the very best material that you could get anywhere.  They are men who are prepared to face anything in the pursuit of their undertakings.  They are the very best class of fishermen that you could possibly get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of finance, I do not think the Ministry should allow that to stand in the way of the development of the industry, seeing that the return from dues alone would be a guarantee to the State against any expense the State might incur in providing proper equipment for the fishermen.  The industry in my opinion is one of the most important that we have.  The people engaged in it are the most worthy people that we have in the country, and I must also say, they belong to a class which is least able to help itself.  They live in remote parts of the country, and are not in touch with centres that might be able to assist them in one way or another.  They have to rely, almost entirely, on the Ministry, and on the agents it sends out, to assist and guide them in pursuing their undertakings.  I do not think the Governor-General, in his Address in referring to forthcoming legislation, could have touched on a subject of more general importance or interest to the country, than the development of the fishing industry.  Although <Col N="1047" /> the industry has not been referred to in that Address.  I am sure that it is none the less being considered by the Government and its responsible officials.  The Government has placed a Minister in charge of this industry and I am sure that it will now be dealt with in a manner satisfactory, not alone to the nation, but to all concerned in its development.</P>

      <P>If anybody had any doubt in his mind before this, that the question of fishery development was a matter of no concern to members of the Dáil, they have surely been relieved of that doubt. It was, I might say, a pleasure to me to find that Deputies, from every part of the country, take a very intelligent interest in the fishing industry, both sea and inland.  To come to the amendment itself, I think Deputy Johnson practically answered that.  Legislation will not be needed to develop the industry. I feel that, under the Ministers' Bill and the powers of the Congested Districts Board and of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, which have been handed over to us, that we have sufficient power to carry on without any further legislation enabling us to do so.  Deputy O'Connell referred to the fact that, under the old <i>régime</i>, more attention was devoted to the development of what might be called casual fishing, that is to say, drift-net fishing and occasional fishing of salmon and herring, than to trawling, which is of a more permanent type, or, as one might say, all-the-year-round fishing.  The Deputy referred to the fact that in other countries it was on this aspect of the fishing industry that the people concentrated. In Great Britain that is so, but it was not through Government agency.  The development of trawling is a matter for private or capitalistic enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And now we are bringing that forward, <Col N="1048" /> and we have brought it before the Chambers of Commerce.  Deputy O'Connell referred to the possible development of the supply of gear.  That was done by the old Boards, and continued to be done until comparatively recently by the Ministry.  Its financial provision for the supply of gear is curtailed for the moment, at least, owing to the financial conditions.  I might say that outstanding loans amount to between £120,000 and £140,000, and this fact, of course, governed a good deal the action of the Minister for Finance in stopping any further financial loans for the moment. Deputy O'Connell referred to the industries in connection with fishing, the making of nets and fishing barrels, etc. Nets are made at one place in Ireland&mdash; Baltimore.  There are no barrels made at present.  But it is difficult to know whether the suggestion is that the Government should start factories.  The Government is encouraging, as far as it possibly can, any enterprise that is undertaken in this way by private individuals, having in the past provided loans.  As a matter of fact, there is, I understand, a proposal for the barrel-making industry now being revived in West Cork.  The Deputy referred to what we are doing in regard to the provision of information as to the movements of fish, and he referred to the fact that aeroplanes have been used by other countries.  But the fact is no satisfactory result was effected or accomplished in that way, and the aeroplanes have been a practical failure as far as getting any real information is concerned.  The next point he mentioned is a very important one, namely, that of marketing and transit.  Nearly every Deputy referred to these two things, as they naturally would, as the most important in their speeches.  To take transit first; we are, of course, always in close communication with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in regard to transit.  We have got some concessions, not a terrible lot, because we are always met with the reply from the railway companies, if we ask for reduced freights, that they are up against high wages bill, high cost of coal, etc.  The Deputy mentioned the Arran and Coshla Bay Scheme.  That <Col N="1049" /> is being examined at the moment by the Department, and if it is found practicable it will be adopted.  It is known, I think, that we have under way a plan for the development of markets.  As a matter of fact, one section of the Department is at the moment devoting all its time to it.  A general outline of their scheme is the organisation of the retail trade in certain selected towns for a start.</P>
    <P>The appointment of salesmen from the Ministry to work up the trade, a scheme of propaganda to encourage the eating of fish, and then, after having encouraged people to eat it, to organise regular supplies to these inland towns. Deputy O'Connell also raised the question of protection.  That is, of course, an old sore.  There has always been considerable poaching, It has continued, and it possibly increased in recent years from one reason or another.  But we hope that with the aid of the additional patrol vessels, now placed at our disposal, and that have actually done considerable work already in aid of the Ministry, we hope to make this poaching not so profitable for those persons as it used to be.  Then he mentioned kippering stations, and he wanted to know if there was any such thing as an Irish kipper to be got.  There are kippering stations at Dunmore, Howth, Clogherhead and Baltimore.  These have all been assisted by the State in the past.  Then Deputy Woulfe referred to ice making plant.  These are, as a matter of fact, being now gradually developed&mdash;and developed by private enterprise.  There is one in Cahirciveen and one in Galway.  In the past, the procedure of the Department was that they supplied the ice at a low cost during the season.  This was found more practical than setting up anything in the nature of Government ice factories for the short periods that it would be necessary to use them during the year.  With regard to the question of licences, that at the moment is being considered by the Ministry.  It was one of the questions submitted to the Advisory Committee on Inland Fisheries recently.  Provision is also being made to enable the Board of Conservators to deal more effectively with the question of protection by <Col N="1050" /> putting them on a better financial basis.  Deputy Gorey wanted to know what the Civic Guard or the military had done, and Deputy Bryan Cooper was good enough to mention at least one specific case.  I can quite easily give many more, but I cannot do so offhand, and I can give figures of prosecutions at the instance of the Civic Guard and the military.  I know, as a matter of actual fact, that they have been effective, and much more effective, than the old R.I.C.  Deputy O'Doherty referred to organising the fishermen on something like a co-operative basis.  Well, I am waiting to see a scheme in writing before I commit myself.  I am prepared to scan, very carefully, any scheme submitted to me by any Deputy, but I will be quite candid and say that I will look very carefully at any scheme of that kind.  My first few months after the formation of the Ministry, had to be devoted practically to cutting losses as a result of former schemes of co-operation undertaken by a former Minister, all of which proved to be failures.  It is, as a matter of fact, the general belief, by persons who know them best, that before co-operation can be undertaken, our people engaged in the fishing industry will first of all have to have a long educational course.  Their life and work is individualistic, and it is extremely difficult to get them to accept even the very first principles of co-operation.</P>

      <P>Occasionally they work on the share system, but you will find, at any rate, that even in the buying of their ordinary provisions, if you except the crew of one boat which does not mean co-operation, they will not co-operate. The crew of one boat will be trying to down the crew of another boat, and co-operation between four or five persons does not mean a scheme of co-operation, surely.  You might as well say that because one family will try to work things out for the benefit of themselves that that is a sign that co-operation is possible generally.  Deputy Gorey referred to the sale of <Col N="1051" /> spawning fish.  That is an offence; and if there has been neglect in the way of prosecution there, it is the fault of the bailiffs, and, of course, if it is done openly, it is also the fault of the Civic Guard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the fishermen at the mouth of the Shannon.  On the Inland Fishery Committee already there are two representatives of the net fishermen in estuary waters, one at the mouth of the Liffey and one from the mouth of the Boyne.  I will look into the question of whether we can add further to the present Committee.</P>
      <P>I do agree, as Deputy Johnson thought I would, that the fishing industry is a gamble from start to finish. I may say that it was because of that that I think the system of finance, which I will be raising with the Minister for Finance, in regard to the development of fisheries that prevailed with the C.D.B. is preferable to the actual control of every detailed item of expenditure that prevails at present. That matter will have to be dealt with departmentally.  The Deputy from Mayo referred to the territorial water fishery limits.  The limit is, of course, three miles, and we have certain bye-laws which are extra territorial.  The actual position with regard to those is that a foreign boat can fish legally outside the three mile limit and within our bye-law limit.  A French boat can do so.  At the moment the bye-laws that existed prior to the 6th December, 1921, affect British vessels as they affected them formerly.</P>

      <P>It would hit ourselves. The British vessels would be very glad to be treated as foreign for that particular purpose.  Deputy McBride referred to the delay in the publication of fishery reports by the Department of Agriculture.  I myself was pressing for a long time for the issue of these reports, and I know that one of the causes for delay was the change in the Government and also a technical point as to the difficulty of presentation&mdash;a certain procedure about the presentation of the reports.  Deputy Shaw referred to the hatcheries and their development. That is a question that is receiving the attention of the Ministry and certain proposals were put up with regard to those of the Inland Fisheries Committee.  There is not very much use in going very far in the establishment of hatcheries until first of all we have secured protection.  Even though I am glad that the amendment was brought forward, since it has resulted in such a useful debate, I feel that there is really no necessity for it, and that there is no necessity for inserting anything in the Governor-General's Address with regard to the encouragement and development of the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>My main object, as I said in introducing this amendment, was to draw attention to the fact that this important matter seemed to have been forgotten when the Government was preparing its legislative programme.  Now the Minister has satisfied me that, at least, it has not been forgotten, even though it was not mentioned in the Address and, while not wholly satisfied that everything is being done that might possibly be done, we will wait further to see the results. I ask, therefore, the leave of the Dáil to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to notice that Deputies generally have thought fit to ignore the suggestion of Deputy <Col N="1053" /> Nicholls in seconding the vote of thanks when he said: &ldquo;I do not think that there is any need for dealing in detail with a subject like this.&rdquo;  As we all know, and as Deputy Nicholls should know, it is very important that the Address of the Governor-General, which is not a personal matter but merely an expression of the opinion of the Government regarding their future policy, under the circumstances which prevail in this country and under which the Ministry has been returned to office, every aspect of that Address should be thoroughly discussed.  As Deputy Captain Redmond said, it should be finally disposed of before any legislative measures outlined in that Address are introduced into this Dáil.  One would imagine from the very short statement of Deputy Nicholls that he was returned to support the Government without knowing the programme that he was returned to support. Unlike every other country, or the governing party of every other country where normal conditions prevail, this Government has been returned without putting any definite legislative programme before the people.  Therefore I think that is a very important reason why Deputy Nicholls, even as a member of the Government party, in seconding the vote of thanks, should have dealt in detail with the address of the Governor-General.  The Governor-General in the Address refers to the recent Electoral Act passed in the last Dáil, whereby every person has a right to share in the setting up of the government of the country.  I deny that the Electoral Act, which brought a certain register into operation, gave the people who are entitled to it the right to share in setting up the Government and participating in the administration as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of many instances where hundreds of voters' names appeared on the first print of the register, and when the final register was produced those names were omitted without any explanation being given to the parties who had a right to have their names on that register.  I am very glad the Minister for Local Government indicated a few days ago that it was the intention of the Ministry to set matters right on that point.  One fails to understand, <Col N="1054" /> however, why in the recent election a very large section of the community failed to exercise the franchise. It is quite true that in other countries a certain section of the community failed to exercise the right which they have in the setting up of the administrative machinery.  To me it appears that the people who in the recent election refused to take their share in the election of the Government were, to a certain extent, ignoring Parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>If such was the case I should say people should be compelled to go to the polling stations and register their opinions in the ballot boxes under the penalty of a fine.  Those who refused to acknowledge their duty in the setting up of the Government of their choice should be penalised.  The Address goes on to state that time and opportunity in the past year did not permit of any but temporary provision being made for the Civic Guard and Military forces and states that it is the intention of the Government in the Dáil to introduce measures giving a permanent form to the Civic Guard and Military Forces.  I cannot fail to notice the manner in which the Civic Guard have conducted themselves under the very trying conditions in which they were working as compared with the general conduct of the military. Might I express the hope in the new re-organisation foreshadowed by the Minister for Defence that only those who have conducted themselves in a proper way will find a place in the new Army organisation, and that any officers or men who have by their misconduct thrown discredit and dishonour on the Army and the Government will find themselves in the ranks of the demobilised.</P>
    <P>I think it is eminently desirable that it should be made quite clear to those who compose the army that this army, which is paid by the whole of the people to protect the people, is not conducted on the amateur lines of the army which had only the support of a section of the people previous to the Treaty being signed.  The method of demobilisation indicated by the Minister for Defence is generally satisfactory. It goes further than the statement made in this Dáil two or <Col N="1055" /> three months ago when he said it would be quite possible to reduce the army to 30,000 within the year.  He has now stated it will be possible to reduce the army to 20,000.  May I express the hope, especially in view of the great amount of unemployment, that demobilisation will be gradual, and will, as far as possible, only take place in accordance with the requirements of the labour market.  It might be far better under conditions existing at the moment to have 5,000 or 10,000 men in the army under discipline than to have them going out on the unemployment dole and misconducting themselves in a manner in which they could not be dealt with as if they were in the army.  I do not want to go very much further into the question of army discipline.  It is rather a delicate matter, but I think the Government will realise that the overbearing attitude of many army officers resulted in the last election in a considerable number of people voting anti-Government not so much because they were anti-Treaty but because of the overbearing attitude of the servants of the Government.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to the practice of military officers going about in civilian attire. This should be discouraged, and in any other country is not practised to the extent to which it is here.  There is also the question of the non-payment of old outstanding accounts.  I happen to be one of the members who frequently receive communications from constituents of mine who are still owed old accounts dating back to 1922.  I see no reason why those old accounts should be outstanding and why Deputies in this Dáil should be called upon to go to Portobello Barracks frequently to ascertain why such and such an account, which has been outstanding for two years, has not been paid.  The Minister for Finance, in a statement to the Dáil, said that many of those accounts were fraudulent. That may be so in some instances, but it is a remarkable thing to find fraudulent accounts or overcharged ones certified by local officers as being correct. I hope he will give this his attention <Col N="1056" /> so far as the years 1921 and 1922 are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Address claimed that the Government intend, have, and will, continue to take effective steps to deal with all those who challenge its authority. So far as I am concerned, I have always been quite prepared to support the Government in any effective steps they might take, so long as they were constitutional, which they might deem necessary to deal with those who challenge the authority of the people's Government by force of arms, and I am quite sure that every Deputy is prepared to give every possible support to the Government to see that armed robbery, which has recently been such a menace to the citizens of the State, shall be put down, and put down in the strongest possible manner.  I realise that while this armed robbery goes on it makes it very difficult indeed for the State to come forward and ask the people to lend them money, so that it may carry on the ordinary work and machinery of Government.  In my opinion, the extent to which it was going on until recently helped to reduce the credit of the State and to bring down its borrowing powers when it is necessary, as at present, for the State to look to the people for the money required to carry on.</P>
    <P>We have had a very interesting debate on that aspect of the Address dealing with the question of high prices, high profits, and high wages, and, mark you, the Governor-General says: &ldquo;High prices, high profits, and high wages can no longer be sustained by a country whose economic life has agriculture as its base and foundation.&rdquo; I deny that high prices, high profits, and high wages exist in the country's main industry, agriculture, and so far as that aspect of the Address is concerned, it does not exactly picture the situation as we find it today. So far as I can gather, representing, as I do, an area that depends to a large extent upon the prices which it receives for its agricultural produce, profits to the producer have gone down in many cases below pre-war figures, but notwithstanding that there is no reduction whatsoever to the consumer.  I <Col N="1057" /> was deeply interested in the speeches of the merchants, made from the Government benches, speeches largely, perhaps wholly, directed to the question of high wages, without making any attempt whatever to justify the profiteering going on in the community in which they themselves were associated. So far as I can see the producer, on the one hand, and the consumer on the other, are being fleeced, and it is quite possible that if the producers were better organised and the consumers were organised through the co-operative movement they would eliminate that very dangerous section, the profiteering section, which, in my opinion, is the principal cause of the industrial upheavals in recent months.  The Government set up a Commission on Prices that sat for a considerable period.  Deputies have been furnished with the Report and Recommendations of that Commission, but up to the present we have had no indication from the Government, except this very vague thing from the Governor-General, as to what the Government intends to do to deal with the question of profiteering. It may appear strange to say so, but we have to face the facts, and so far as Dublin is concerned, in my opinion the greater part of the trouble is due to the high prices of beer and stout. Deputies may laugh and may appear to think that is not correct, but beer and porter or stout is looked upon, and is, in fact, a food to a certain class of worker, and while the prices stand at their present high level, I think that the Government is not justified in failing to deal with the question.  I have figures to show the profiteering going on in that particular trade.  At the present price the gross profit on the sale of one barrel&mdash;32 gallons&mdash;of draught porter is £3 5s. 0d., draught stout, £5 3s. 0d.; bottled stout consumed on the premises, £9 6s. 7d.; bottled stout consumed off the premises, £5 10s. 5d.  The nett profit on the sale of one barrel of each of the above per week would show, in fifty-two weeks, a gross profit of £1,189 10s. 0d.  If five barrels of each per week were sold the total profit for the year would be £5,947 10s.  The corresponding figures for 1914 were: profit on one barrel a week of draught porter for fifty-two <Col N="1058" /> weeks, £277 11s. 0d., as against £1,189 10s. 0d., and the profit on five barrels of each per week for fifty-two weeks was £1,387 15s. 0d., as against £5,947 10s. 0d. I would like to hear from some Minister what has been done or what they intend to do to deal with the question of profiteering in the licensed trade.  If they deny that it exists, then we know where we stand.  But if they admit it exists to the extent of the figures I have given, I would be glad to hear what they intend to do.</P>
    <P>In the wages disputes during the last six or twelve months the Government have thrown the weight of their influence and support on the side of the employers to bring down what they said were the high wages, while at the same time they have made no attempt to deal with the profiteering.  Deputy Egan referred to what he called the standard of luxury, and indicated that the large increase in the number of picture houses in Dublin, compared with the time when he was a boy, was due to the high wages which the workers are spending in the very foolish manner of patronising picture houses. He did not exactly say that he would rather see the workers remain at home, after a hard day's work, in the slums in rooms for which they paid 10/- or 12/- a week, or go into the nearest public-house and pay the high prices I have indicated for porter.  I do not happen to be a patron of picture houses myself, but it would be very interesting to know from Deputy Egan what liberty or what pleasure he will allow the ordinary worker who has worked hard for eight hours on the Dublin quays, or at some other business.  He referred also, and naturally we have had a good many references of the same kind, to the domestic differences supposed to exist in the ranks of the Labour movement, and indicated pretty clearly that the industrial disputes were created by these alleged differences.  It would be rather an unusual experience, not alone in the family circle, but in the wider sections of the community, among labourers, manufacturers or employers, to find that everybody, in the days in which we are living, were united.  It is quite true that certain individuals who took very little part in the building up <Col N="1059" /> of the Labour movement, and have recently issued a challenge&mdash;a challenge which to me, and I am only speaking as an individual, meant the setting up of a dictatorship within the Labour movement.  As a Labour Party, recognising that the governing principle and the foundation of our movement is that the rule of the majority should prevail, it was up to those of us who stood by the principle of majority rule to stand up to the challenge, and if workers or people associated with the Labour movement, and they are very few, thought fit to support such a claim as that, a claim that definitely meant the setting up of a dictatorship, and if the country suffered as a result of the struggle that went on, not in the Labour Party, but in one particular union, then I think that whatever has been done to defeat that challenge was in the interests of the country and, no doubt, also in the interest of the Labour movement.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an impression in the minds of many speakers, particularly those from the Farmers' and Government benches, from the employers' side, that the only people who pay taxes in this country are the farmers and merchants.  It is quite clear that so far as the taxes of the merchant are concerned they are in all cases passed on to the consumer, so that that aspect of the case does not impress one who finds himself in the position of the ordinary consumer.  There was a very lengthy discussion on the question of finance and high salaries, and the Minister for Agriculture, in dealing with the question of high salaries in the Government service, said: &ldquo;The Dáil is entitled to know that the salaries we pay are what we can afford to pay.&rdquo; Looking through the Estimates, which we scanned very closely in the early part of the year, and which we dealt with at considerable length, one finds it hard to understand why there should be any necessity for three individuals in the Governor-General's establishment drawing £2,800 per annum, and salaries of £1,100, £1,000 and £700, while at the same time the Minister for Agriculture comes along and says there must be a cut in the teachers' salaries, which are not a quarter of what these <Col N="1060" /> individuals' salaries are.  In fact, the item of £2,800 for A.D.C.'s to the Governor-General represents, roughly, the average salary of ten teachers, or the payment at the maximum figure of 107 old age pensioners.  I would be very much interested to see on what grounds the Minister for Agriculture would justify that item, and there are others like it in the Estimates which we passed some time ago.  The Minister for Agriculture also indicated that the cost of living could be reduced only by some superhuman effort on the part of Deputy Johnson.  He did not tell us how he thought Deputy Johnson could do that, but there are ways which I would suggest to the Minister for Agriculture by which he himself could help to bring down the cost of living.  We are well aware that the high internal transport rates are placing a very unfair burden on the charge of the commodity to the home consumer, and on the other hand, that the low rates from British towns, either inland or sea borne to the Irish port gives a decided preference by their low rates, the British articles being dumped into the home market as against our produce.  I would like to give one or two figures to bring it home as clearly as I can to the minds of the Deputies how it works out in practice.  Some time ago I was speaking to a constituent of mine who is a very large egg exporter, and he told me that he was gradually losing his trade in the British market on account of the very high internal freight charges.  I made inquiries, and looked up some of the rate books to see how the position affected him.  I took the cost of eggs from Port Laoghaise to Dublin, a distance of 57 miles, and found it was 9d. per ton per mile; the rate for eggs from Port Laoghaise to London, 385 miles, works out at 3?d. per mile.  The rate from Dublin to London, 334 miles, is 2¾d. per ton per mile, showing that the home consumer is having an unfair burden placed on him by the high internal rates prevailing as against the charges from Dublin to the British markets.  The rate for butter from Ballybrophy to Dublin, 72 miles, is 7d. per ton per mile.  From Dublin to London, 2?d. per ton per mile, and from Ballybrophy to London, 400 miles, the rate is 3d. per ton per mile.  Bacon <Col N="1061" /> from Roserea to Dublin, 83 miles, is 6½d. per ton per mile, and from Dublin to London it is 2?d., and from Roserea to London it is 2¾d.</P>
    <P>Within the Ministry for Agriculture there is a department which used to function previous to the setting up of the Treaty, whereby people who were affected by these very high rates on agricultural produce could seek assistance, and bring their grievances before the Railway Rates Tribunal.  To that extent public funds were at the disposal of people who suffered in this way, and in many cases they succeeded in having the high rates on agricultural produce reduced.  Deputy Gorey would say, no doubt, that the high internal rates are due to the higher wages of the railway workers in Ireland.  I will tell Deputy Gorey in advance that if he can produce evidence in support of that I will be agreeably surprised.  The general conditions of railway men in Ireland and England are the same, with the exception that railway men in Ireland are paid a lower rate for Sunday and overtime work, and 2,000 Irish railway men, who work the very small companies, work 10 per cent. below the average rate for other railway men in Ireland and England.  It is not a question of the higher rate of wages, in this case, and it must be a question of bad organisation in Irish railways.  It is for the Minister for Agriculture, and those behind him, to justify that system, or to say in what way they intend to have it remedied.  I have quoted rates, from my own constitutency, for agricultural produce, and it is a constituency that was a large exporting area so far as these commodities are concerned.  The rates quoted may appear high, but as many people know, for the last two years the railway goods service was very bad; so far as export is concerned, and in many instances these commodities had to be forwarded by passenger train, where the rates are 100 per cent. higher than those I have quoted.  A significant thing in connection with this question of high internal railway rates is that the Northern companies, and companies serving the border in or around the Six Counties area, have reduced their rates to a considerable extent.  Some <Col N="1062" /> time ago a Commission dealing with this question went very closely into the existing railway rates, and an official of the Department of Agriculture in his evidence said that the railway companies, such as the Great Northern, the Midland (Northern Counties), the Belfast and County Down, Dundalk, Newry and Greenore, the Derry and Lough Swilly, the Sligo and Leitrim and Northern Counties, the Cavan and Leitrim, the Clogher Valley, Castlederg and Victoria Bridge, etc., having a total road distance 1,303 miles, of which 530 miles are in Saorstát Eireann&mdash;I merely draw attention to this aspect of the railway rates, so that the Northern companies, which it cannot be said are in a different position to those in the Southern area, have reduced their rates from 150 per cent., pre war, to 100 per cent., as well as abolishing many of the flat rates.</P>
    <P>The result of that is that the people in Mayo, Sligo, Cavan and Leitrim who forward traffic are getting a natural inducement to send their traffic through Belfast port.  That is probably one of the reasons why the railway companies in the Six County area have agreed to this reduction.  The official attached to the Department of Agriculture was asked whether any representations were made to the Southern railway companies to bring about similar reductions. He stated representations had been made, and that the companies declined to agree to any of the reductions that were given by the Northern companies. The financial position of the Southern railways was pleaded as the reason why they could not adopt these reductions.  The official further stated: &ldquo;At the present time none can challenge the reasonableness&rdquo;&mdash;and this is a very important matter for the Minister to explain&mdash;&ldquo;of the rates originally imposed by the Minister of Transport on the 1st September, 1920.  Under the Act it was laid down that any increases directed by him were to be deemed to be reasonable.  The present position is that until there is some repeal of the provisions of that Act, as far as Irish produce is concerned, these high rates of Sept., 1920, obtain, except in so far as the companies may voluntarily modify them as the Northern group did, but <Col N="1063" /> none can compel them to reduce them.&rdquo; That is the evidence of an official associated with the Minister for Agriculture, given at a recent Commission in connection with railway transport rates.  The Minister taunted Deputy Johnson with having in a speech which he said lasted over an hour &mdash; and which got only three inches in the Press&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister, by agreeing that the railways should be allowed to set up and continue to impose these high rates, by his own action imposes a tariff on our exports, and, on the other hand, by allowing the low railway rates on British imported goods to be continued, is associating himself with a tariff on our exports and with the giving of a decided preference to imported goods into this country.  If the Minister is prepared to justify his association with such a policy as that, the Dáil would like to hear how it can be done.  The result of the high rates on farm produce is that the land is being let out to an alarming degree in many areas, and that, in time, will create more unemployment. If things go on as they are going on at present, Ireland will have lost her large export trade, and in addition will become, as England is at present, a country relying largely upon imported articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of profiteering to which I would like to draw attention, and that is the failure of the Ministry of Home Affairs to deal with the question of weights and measures. Owing to the peculiar conditions under which we have been living in this country for the past four or five years there appears to have been no check on weights and measures.  I had a complaint made to me two or three <Col N="1064" /> months ago by people in a certain town in my area that scales were being used for weighing live pigs which were far from being accurate.  When the weight of certain pigs was afterwards tested on another scales it was found that the pigs were considerably heavier than the weight which was given to the owner when the pigs were weighed on the original scales.  If there is any person in that area capable of dealing with that matter I would be very glad to give him information to enable him to institute a prosecution.  It is a very important matter, and some explanation is due to the Dáil for the failure of whatever Ministry is responsible for dealing with it.  Some months since I put down a question drawing attention to that particular aspect of profiteering, and, so far as I can see, nothing has since been done.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to the failure of the Government to get any agreement on the question of future railway policy.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the 3rd January last, made a very long and, apparently, well-considered statement of Government policy on this matter in the Dáil.  He indicated briefly that the Government had turned down the Railway Commission's report, and that they proposed to give to the Irish railway companies three months to make up their minds upon a scheme of grouping which would meet with the approval of the Government.  He further stated that if at the end of a further three months, namely, the 1st July, a scheme of grouping which would meet with the approval of the Government was not brought forward by the railway companies that the Government would proceed to bring in a Bill to deal with the matter.  On the 17th July last the question was discussed rather briefly in the Dáil on the Estimates, and we were informed by the Assistant Minister at the time that President Cosgrave was attending a conference in London with Sir James Craig on the question of the railways.  We have had no indication whatsoever since the 17th July of what transpired at that Conference, or as to whether any progress had been made on the lines of the Government policy at the time. Sir James Craig, speaking at Belleek <Col N="1065" /> on the 13th October, said: &ldquo;They had schemes in view to case the situation with regard to the railways.  The present railway system was not a good one.  In the old days the railways worked their traffic from North to South, but in future there would be amalgamation and they would be worked from West to East and East to West.&rdquo;  I want to ask the Minister whether that statement of Sir James Craig was made as a result of the conference which took place in London between Sir James Craig and President Cosgrave.  We are now five months beyond the period that was allowed to the railway companies to bring in their agreed scheme of grouping, and I think it is in the interest of the Government, of the business community and of everybody who will be affected by whatever change will take place, that the Government should make an immediate statement as to the present position, and as to whether or not there is any likelihood of an agreement being arrived at between the companies concerned; also as to whether or not the Government have definitely made up their minds to go ahead on the lines of the policy indicated by the Minister on the 3rd January.  In case such a decision has been come to I would like the Minister to give us the approximate date for the introduction of the Government's promised legislative proposals, and if he would also indicate whether the Government intend to deal only with the railway companies wholly within the Free State area or with all the railway lines that are within the Free State area.</P>
    <P>Until some such statement is made on the lines I have indicated considerable unrest will prevail in railway, agricultural and commercial circles.  Although the railway companies, to all outside appearances, have made no attempt, or as far as I know, have not come to the agreement that the Ministry wishes, still they are preparing the ground for the time when some scheme of unification, grouping, or nationalisation will take place.  They are effecting economies in many directions and two railway companies recently gave notice of dismissal to members of their staff. That is a very serious position because I anticipate that in whatever scheme of <Col N="1066" /> grouping, unification, or nationalisation that is eventually passed through the Dáil, whatever railway staffs are found redundant will have to receive reasonable protection and compensation if dismissed.  That is what happened in the grouping schemes passed in England where servants were displaced as a result of the combines legalised there.  I think it is very bad policy on the part of any railway company, and especially on the part of a railway company that apparently does not think fit to fall in with the wishes of the Ministry, to prejudice the position of their officials in anticipation of anything that may take place in the near future.  I hope the Ministry will drive it home to the companies concerned that such a policy will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I want also to draw attention to the treatment that the Great Southern and Western Railway Company are meting out to many members of their staff who joined the Railway Maintenance and Protection Corps when it was established. I have received complaints from Cork and from other areas where men were demobilised from the Railway Maintenance and Protection Corps that when they went back to report to the railway company they were kept a considerable time walking about idle before being taken back.  They went to the local station and reported to the stationmaster, agent, or superintendent that they were available for duty.  The stationmaster, the agent, or superintendent wrote to Dublin, and headquarters in Dublin wrote to someone else.  In that way men who have been demobilised have been kept out of employment for 3 or 4 weeks.  I suggest that that is not in accordance with the spirit of the undertaking that was given by the company when the men joined that particular Corps.  I trust the Minister will take the matter up and see that no undue delay of the kind takes place in reinstating men who offered their services when the outbreak occurred in June of last year.</P>
    <P>I want also to ask the Minister if any assistance is given by the Transport Department associated with his Ministry towards the development of tourist traffic.  It is well known that in prewar days this country benefitted to the <Col N="1067" /> extent of four or five million pounds per annum from the large number of tourists who visited it.  I suggest that no more useful work could be done by the Transport Department than encouraging, as far as possible, the development of tourist traffic.  It is pretty well known by those who come into contact with travellers that the hotels in this country are very badly organised for tourist traffic.  Tourists who come to Ireland do not get, in many ways, that attention and consideration that they receive in other countries.  The Transport Department could do a lot of useful work by trying to organise hotel keepers and by assisting to develop a traffic that brought considerable revenue to the country previously.</P>
    <P>On the question of the financial statement made by the Minister, Deputy Milroy indicated in a speech that he made, that there were other means of taxation.  I am sorry he did not indicate what was in his mind when he made that statement, or say if he was in favour of the taxation of bachelors. From what one can see by looking around the Dáil, if the Minister were to introduce legislation for the taxation of bachelors there would be a considerable revenue from the Government benches alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN Mr. P. HOGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to two questions that I think deserve immediate attention.  On the 10th October of last year dealing with the question of compensation to members of the R.I.C. who resigned, the Minister for Home Affairs said: &ldquo;It is the intention of the Government to grant compensation to certain R.I.C. men who resigned or were dismissed in recent years because of their national sympathies. It is intended that such men will receive as generous treatment as if they had remained in the Force until the date of its disbandment.  Legislation will be required to cover such compensation, and it is proposed to introduce appropriate measures as soon after the enactment of the Constitution <Col N="1068" /> as is practicable.&rdquo;  That was 10th October, 1922, and I think it is very bad policy on the part of the Government to have delayed giving the compensation that was promised.  Recently two cases came under my notice. One man came to me in this building a week ago from the area that the Minister represents, and told me he had not enough money to pay for his lodgings that night.  I heard of another case where a man was dying in the poorhouse, as it was called, in Cork.  Honest men, and some of them were honest, who made sacrifices by resigning from the R.I.C. in response to the appeal that was made in July, 1918, do not deserve to be treated in that disgraceful manner.  I suggest that the Sinn Fein organisation that made such promises, as it was entitled to do on behalf of the nation, is in honour bound to carry them out.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that it is his intention to lay regulations on the Table that will enable him to pay the men in accordance with the promises that were made to them.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the question of compensation in connection with the Shaw Commission.  In dealing with that matter some time ago the Minister stated: &ldquo;The Commission which deals entirely with pre-Truce damage has made considerable progress in the issue of its awards, and the machinery set up by the Ministry of Finance has for some time been working at a rate which has overtaken arrears, and keeps pace with the making of awards by the Commission.&rdquo; I want to draw the particular attention of the Minister to the fact that that is not exactly the case.  Two or three people in my area whose homes were burned in pre-Truce days for assisting a then united nation, are now being denied compensation, because they are supposed to be sympathetic with the Irregulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are alleged to have sympathies in that direction.  I cannot say whether that is correct or not, and I cannot say what is the information at the disposal of the Minister on that aspect of the case.  In making inquiries into the matter I found that there are 50 such cases being held up by the Minister for Finance, or someone acting on his behalf in his Department.  I consider that <Col N="1069" /> is a very bad policy on the part of the Minister to deny these people the compensation to which they are rightly entitled for damage done by the Black and Tans.  I suggest that it is not one of the ways by which we can heal up old sores that are open in this country as a result of the dispute over the Treaty.  I suggest it would be a good policy on the part of the Minister to pay such claims without any further delay.</P>
    <P>There is another question dealt with in the Governor-General's Address, the housing question.  That question has been very fully gone into by people who are more competent to deal with it than I am.  I, therefore, only wish to make one point in connection with it.  I happened to be around the Irish coal areas on a couple of occasions recently.  One of the things that appear to affect the workers, particularly in the mining districts of Arigna and Wolfhill, is the lack of proper housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I hope the responsible Minister, when dealing with this question of housing, will make provision for the building of houses in mining areas.  It would not take much to deal with that situation, but it would be one of the ways by which the coal resources of this country would be better developed.  I think it is unfair to see miners having to walk six miles to their work, and working under the horrible conditions which we know exists in some of the Irish mining areas, and to have to walk home again six miles when the work of the day is over.  I make that suggestion to the Ministers and hope that in dealing with the matter they will keep in mind the question of housing in mining areas.</P>

In rising to support the motion of thanks to the Governor-General for his Address there are a few matters to which he referred on which I desire to offer some observations. On the many matters dealt with in that Address, I presume many Deputies may hold different opinions, as to which is the most important problem.  To my mind, the unemployment problem is <Col N="1070" /> one of the most vital, and I am sure that any schemes introduced by the Government will receive every possible attention and support from all sections in the Dáil.  Rather, I should say that anything that tends to give employment and reduce unemployment will receive attention and welcome.  While dealing with the unemployment problem I do not suggest that if unemployment were even now normal that we would be at the end of our troubles and disputes as between capital and labour. I trust that in our deliberations in the future that some definite effort will be made to set up or formally establish an Industrial Arbitration Court with a view to dealing with industrial disputes.  I am glad to know that the Governor-General has suggested that a larger provision is to be made for dealing with the housing question. Notwithstanding the number of houses that have been built throughout the country during the past couple of years there is still a considerable dearth of housing.  In Dublin alone the Corporation have built 200 houses, but that has not diminished the great demand for housing accommodation, and there are thousands of people at the moment living under the most unchristian conditions possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governor-General makes a very important statement on the re-organisation of our railway systems.  They have for a considerable time exercised the minds of the Ministers.  Now I think that is about as important a problem as can be tackled, and I have no doubt that the Government have full scope for their activities in dealing with that matter.  It may be rather a difficult subject to refer to here, but I feel that a little criticism will be very helpful in outlining any future scheme of management which may be in the minds of the Ministry.  The manner in which the Irish railways have been managed in the past, particularly during the old regime, has, in my mind, been most unsatisfactory.  The Irish railway management has been more detrimental to Irish industry and enterprise than any other cause of which I am aware.  I am sure any change in the system of management that operated in the past will, I believe, be for the general interest and advancement of the <Col N="1071" /> country.  The existing rates on merchandise require immediate revision. The fixing of Irish railway rates and charges in London has been a very serious impediment to progress in Ireland in the past, and has considerably hindered the development of Irish transport, including the utilisation of our canals.</P>
    <P>I do not know at the moment if that is still in operation as regards the canals, but I know that until recently it has been so.  I think it has had a detrimental effect on the canal transport service, which touches upon some areas where there are no railways. In any proposed extension of the Irish railway system the industrial centres must be catered for in such a manner as adequately to meet their needs and requirements.  That remark is particularly directed to where industrial effort has failed as a consequence of neglect in the past.  I do not think that it is necessary to remind Deputies that the original intention in the marking out of the railway system in Ireland was not in the interests of the nation, but simply in the interests of military services, and to meet requirements from a military point of view.  Industries have in no case received the attention that they should have received.  I desire to lay stress upon one important point in the matter of railway management and that is the importation of rolling stock. On this matter recently an explanation was submitted by one of our chief railway companies &mdash; the Great Southern and Western &mdash; by way of reply in one of the daily newspapers to a statement made to the Fiscal Inquiry Committee set up by the Government.  The railway company claim that their works are the largest in Ireland, and they claim that the engines and other rolling stock exclusively manufactured at their works could not be surpassed in workmanship or anything else.  I should have said they do not claim that, but I do claim it, and I think anyone who has any knowledge of the work turned out at Inchicore can from no other opinion than that it is nothing short of a scandal that rolling stock is imported into the country when it can be manufactured much better and more economically at Inchicore.  That is <Col N="1072" /> what has been going on in the past.  It is up to the Government to make some effort to stop it.</P>
    <P>As a matter of comparison from an economic side, the Company state it has been their policy to manufacture everything in the nature of rolling stock that they require.  It would be interesting to know what quantity of imported rolling stock and equipment has been ordered from Scotland and England within the last 10 or 12 years. A good deal of the rolling stock that is being used was ordered probably a year or two before it reached here. On the Dublin quays at the present moment one can see a large consignment of axle wheels and many other finished requirements for rolling stock. It is very unfair for the railway companies to say that such work cannot be done as cheaply and as well here. The Company admits that six large engines were imported about two years ago.  I should like to point out that those engines have only been placed on traffic since the recent destruction of the railways and they have not proved very satisfactory as regards oil or coal consumption.  They have already been put down for general overhauling and repairing.  That is what I put forward as an argument in favour of the work that has occasionally been turned out at Inchicore.  In the case of imported rolling stock there has been a greater cost for overhauling and repairing it, and that has added considerably to the expenses which come under the heading exclusively of overhead charges.  Consequently the company put the proposition that owing to the cost of wages, which is generally what they fall back upon, this work could not be done in Ireland.  A short time ago some 20 boilers were imported from England and they had some very serious defects. No provision was made for tube plates or steam pipes and the result was that they have to be overhauled and remedied at Inchicore Works at considerable cost.  The same applies to other large stocks of engine parts that have like defects.  Notwithstanding that the Company have resident Inspectors in stations in England, at substantial salaries, we have not been able to tell to what charge the outlay, <Col N="1073" /> in this respect, has been put to, whether put against the cost of the home product or not; it certainly is not shown against the imported article.  Now the question is why should the Irish Railway Companies desire to purchase finished rolling stock in England at a greater cost than purchasing the raw material outside of England and manufacturing their own rolling stock at home would mean, because it is a fact that the cost of the raw material for home manufacture can be purchased at a lower figure outside England than it can be purchased in England.  By that I would like to make it clear that there is evidently a ring in existence in England inside which the Irish Companies are compelled to buy the finished article notwithstanding the fact that if they manufactured their rolling-stock in Ireland they could import the raw material from outside England at probably half the cost they are paying through the ring in England and which shows, as I would say, that they are paying through the nose.</P>
    <P>The argument in the article that I refer to is a matter that they dealt with some time ago, and it is that the principal cause is that the existing rate of wages paid to skilled and semi-skilled tradesmen here are so much in excess of those paid in Great Britain that it is a question whether we can continue to manufacture new rolling stock at Inchicore as cheaply as it can be imported. That article at the moment referred to the question of importing a number of coaches from England, and I am glad to say that since the publication of that article that whatever communication had taken place between the men and the Company the result was that the men are making the four or five coaches though it had been intended to import them from England.  Now the Company have not explained why they made this change.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce had anything to do with it or not, but the fact remains that the Company's case that they were paying £300 each more for the home article than for those imported has apparently fallen to the ground, and I hope that is the last we will hear of the importation of rolling stock by the Great Southern Railway.  At the moment I do not wish <Col N="1074" /> to refer any further to that particular matter except to say that some of the material which I believe is at the North Wall is for the Cork and Passage Railway. I do not know what amount of plant they have down there for finishing raw material work for minor requirements, but I think some effort ought to be made by the Government to secure that all this money, which runs into huge sums annually, ought to be kept in Ireland and used for providing much needed employment.  My main reason in bringing these matters before the Dáil is with that object in view.  I do not stand here to take up a case, or to exploit a case on behalf of the men on the wages question, but I do believe that if there is any difference of opinion between the Companies and their men on the question of wages, by which it can be made possible to keep all this work at home, the men will do their part.</P>
    <P>There is just another matter to which I may refer, and that is this: the Governor-General in his statement referred with gratitude to the services of the various arms of our National Defence. I feel that the best gratitude we could extend to those men who have borne the brunt of the unfortunate struggle in the trouble in the past is that a good honest effort ought to be made to provide them with employment on their disbandment from the Army.</P>

      <P>The Governor-General's Address provides us with a very large field for debate.  It has been used to a very great extent, and to an extent that I do not intend to follow myself. But I wish to refer to one portion of that Address in which the Governor-General deals with the question of unemployment and with the results that follow from it.  The words of the Governor-General are:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem of unemployment which confronts us has had the special consideration of your Ministers.  They are confident that, with stable conditions, enterprise will find many opportunities in this <Col N="1075" /> country.  Developments are at present hampered by disagreements between employers and employees to the loss not only of those directly concerned but of the general community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that at the present moment the question of unemployment and what it means for Ireland, and the question of the various disputes that have taken place between employers and employees is a matter that deserves the very greatest consideration from this Dáil.  A strike or a lock-out is, to my mind, a war without guns.  In its results, it is quite as injurious in its own way as war, and like war, it rarely justifies itself.  If we hope for a development of industries in this country we must see that both employers and employees, capital and labour, meet together on the one solid ground, and that is to arrange between themselves that their joint efforts have got to be for the advancement of these industries, and to have these industries so carried on in the country that they will command the confidence of all.  There is really little use in counting that those who have money in Ireland they will place it in Irish industries to develop factories in the country if they are to be met with, in twelve months' time, a strike of their workers employed in these factories.  Neither can we expect that the workmen of this country are going to remain in Ireland if they are certain, in the first instance, of better wages in another country, and, above all, if they are certain that their employment is to be more constant elsewhere.  Labour disputes are injurious to both parties, injurious to capital and to labour.  We cannot expect either that those in foreign countries, in America or elsewhere, who may wish to start industries in this country, will come here unless they see some certainty or some security that not alone will they be able to earn a fair interest on the capital invested but that they have security in the industry when it is started.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been engaged several months in trying to arrange the various disputes that have taken place in this <Col N="1076" /> country.  We have been confronted with one of them lately in the shipping dispute, and others of them are still unsettled.  I ask, why is there not some result to be gained from the labours of the Minister and those who have been associated with him in bringing these disputes for the time being to a happy ending.  If these disputes are not to recur within a period of six months or three months, or maybe a month, it is rather a pity that all these efforts have been made only to secure a temporary continuance of the trade of the country.  We hope in Ireland that all the hidden wealth of this country will be developed, that her mines and her minerals will be got working, that existing industries will thrive and that new industries can be brought here.  Surely if there is a difference between capital and labour to be everlastingly cropping up and coming before us, there will be no confidence; capital will not be invested, and labour will have no confidence in capital unless machinery is found by which these various disputes can be avoided, and until such time that in this country the lock-out on the one hand, or the strike on the other, will only be availed of when every other means has failed to bring the two sections together.</P>
    <P>In Australia, in 1890, a big strike occurred when the ranchers and the graziers got into a war that practically destroyed most of New South Wales and New Zealand.  They found that it was necessary to construct some kind of machinery by which the trade of the country was not going to be ruined and that financial loss was not going to be brought on the ranchers, and that the employers were not going to be driven to starvation or forced to go to other countries to earn a living.  In 1894 they established their Conciliation and Arbitration Courts.  There were various Acts of Parliament passed in Australia, New Zealand and New South Wales between 1895 and 1912 by which these Conciliation and Arbitration Courts were brought into conformity with what was necessary for the good of the country.  These Courts secured what they desired, and what they were meant to secure, peace between capital and labour.  Possibly they have not <Col N="1077" /> attained all that was expected of them, but this they did for Australia, and to a certain extent they have done the same in America; they prevented strikes that would otherwise have taken place, and they succeeded in making capital have confidence in the country, and also succeeded in bringing larger sums of money to be invested in Australia, New South Wales and New Zealand, both in land and in factories.</P>
    <P>Now, I believe from what I have heard that there are many Conciliation Boards at present working in Ireland. Some are working on railways and a few are connected with creameries.  If it were the spirit of the Dáil, as I believe it is of the people of the country, that strikes and locks-out should be avoided and that women and little children should not be made to suffer hunger and poverty, it would be for us to adopt every available method, to use any machinery within our power to have those evils avoided.  The hardships of a lock-out, when men are turned out of their employment, because employers have to compete with the manufacturers in other countries, could be avoided if these Conciliation Boards were set up.  These grievances could be met by the formation of such boards as have been formed in other countries with representatives from both employers and employed in equal proportions.  If such boards fail to compose the differences in their own particular district they should go before an arbitration court at which a member of the legal profession should be chairman, and whilst that court was sitting a strike or lock-out should be declared illegal with the consent of every member of the Dáil.  That suggestion of mine does not interfere either with the right of men when forced to strike for a higher wage, or with the right of the employer to lock his men out, and to fight the matter out as they have already done.  My idea is to see that these disputes that are ruining the industry of the country should be avoided, and that people who have money, say in foreign securities because they are afraid to invest it at home, could put it into Irish industries when they knew that such industries would not be upset within twelve months.  I hope my views will <Col N="1078" /> fall on willing ears, and that Deputies will consider the matter in the same spirit in which I have brought it forward. If at a later stage representatives from each of the parties in this Dáil form into a small Committee and discuss the possibility of setting up these courts and recommend them to the country, I believe that every Deputy will have the support of all his constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise the question of the alleged refusal of the Government to hand over the body of the hunger striker who died yesterday morning to his relatives for burial.  In any remarks I am going to make here I do not wish to aggravate the situation.  I think that the decision of the Government, if the reports in the newspapers are true, is an extraordinary one, and I think it would be found that, so far as the opinion of the people of the country is concerned, the decision is not a wise one.  The decision arranging that this man's body should be retained by the prison authorities to be buried within the precincts of the prison amounts almost to this, that this man, who has been an untried prisoner, and who has been in prison for twelve months, is to be treated as if he was an ordinary murderer.  I do not think that that is wise, and I believe that every Deputy here and everybody in the country will <Col N="1079" /> agree that the decision of the Government to permit the meetings of the Republican Party to be held, to permit the Republican publications to appear, and not to interfere with the Republican propaganda, is a wise one.  I believe if the Government are prepared to reconsider this question, and if we have a statement to-night to the effect that they are willing to hand over the remains, it will have a very reassuring effect throughout the country.  I do not intend to elaborate this matter any further, but I think that we who have the reputation of being very generous to our dead and of giving them decent funerals will be establishing a bad precedent if we deny our opponents the right to a Christian burial.  In the County Cork the mother of the hunger striker is living.  She is an old woman on the verge of the grave, and it would be very sad if this man's body were not allowed to go back to be buried amongst his own people.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the views expressed by Deputy Murphy.  I think it is an unwise policy that, it is stated, has been decided upon.  I hope it has not been decided upon by the Government.  I think it would reflect badly upon their good-sense and general policy.  On the lowest grounds, I think there would be very much more advantage taken to the detriment of the Government's good name by the refusal to let the body of an untried prisoner be taken home than could be taken even by the most elaborate demonstration, the fear of which is, presumably, the reason why the Government is said to have come to the decision not to allow the body of this prisoner to be sent home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the case made by Deputy Murphy that he is an untried prisoner and that we have no right to consider him in the light of a criminal is sufficient to justify the demand that he makes that the body of his constituent should be returned to his home for burial.  I do not think that there is any need for me to elaborate further. I simply add my earnest plea to his that the Government would reconsider the decision they have come to and <Col N="1080" /> hand over the body of Denis Barry to his relatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as the Government regret having to take such a decision as this, the fact is that having all the circumstances in mind and having carefully considered the matter the Government have decided that in the case of any of the prisoners dying on hunger strike they will not hand over the body to the friends at this particular stage for burial.  It is not a question of refusing a man Christian burial or burying him as an ordinary criminal.  The remains will get proper and reverential burial but inside premises that are official premises.  If later, when the circumstances are such that advantage cannot be taken of a funeral demonstration to prejudice the safety of the State or to jeopardise further the lives of men who are still hunger-striking in prison, the friends of Barry or of any other person who may die in this wretched hunger-strike desire it, facilities will be granted to have the body of any such person transferred from the burial ground at present provided by the Government to any burial ground his friends or family may wish.  The Government have to emphasise again the fact, that just now as at any other time during the last twelve months or more when the safety of the State is prejudiced and endangered, it is their duty to safeguard the State.  Every type of pressure that can be brought on men to throw their lives away in a useless protest, in a protest about nothing that can be achieved, is being brought to bear on men many of whom are generous men, generous as regards honour and general intentions but nevertheless a danger to the State, and the most unscrupulous pressure is being brought on them to sacrifice their lives in this particular way, and day by day, and week by week this, that, and the other inducement is held out by people outside who are unscrupulous in the matter, that if the men inside hold out another day or week this, that and the other thing will be achieved.  The men inside were simply filled with dismay for having to adopt the situation that they had been forced into and they feel that instead of being ordered to continue the <Col N="1081" /> strike, the hunger-strike should be called off by those outside.  Instead of that, this type of pressure is being brought to bear on them.  In the circumstances the Government have decided not to put into the hands of those people who are working up this pressure the additional opportunities <Col N="1082" /> of funeral demonstrations that would have the result of sacrificing additional lives inside, and perhaps additional lives outside.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 until Thursday, 22nd November, at 3 p.m.</P>
