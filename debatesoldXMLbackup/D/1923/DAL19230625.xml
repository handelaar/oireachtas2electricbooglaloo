      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £79,788 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March 1924, for expenditure in respect of Reformatory and Industrial Schools, including places of detention.&rdquo; Already a sum of £28,500 had been voted on account.</P>

      <P>When these Estimates were under consideration last year some suggestions were made with regard to the provision of pensions for the teachers engaged in these Industrial Schools.  I would like to know if anything has been done in that direction during the past year.  Would the Minister be in a position to give us any forecast as to whether or not it is proposed to bring those schools under the Ministry of Education in the proposed Ministries Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they will be brought under the Ministry of Education, and the Reformatories will continue under the Ministry of Home <Col N="2386" /> Affairs.  In regard to pensions, of course it is not a year since the question was raised.  Nothing has been done.  As a matter of fact, it would require a departure from the present system of financing before anything much could be done, as the schools are assisted by the State on a capitation basis.  No account is taken of the way in which the schools themselves expend the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to draw the Minister's attention to the question of the Phillipstown Reformatory. There seems to be an impression in the minds of people in the district that, in view of the number catered for in the institution, it is not necessary that such a large expenditure should be involved. I would like to know whether or not at a later date it would be possible to consider the advisability of closing this as a Reformatory and reopening it as a growing industrial concern connected with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reformatory schools run by the one Order&mdash; Glencree and Phillipstown.  They are both in serious financial difficulties owing to the fact that they are paid on a capitation basis and that the number of pupils has decreased very seriously.  Of course, the overhead charges have not fallen in proportion.  Taking the two institutions together, the numbers fell from 481 in 1916 to 90 in the present year.  The schools applied for an increased capitation grant, but the Ministry of Finance was not able to accede to that application. Take, for instance, the question of committals.  In 1914 the number of committals was 124.  Even as recently as 1916 the number was 136.  Last year it fell to 18.  We are advised that one of the institutions should be closed, but the management of the schools urged that they were good and useful institutions. That is a matter that will have to be thought out.  There is not any need for them at the moment, nor is there even a possibility, if the present state of affairs continues very long, to keep both going.  So far they have declined to take our advice that one of the schools should be closed.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister assist us with further information relative to sub-head E?  Can he tell us <Col N="2387" /> what is included in the 7s. and the 2s. 6d. temporary additional capitation grant in augmentation of a corresponding grant from local authorities?  I would like if the Minister would analyse the current normal charges, irrespective of the number of people maintained in the establishment, and the charges that might be grouped under the heading of rations or food supplies.  Would it be possible for the Minister to give us under this head as full information as we had in connection with the Dundrum Asylum?  In connection with Dundrum Asylum we had particulars regarding the victualling for patients and rations for the attendants, clothing for patients and uniform clothing.  Can the Minister assist us in finding out what is covered by the 7s. allowance and the 2s. 6d. in augmentation of a corresponding grant from local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no direct control over this institution.  Dundrum Asylum is different; it is a State institution. Every item of expenditure is sanctioned by Government authority; scales of pay and clothing allowances are sanctioned by the Treasury.  These schools are independent bodies, which carry on their work in their own way, subject to inspection and general regulations, but they are not subject to financial control. They simply received the grants fixed a considerable number of years ago, which they now allege to be insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hopeful there would be a case made by the authorities concerned for the temporary additional capitation grant, and that in the course of making that case they would tell us what the cost of maintenance would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Reformatories there was not a detailed case set out to that extent, because they relied on the rather obvious case that instead of 200 boys they had only 18, and the capitation grant was, of course, insufficient.  If the Minister for Finance had been minded to increase the capitation grant we should probably have the whole thing considered in detail; but as they did not feel like increasing it only the general case came up for consideration.</P>

      <P>When one looks at the figures presented to us in this Estimate, when one looks at them with all the charity one can muster, one asks oneself whether all this Department is in truth and in fact very much more than a most unsatisfactory Publicity Department for the present Government.  The first question one is entitled to ask, and to which one is entitled to an answer, is: What value are we going to get for this £60,000 if we vote it?  And in seeking to obtain an answer to that question it is not unreasonable to ask oneself what kind of value the country is getting for the money it has spent on this Department in recent months?  One asks oneself whether in truth and in fact this particular Estimate is not intended by the Treasury to be a comic relief of the Estimates.  I remember a few months ago talking to a gentleman, who is now a very distinguished person in the State, about our future conduct of foreign affairs under the Treaty.  He said to me: &ldquo;Foreign affairs!  Why, once the Treaty is through, all the foreign affairs we will want will be trade.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, one does not argue with a gentleman like that, and I did not argue with him.  But look first at what is proposed in respect to trade, if trade only is the concern of our external affairs.  I look down the list, and I confess I am not lost in admiration at the long array of Consular offices that we have established on the Continent and America, as well as Consuls and Vice-Consuls to push our trade and to bring Irish trade into touch with foreign commerce.  I do not see the numerous offices we have abroad, where we can go when we are in trouble, for the protection of our Consuls.  I do not see the offices to which we can go in connection with passports.  I do not see the Consular offices which are going to deal with ships' cargoes, manifests and ships' papers, although it is notorious <Col N="2389" /> that if you establish Consulates in places where they are wanted, the fees on passports and ships' papers will more than pay for your Consulates.  I do not even see any provision for that register of our Irish Nationals abroad which one would have thought an Irish Government would be anxious to get established at the earliest possible moment.  Instead of that, what do we find?</P>
    <P>We find that our representatives in Italy have gone out of business altogether. We find that our representative in Spain has been scrapped.  We find that, although there may be a shadow of a representative in Berlin, in fact that office might as well not exist; and we find that even in Paris the expected developments have not matured.  I do not recollect in the course of the year having come across any considerable or inconsiderable quantity of data in the Press from our Consuls abroad for the information of people in Ireland.  The Ministry which looks after our Consuls does not seem to think it necessary to give the country the benefit of the very valuable advice they no doubt receive from our representatives abroad.  One might have thought that, in view of the terms of the Treaty, assimilating our position to that of Canada, that one of the first things to do would be to appoint a representative in Ottawa, and if there were difficulties during the past year in so doing, one would have expected to see some such official in the Estimates for the present year.  But that representative again is conspicuous by his absence.  So that whether our foreign relations be trade only, or be something very much more, comprising trade, it is difficult upon these Estimates and upon the data before us to see where we are getting value for £60,000.</P>
    <P>We after all, are not merely a little island in the far distant corner of Europe. We are a world race.  And we are entitled to let the world know that we consider ourselves a world race.  I look to these Estimates in vain for any sign that we intend to give any such message to the world&mdash;for any sign of the fact that we realise that our geographical position gives us a unique opportunity as a link between the old world and the new.  If these things are realised, that realisation is not carried into practice under the present Government.  I should imagine <Col N="2390" /> that for our own protection we require to come out into the open.  We require to make friends with foreign people, and to make ourselves known abroad, and to forge links of friendship that will last for our own protection and for our commercial interests.</P>
    <P>I fail, in going through these Estimates, to see one single direction in which we have explored any new avenue, or indication that we intend to explore any new avenue in the coming twelve months of peace.  That seems to me very remarkable, and I think a very significant fact in dealing with the Ministry of External Affairs.  So far as I am aware, we have never done what is done by every nation coming for the first time into its own&mdash; attaining for the first time the recognition of the world.  We have not sent envoys to foreign Powers notifying them of our emergence from foreign domination.  I ask the Minister to let us know how many, and which, foreign Powers now give us official recognition?  I ask how many, and which foreign Powers recognise our envoys, consular or diplomatic, as what they are?  And how many foreign Powers have since the Treaty sent representatives accredited to us in Dublin?  The larger the number he can give in his reply the better I shall be pleased.</P>
    <P>We had the other day a little item in the newspapers which seemed very significant. An Irishman proposed to tour the world in his yacht.  He could not sail under the Irish flag.  Why not?  He said it was the fault of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I should be glad to know what the Minister has to say to it. It seems strange after all those months that an Irish vessel cannot sail the world under her own flag.  The truth is that in this Department you have triumphantly exhibited the policy of the Ministry in regard to Great Britain, the policy of &ldquo;Yes, if you say so.&rdquo;  Our foreign affairs have become external affairs. &ldquo;Don't you think it would sound rather nicer to have external rather than foreign affairs?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, yes if you say so.&rdquo;  It is the same policy as we have had in the mangling of our Constitution.  It is the same policy we have had again and again, and it is the same policy apparently that it is intended to continue and perpetuate in the coming year.  We do not know what the Minister has to <Col N="2391" /> say about the non-registration of the Treaty at Geneva.  Everybody knows under the Covenant of the League of Nations that a Treaty entered into must be registered by one of the signatories, and if it is not registered in Geneva it is absolutely void.  Have any representations been made by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Great Britain pointing out that the plain duty of Great Britain is to register the Treaty in Geneva, and, if so, what answer has been received?  I invite the Minister to take the Dáil into his confidence upon that interesting question.  There are other matters also left out of the columns where you would expect to see them figuring.  Other countries, notably Great Britain, make a point of sending to America and Continental countries their distinguished men of letters and their distinguished men in art and science in order to establish contact, in order to get themselves appreciated by foreign peoples, and in order to make friendships.  We have plenty of distinguished people who would do us honour if we sent them on these visits abroad.  I fail to see in these Estimates any provision for carrying out any such plan.  I, for one, take the view on that point that it is so useful that I should not question any amount the Minister would put down for carrying out that purpose.  He goes to the other extreme, impressed, no doubt, by what was done in Dáil Eireann in other days, when too much attention was devoted to the entertainment and hospitality of foreigners. He leaves out that item altogether, except in the case of the United States, and the unfortunate people whom you do send abroad to represent us are not given, so far as I can see, one cent with which to discharge the normal, ordinary hospitality which they will have to discharge if they are going to enter into the social and diplomatic life of the country to which they are sent.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I see no sign of such item except in the case of the United States.  I should like to see provision for an Irish Commission to be sent to Canada and South Africa.  We know that there are questions as to what exactly are Dominion rights in this direction or in that.  We know that everything the British Dominions have won in the past years has been won in the teeth of bitter opposition <Col N="2392" /> from Downing Street.  Would it not be judicious and prudent in these circumstances that we should inform ourselves on the spot as to what is the South African and Canadian view of this or that problem which are now our problems? Would it not be judicious and prudent that in those special directions we should form for ourselves links and friendships that will be used bye-and-bye? We may be doing it, but I see no trace of it on this Vote.</P>
    <P>I turn to the establishment at home, and when I compare that Ministerial Department with others I am struck by the fact that wholly inadequate provision is made for carrying on a real Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One would have thought that the Minister would recommend that he should have not only a Commercial Secretary, with a commercial staff, looking after foreign trade and collecting data, but also a Political Secretary, whose business would be to find out what was going on abroad, and to direct our representatives abroad accordingly, and a further constitutional or legal secretary who would watch the development of the very important issues arising between Great Britain and her Dominions, issues which will now affect us.  There is no sign of that, nor of any intention of making the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a real, live, Ministry dealing with our Foreign Affairs by some such method as that, by establishing here in Dublin secretaryships or sub-departments to look after the main heads of what ought to be one of our principal Ministries.  We do not even see any sign of the very interesting proposal I once heard of, to bring out a book on Ireland. Other countries, under similar circumstances, realising that they are not known abroad, realising that they have been misrepresented abroad, realising that they have a good deal to say which would interest foreign people, and that it is necessary to interest foreign people in their country, bring out a book on their country, and send copies to their agents in order that people who may want to take an interest in that country may have data accessible to them.  That would be a very valuable scheme to carry out, but I look in vain for any trace of it in these Estimates.  There is only one thing more to which I want to draw attention, and it is an item or two which intensifies the impression that we are <Col N="2393" /> not intending to take the foreign affairs portion of this Estimate seriously.  I looked at item (B) (4) postage, stationery, telegrams, telephones.  On looking down the list I observe that while our stationery, postage, telegrams, and telephones are going to cost us £400 in the United States of America, in Paris we shall be able to get on for the whole twelve months on the modest sum of £5, £5 for stationery at the Paris Office for the whole of twelve months, and that is called a serious representative office of the Irish Free State abroad!  I know the gentleman who administers that office. He is a competent man.  How then does it come to pass that we are asked to vote £5 for stationery, etc., in the Paris Office in the year 1923-24?</P>

      <P>Do I gather that the Minister blames the printer? I am very glad to hear it, particularly as I observe there is to be an allowance of £1,000 for an additional staff in this office.  The Minister will agree that I had some reason for my surprise in this particular item.  There are other points, but I will content myself with asking the Minister whether he seriously asks the Dáil to consent to paying 17s. 6d. a week to what he calls an office girl in the London Press Bureau.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has asked what value we we are going to receive for this money, and he goes on to say that during the recent months apparently nothing worth mentioning has been done by the Department of External Affairs.  I would like to say that if he said nothing of value was done by the Ministry of External Affairs prior to recent months, I might have agreed with him.  He says the list of Consuls is not impressive.  The fact is we began a few months ago without any foreign affairs that we could call foreign affairs, but with a certain number of representatives abroad.  The only useful functions they could serve abroad up to that were those of Publicity agents.  They handicapped themselves with such high-sounding titles as Ambassadors and Colonial Ambassadors. I inherited a <i>damnosa haereditas</i> when I <Col N="2394" /> took over this office.  I was told the office in Italy was closed down.  We had two representatives in Italy.  One represented trade, the other the country generally.  The man who represented the country generally was an avowed adherent of the internal enemies of this State, but was a thoroughly honest man. He resigned as he could not act in accordance with his conscience for this State.  The other man was not an avowed adherent of the enemies of this State, and was not an honest man. When we found he was dishonest he ceased to represent us.  We will reestablish that office as soon as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>We feel we are in a position to get value for our money. As regards the office in Spain, we had a man in Spain who reported that he thought the office could serve no useful purpose there owing to the fact that Spain had no foreign policy, and for other reasons.  With regard to Berlin we have an office there, and I am advised by other Departments to whom it gives information that it is doing fairly useful work.  At the same time I intend to go into the matter, and see if it needs reform and re-construction.  The Deputy complains that he does not get commercial information in the paper that should be available.  I am not quite sure how the matter stands at present, but it was intended some time ago by the Department of Industry and Commerce to publish a journal.  I am not quite sure how that matter stands now, but the Consuls do send home information which is duly passed on to the Department of the Ministry for Industry and Commerce. Unless I am mistaken I think they intend making the use I explained of that. The Deputy complains that we have not explored new avenues.  We actually have, as a matter of fact, because everything we did was new.  We regard our Departments from the utilitarian point of view.  We are not anxious to have elaborate Embassies in other countries where our representatives will spend money in entertaining people. We are only anxious to send a man abroad who will do valuable work so that we shall get value for our money.  As time goes on it will be clearer where those representatives are unnecessary. <Col N="2395" /> and where they will do useful work.  We do not propose to spend money, until we are sure it serves a useful purpose, and then we shall not hesitate to spend it.  The Deputy asks what steps we took to inform foreign powers of our emergence.  We did inform certain foreign powers of our emergence, and I have letters received in reply which were published in the public Press.  They certainly include America, France, and Italy, and I think replies were received from Signor Mussolini and President Poincairé which were published in the Press.  I had to work with the machinery I had inherited, and had to regard it necessarily on a temporary basis because the continuance of those various offices was determined by whether they served a useful purpose or not.  As regards our representatives, most of those men are recognised as temporary until they are made permanent. The various Governments of the country in which they are living have been notified of their existence there, and of the functions they are to fulfil.  With regard to the matter of the Ensign, and the Irish flag not being able to be flown in foreign waters that is a matter for the introduction of a Bill into this Dáil by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; I believe that Bill will be introduced some time in the future, and I suppose it was not considered as urgent as some of the other Bills introduced.  The Deputy says we have adopted an attitude of saying to Great Britain &ldquo;Yes, if you say so,&rdquo; and he instances the fact that we called our Department the Department for External Affairs.  The British did not ask us to call it External Affairs, and we did not ask them if we would call it External Affairs.  It was called so because it was to deal with everything that was external to our own territory.  With regard to the non-registration of the Treaty the Deputy says that the Treaty was null and void because it was not registered with the League of Nations. We are acting on the assumption that the Treaty is not null and void; we have not asked England to register the Treaty with the League of Nations because we feel we are able to look after our own business, and as it is quite possible we shall ourselves be members of the League of Nations before the year <Col N="2396" /> is out, we shall look after the registration of our own Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested the sending abroad of distinguished Irish people to &ldquo;establish contact.&rdquo;  Well, we are, undoubtedly, economical, since economy was forced upon us by the system which prevailed earlier with regard to this Department, when there was a great tendency to send distinguished people abroad.  It was hard, exactly, to understand what they were sent abroad for. Entertaining abroad was, to my mind, an absolute scandal.  The only way to bring it home to people who were in the habit of spending our money with an ease and distinction which was very expensive to us, was to stress the other pedal.  We have stressed that, but under &ldquo;incidental expenses,&rdquo; there is a certain margin allowed for entertaining abroad.  However, I made it perfectly clear to every man abroad that if he entertains, we will require to know exactly how much he has spent, the reason he spent it, and how it was likely to improve our financial or international position.</P>
      <P>With regard to a Commission to the Dominions to inform ourselves of the developments there, one of our representatives has been to Ottawa.  He has not been established there, but he was there for a certain time and he pursued very useful inquiries.  His mission has, undoubtedly, been very useful to us. He met people like the Prime Minister of Canada and everybody who was likely to be able to give us information.  If, during the year, we find that it would be advisable to establish a permanent office there, it will be a matter for a supplemental estimate.  In preparing this Estimate, which I think, gives in very full detail all that is being done, the Finance Department preferred us not to estimate merely for potentialities, but to deal with things that were obvious and were in the nature of established expenditure, and in the event of our embarking on any new measures, that would be a matter for consideration later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy complains that I have not a commercial secretary, a political secretary, and a legal secretary assisting the Ministry.  The Ministry of Industry and Commerce advises us commercially, and the Legal Department advises us on constitutional matters.  With regard to the book about Ireland, that would be <Col N="2397" /> useful, but whether it would be so useful as to justify the expenditure that it would involve, in the present state of our finances, is very doubtful.  With regard to the £5 for stationery in Paris, the Deputy if he tots the figures across will find that it should not be £5 but £85. With regard to 17/6 for the London Press Bureau office girl, that Bureau is being closed down and is being incorporated in the office of the High Commissioner over there, so that that matter does not arise. With regard to the small estimate for stationery and so forth, we have, owing to the bad tradition that had grown up, found it necessary almost to shriek economy to our representatives abroad, and we feel that if the estimate is small they will curtail expenses, and they will be less likely to be extravagant than they were when they had an unlimited estimate.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed myself that the passports are not ready so far.  There is an international passport form in which elaborate precautions are taken to prevent forgery. The Stationery Office has the matter in hand.  I have urged that everything that could possibly be done in Ireland should be done in Ireland.  The matter of overprinting and binding of the passport, which is in one piece, folded and bound, presents certain technical difficulties in Ireland, which has made for this delay. The matter is well in hand now, I understand from the Stationery Office, and I think I will be able to have the passport made in Ireland and ready within the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>I was hopeful that the statement by Deputy Gavan Duffy would have called forth the kind of statement one might reasonably expect from the Minister, in explanation of the Vote or programme of the Department for the coming year.  I am sorry I have been disappointed.  There are two or three matters on which I would still like to have some light.  I note the explanation that has been given regarding the staff at Headquarters, and the reply to the case made by Deputy Gavan Duffy as to the shortage of expert advice.  It did occur to me, when Deputy Gavan Duffy was <Col N="2398" /> speaking, that perhaps the Minister for Home Affairs would have a reasonable right to call upon the Minister for External Affairs for some information as to the conduct of different nations abroad in regard to their prisoners&mdash;Turkey or Prussia or Russia, for instance, or any of those countries which have had internal political troubles during the last 25 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>The item on which I would like information, more particularly, is in regard to the publicity side.  I raised the question the other day on another Vote, but did not draw any clear explanation as to whether it is true or not that under the Department then under discussion printed matter was going forward without any indication that it was an official publication.  I wonder whether it is in connection with this department that we should discuss that question, or whether the Minister can put us in the way of finding out what department it is that is issuing printed matter of a propagandist kind, which would presumably come under Publicity, without any indication that it is official.</P>
      <P>If it is this department I think it is a practice that ought not to be continued. It may be a secret service job, and it may be explained under the heading of Secret Service.  I am inclined to think, and I will assume, for the purpose of this statement, that it is the Minister for External Affairs who is responsible, and that it is the Publicity Department that is the actual executive body issuing propagandist material, printed without any indication that it is official, or that it is issued in the name of or by the Government. The importance of this is that some of this matter is not boosting the Free State, but is boosting the present Government of the Free State and that is work that ought not to be done without a signature.  It ought to be clear to the readers of such literature, if it can be ennobled by that name, that it is being issued by the Department of State responsible for such publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an item here on page 201, &ldquo;Books, Newspapers, Pamphlets, etc., on Publicity work, £7,500.&rdquo;  Will the Minister tell us what newspapers, if any, are being published under his auspices, whether they are being published or whether it is only an estimate of money that will be required at some future date to publish newspapers.  I am assuming that <Col N="2399" /> this is for the publication of newspapers, not for the purchase of newspapers.  As regards the distribution of literature and billposting, I think we have a right to some information as to whether this is work done for a political party.  Is it work being done for a political party to support political party propaganda?  Would the Minister agree, and would the Dáil direct that samples of all this literature should be put on the table or exhibited somewhere so that members should know what is being done with their money?  The Sub-head <i>(b)</i> 1 suggests that the Minister would be assisting the Dáil if he would give us a clear indication of the respective positions of the various representatives abroad.  I notice, for instance, that there is an envoy at Washington; there is a Consul at New York, there is a representative at Geneva, a Consul at Brussels, Consul at Rotterdam, a Consul at Berlin, a Trade Representative and Head of the Irish Bureau at Paris.  What I would like to know is whether there is anything to determine either the status or the description of these various representatives. Why is a man in one place called an envoy or a representative and in another place a Consul?  Are they recognised as representatives by the Governments of the respective countries, or are they recognised as Consuls by the Governments of those countries?  I am not inclined to find any fault even if they are not.  I think we may still have to wait a little before full recognition of the new status is given, but I think the Dáil is entitled to know exactly where we stand in this matter, and whether there is any difference in the relationships as between one country and another in respect of these various representatives.  On that matter also hinges this question of the use of a flag.  It may not be a very great concern that a yacht going on an adventure may have to fly the British flag, but I think it is somewhat different if a Government vessel has to haul down its own flag and hoist a British flag when going into another port.  The practice of hoisting the flag of the country the ships are visiting I think is a common act of courtesy, a trade custom and a diplomatic custom, but it is not usually accompanied by the hauling down of the flag of the country to which the ship belongs. If that is not the case with the merchant ship surely it ought not to be the case with the Government ship.  I am reliably informed <Col N="2400" /> that that is the position in regard to this Irish Fisheries vessel that has been sent to Belfast to be repaired, that she is, as a matter of fact, flying the British flag, and that she hauled down any emblem which would show that she was a vessel belonging to the Irish Free State before entering the River Lagan.  That requires some explanation, and whatever saving may have been made in the price of the repairs was very dearly purchased at that additional cost.</P>
    <P>Referring again to publicity, perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the book on Ireland that I think Deputy Gavan Duffy referred to is actually in course of preparation.  There was a certain prospectus issued some time ago that a book was to be published called &ldquo;Ireland a Nation,&rdquo; under official auspices.  Whether that was official auspices within Ireland or not, I do not know.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's explanation, but if it were under official auspices I think it would have been more creditable to the official authorities if they had supervised at least the prospectus and not allowed the publishers to publish page after page of lies upon lies. I may be quite wrong in suggesting the official auspices were the auspices of the Irish Government.  They may have been the auspices of the English or American Government.  In that case the remarks have no pertinence to this discussion.  I note too&mdash;and I think it is of interest, and perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Assistant may take a note of it, as an indication of what might be done&mdash;that we can get a typist in Berlin for 11s. 6d. a week, inclusive.  I have no doubt that is a salary almost equivalent to a millionaire's. But one wonders how far when we are going outside the Saorstát we should take advantage of the scale of living which would allow a typist to work at 11s. 6d. a week.  I had better not pursue that; it might come on on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point that my colleague for Co. Dublin suggested was that the Ministry for External Affairs should get information for the other Ministries.  As a matter of fact it does.  One of the first new works they took on for the last few months was to gather information as to publications, <Col N="2401" /> governmental forms, and documents, providing reports on Departmental matters for all the Ministries including the Ministry of Home Affairs.  So that every Irish Department has the use of the information they want.  With regard to publicity, I was not aware until I went back to my office after I heard the Deputy's remarks the other day that certain things had been published without the printer's imprint.  During the last year this State was fighting for its life against anarchy.  We had to issue a form of State propaganda.  As far as I could I tried to arrange that that would not represent any one party above another, or at any rate boost the Government as distinguished from Government. It was important seeing there was hysterical propaganda going on all over the country to bring certain documents before the notice of the people who are inclined to be carried away by the hysteria that prevailed.  For that reason these things were not issued with any State description on them, and I quite agree, and I was not aware until the Deputy himself pointed it out, that there was no printer's imprint.  For a long time we had carefully to arrange that there was to be no imprint on the documents we issued.  I suppose the printers came to associate lack of imprint with the work they did when I asked them to do it, and this is how the matter arose.</P>
      <P>This item here, &ldquo;books, newspapers, pamphlets, etc.,&rdquo; is not for the publication of newspapers, but when we think there is any special newspaper that we consider we should distribute we might buy up a few hundred or a few thousand copies for distribution in other countries. This is not with a view to publishing them but distributing them.  In regard to &ldquo;distribution, bill-posting, literature, etc.,&rdquo; we had in mind a condition of affairs that no longer exists.  We had in mind need for what we might call the propaganda of civic duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this estimate the word &ldquo;consul&rdquo; strictly should not be used.  Where the word &ldquo;consul&rdquo; is used it is not right. The word &ldquo;consul&rdquo; should not be used inasmuch as these trade representatives have not received their exequateurs.  A distinction is made between trade representatives and representatives.  The chief function of a trade representative is on the commercial side, while our <Col N="2402" /> representatives deal with the general representations of all Irish Governmental Departments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the flag I quite agree with Deputy Johnson in what he says in this, and there is a Bill which will be introduced very shortly that will cover that matter.  The book on &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; which described itself as under official auspices had nothing whatever to do with official auspices, and I, myself, wrote to the Editor to remove that.  We had nothing whatever to do with books, and I explained to anybody who inquired that we had nothing to do with it.  I was very careful to know as little as possible about it.</P>
    <P>A sum of 11/6 a week does sound far fetched here with regard to the salary of employees in foreign parts, but I did arrange when dealing with these posts that these employees would be paid a set wage in English currency rather than to leave them at the mercy of their own foreign exchanges.  As a matter of fact I saw that if we left them at the mercy of their own currency they might be getting 11/6 this week and would not be getting 6<i>d.</i> next week.  I think these are the chief points that have been raised.</P>

      <P>During the course of the last year there was a question raised on a few occasons with regard to the position of those teachers who are engaged in giving instruction in Irish under the local Technical Committees. My recollection was that there was some kind of a promise given that the cost of living bonus would be paid this year, or <Col N="2403" /> that arrangements would be made to make provision for that in the estimates for those teachers who are engaged by Local Committees to give instruction in Irish.  Many Committees last year adopted schemes for the formation of classes giving instruction in Irish, but they found themselves considerably handicapped by the fact that provision had not been made in last year's estimate for paying the cost of living bonus to such teachers.  Now, I would like to know whether such provision had been made in this estimate.  Perhaps the Minister would be in a position to say on this Vote what exactly is the present position with regard to the College of Science, or whether he is now in a position to say what is to be its ultimate fate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to draw attention to one or two items.  To some of them I drew attention when the Estimates for last year came before this Dáil sitting as a Constituent Assembly. The first is in respect to the National Library.  The Estimate for last year was £4,000.  That is now to be decreased by £1,400.  The National Library is the only library of its kind in this country, and it would be no disparagement to those who are conducting it with very great efficiency and under very considerable difficulties, if one were to say, what they themselves and the Minister would be the first to admit, that this library is not at all as well equipped or as efficient as it should be.  In fact there is no public library in Ireland that is as well equipped as it should be; there is no library in Ireland nearly as well equipped as other countries insist upon having their libraries, for the general public convenience.  The Trinity College library is entitled to receive one copy of every publication.  I believe it does not exercise that right; but, even if it did exercise that right, not everybody is privileged to use the Trinity College Library.  The National Library is the only one that students and scholars and the general public can use.  It is no uncommon experience for such students and scholars, who are using it not merely for purposes of pleasure&mdash;which would be quite sufficient justification&mdash;but really for equipment in knowledge either for University purposes or various purposes of study, that they are frequently unable to get books in the library which should <Col N="2404" /> be available.  Even if last year's figure of £4,000 had been maintained in the present Estimate, it would still be impossible to equip the library as it ought to be equipped.  How is it going to be possible to make any kind of a representative selection of books on £2,600 a year for national use, apart from such other allowances from such other quarters as perhaps may come?  This is a substantial reduction on a very essential Vote, and I think it is very unhappy to see this reduction from £4,000 to £2,600.  I drew attention before to a matter that I wish to briefly refer to again.  It is the desire of this nation to economise to the utmost; the necessities for economy have been pressed upon us, and each Deputy is fully alive to the necessities for economy; but there is economy and economy, and to economise on salaries given to persons in the National Library or the College of Science or under the Geological Survey of Ireland is not wise.  One notices that the persons there are receiving much less than the ordinary standard of pay given to administrative Civil Servants, although a much higher order of intelligence and special technical training is required of them.  To economise in that respect is not for the good of this country.  Take the salaries payable under the head of the Geological Survey.  The Geological Survey of this country will be in the future one of the most important and imperative matters.  The only survey available is a purely surface survey, that kind of survey that arose from very careful measurements and borings.  That has been done in every country, and maps which are available for every country are not available for Ireland, and could not be, because of the slender monies made available for this section of the Department. We have continued that.  It is not right that a person from whom administrative ability is required should receive, as they are receiving, salaries that range from £750 to £1,200.  When one wants a person who has to have the same administrative abilities in addition to a specialised technical, scientific knowledge, it is not right that they should receive the rate of pay that is being accorded under this Estimate.  I am making an appeal now for the scientists of this country.  I regard this nation as a large business concern that has to be conducted efficiently.  Any conductor of a large business, and the general public, know that the highest fees <Col N="2405" /> are paid to its technicians and its scientists because the rest of the business swings on the knowledge acquired by such persons and furnished by such persons in every year of development.  It is done by large business concerns, not out of any theoretic fealty to science, but because it is a good paying thing to do. If it is so for a business house, it is much more so for a nation which is but a very large business institution.  It is not in order for a Deputy to move for any increase, but I do urge that the question of the remuneration of scientists and technicians, all of whom come under this Vote, should be very carefully reviewed, or else we will have falling to us a fate that has been too often experienced in the past.  Last year the Senior Geologist of Ireland, who is now no longer there, was offered twice the salary he was receiving in Ireland from one county in England to undertake its mere county survey, and he naturally left.  That is not a very happy, a very desirable, nor a very hopeful state of affairs.  The matter cannot be revised now, inasmuch as it would not be in order to vote for any increase. It would not be right to ask for any specific increase without an entire survey, but I do urge the Minister, when he is replying, to say whether he would be willing to cause special inquiry to be made with a view to seeing that the salaries of technical experts and scientists, falling under one or other of the various sub-heads of this departmental vote, should be thoroughly reorganised in order that they may be placed not merely on the same basis as administrative Civil Servants of senior grades, but on a higher basis still&mdash;on such a basis that we can hope to retain their services instead of their being attracted elsewhere by higher rates of pay, which we could little blame them if they took advantage of.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote in the main for the College of Science and the various technical institutions through the country.  I am merely administering these services for the moment on trust, as they will be transferred, and rightly transferred, immediately to another Department under the Ministries Bill.  There is no necessity for me to dilate on the importance of technical education as I would be merely preaching to the converted.  As we are talking about re-organisation and as Deputy <Col N="2406" /> Figgis has raised the question of what he calls the re-organisation of salaries I want to point out what is obvious, that it is not re-organisation of salaries but the re-organisation of the whole Department that is necessary, making quite sure that we get value for our money. I am not suggesting that we are not getting value under the present organisation. I agree that first-class scientists are entitled to be paid salaries which would keep them in Ireland, and that in the interests of the country you should not leave them open to the temptation of being attracted elsewhere.  I think that within the limits of this Vote you could pay first class salaries to first class men and still make a saving.  I do not say that a saving should be made, and I do not say that too much money is being spent on technical education.  It would be very difficult to spend too much money on technical education, but I am asking for a sum of £197,216, which is the total Vote, and I am perfectly satisfied that if these departments were properly organised and co-ordinated, and if over-lapping were obviated you could within that figure give a far better service and pay far better salaries to our men.  However, I only hold this department on trust, and it will be transferred immediately under the Ministries Bill to its appropriate Ministry.  With regard to the College of Science, Deputies will notice that the Estimates provide for the College at its full strength.  Again that raises a point bearing on the whole question of technical education.  Technical education in this country has suffered from the fact that we have confused certain facts.  I am not interested in the slightest in the College of Science or in any institution even though I am interested in technical education.  What we want is to see what institution would give best value for the money.  It does not at all follow that the College of Science in its present position and re-organisation is ideal, and we will never get very far if, as well as professing to have the interest of technical education at heart, we also are under the necessity of keeping the College of Science or any other institution in exactly the same position as when we received it.  I hope we all have sufficient initiative and freshness of mind to be glad of an opportunity of improving these institutions and changing <Col N="2407" /> them where necessary.  So far as the College of Science is concerned, we are asking for money that will keep it going at full strength, and it will be for the new Ministry, that will take charge of technical education as a whole, to say what are the proper functions of the College.  I have my own ideas as to that, but that question does not arise at the moment.  With regard to the National Library, there is a big decrease, and I regret it, but remember that these Estimates were all prepared when we were at war, or at least when we were preparing our Army Estimates on a war basis.  I do not say that means that we should cut down every other service, but we must pick and choose.  I can sympathise with the point of view of Deputies who think that we should not choose this particular item, but there it is, and I think, as a result of it, the Library will not be short of its ordinary quota of books.  This is an estimate for one year, and I hope that next year the Minister who will then be in charge, in putting it forward will not have to make the same excuses that I am making for cutting down.  In regard to Deputy O'Connell's point in regard to the teaching of Irish, any little delinquencies we may have committed in the way of cutting down the estimates for the National Library we have more than made up for by the liberal amount voted for teachers in which there is an increase of no less than £42,000 in regard to salaries and bonuses. It is a very big question whether by co-ordinating the teaching of Irish you could not get very much better results.  While you have the Department of Agriculture, the Departments of Science and Art, Technical Education Committees, and the various County Councils, all interesting themselves in the same way in the Irish language, looking for money, there is no attempt at co-ordination.  You will not get Irish properly taught, and you will get a large sum of money wasted unless there is co-ordination.  I have no doubt that we could give the same service with better teaching if the systems were co-ordinated.  We had to take the systems this year as we found them, and the Votes for the Department and for Science and Art provide £42,000 extra for the teaching of Irish.  I put that <Col N="2408" /> forward as a plea for my parsimony in regard to the National Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to one point with regard to the National Library Vote that may be neglected.  If the Vote will be rectified as the Minister suggests, the increased sum will be expended after twelve months time, within which time any books that will have been published will be irreplacable.  It is as much as any Vote is capable of to keep pace with the books published in one year.  It is beyond the possibility of one such Vote to catch up with the books that are essential to the National Library.  I desire to add one further comment to what I said in regard to salaries.  I agree that the Minister has put his finger on the weakness of the Vote when he makes reference to the necessity for re-organisation and co-ordination.  There is no doubt that owing to the wasteful way these matters have been conducted in the past, a great deal of money has been lost. Nevertheless, there are such things as precedents that are sometimes helpful and sometimes very dangerous.  The precedent established with regard to salaries may, sometimes, be helpful and sometimes it may be very dangerous. Here it is asserted that the senior Geologist is to receive £540 per year.  Three assistant Geologists get £530.  Each of the Assistant Geologists is then to receive £175 per year.  Stated in those bald figures, the thing is absurd.  Assuming that we were, as a nation, to make over to some private company the geological rights of Ireland as a concession, what would that concessionaire pay for geological services to explore the possibilities of this concern?  Under the Constitution, the Irish people are their own concessionaires, and the Irish people should be prepared to pay for its geologists at least as much as a concessionaire company. I know what price he would exact and what price he would get.  The Senior Geologist would be paid £5,000 a year by this Company, and we are paying him £540, and paying three trained technical assistants to him £175 a year plus such bonuses as may be laid down, and that is the establishment charge.</P>

      <P>That is the <Col N="2409" /> kind of cheap remark that is very easy to make.  The fact remains that this country is going to conduct its affairs as any business concern would conduct its affairs.  It has to pay its scientists and technicians properly.  While recognising the importance of the Minister's statement about the necessity for co-ordination, the principle should be laid down that the salaries stated in this Estimate for certain important positions shall not be regarded as a precedent in assessing salaries.</P>

      <P>I think hardly anyone in the Dáil has drawn attention more often to the necessity for co-ordination in education than I, but I would be sorry if the latter remarks of the Minister would have the effect of creating the impression that this want of co-ordination which we all admit in the educational Department has resulted in a wastage so far as the teaching of Irish is concerned. That impression might be gathered from his remarks.  I think it well, therefore, to say that although the Department for Education and his Department of Agriculture were engaged in finding some money for the teaching of Irish, there was very little overlapping in that direction, because the Department for Education made provision for the teaching of the children in the schools whereas the Technical Departments provided very largely for the teaching of Irish to adults in the night classes and at colleges, too.  It is only right to say that for several years before the signing of the Treaty the Department for Agriculture was doing very much better than any other Department for the encouragement of Irish, even much more than the Department that should have control of this work&mdash;that is the National Board.  To the efforts made by Local Technical Committees and the co-operation with the Technical Department is largely due the fact why many National teachers were able to get a knowledge of the language which should have been provided by the National Board.  It is only right at this stage to say that I am very glad indeed such ample provision as has been stated by the Minister has been made, but I would be very sorry that those who are inclined&mdash; and we have them&mdash;to talk about the wastage of money in the propagation of Irish should be in a position to draw from the remarks of the Minister that there has been a leakage due to want of co-ordination <Col N="2410" /> so far as the teaching of Irish is concerned.</P>

      <P>For fear people would not know what I said, I will repeat it. There has been a leakage as the result of want of co-ordination.  I have no doubt whatever about it.  There is no doubt whatever that if the teaching of Irish, and any other teaching you like, were properly co-ordinated we could get better value from the same money.  The question of how much or how little should be spent on the teaching of Irish, does not arise.  We can get better value from the teaching of Irish in particular, and the teaching of any subjects in general, if the departments are properly co-ordinated. There has been a leakage, which I hope, will not continue.  With regard to Deputy Figgis's point: Geologist is a very fine word to use.  Geologists are not the only sort of scientists.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I daresay science is not as well paid as it might be. However, the Deputy realises the importance of co-ordinating these institutions, the re-organised Department of Agriculture and Science and Art Institutions, and the College of Science.  Although he agrees to that, I cannot understand his point of view, when he urges that immediately before re-organisation, we should go and pay higher salaries to existing officers despite the fact that those salaries have been paid for many years, and we are paying now as much as was paid in the past.  Next year our Army Estimates will not be on a war basis.  It is hardly the time to make a change in these matters in the very year during which we intend to reorganise departments, probably to abolish some positions, and to make new ones.  I do not make any excuses for those salaries. I would not ask the Dáil to consider the question of increasing the salaries in institutions like those that are going to be reorganised at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under this head, I would like to ask the Minister if it is proposed at any near date to bring in an Afforestation Bill.  The matter has been frequently discussed.  It was one of the very earliest proposals of the political party which brought this Dáil into being.  Several attempts were made to deal with it in the past and the attempts always resulted in failure because of the lack of administrative machinery by which alone it could be brought to success.  Now, with the administrative machinery at our disposal, it is a matter of common consent that a properly organised system of re-afforestation should be instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and we are all of one mind in that matter, and I would be glad if he would say when it is proposed to deal with it by means of legislation, and if, pending such legislation, he would deal administratively with persons who are destroying at the present moment some of the beauty spots of <Col N="2412" /> Ireland and some of those parts still remaining in forest or in wood that not merely serve a beautiful purpose but also serve an economic and necessary purpose. These trees are being felled purely for profit, and I would ask the Minister to deal with the persons responsible administratively and compel them at least to get sanction from his Department before a single further tree in Ireland be felled.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is framed on very modest lines, doubtless because of the fact that the financial position of this country at present is harassed because of the unfortunate trouble that took place here during the last six or eight months.  There is one fact I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister bearing upon this question of Forestry that might encourage him to take steps to increase his Estimate. Under his own Land Bill he proposes to take possession of thousands of acres of untenanted land.  A large portion of this untenanted land is entirely unfit for cultivation, and a great deal of it is particularly adaptable to forestry.  If advantage was taken of this fact, the Ministry might be able to hold possession of those lands and carry out a scheme of planting upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention of the British Government in this country was called again and again to the question of Forestry and the naked condition of Ireland was pointed out to them.  A Commission sat in 1908 and inquired into the matter.  It called attention to the fact that while in Austria 32 per cent. of the area was under wood, only about 1.5 per cent. of the area of Ireland was then under wood.  Taking into consideration the heavy felling that took place during the war, the area under wood in Ireland now would be only about 1 per cent.  Ireland has 1 per cent. under wood, Hungary 27 per cent., Germany 26 per cent., France 17 per cent., Belgium, the most highly industrialised country in Europe has still room for 17 per cent of its area in timber; and Denmark, which is only half the size of Ireland, has 7 per cent., or more than double Ireland's wooded area.  This Commission also called attention to the fact that the area under wood in Ireland at that time was 300,000 acres, and they pointed out that the question of planting was purely a question for the State.  They <Col N="2413" /> stated that the private individual would hardly plant a crop of timber, because he would not reap the harvest of it in his own time, and that it was only the State which could venture on a large scheme of planting.</P>
    <P>This Commission recommended that the State should plant 200,000 acres of forest immediately, under its own direction, and that the Co. Councils should be encouraged to plant an additional area. They considered the entire area at that time, and in their opinion there were one million acres in Ireland particularly suitable for tree planting.  I bring these facts before the Dáil, because I am sure it is thoroughly aware of the great value of having a country well planted.  Although America, as compared with Ireland, is a thickly-wooded country, they are taking steps in America to preserve the wooded areas around the river sources, and also to plant further, in order to equalise the rainfall and improve the health of the country generally.</P>
    <P>No one going through Ireland at present can fail to be struck with the miserable condition of the country for lack of trees.  It is almost as bare as the Sahara in places and a great deal uglier, I am sure.  I think the Minister for Agriculture is furnished with an excellent opportunity at least for getting the land, and I am sure this Dáil would not hesitate to give him the money either.  The Commission which sat in 1908 under the scheme they drew up calculated that if these 200,000 acres were planted the annual cost for the first decade would be about £25,000 per annum, the second decade £55,000 per annum, and £70,000 per annum for the third, fourth, fifth sixth and seventh decades, after which the scheme would become self-supporting. It would pay the entire outlay in the first instance, and all the outlay for all the years up to then and the reasonable interest on all the money expended.  If that is so, and those experts came to that conclusion, it is a pity if we cannot commence the planting of the country at as early a date as possible.  Unfortunately it is not a class of work that affords much employment, though the contrary opinion is very common. It is work more for small numbers of men here and there wherever the estates are bought up, but I submit that the work is very important, and I am sure the Dáil entirely sympathises with <Col N="2414" /> it.  I hope the Minister will devote special attention to it in view of the fact that under the Land Bill he is now getting possession of land excellently suited to that purpose, and of very little use for any other purpose.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sears brings under your notice a very important fact.  A few years ago a Canadian expert in timber-growing visited Ireland, and I had the advantage of a visit to the Botanic Gardens in company with some friends under his direction.  He drew our attention to a little planting in one corner near the Glasnevin Cemetery, wherein various kinds of hybrid trees had been planted in experimental plots. He gave us a very instructive lesson in regard to those trees.  They are alongside a little plantation of spruce.  We all know that during the later years of the Great European War most of the paper utilised on the American Continent was made from spruce.  So great was the demand in fact for that type of timber that a special railway line was run in the neighbourhood of Seattle.  According to this expert, and from what I have read, stimulated by his suggestion, a better tree for this purpose which grows the maximum of pulp usable in the minimum of time is the popular tree.  I am sorry the statistics which I was provided with then are not forthcoming now on the spur of the moment, but I do recall that the average time in which the poplar tree would have produced its greatest quantity of usable pulp was from 30 to 40 years, so that the return upon the capital outlay is exceptionally rapid, and is exceedingly fruitful.  It so happens, as Deputy Sears wisely reminds us, that we have now the opportunities under the Land Act, and also that Ireland is a country particularly favourable to the growth of the poplar. It grows with great rapidity and richness of sap in every part of Ireland, so that there is the opportunity here for a very rich investment.  There was a time when the farmer did not own the tree that was planted on his land and one of the Land Acts introduced a very beneficial reform in securing him his property in it.  Agricultural education should be extended in the near future, under the head of Technical Education, and it should be brought under the notice of the people what a rich harvest they may have, not in the nature of an annual harvest, but a rich <Col N="2415" /> harvest nevertheless, through the planting of trees.  There will be the additional advantage of shelter.  We are all aware &mdash;to copy the very happy phrase used by Deputy Sears&mdash;of how naked the land has become.  Shelter is absolutely needed, not merely in the ordinary sense for cattle, but for the country at large. It does seem an unfortunate thing that the Forestry Department, until a comparatively few years ago, was a neglected side of public expenditure.  I am quite confident, however, that under the new regime, to which we are all looking forward, the planting of trees will be inculcated as a public duty, apart altogether from its being shown with absolute conviction to the farmers that they cannot put their money more profitably into any other thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to draw attention to the figures in connection with this Vote.  Last year there was voted £31,665.  There is a note, and I think, though I am not quite sure, that a similar note was attached to the estimate last year.  The note reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The expenditure out of this Grant will be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Any balance of the sum issued which may remain unexpended on the 31st March, 1924, will not be liable to surrender.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that was the case in regard to the Vote of £31,665 last year, but we find in a note at the bottom of that page that the balance unexpended or anticipated balance of the Forestry Fund amounting to £6,000 on the 31st March, 1923, was, as a matter of fact, surrendered, or it was equivalent to a surrender, inasmuch to the balance of the 1923 account is added a sum of £5,690, which it is expected will be paid to the Forestry Fund by the British Government, and those two sums added together are taken from the Vote for the ensuing year.  The effect of that is that the Forestry Fund is not able to take advantage of the money that was saved from last year.  I think it would have been more satisfactory to the country if the Grant of £31,000 voted last year was duplicated this year, and if any addition, either paid in by the British Government, or saved on last year's expenditure, had been added to the sum <Col N="2416" /> at the disposal for the current year instead of being reduced from the amount voted.  We see in the Appendix an alleged nett decrease of £1,150, but so far as the charge upon the Exchequer is concerned there is a decrease of £12,800, and it is a pity that advantage should be taken by the Treasury of the circumstances of last year, which militated against the expenditure of the voted sum, to deprive them of the use of that sum for the ensuing year.</P>
    <P>As I read this estimate, that is in effect what is to happen.  Item E, dealing with forestry education, was reduced by £800 from £1,070 to £255.  I have been led to believe that the scheme for forestry education has been very successful, and that young men, farmers' sons, were able to take advantage of this forestry tuition and experience, and spread the light that they received at that school when they got back to their own localities.  I think it is unfortunate that there should be a decrease in this estimate for forestry education and expenses of apprentices at forestry centres.  On the general question, it is a pity to find that the Ministry is economising in this Vote.  There has been a great deal said in favour of education and forestry, and the development of afforestation for the purposes of National wealth in the future.  I think it is generally admitted that this is one of the forms of expenditure which is certainly productive.  I do not think £30,000 should be cut down.  I do not think the forestry department should have been deprived of the amount&mdash;the unexpected amount&mdash;saved out of last year's Vote, especially when we are reminded that any such balance is not liable to surrender.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that, notwithstanding the meagre sum asked for on this occasion, he does anticipate there will be a call for a supplementary estimate, having schemes in hand, and that his expert advisers are satisfied with the forecast of work for this year that this Estimate gives us.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that we should look at the Estimate from the point of view of how much money we have to spend.  Apart altogether from whether the Estimate should be big or small, the correct way to <Col N="2417" /> prepare one is to ask yourself how much are you going to spend, and not how much have you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister a still more suitable question: &ldquo;How much, according to the requirements of the country, ought we to spend?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is putting my point in another way.  I will deal with the Deputy's point later on.  At present I am on the contention that we had £6,000 over from last year, and that we expected £5,690 from the British Government, and that hence that should be added on.  It really comes to this: it should be added to the £30,000, and that we should spend the whole lot.  That, in my opinion, and the Deputies generally will agree, is a wrong way to look at the question.  I am not defending the £30,000; it might be £300,000.  The real point you should first consider is: &ldquo;What are you going to spend; what can the country afford; what should you spend according to the particular policy you are carrying out.&rdquo;  That should be the view point, and you should not look at it from the point of view, &ldquo;We have so much money and let us spend it.&rdquo; That is the reason I am against grants-in-aid. It was all right when we were getting the money from the British Treasury, and when we were getting a certain amount under conditions which enabled us to hold it.  Now we are getting it from the Irish Treasury and there is no further reason for the system whereby Departments hold any balances they may have.  That only leads to waste and inefficiency, and the general spending of money for the sake of spending it.  To come to the figure £30,515, that really is not the Estimate this year.  If we are to increase our forestry programme, and undoubtedly it must be increased in the near future, we will have to buy land, and we are in the fortunate position this year that we, probably, will get something like 10,000 acres of what I call Army land, land taken over from the <Col N="2418" /> British War Department.  If we had to buy that it would increase that Estimate very considerably.  Deputies should not come to the conclusion that the payments will be made by the Department and that the service which they intend to carry out is covered by this figure of £30,515.  We are getting 10,000 acres, and then as Deputy Sears pointed out, we have a Land Bill under which we have power to vest land in trustees or other bodies for forestry purposes.  There is no limit to the one important item, the amount of land we have in hands, and that is the item which costs money.  The estimate is in fact, if you look at it from that point of view, a very big estimate.  We get land from the Army, and we will have provision in the Land Bill to take over land for forestry purposes, and make advances to trustees and other bodies. Therefore, it is not in fact a small Estimate this year.  I do not want to go into the general question of policy in regard to forestry.  Apart from the consideration that Deputy Magennis put forward, that it might be developed and made a paying industry in a special way, there is the fact that this country is denuded.  Apart from the question as to whether you can make the planting of trees a paying proposition, you have to deal with the fact that of all countries in Europe this country is probably the most denuded of trees, and whether the planting of trees pay or not from the commercial point of view, we must plant them.  From the point of view of climate, shelter and scenery it is absolutely necessary to increase our forestry programme to a very large extent.  I need not labour that question, and I need not go into the question of whether we should make profits from forestry in this country which other countries can make.  That does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Afforestation Bill, I have the points of that Bill prepared, but the fact is that as a result of the Land Bill I have no time to present it to the Dáil, and there is no time in the Dáil, because of its programme being so full up with other absolutely essential Bills.  I do hope, perhaps, but I could not promise to introduce that Bill before the elections. I could not deal with it until the Land Bill is through, and we are taking certain powers in the Land Bill which will go some way to meet the powers we propose <Col N="2419" /> to have under the Afforestation Bill.  It will go part of the way.  Deputy Johnson asked me a question which I do not propose to answer&mdash;that is, as to what particular advice I got from my experts in this matter.  I am declining to answer that on general principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister one question which probably passed his memory, and that is that pending the Reafforestation Bill is he prepared to come to this Dáil and get such powers as he may be advised are necessary to enable him to stop the felling of any further trees in any part of this country without the specific permission in writing of his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister answers that, I would like if he would tell us what the expectation is for this current year with regard to the number of apprentices receiving education at Forestry centres?  Is there considerable reduction in the number which would account for the reduction in the Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell the Deputy the exact number, but my impression is that the sum we are providing covers the expenses of all the apprentices that we could take.  I could not at the moment say the exact number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that rather suggest that there is, apart from these bigger and more expensive items, a decline in the actual work of this Department, certainly in the forestry centres when £1,000 could be voted last year and only £255 this year for education services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course £1,000 was voted last year, but the £1,000 was not spent.  My impression at the moment, and I have gone into the question before, is that there was some difficulty in getting apprentices for these purposes&mdash; that is to say suitable men.  The Department expect that £255 will cover the expenses in connection with the men they will be able to get for this purpose this year.  With regard to Deputy Figgis's point, in regard to the Bill I spoke of, one of its main provisions was the prevention of the felling of trees.  That is not a thing you can do with a wave of the hand.  There are a great many interests connected with it.  You have the timber merchants and other people, and <Col N="2420" /> all these people have been consulted, and their views have been found, and I have the Bill practically ready.  I have the points ready, but the Bill is not yet drafted.  The various points in the Bill are prepared and in writing after consultation with all interests.  I could not come to the Dáil and get from the Dáil permission to issue an ukase preventing people cutting trees.  It is a matter for legislation.  The Dáil time-table has not allowed me to introduce this Bill.  The fact that I have been dealing with the Land Bill for the last month or two, and the fact that I have had to give my time also to other interests have prevented this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the question of the contract that was given for the repair of the bridge at Mallow. On two or three occasions statements have been made in the Dáil, and outside, regarding the attitude adopted by the Great Southern Railway Company in the matter of this bridge.  The result has been that the contract for the repair of the bridge&mdash;or shall I say the rebuilding of the bridge&mdash;was given to a firm, I think, in Newcastle-on-Tyne. The information that has come to my hand within the last few hours is that this firm in the course of its work, is making preparation to introduce, if it has not already introduced, fifty or sixty men for the building of this bridge, and that they are bringing from Newcastle-on-Tyne rivetters.  I wonder whether <Col N="2422" /> that was contemplated in the contract or in the handing over to this firm of this job.  I wonder whether it is good public policy to give such a contract to a firm in England, or Scotland, and to allow the whole work to be done on the spot by men whom they brought over with them while other men in the same trade, in the same kind of work, are idle in this country.  I think, however, such a procedure may be defended on the ground of economy, it is bad public policy to invite a large number of men to be brought over the water to work at this Government work while men of the same trade available are walking the streets, perhaps not in that town, but not many miles away. I suggest that that is a bad public policy.  I wonder what would be said supposing the request for tenders for this work had not been confined to the Free State and Great Britain, but that German and Belgian contractors had been invited to tender, as they ought to have been once it was decided to go outside the Free State&mdash;what would be said if the contractors in this case had decided to bring into the country men to do the work not, bear in mind, to come to the country, to settle in the country, and give their time and service to the country, but to come for a specific purpose, to take away their wages, while other men in the same trade are looking on?  One might go a little further and suggest the analogy of coolie labour.  The contractor is entitled to take a Government contract and to bring labourers into the country to do the work.  I have no doubt you will be able to get a great deal of work done at a very much lower price because of the fact that imported labour can be brought to the country at a very much lower rate of wages.  What is to be the condition? Is it to be a standard rate to be paid?  Is it a standard rate in the place where the work is done, or is it a standard rate in the home or place of occupation of the men concerned?  I take it that in this contract there has been inserted a fair wages clause.  I am not going to assume, because I have no information, that the wages paid to these men brought from Newcastle will be any lower than the wages paid to Irishmen doing the work there.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a very unwise proceeding to make a contract with a firm <Col N="2423" /> for a big job and to allow, not specialists, not men of any particular accomplishment, but the general workmen on the job, to come over and undertake the work before the eyes of men in the same trade, possibly even of the same Trade Union, who are unemployed.  I think it is a very unfortunate experience, and I hope it will still be possible to obviate it.  If there were no men in this trade to be found in the Saorstát then one would have nothing to say.  I am informed that there are plenty of men to be obtained, competent men to do this work, having done it in different parts of the world, and who are quite as competent as these men who do piece work and who will be working under the same kind of conditions to be found in the Free State.  It is very unsatisfactory to hear that the firm obtaining the contract is not only doing the iron work in its own establishment in England but is bringing over the men to do the work in Ireland.  Perhaps it might be wiser not to raise any other question at the moment inasmuch as I think that that is a serious item and raises questions that may have rather serious repercussions.</P>

      <P>Under Head E, &ldquo;Compensation for Damage to Railways,&rdquo; I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the position of affairs between Mallow, Mitchelstown and Waterford.  For the past ten months all that large area is without a railway service owing to the destruction of bridges by the Irregulars.  It is a very important area and people are suffering very severely in the towns along the way for want of a railway service.  They have had to pay high prices for coal and other necessary commodities.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that the bridges along that line, which I am informed are only very small bridges and would not take a considerable time to repair, will be repaired as soon as possible.  I am informed if the Railway Maintenance Corps were sent down they would have the place repaired in a very short time.  I think it is reasonable to ask the Minister to urge that the line be reopened at a very early date.</P>

      <P>The agreement which was made in this case between the representative <Col N="2424" /> of the Government on the one hand, and the Railway Co. on the other, seems in many of its clauses to be very elastic, and to allow an interpretation on the part of the Government on the one hand and of the Railway on the other that would be quite conflicting. The words &ldquo;reasonably required&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; are right throughout this agreement.  In the case of a dispute, I would like to know who is to be judge as to what is reasonably required, and reasonably necessary.  The Government are no doubt aware that for a long time as a direct result of the trouble which started in this country in June last, thousands of employees in the Inchicore Works were out of employment for a period, and had only three days' work a week in another period, and numbers of them were without work that would enable them to keep their dependants and others.  The point Deputy Johnson raised has a direct bearing on that issue.  I would like to ask the President if when this agreement was being negotiated, any understanding was arrived at between the two parties as to putting the overhead bridges which were destroyed into proper order.  I understand there is contention between the Government and the Local Councils as to the direct responsibility for the repair of certain bridges.  Seeing there is an urgent need for the repair of those bridges I would like to know what took place between the Government and the Railway Company.  With regard to the repair of bridges and signal cabins, their equipment, plant, tools, stores, and everything except locomotives, carriages, waggons, the following provisions shall apply:&mdash;&ldquo;The Railway Company concerned shall furnish to the Government Consulting Engineer such particulars as he may reasonably require, and he shall forthwith furnish a certificate showing the amount which he considers represents the expenditure reasonably necessary for the purpose of effecting a permanent repair, and the Government will thereupon pay the amount.&rdquo;  Does that mean that the Railway Company shall furnish to the Government particulars of where the material has come from, particulars as regards the conditions of employment, and whether or not in such cases Irishmen shall be employed?  I ask for the information because it was not made very clear as to whether these were some of <Col N="2425" /> the particulars the Railway should furnish to the Government's Consulting Engineer.  The agreement also said: &ldquo;In the case of a repair carried out by the Railway Maintenance Corps, credit shall be given to the Government for the value of so much of the work done by the Corps as, in the opinion of the Government Consulting Engineer, is of use towards completing a permanent repair.&rdquo;  I would like to know in a case of dispute who is to be Arbitrator and who fixes what is a reasonable amount to be given in credit. I drew the attention of the Dáil on two occasions to the fact that the Great Southern and Western Railway had on many occasions imported into this country railway engines and wagons from across channel.  In view of the large amount of unemployment, and as it has a very big works at its own disposal in which is all the machinery necessary for the re-building and repair of any locomotive wagons and carriages, etc., I would like to know if any understanding exists between the Government and the company for the beginning of new engines to take the place of those destroyed; or if, where carriages, etc., have to be replaced, they are to be built in the Company's works at Inchicore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another clause says: &ldquo;In the case of any rolling stock destroyed beyond repair, the Government shall pay so much of the cost of replacement as represents in the opinion of the Government Consulting Engineer the fair value at the date of destruction to the Company of the locomotive or vehicle destroyed.&rdquo;  It may be reasonable to think that this is a very fair consideration on the part of the Government to the Company seeing that the engine or wagon or whatever other article was destroyed has not been replaced, and that between the date of destruction of either locomotive and now there has been no effort whatsoever to replace that particular locomotive.  It would not be unfair to assume that the compensation should be on the basis of cost of replacement.  Further, I would like to hear from the President as to the reasons for the insertion of such a clause so favourable, in my opinion, to the Railway Company.  One would not attempt, generally speaking, to criticise the agreement, with the exception of the item referred to by Deputy Johnson, were it not that there has always been a tendency by the Railway Company to jibe at <Col N="2426" /> any agreement arrived at with regard to wages and services, and to take a mean interpretation of anything put down in black and white.  It has also been the tendency of the company's directors and officials to look across channel for things that could be made in this country.  I think that in view of the fact that men have been walking round the country for twelve months that any agreement made should tie the Railway Companies down to employing Irishmen, as far as possible, in the renewal of its works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Sections of contract for the repair of the Mallow Bridge reads as follows: &ldquo;The Contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised in the district where the works are carried out by employers and Trade Societies in each trade concerned (or in the absence of such recognised wages and hours, those which in practice prevail amongst good employers), or should there be no such wages and hours recognised or prevailing in the district not less favourable than those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar.&rdquo;  That is one section, and the other section which concerns this is &ldquo;The Contractor shall so far as possible recruit the labour from the locality in which the work is being performed, and shall satisfy the Minister, if required so to do, that this has been done.&rdquo;  I have not heard the complaint that was made by Deputy Johnson before, and there were two very important considerations, to our minds, in connection with the repair of this bridge; one was the cost of it, and the other was the expedition with which the work could be done.  To expedite the work we have allowed some overtime, which will give us the bridge in a much shorter time.  We expect the bridge will be completed by the end of September. That is the information we have.  Other considerations that are embodied in the contract appear to be satisfactory and I have not heard any complaint about them before.  If the Deputy wishes I would investigate the case he has mentioned. It is the first time I heard about it.  As regards the matters raised by Deputy Davin, it is an agreement between ourselves and the Railway Company.  There was some cause for dissatisfaction at one <Col N="2427" /> time, with, I believe, one Company, but there are now no causes for dissatisfaction. We have not had any cause for complaint against any of the Companies recently, and I think Deputies will agree that there is no good reason why we should go into any previous causes of complaint.  The Railway Companies suffered very considerably during the disturbances, more so, perhaps, than any others.  In one case alone a company lost more than half its revenue by reason of the interruption that took place, and it was natural that persons being aggrieved to such an extent would endeavour to make as good a case as possible for compensation.  The agreement that we have entered into, I think, safeguards our interests.  They are fair to the railway company.  &ldquo;The fair value at the date of destruction,&rdquo; appears to me to be a fair claim on the part of the railway company, and a fair liability on the part of the State.  With regard to the overhead bridges, the overhead bridges and roads are part of the Damage to Property Act and are the liability of the County Councils.  They will get compensated for that work out of the Road Board Grant, out of the 6<i>d.</i> in the £.  Deputies will remember that that was the only charge placed on local authorities.  They have borne no charge for the last two or three years in respect of malicious damage.  I explained at the time the Act was under consideration here, that apart from that consideration, very considerable sums of money would be spent in each county.  I suppose it would be safe to assume a sum of probably one million pounds in each county.  The actual contributions from each county for five years would be about an average of £50,000; it may be more or it may be less.  But the amount is calculated to be in the neighbourhood of about a quarter of a million in the year, and divided by twenty-six, that would be about £10,000, which for five years is £50,000, whereas the actual benefit, taking the average sum for each county is calculated to be in the neighbourhood of one million pounds.  If the pre-Truce and the post-Truce damage be calculated, it might possibly be even a greater sum than that.  I hope not, but I think Deputies will admit that that is a conservative estimate of the damage done. <Col N="2428" /> Each County Council, or the various local authorities in each district will benefit very considerably by the expenditure of such sums of money. It will relieve unemployment; it will stir up to some extent commercial enterprise and business in general. Some advantage will be derived from the sums of money that will be expended, and the only charge that we have asked them to meet is that 6d. in the £.  That, together with sums already in hand in the Road Board Fund and the ordinary road tax on motors, will provide a fairly substantial sum out of which we expect that they will shoulder the liability for roads and bridges.  Overhead bridges do not concern the railways; they are the concern now of the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the President one question.  If, for example, a County Council has refused to strike the 6d. in the £ rate will they be given any money from this fund to enable them to carry on, or will the full amount of the damage done in the county be placed upon its ratepayers in the future?  The County Council of Westmeath has refused to strike this 6d. in the £ rate, and there are at present about 150 or 200 men out of employment. The Labour members of that Council did advocate the striking of the rate here, and they want to know from you whether that Council will receive any money from this fund after they refused to strike that rate, or will the ratepayers of the county have to pay the full amount.  Sixpence in the £ on the county would amount to £7,800 each year, or £40,000 in five years, and I think that the amount of damage in Westmeath will be something over £150,000.  I would like an explanation on this matter so as to enlighten the people of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>To envisage the situation properly we must go back for a couple of years.  Very considerable damage was done by the Anglo-Irish war.  The local authorities generally objected to any imposition under the Malicious Injuries Acts and did not strike any rate in connection with it. Various wiseacres in many parts of the country said, &ldquo;This is foolish; you are biting a file; it is impossible to resist <Col N="2429" /> the courts,&rdquo; and so on, and for a time some people had doubts as to whether or not we were going to succeed.  Well, we have succeeded.  Withheld grants have been restored to us; local bodies' moneys that had been held up for a year, or two years, or longer, were paid to them.  We got back moneys that the British Government had withheld, and we got back moneys that the British Government had spent in discharging awards under the Malicious Injuries Acts.  Several awards for personal injuries were paid by the British Government out of these funds.  We got back all that money, and we gave it to the County Councils and the County Borough Councils, and other bodies affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases here and there through the country where complaints have been made that they have not been paid all their sums of money, and I have explained to several Deputies personally that in one case somewhere about February or March, 1922, I communicated with one County Council, or one Committee in a county, and asked them to forward particulars of their charge in respect of a certain grant, and the answer I got back was &ldquo;letter marked read.&rdquo;  It was sent under Rialtas Sealadach na hEireann, and the Order was &ldquo;Apply to the Local Government Department, Dáil Eireann, for this money.&rdquo;  In other words they were too pure souled to apply for what was their due from the British Government, and they were prepared to rob the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann of that sum.  We have got all that back, I do not mean to say that particular sum, but the sums that have been withheld.  We have not been able to get that particular sum back because they would not give me particulars of it.  All these demands had to be in before the 21st March, 1922.  No vote has been struck in England for any Irish services since that date.  Up to that date votes had been passed and the moneys paid.  There are some outstanding amounts.  I understand that they will be brought in on the ultimate financial adjustments.  So far as the local authorities are concerned, it may be some time before they get back any of the sums.  We have got rather used to these people.  They have lost nothing in the war, whatever others may have <Col N="2430" /> lost.  We are absolutely independent of them, and a good many of them disputed with us during the time that we would be able to see it through to the end, and that they would not be at any loss.  Now having seen the change that has taken place some of them have got new courage and new blood.  While they did not give us much assistance in the war with the British, they are now prepared to throw sand in the cogs of the wheels of the Government machine, and some of them are saying &ldquo;We will not strike this rate,&rdquo; though it helps them to make their counties possible to be travelled over, to make their roads passable, and to repair their bridges. We have got a great deal of unpopularity through insisting on the motor tax being paid.  We have collected the motor tax from our friends in spite of their entreaties. We have been deaf to any requests that have come to us to postpone or abrogate the tax.  We collected it, and we are collecting it still, and we are collecting it from some people who take every opportunity of showing their independence, their new-born independence. It would not be good business to give money out of that fund to the Council which is independent.  The best thing independent people can do is to look after themselves.  They do not want Government assistance, I presume, and surely we ought not to force it on them.  When they are prepared to accept their responsibilities towards the upkeep of the roads of their county, and their repair, we will give them every assistance.  If they are prepared to do that, even now, we will not mind the little bickerings we had in the past, but I think it right to explain that they have lost nothing in the war, and what we are asking them to subscribe to now is something that will benefit their own particular county.  In every case in which that money is subscribed it will be spent in the county itself.  There are one or two cases in which so much money will not be spent in the county, or county borough, but on examination it will be found I think that in those cases they will get a relatively larger sum out of the Damage to Property Act and out of compensation from what is called the Shaw Commission.  This is a sort of hotch potch, which is put into one fund and it is distributed generally as if the country had been at war at <Col N="2431" /> the same time.  They may say a man in Kerry does not benefit by money spent on the roads in Dublin, but he may have to travel by motor to Dublin, and he will then get the benefit in a nice soft, quiet, easy drive, and I am sure he will appreciate that.</P>

My information is that about 60 rivetters are being brought from Glasgow to put up the bridge at Mallow, and will he endeavour to arrange in the friendliest way, that they should not be brought so long as Irishmen can be got to do the work?  The Minister will bear in mind that all this work, almost universally, is done by piece-work and the question of overtime does not come in. Irishmen are prepared to work piece-work on a job of this kind, just the same as Scotchmen or Englishmen.  I think it would conduce to the speedier building of this bridge if this intrusion did not take place.</P>

      <P>I do not want to criticise this Vote in any way, but I think it well to voice what is a fairly wide desire amongst employed persons, that at the earliest possible date there should be an extension of the National Health Insurance system to include the proper provision of medical benefits.  The Act, as it stands, is one which excludes from Ireland the medical benefit system which operates in Great Britain, and it was thought, at the time that Act was passed, that by that exclusion the desires of the Irish people were being met, and that the circumstances of this country did not require the medical benefit scheme.  The information at my disposal, and the urging of many people in different parts of the country, show that they are distinctly in favour of the extension of the medical benefits to this country.  While recognising that it would mean an increased contribution, it is believed that the advantage would be great and that it would more than compensate for the increased cost.  I do not want to go into any details, but I do want to express that view, and put it before the Minister in the hope that he may convey it to the Commission who will, no doubt, be thinking of certain changes with a view to future legislation.  I desire that point of view should be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I would like to add to that made by Deputy Johnson.  I think that in regard to a lot of the important society work of National Health Insurance there is a great want of efficiency.  Some of the workers when they fall sick have to wait for six or eight weeks before they receive their benefits.  If a worker is sick for a number of weeks he has to send a doctor's certificate each week at a cost of 2s. 6d. each time.  He only receives 15s. per week altogether, so that when he pays 2s. 6d. out of that he has only 12s. 6d. left.  That is not at all fair, considering that the employer, the employee and the State are each contributing towards this National Health Insurance Scheme.  I do not think it at all fair that the employee <Col N="2434" /> should have to pay this sum per week, and although I do not wish to copy England in anything, I certainly would advocate following their example in this matter.  I think we should adopt the principle that is in vogue there.  Another thing I would like to bring before the members of the Dáil is that a lot of people in the country are remaining single simply because the Government are not coming to their assistance.  I think the Government should come to their assistance under the Act, and that to every young man who may not be in very good circumstances they should give a bounty to start him in life.  If you do that you would very soon find your register very much increased.</P>

Apart altogether from the question of time, I mean time for considering or introducing a Bill, this is one of those subjects that we have not had much time to consider, and we are not likely, I should say, in the immediate future to have much time for it.  Possibly there may be later opportunities for considering it.  I will, however, bring the matter to the notice of the Commissioners, but I am not very hopeful of any immediate results.  With regard to Deputy Lyons' point, I am sorry that the Deputy is having his patriotism sapped, and that he wants to follow the example of somebody else.  I wonder do they pay any bounties over there in England for marriages, or does he mean to pay bounties to young men, middle aged men or elderly men? I believe the Deputy is not correct in his statement about the payment for medical certificates, because last year a sum of over £50,000 was paid for medical certificates under the Act, and individual contributors are not liable for payment of these certificates.

      <P>I might say, in putting forward a statement on this Estimate the only apology to be made is chiefly for the smallness of the amount, but when we consider the actual state of the finances of the country, referred to so often here, we have to bow to the inevitable and be satisfied with a lesser amount than we originally asked for. With regard to the work, as this is a new Ministry the first thing we had to do was to get together a staff.  We had, more or less, to coalesce the Fisheries' staffs of the Congested Districts Board and of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;I mean the staffs of these two Departments&mdash;that were dealing with Fisheries' services before. Our chief work has been to carry on the services as they were being carried on before by them.  These involve the granting of loans to fishermen for gear, etc., and the general work that was done by these departments formerly.  Shortly after the Ministry was formed I decided to call together a committee to deal with Sea Fisheries and another to deal with Inland Fisheries.  The Committee on Sea Fisheries met and had some sittings.  They discussed two schemes put before them from the Ministry.  One was for the development of inland markets, and the <Col N="2436" /> other for the development of foreign markets. On the whole, they approved of the schemes as they were put before them, and we have now got permission from the Ministry of Finance to go on with these.  I might mention that the figure in the Vote, as you will see from the note at the end, is not the total amount available for Fishery development. There is a sum of £25,000 to come from the funds of the Congested Districts Board, and a sum of £17,150 to come from the funds of the Department of Agriculture.  That makes a total of £42,650 which, in addition to the £9,000 specified in the Estimate, makes available a sum of £51,650 for development as distinct from the ordinary staffing, salaries, wages, etc.  We found it necessary, owing to the dislocation of the railway services this year in order to enable the mackerel fishing to be availed of off the coast of Cork, to supply transit from there to the markets in Wales.  This, in actual effect, was not a great success, because the whole mackerel fishing this year, through weather circumstances, was a failure; but, at any rate, it was something that had to be done, because the outstanding loans and arrears, etc., that were due to both departments were such that if the men were not able to go to the fishing grounds we had no chance of getting back that money.</P>
      <P>It may have been that in this particular case, in the case of mackerel fishing it was actually throwing good money after bad.  At any rate, the experiment had to be made.  The fishermen themselves agree that we have done what we could, that it was nobody's fault except the fault of nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the fishing industry at the moment in Ireland is at its lowest ebb.  The fishing industry in every country is, in fact, practically at its lowest ebb.  There is, at least, a very great slump.  That is due to many causes, the chief of which is the depression in the markets and the exchanges in Central Europe.  The Irish fishing industry, in addition, has been hit owing to the circumstances that have prevailed here for a few years.  Our idea has been not to break forward into new departures owing to the existing circumstances until we have brought back the existing industry to its former condition. I felt&mdash;and my advisers felt&mdash;that there would be no use in adopting schemes <Col N="2437" /> which might be merely a &ldquo;flash in the pan&rdquo; and then collapse through want of finance.  What we have set before ourselves, in other words, has been to revive the fishing industry as it was and go forward from that.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware of the failure of the cod, skate and plaice fishing around the East and South-East coast, and what investigations he has made into the matter.  The men have gone out to fish time after time without any results.  I would like the Minister to inquire into this matter, and see what is the cause of the failure.  I would also like to ask him what steps he has taken to have proper methods of fishing taught. These methods could be taught even in the Technical Schools, as also proper methods of net-making and the making of all classes of fishing gear.  The Minister might also tell us when he intends to have barometers and weather glasses installed at all the fishing stations.  Heretofore these glasses were kept by the coastguards, and I would like to see them installed now at the fishing stations.  At present they are conspicious by their absence.  Would the Minister also state what are the steps necessary to be taken by fishermen to obtain boats and fishing gear.  I would also like to know what has resulted from the investigations recently held <i>re</i> the three-mile limit, or further out, so as to enable the small boats engaged on the inshore fisheries to earn a living against the steam trawlers&mdash;often foreign&mdash;that invade our waters to the detriment of the fishermen of all classes.</P>

      <P>The statement of the Minister for Fisheries would make one almost feel&mdash;if one already did not feel it&mdash;that it was rather premature to set up a separate Ministry of Fisheries.  I am inclined to think that that will be found to be the fact for some years to come, until we are in a position to spend very considerable sums in the work of development in what is, in fact, a reorganisation of the industry and a refurnishing of the industry with new types of boats, or adapting boats for new classes of fishing.  The statement which the Minister has made with regard to the experiment of sending mackerel from Baltimore to Milford is interesting.  He says the fishermen who are primarily interested felt that all had been done <Col N="2438" /> that could be done.  I wonder does the Minister claim that the method adopted in the transport of mackerel was approved of by the fishermen and by others technically competent to judge of the wisdom of that?  As I am informed, a vessel was chartered for the purpose of sending mackerel from Baltimore to Milford, and to send them without ice and in bulk; to take them out of the fishing-boats, transfer them to the carrier, and to send them in bulk to Milford to be rehandled again, put into boxes, or sold there without having had the protection that boxes give in transport and handling.  It seems to me that that was an experiment that invited failure.  There should have been some method of carrying, once they had been taken out of the fishing boats, by which the weight of the fish itself would not destroy the fish.  Everybody knows that is the case, particularly with mackerel.  The failure that the Minister admits was made certain by the fact that there was no fish.  I would like the Dáil to remember, when so many people are talking about the failure of fishing, that certainly in the case of mackerel very often the cause of the failure is not the failure of the fishermen, but a natural phenomenon.  That is not going to be cured by any amount of expenditure or any amount of organisation. The scientists who have studied this question have not yet satisfied themselves as to the changes and movements of mackerel and herring, so that it is not wise to build up a system on the assumption that the movements of these fish are certain and can be calculated.  I think the Minister would be well advised if his thoughts would run rather in the direction of encouraging line fishing and trawling as a ready alternative to drift-net fishing.  There is more money to be made in the long run by fishermen out of trawl fishing or line fishing, while if boats were equipped and ready to use drift nets for mackerel or herring when they show themselves, the harvest would be assured.  There is very much more certainty of a regular, or somewhat regular, income if alternative processes are made available.  The fact of the existence and of the development within the last 20 years of very large fleets of very powerful steam trawlers, and of less powerful, but not less effective, <Col N="2439" /> motor trawlers, is a factor that Irish fishermen, especially on the West coast, have to count as detrimental to them. Until we are able to develop a much greater consumption of fish in this country that handicap is going to be almost insuperable.  I think it would be found in practice, and perhaps the Minister will agree to this, that for the English market the steam carrier is going to be used for direct shipment rather than any rail transit.  The development of the fishing on the West coast of Ireland for the English market is going to be the development of the British or the French fishing-boat just as well as the development of the Irish fishing-boat. For the local market and for inshore fishing there may be a great deal done. I think the Minister will find that for the development, as so many people speak of it, of the great fishing industry, there is going to be a great deal of disappointment, and that disappointment will be still greater if there is not a steady increase in the consumption in Ireland.  I suppose this country is about the worst of all the fish-eating countries in Europe.  I am inclined to think that any development of inshore fishing, which is probably going to be the most beneficial to the half-fisherman half-farmer, will probably be the most beneficial for a large section of the community, at any rate, and that fishing will be more valuable with every increase in the demand for fish from within this country.  I think that along with any expenditure in the development of equipment there should be a concurrent expenditure in the development of demand and methods of distribution within the country.  In the development of methods of distribution, and&mdash;perhaps with the assistance of the Minister for Education or whoever is in charge of technical instruction in the future&mdash; in an improvement in the method of treating fish for the table, lie, I think, the secret of any improvement in the demand for fish, any improvement in the price of fish for the fisherman, and any improvement in the success of the industry around these coasts.  Irish fishermen for the last 30 years have been trained to depend on mackerel and herring&mdash;fresh mackerel for the English market and cured mackerel for the American market.  The American market <Col N="2440" /> is a very uncertain quantity, and it will be less certain still in the future. The herring market is almost illimitable, provided Eastern Europe is opened up. For what I call the finer qualities of fish there is very little market indeed in this country.  There is, no doubt, a great demand in England, but with that great demand there is a tremendous supply, brought to the place of consumption in about one-third of the time that the Irish fishermen on the West coast are able to accomplish it.  That is the difficulty in the development of Irish fisheries, and it would not be any harm, perhaps, for a cold douche to be applied to the very many optimistic thoughts there are about the Irish fishing industry. The problem is complicated, and not at all as easy as newspaper writers would have us believe.  It is not simply a case of equipping a boat going out and throwing the net overboard and bringing in fish.  You might have fleets upon fleets of vessels, fishing season after season, with the most accomplished fishermen, and get no fish.  As I am reminded, unless you have the means for dispersal of the fish you have caught and arrangements for curing the fish you have caught, you might as well not have caught them.</P>
      <P>I suppose that industry is the greatest gamble in nature.  It is a gamble from the moment a fisherman takes to the boat until the final moment when the consumer buys the fish, and there are gentlemen in the building who can confirm that.  I would again urge that the attention of the Ministry in this matter should be devoted largely to the disposal of fish within the country, to the encouragement of the methods of marketing fish, and to the encouragement of consumption.  I believe that if you can by this means improve the demand for consumption within the country, you will be doing the best work in encouraging the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>Although the amount set out for the improvement of fisheries is not very large, I think it is one of the costliest Departments within the whole reach of the Estimates.  The administrative charges seem to be very near three-fourths of the total expenditure. In those Estimates, if we read them aright, £3,000 are allowed for the development of fisheries and £6,000 for a <Col N="2441" /> fishery cruiser.  That is the only expenditure. I can see in this Estimate that benefits the public at large.  The remainder, £22,525, seems to go all in administration.  I think that is totally out of place&mdash;for the administration of £31,000 it costs £22,000.  I think it is a very costly Department.</P>

      <P>I do not know very much about this fishing industry, but I would like to call the Minister's attention to one thing which might, perhaps, help to save the industry&mdash;that is, as far as it affects the immediate coastline. I do not propose going too deeply into the matter, but there is a system in vogue around the coast of ring-net fishing, and I believe that it is the most destructive form of fishing in the bays around, as far as the spawning beds are concerned, that it is possible to get.  I believe people come in, and they are well equipped, and they simply scoop the bay in a few evenings and then get clear away.  It is an illegal form of fishing; it is an illegal net.  Those people have done that for the last few years when there was no protection, and it leaves the native fishermen in such a position that they go out night after night and day after day, and they come in with next to nothing.  I think the Minister should devote his attention to stopping that practice in the bays, especially on the East coast.  He would be doing a very good thing, and would perhaps be laying the foundation for allowing the fish to come to maturity.  I would ask him to see that his Department's attention will be devoted to that part of the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time the Estimate was printed the amount was not available.  Deputy O'Callaghan asked me to explain the failure of the cod, hake, and plaice fishing in the East coast.  The shortage in plaice, I am advised, is universal.  Cod and hake are not fished for because line fishing is not <Col N="2442" /> adequately followed.  There is provision in the detailed Estimates for vocational instruction, including net-making and fishing.  There is a sum of £5,050 under the head of vocational instruction.</P>
      <P>With regard to weather glasses, barometers were issued and are still on the coast.  If you give me particulars of any case where there is a shortage, we can see about that.  Loans are issued, just as they were always issued, on application, and with sufficient security, for the provision of boats and fishery gear.  With regard to the inquiry recently held about the three-mile limit, the report of the Inspector is not yet ready.  I entirely agree with Deputy Johnson that the thing to be looked forward to is to encourage the people of the country to eat more fish.  That is actually part of the inland market scheme&mdash;the development of our inland markets.  We are making provision for a scheme of propaganda to encourage the eating of fish.  This is the lowest fish-eating country in the world, with only an average of 13 lbs. per head of the population.  We are also making provision in the scheme for instruction in the method of cooking, and we are trying to get shops in certain towns as a start-off to display fish in a matter that would induce the public to buy it. With regard to line fishing and trawling, that is being encouraged.  But it is found that fishermen themselves prefer drift-net fishing.  The other is less speculative, if any fishing can be said to be other than speculative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the boats on the Western coast have trawling nets as well as drift nets.  The owners being half farmers and half fishermen, wait for the shoals to come along.  With regard to the Baltimore scheme Deputy Johnson said that the bulk method was the chief or at any rate one of the chief causes of failure.  Now, the way that the fish was actually consigned was not in bulk, as Deputy Johnson appeared to understand it.  The fish was laid on shelves in very even layers, and their own weight could not have destroyed them.  They were iced.  We had an opinion, and it was a very sound one to follow in adopting that method.  We were also guided by the fact that it would be impossible, in the event of large captures, to utilise <Col N="2443" /> the scheme of transport by these trawlers if we had reverted to large boxes. In calculating the loss we also knew, if we had gone to the expense of buying the boxes, that our losses would have been considerably greater.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Hughes, I have to say that ring nets are not illegal, and are used comparatively freely all over the coast.  Restrictions on this particular type of net have been asked for frequently, and investigations are being held this week in regard to this matter. I think that covers most of the points raised by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise another question which is not quite on the same plane, I was going to say in the same boat, as the last one.  It is with regard to the fishery cruiser.  I understand that this cruiser is not now in commission.  Can the Minister tell us what is the estimated time during which it will be in repair?  Further, can he say whether in the course of the examination it has been found that there were unforeseen defects, that new repairs are required to this vessel which were not contemplated when the original decision was taken for overhauling; whether those defects were due to the services rendered for the Fisheries Department or for any other Department?  If he can say what was responsible for those defects which were not previously counted upon for repairs?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would ask him to make inquiries into the three-mile limit at rivers owned by landlords.  I believe that was granted to the landlords about 86 years ago, and what was the reason for it?  Now, I will give you a case in point.  A fisherman who pays a licence to your Board is not allowed to fish within those limits; that is, a half mile both ways, north and south, as the case may be, and seawards.  Now, the landlord of that place can sell his rights to these fishermen for £40.  It cannot be for the protection of the salmon.  It must be for some ulterior motive, and I would like you to inquire into that.</P>

      <P>First of all, the original time specified in the tender for the repair of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; was 18 days.  While it was undergoing overhauling it was found that, when the vessel was opened up, <Col N="2444" /> heavier repairs were required.  These defects could not be revealed until the vessel was stripped in dry dock.  The vessel will be ready in a few weeks.  What service it was which necessitated these repairs it is hard to say.  The defect was due possibly to an injury while the Defence Department had the ship, but no proof of that can be brought forward. Whether these defects have been long in existence it is hard to say.  They were only discovered when the ship was opened up.  Deputy O'Callaghan has raised a point that is really a matter of Fishery Laws, and which would require a re-codifying before they will be interfered with.  It will have to go before the Law Department some day.  At any rate as the law stands we have no power in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not aware of how the damage occurred.  I suggest it might be worth while for his Department, which will have to pay for this extra damage, to make some inquiries as to the course of events round the Kerry coast when the vessel was run ashore two or three times, and certain people got into trouble because of the fault of the man in charge.  When the Minister points out that several more weeks, after the eighteen days specified in the original contract, will be required to get the vessel into repair, and that it is on the overhauling that these defects were noted, we get, I think, some clue to the manner, at least to the reason, why one firm was able to tender for this work while another firm was not able to tender at a figure anything like the same sum.  Extras count very greatly indeed amongst contractors for ship repairs, and if one firm is in a position to hear that there will be a great field for extras it is a great temptation for that firm, which knows of the probability of extras, to cut down the price for the nominal repairs <Col N="2445" /> in the sure and certain hope that there will be plenty of recoupment to be made out of the extras.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The repairs to the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; were normal overhauling. This contract was given for normal overhauling. After having been out in service for an extra time it was found necessary to overhaul the ship, and certain specifications were no doubt sent to the various firms capable of doing this work. It was known to more than one person, it was known to quite a number of people, that the keel of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; required considerable repairing.  It was known that there was a good deal of damage done to the &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; but this damage, which, as I say, was known to several people, was not tendered for.  I suggest that one is justified in thinking that a quotation, or tender, for overhauling in one port which is 100 per cent. less on the same rates of wages, or near about the same rate of wages, as the tenders for the same work in another port can be justified on the assumption that the low-tender firm knew that there was a great deal of overhauling to be done besides that tendered for, and that once the ship got into the yard it was not likely to be removed.  When we learn that 18 days were promised, and that the contract, which was something less than £1,000, is now likely to be increased by several thousand pounds, it suggests the necessity for some examination into this business.  I think, forgive the pun, there is something fishy about it.  One could never understand how one firm could make an estimate which was lower in its totality than the item for wages in another firm, that material would be nearly as much in one firm which ought to be just as well able to provide material as another, as the total of the tender of the successful firm.  The very huge difference in the tenders <Col N="2446" /> ought, I submit, to have made the Ministry exceedingly cautious and doubtful before they sent away a ship of this kind to any firm outside the Saorstát under these conditions.  When we now have the sequel that three or four times the amount of work had to be done than was tendered for, and once the ship was opened up she could not be removed until the whole work was completed, and what was lost on the original tender could be made up out of extras, the explanation can be readily understood. While, I suppose, the damage is done, it ought to make Departments even more cautious and more careful than they have been, and to remember that things are not always what they seem.  Cheapness is not only low prices.  I think the mystery of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; has still to be solved, but I think we are on the way to solving it.</P>

I am not going to make any charges against anyone or be disrespectful to anyone, but I suggest to the Minister it is very desirable he should inquire into the relationships of the individual responsible for the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; with the shipbuilding firm to which the contract of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; has been given.  I am one of those who believe that the Ulster question can only be settled, in the long run, by a policy of economic pressure.  Many things might have been taken into consideration before that ship was sent out.  It is not right to send revenue of this State to another State which denies people a living simply because they differ from them in many respects.  The question of wages cannot be a serious consideration in the contract price, because wages in Cork are £3 9s. 0d. and in Belfast £2 10s. 0d. to £2 15s. 0d., and the difference, I am informed, is less in Haulbowline.</P>

      <P>That justifies the argument I have just been trying to get into the mind of the Minister&mdash;that is, that the question of the wages of the worker is not the real issue in this particular <Col N="2447" /> case.  It is very hard to think that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of shipyard workers were thrown out of the shipyards in Belfast and dumped in upon the charity and friendship of the people of the Saorstát, and are walking about the different streets of the Saorstát, and to find that a ship the property of the Government has to be sent to the yards of the people who carried out the policy of pogrom for the last few years. I would ask the Minister who is responsible to get his hand tight upon the person responsible, so that the act will not be repeated without very good reason. It is not the question of £900 that is involved, but simply a question of policy in connection with the persons responsible for this pogrom.  I would not blame the Government if they sent this contract across to Newcastle, Liverpool, or Hamburg, because we know that wherever Irishmen went outside of Belfast shipyards, they were able to get a day's work without being asked what their religion was.  I do blame them for sending money collected from the people in this State to be paid to the people in Belfast who will not allow others a living unless they profess their faith in the policy they are carrying out. I think that one might go a long way in discussing a matter of this kind.  It is only a question of drawing the attention of the Ministry to it now to see that nothing, in our time at any rate, will happen like that again, unless there is some very good reason&mdash;a better reason than the one previously put up by the Minister responsible.</P>

In view of that, I think it is up to the Minister responsible, or to the Government, to have an inquiry into the whole matter of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; going to Belfast.  I have no particular enmity against Belfast people more than any other people, but here we have it stated openly that either the Board of Trade or the assessors or underwriters asked the Haulbowline people, or the Furness, Whitty people, or the Belfast people to quote for specific <Col N="2448" /> damage to the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; and other ships, and they quoted for such, and when this vessel goes into Belfast it is then found, and only then, in spite of all the experts who examined it before that and asked people to quote specifically, that there are other damages to the ship.  We must only assume that the Belfast people were warned beforehand that there were certain other damages to this ship.  I think the whole case is there for inquiry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle has given notice that he will raise the question of the shooting of an unarmed civilian in Wexford on Friday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DOYLE Mr. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this question of the shooting of this unarmed prisoner I assure the Dáil that I have no animus to the Minister for Defence or to the military.  My chief reason for doing so is the expressed wish of a very large number of my constituents.  They asked me to raise this question in the Dáil in the hope that such shootings might be deterred in the future, and that some other ways and means might be found to cope with men who are still on the run besides shooting them, as in the present case.  I simply detail the case as it was detailed at the inquest.  This prisoner, a man named Michael Radford, was one of a number of prisoners who escaped from Wexford Military Barracks, I understand, about eight weeks ago, and who has since been more or less at home working on his farm, and with his father, until about four or five days ago.  I understand that those prisoners had some information that the military were again on their trail, and that they were to be re-arrested.  Again those prisoners, or some of them, went on the run.  They went into a certain district, and into that district last Friday a large search party of military made their way.  Posts were set up and sentries placed at different points.  One, a sentry at the end of a laneway leading from certain lands to the public road, was placed on the road at the end of the laneway, and at about 10.30 o'clock, according to his evidence at the inquest, he saw three men approaching.  When they saw him they turned and ran back the lane again.  This sentry, a young man about sixteen years of age&mdash;I do not think from his appearance he could have been any more&mdash;called on them to halt three times.  He swore at the inquest that he then fired a shot over their <Col N="2450" /> heads.  They did not take any notice or either the &ldquo;Halt&rdquo; or the shot fired over their heads.  They kept running, and two of them got over the fences at different sides of the lane.  When the third man was jumping over the fence the sentry said he fired at him to kill, and he accomplished his object.  The man scrambled over the ditch after being hit and got into the field about three yards inside the fence, where he lay until he died.  I understand that the military had those instructions when they were told off to make this search, and those instructions were, I believe, carried out to the letter by this sentry.  Where the callous part of the whole proceedings arose was, this sentry said that he asked the other sentries about to go down and see if any of the men were hit.  They went a small portion down the laneway and they found nobody, and they came back and reported accordingly to the sentry.  In the morning about 5.30 the sentry himself&mdash;I suppose he was aware he had hit his prisoner, I do not know if that is so, as he did not say so at the inquest&mdash;made a search at that hour in the morning and found the body three yards inside the fence.  That is what I consider the callous part of the whole transaction.  The doctor said at the inquest that if medical aid had been procured immediately he certainly would have been able to alleviate the sufferings of this man, and there was a possible chance that he might have been able to save his life.  No move was made to find whether this man was hit or otherwise from 10.30 on that night until 5.30 on the following morning, when he was found by the man who shot him. This is a matter my constituents complained bitterly about, and, along with that, they think there should be some other ways and means found, now that things are approaching normal, in cases of this kind.  We have things pretty normal in Wexford, and everybody is agreeably surprised at the peaceful time we are having for the past six or eight weeks. I raise this question in the hope that the Minister for Defence and the Government may find some other means of coping with those escaping prisoners than by shooting them.  I can give the assurance that it has had anything at all but a pacifying effect on the district.  From all I have heard I believe he was popular, and his funeral from the military barracks <Col N="2451" /> on Saturday night bore that out. I do not condone in any way the actions of the Irregulars in any shape or form, and I never did.  The people who have complained to me about the shooting of this man have been staunch supporters of the Government ever since the Treaty was signed.  They have no axe to grind, but they think some other form of punishment should be found at present than the taking of life.  No matter what may be said, since the order to cease fire by the other side they have given no provocation in County Wexford in any shape or form as far as I know.  I hope the Minister may be able to say that other measures may be taken besides the shooting of prisoners even if they are escaping. I consider the time has come when actions like this will embitter the community more than anything else, and certainly it will not tend to peace in the country.  Before the &ldquo;Cease fire&rdquo; order Wexford was anything but peaceful.  In fact, it was one of the worst counties in Ireland, but since that order was issued another influence was brought to bear, and the county is one of the most peaceful in Ireland.  I conclude by again expressing the hope that we will have no more bloodshed such as this now that things have become normal.</P>

      <P>I fully endorse every word uttered by Deputy Doyle. I hope the Minister for Defence will take every means in his power to restrain shooting&mdash;indiscriminate shooting. This is the third man who has been shot in the County Wexford during the last couple of weeks.  As Deputy Doyle has stated, peace now prevails amongst all classes.</P>

      <P>I think it does Deputy Doyle great credit to speak in the way he has done in respect of those people in Wexford who brought such sad destruction upon him personally.  The only information I have officially in regard to this incident is contained in a telegram received at 12 noon on Saturday. It states: &ldquo;During operations by our troops in South Wexford this morning (Saturday), Michael Radford, one of the prisoners who escaped from Wexford Jail, failed to halt when called upon, and was shot dead.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> Now, the Deputy speaks of the shooting of unarmed prisoners.  I take it that that is a wrong description, and that it is clear from the Deputy's own description of the incident that this was a man who had been a prisoner and escaped.  He was one of the responsible Irregular leaders in the area.  Serious attempts to effect his escape and the escape of others were previously made, but they were foiled by the watchfulness of our troops.  There did recently escape prisoners to the number of twenty-seven.  This was a man who was at large, and he was being rounded up at the time when the shooting took place.  It is not right to speak of this case as the shooting of an unarmed prisoner.</P>

      <P>The official information I have is that that incident took place early on Saturday morning. From the Deputy's own statement of the situation it will be understood it was quite possible that in the darkness it was difficult to locate whether or not the man lay in the field.  If the position was that the sentry could not leave his post, but had to send other men to find out what the situation was in regard to that particular man, it was possible and reasonable that they could not locate him, and if the deceased was found at half-past five o'clock in the morning, until we have more information about that it is quite reasonable that finding the deceased at half-past five was finding him at the earliest possible moment, which, considering the operations we had on hands, it was reasonable to expect he should be found.  I think it is not deserved, and it is not just either to the Army authorities, who dictate the policy that has been carried out from the Army point of view, or to the men <Col N="2453" /> who have been suffering death and pain and wounds at the hands of men in Wexford, and suffering them cheerfully, and with very good discipline and control&mdash;it is not just to them to state that there was callousness in their attitude in this particular instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is greatly to the credit of the Deputy, this extending of his compassion and sympathy to these unfortunate people who have brought so much trouble on that particular area.  In view of the spirit in which he raised the matter, certainly the men in the ranks of the Army there, who have suffered and are suffering so unnecessarily, might receive from the Deputy some of that compassion and sympathy that he has given expression to.  Prisoners to a large number did escape from Wexford, and the duty that was upon us to hold these prisoners at that time is upon us to recapture them.  Some very dangerous prisoners have escaped in different parts of the country.  We have explained to the Dáil that, while there is a large amount of peace on the surface and while we hope for a continuance and a firm establishment of that peace, we still have certain duties to look after the protection of the country. In view of certain things that we know of, and certain things that are plain and are happening, it is our duty at least to see that men who are prominent Irregulars, and who have escaped from our custody, are recaptured.  We have to <Col N="2454" /> get after these men and to recapture them by military force.  It is not unreasonable, knowing what our treatment of prisoners has been and knowing the clemency of the Government in dealing with the prisoners who have fallen into their hands, whether there is a charge against them or not, that when men know they are caught in a trap and know they are surrounded by our soldiers, that they would answer the challenge to halt.  If they bring death or wounds on themselves by not answering challenges that are only issued for the safety of these men themselves and for the safety of our troops, then we cannot be accounted callous or unreasonable if, by non-compliance with these challenges, these men bring either death or wounds on themselves.  The policy of the Government generally, and the policy of the troops in Wexford, is one of dealing stoutly and sympathetically with whatever there is of danger in the situation there, but dealing with it in the same tactful and clement way that the situation in every other part of the country has been dealt with for so long, and is being dealt with at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>My chief point was that if other means than shooting could be dealt out in cases like this it would be desirable.  It was to stop shooting that I put the question.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Tuesday, the 26th June.</P>
