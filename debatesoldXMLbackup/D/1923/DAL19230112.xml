      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the reform announced in the system of motor taxation has given great dissatisfaction to motorists; whether he is aware that the failure to make a reasonable reduction in the tax has caused numbers of motorists to cease using their cars; whether the facilities for motoring at present justify taxes, which in some cases are higher than those prevailing in Great Britain or the North of Ireland; and whether, with a view to preventing any further decline in the use of motor vehicles, he will consider the establishment of a small committee to prepare both a permanent scheme of taxation, based on use and an interim scheme, which will enable the motor industry to survive the present trouble; if he is aware that a large number of garage proprietors and motor repairers have dismissed their employees owing to slackness?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the recent revised basis of taxation, which has resulted in reductions in tax on some private motors most generally used, has given dissatisfaction. On the contrary, a very large number of those interested in motoring appreciate the concession made.</P>
      <P>There is no information which would lead me to believe that there has been any recent diminution in the number of cars used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised taxation in force from the 1st instant reduced the tax on several of the cars commonly used in Ireland. By the extent of the concessions which have been made, motorists in Ireland are placed in a more favourable position <Col N="716" /> than those in Great Britain or in the North-Eastern Counties.</P>
    <P>Greatly reduced motor taxation would produce a depleted Road Fund, at a time when improved roads and road maintenance are most essential.</P>
    <P>I have been favoured from many authoritative sources with exhaustive information on the whole subject of motor taxation and the position of the motor industry.  An Advisory Committee will be formed when it appears that the formation of such may be of material assistance.</P>
    <P>If garage proprietors and motor repairers have, in some instances, dismissed their employees owing to slackness, this is attributable to causes other than the amount of the taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the Minister would kindly receive a deputation from the traders and users interested in this matter.  The concession he is supposed to have given only affects one style of car, and I think, if the Minister will receive a deputation, we could put some information before him which would be useful.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether the provisions in regard to agricultural holdings under the Irish Land (Provision for Soldiers and Sailors) Act, 1919, were cancelled or postponed in February, 1922, and if so for what reason, and what are the prospects of making further use of that Section of the Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On account of the acute state of feeling existing in the country on the subject <Col N="717" /> of the provision of the holdings in question the Provisional Government on the 4th February, 1922, made the order referred to.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that National troops commandeered two motor cars, the property of Mr. John Grenham, Connaught Street, Athlone, on 12th July, 1922, whether one car was returned in a damaged condition on 1st September, 1922, and if the authorities have received a bill for repairs of same. Further, whether another car was taken by National troops on November 9th, 1922, and whether this car is now lying useless in Custume Barracks, Athlone. Further, whether and when it is the intention of the Minister to compensate Mr. Grenham for loss sustained, to the extent of£1,486 12s., from 12th July, 1922, to 1st January, 1923.</P>

      <P>Two Ford cars were commandeered on the 12th July.  A bill for the repairs to car returned on the 1st September has been received.  It appears that the car commandeered on or about the 9th November is lying in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  I am making inquiries into its condition.  The whole question of compensation in respect of commandeering of motor cars is at present under discussion with the Ministry of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this particular man, Brennan, has lost his trade through the commandeering of these cars?  There were three of his cars commandeered, and he has lost practically all his trade in consequence. These customers that used to hire his cars for the purpose of driving them to different places in the country have had, of course, to engage other cars, and this <Col N="718" /> man now claims the sum of £1,486 12s., which is the total amount he has lost, and I would ask the Minister to consider the necessity of paying this amount at the earliest possible moment.</P>

Whether the same claimant has been compelled to continue supplying the National Forces in Roscommon with motor cars and parts, and has received no payment for these supplies since 1921, notwithstanding that the account for same has been furnished on numerous occasions, and as Mr. Dillon Conroy is in consequence in a bad way financially, will he see that his claim receives immediate attention.</P>

Whether the Minister is also aware that, as a result of this destruction of motor vehicles, the whole Motor Trade Association of Cork City and County is absolutely breaking to pieces, and a large number of men are, as a result, being disemployed.  Whether the Minister will refute this statement of the Irregulars, and otherwise, as far as possible, afford protection to the motor trade.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he has noted the following very serious report which appeared in Press <i>(Independent)</i>, 6th instant, to the following effect, viz.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Following the holding up of mail car near Midleton, Co. Cork, on Monday, armed raiders have commenced a campaign of wholesale looting and plundering in the district south of town.  The following plunder and destruction is reported:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Licensed premises of Mr. McCarthy, Cloyne, robbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> (2)  Post Office, Shanagarry, raided and robbed.</P>
    <P>(3)  Licensed premises of Mr. Kennefick, raided and robbed.</P>
    <P>(4)  Residence of Mr. Engledow, Rostellan, raided and robbed.</P>
    <P>(5)  Residence of Mr. Shanahan, Ballymacoda, raided and robbed.</P>
    <P>(6)  Motor vans and contents of Messrs. Lenehan and Abernethy, Castlemartyr, wholly destroyed.</P>
    <P>Whether the military are in sufficient strength and have sufficient transport and equipment to afford greater protection to the people of this area, and their property.  Whether the military have apprehended any of these raiders engaged in above alleged loot and destruction; and whether, in the case of any of the above persons being seriously financially embarrassed, as a result of such raids on their premises and stock the Minister will, after having the necessary inquiries made by his department into each case of any such hardship, advise the Minister for Finance to advance sufficient moneys to such persons to enable them to carry on their business pending the hearing of their claim for compensation in the Law Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed, amongst others, the report quoted, and am satisfied that there is reasonable strength of garrison and of transport and equipment at Midleton.

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he has received a complaint to the effect that Free State troops effected a forcible entrance into the Central Garage, Ballinasloe, at 4 a.m. on the morning of the 5th January, and, without producing any written authority, took possession of two Ford cars, the property of the proprietor, Mr. James Martin; whether such action is not a violation of the public notices issued by the military authorities to the effect that motor cars could only be commandeered or requisitioned on the production of a specially authorised form, <Col N="721" /> and if he will state what action he has taken, or proposes to take in connection with the incident referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>On the morning of the 5th January information was received at Ballinasloe Military Barracks that a prisoner named Keogh, who had escaped from Athlone on the night of the 4th inst., was in the townland of Kilconnel.  No Army transport being available, the O.C. sent two members of the National Forces to the Central Garage to inform the proprietor that he required two cars for the purpose of visiting Kilconnel to arrest the escaped prisoner.  The urgent circumstances necessitated a breach of regulations.</P>
      <P>The Garage was occupied by the foreman, who refused to open the Garage, and refused to give the cars as requested. The O.C. personally visited the Garage and requested the use of the cars, and explained the reason necessary for his request.  His request was also refused.</P>
      <P>The O.C. then forced the door of the Garage and took possession of two Ford cars, which were returned in good condition to the proprietor at noon on the 5th inst.  The proprietor informed the O.C. that he regretted that he was not present when the cars were commandeered; that he was only too willing to assist the Army Authorities in every way, and promised that it would not be necessary for the Military to take such action in future, as far as his cars were concerned; we had the satisfaction of re-capturing an escaped prisoner.</P>

    <P>The procedure in connection with the claim of an officer or man who is married is that the Pay Officer who issues his Pay Book notifies the Assistant Chief Pay Officer, Portobello Barracks, <Col N="723" /> that the officer or soldier appears to be entitled to Dependents' Allowance.  The Assistant Chief Pay Officer issues a Declaration Form to the wife.  On the return of that Form properly completed and certified correct by a responsible person, payment of the allowance commences. In the case of other claims, the procedure adopted is that the Assistant Chief Pay Officer awaits a request from the dependents for an allowance or the receipt of a statement of claim from the officer or soldier on a special Form, Q.P. 7.  As in the case of married claims, the Assistant Chief Pay Officer then requests the dependents to complete the Declaration Form.  When those Forms are returned, the validity of the claim is investigated and the amount payable is assessed.  Pending investigation, where a <i>prima facie</i> case is established, conditional issues at the rate of £1 per fortnight for three fortnights are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move for leave of the Dáil to introduce the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923.  The object of this measure is to regularise the position temporarily of the various county schemes which are in operation at present. Members of the Dáil will be aware that the question of the reform of the Poor Law in Ireland has been under discussion for a couple of generations at any rate.  The workhouse system was set up originally against the advice of Irish experts, against Irish public opinion and in imitation of the British system.  It was continually condemned, and its abolition and substitution by a better system were continually being advised. Nothing, however, was done until a year or two ago, when the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann took the matter up.  In the ordinary way the changes would have been made by legislation, and a new and comprehensive law would have been introduced, and when <Col N="724" /> the Bill had been considered and passed, the changes would have been made by virtue of law.  In fact, however, the changes were made without any legal sanction.  The workhouses were abolished, the Boards of Guardians ceased to function.  In most counties, County Homes were substituted for workhouses. &mdash;homes that would accommodate the aged and infirm&mdash;and a system of home help was set up, which, because of the abolition of the workhouses, differed considerably from outdoor relief, because the administration of outdoor relief as it stood took the alternative of the workhouse. These schemes have been put into operation in all but three counties, and they vary considerably.  They will have to be standardized later on, and the whole matter will have to be regularised by permanent legislation.  The whole position is this, the existing Poor Law has been blown sky high; new bodies have been set up which are extra legal bodies at the moment.  To prevent endless litigation and the greatest confusion it is necessary that the Oireachtas should pass legislation of a temporary character regularising the position of the various bodies set up, and to which, without legal sanction, functions have been transferred. Later on, and as soon as possible, permanent legislation will be put before the Dáil, but I think it will be appreciated that it is necessary at the moment that these bodies that have been set up and these institutions that have been brought into being should be given a temporary legal sanction to enable them to carry on their work.  In actual practice the reforms have been well received in the country, and they have achieved very good results.  No doubt there are faults in most, or in all of the schemes that require to be remedied, but it can hardly be disputed that a great step forward has been taken, and that a better system has been brought into being, and very considerable economies have been effected for the ratepayers in spite of the high superannuation charges which the changes necessitated. I need not, I think, describe the proposed measure at greater detail at this stage.  If the Dáil agrees to give leave to introduce the Bill it will be printed, and Deputies can see for themselves the scope of it.</P>

      <P>I only heard that this matter was on the Orders of the Day at 2.30 to-day.  That is the first information I had about it, and obviously <Col N="726" /> it would be impossible, in the short period between that hour and the assembling of the Dáil, to consider a subject which is somewhat complicated by reason of the Constitution.  The Constitution reserves matters concerning money exclusively to this Dáil.  No question arises in connection with it, but it is possible that meetings of the Seanad may not be as continuous as those of the Dáil, and it may be possible to make recommendations with regard to the staffs that will be required, and what are called minor appointments, and so on.  In any case, having regard to the fact that it is now two or three weeks since the Seanad met, a staff would scarcely have been busily engaged during that period, and it is a question that is open for review and consideration, and the submission, perhaps, of some recommendations with regard to this matter.  For that purpose, I move that this Report be listed for consideration on Tuesday, and in the meantime the Ministry of Finance submit a report on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well to draw attention to the rather unusual manner of presenting this name&mdash;Mr. George McGrath&mdash;and recommending it to the Dáil for this appointment.  Last week I urged that the appointment of this officer should be left in the hands of the Dáil, and when doing that I knew exactly that it would make no difference in reality whether the whole initiation should be in the hands of a Committee of the Dáil or that the name be recommended by the Ministry.  But I thought it well, in view of the particular responsibilities direct to the Dáil of this officer, that the whole proceedings in connection with this appointment should take place in the Dáil rather than that any name should be recommended directly by the Ministry as such.  While I say I knew that the same person would, in fact, be appointed, I think it well that that procedure should have been adopted, for this reason, that it cannot at any time be suggested henceforward that the Auditor and Comptroller General is a Treasury Official.  He is definitely and directly a servant of the Dáil.  There was a good deal said, I think, on the last occasion as regards the importance of this office and the necessity for having someone who was efficient and capable of carrying out the very responsible duties, and especially when we bear in mind that it is practically a life office. He is not removable except by the Vote of the two Houses.  The Committee has recommended the name of Mr. George McGrath, and I take it that they had full knowledge of his capacity and ability, and I am not going in any way to decry that recommendation.  I do not know Mr. McGrath and I have no knowledge of his ability or of any other name that might have been mentioned to the Committee except such public knowledge as one gets from the newspapers.  The fact that Mr. McGrath <Col N="729" /> acted with efficiency and ability in a similar capacity for the Second Dáil is not quite satisfactory in itself as a recommendation because the circumstances under which that Second Dáil was acting limited the choice.  The fact that Mr. George McGrath is a brother of a Minister should not be allowed to weigh with us. I do not believe in visiting the sins or the excellencies of the brother upon another brother, and I do not think that we ought to condemn any man because of the acts of his brother; nor do I think that we ought to give credit to any man because of the acts of his brother.  But there is just this consideration that occurs to me. When, in the course of the next few months, if the destroyers continue, there arises a modern Irish Mussolini who gathers up all the reactionary elements in the country to take control&mdash;I can imagine these reactionary elements, having got control, looking round for an argument for a hereditary legislature, and they will point to the evidence that has been established; they will say&mdash;&ldquo;We have had recent experience of a body of men, one of whose primary principles was to make promotion by merit, and only give offices to those who had shown their ability and fitness for the offices.&rdquo;  They will show, by pointing to the evidence round about, that ability runs in families, as is obvious by the appointments that were made by the Government to the various posts in their administration.  No one will charge the Ministry in those days, in such circumstances&mdash;that is to say no one will charge this present Ministry&mdash;when looking for an excuse for the establishment of an hereditary legislature &mdash;with having selected people who were unfit for their positions, and the deduction will naturally come that all these people who happen to have brothers and cousins and uncles and aunts within the magic circle, all of supreme ability, will furnish a proof of the doctrine of hereditary ability in administrative posts.  This particular appointment that we are discussing may be quoted, but it will be possible in this case, I am told, to point to ability positively shown in the recent past and in the public eye.  I do not think that that could be said of many other family appointments.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand what is meant by &ldquo;many of the other family appointments.&rdquo;  If it is <Col N="730" /> meant against the Ministry I do not know of any.  Certain rumours are current, not alone in Dublin, but all over Ireland, that every relative that I have, that every connection by marriage that I have, has been placed in an excellent position.  That is not true.  There is absolutely no truth in it.  I do not think that the Deputy has that in his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was saying was that it has been rumoured, not alone in Dublin, but all over Ireland, that every relative that I have and every connection that I have by marriage has been placed in a position or office of emolument and of profit by the Government.  That is not true.  I have not placed a single one of them.  There is one member of my family at present in an exceedingly unenviable position, if that be an office of profit.  If I had been consulting his interests I would certainly never have nominated him for the position, but so far as I know he has done his duty in the particular office he holds. It is not an office, I think, that many people would envy.  In this particular case of the Comptroller and Auditor-General I am perfectly satisfied that in the circumstances of the case the Committee exercised good judgment in the appointment.  He was Comptroller or Accountant-General of the late Dáil (the second Dáil), and of the third Dáil, and first Dáil, and he discharged the duties of that office, under exceedingly difficult circumstances, and he did so to the entire satisfaction of the late Minister for Finance.  The duties at that time were onerous; they may not be of the same order as the duties he will be called upon to discharge now, but at any rate, it is a satisfaction to us to know, that as far as this particular office was concerned that not a single penny of money was lost.  There have been losses, but the losses are not in any sense attributable to any action he has taken.  Every safeguard and every protection that the wit of man could possibly suggest he took, and recently we sent him to America to see after the funds there, the names of subscribers and other duties in connection with the loan.  From the correspondence I have received since his return I am perfectly satisfied that he enhanced the reputation of this country <Col N="731" /> in America.  He met many financiers and prominent citizens of the United States, and from all that I have been able to learn his visit to America was one that reflects some credit on himself, and his reflected glory is also, to some extent, on the Government.  Now, in order that there may be no misunderstanding regarding what the Deputy has said, I think, in justice not alone to the Ministry, but to the Dáil, that if there be any charges against the Ministry&mdash;I forget the exact term of this particular disorder, but I think it is nepotism&mdash;I think we ought to have it now, because these are times when once having started on government any suggestion of that sort would damage not alone the reputation of the Government, but reflect very seriously on what we all, I believe, are earnestly hoping for and working hard to achieve&mdash;namely, stabilisation in the country.  I am perfectly satisfied from what I knew of the late Minister for Finance, and from discussions at Cabinet meetings previous to this appointment that no question whatever of his relationship with the Minister for Industry and Commerce ever entered into his mind in making the appointment. He had a pretty considerable field to choose from, and I think his selection was a wise one.  I am not going now to enter into a eulogy of the person appointed, because to-morrow or next day we may be in handigrips over matters, but I am satisfied of this, that the Dáil might have made a better appointment, but it could not have made a more honest appointment.</P>

      <P>I think the speech we have just heard from Deputy Johnson was one of the most objectionable speeches I have listened to in the Dáil for some time.  He did not say anything definite, except to say that Mr. McGrath was worthy of his position, but he did suggest general corruption. There was a sort of &ldquo;willing to wound, but yet afraid to strike&rdquo; air about it.  I agree with the President that this is the place to have that sort of thing out.  If there has been anything in the nature of nepotism it should be stated, and the facts and the names given.  I think I know the circumstances, being in the Ministry, as well as most people.  Of my own knowledge I do not know any cases.  There are relations of each member of the Government <Col N="732" /> as privates and captains, and in other positions in the army in the South, and to all whom it may concern, I wish to announce that there are vacancies in these services&mdash;any amount of them&mdash;and we are looking for men to fill them.  If people covet these particular positions they can have them. There are plenty more of them, but there have been no appointments of a different sort.  The other positions, the positions of emolument and safety have been largely filled, practically entirely filled, by persons who have had no connection and no relationship with members of the Government.  I think now is the time and place to have this matter completely thrashed out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather glad that this discussion arose.  It gives one an opportunity of clearing the air a bit.  There has been criticism of appointments; there have been and will be criticisms of appointments for which I take political responsibility.  I want to say this that that criticism has been entirely of one description, and it has been along the lines that we failed to put in positions our own political and social friends, that we were unduly mindful of the question of qualifications&mdash;unduly in the minds of our critics.  We are stewards for the nation, for the whole nation, not for a political party within the nation.  The appointments we make we make on behalf of and in the name of all the people.  The men we appoint will be performing duties for perhaps fifteen, twenty, twenty-five or thirty years to come, when the political landmarks of to-day and the considerations that seem very important to-day and which loom so large in some minds will have passed and will have been forgotten. Therefore, we, all of us, in filling appointments, have put one thing first, and that was the qualifications of the man for the post and for the fulfilment of the duties attaching to the post.  Where political considerations arose, or were adverted to, they were adverted to in one way only, and that was in a negative way.  It might arise that a man with high qualifications would have his utility largely negatived, largely neutralised by the misfortune of having rendered himself utterly obnoxious to the community in which he would have to perform those duties.  In that case pseudo-political considerations were adverted to, <Col N="733" /> but mainly, if not entirely, in that negative way, that a man could not be put into a post if he had the misfortune to render himself politically very obnoxious to the people in the area in which he had to perform his duty.  But we are not making political appointments in the sense of claiming or exercising any monopoly on behalf of our own more immediate political associates.  But still less are we making any appointments purely on the grounds of personal friendship.  Some of the most painful things I was called upon to do in my own Ministry was to refuse the applications of intimate personal friends who, no doubt, will never forget it to me.  There was no monopoly of political appointments; still less was there a monopoly of social appointments, and least of all was there any tendency whatever towards kinship appointments. I do not believe that the Deputy who spoke and gave rise to this discussion was adverting to one particular appointment &mdash;the appointment of a gentleman who some twenty years before I was born married the sister of a lady who subsequently became my mother.  I do not believe he was adverting to that appointment.</P>

I put forward another name, thinking that that gentleman would be the best.  I hold that view still, and I believe that the gentleman that I put forward had more qualifications and more worldly experience.  I hold that view still, but I signed that recommendation in obedience to the wishes of the majority, as everybody must recognise the majority. If it came to the Dáil the same majority would obtain.  I have heard a lot of praise in regard to Mr. McGrath. I believe he has done very good work.  I did not know the names of any of the candidates previous to the meeting last night, I know none of them personally. I am quite satisfied with the appointment, but I think we could have made a better appointment by selecting one of the other candidates.</P>

      <P>As secretary of this Committee I would just like to say a word.  I did not know that Mr. George McGrath was brother to the Minister for Industry and Commerce until it was <Col N="734" /> stated here to-day.  No one told me that before I went into that committee.  No one canvassed me to vote for anybody at that committee.  I was more or less surprised when I heard he was the brother of Mr. Joseph McGrath, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have learned long since of Mr. McGrath's work, and on the authority of someone for whom I had deep respect, I learned of his efficiency in that respect. That was the reason why I voted for him. Other names were submitted to the Committee; one of the candidates I know to be eminently qualified, but I held with the majority of the Committee that when we had a man who had a full knowledge for the efficient discharge of similar duties for the Second Dáil, it was hardly the business of the Committee to recommend his removal so as to make place for another who had not that experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Clause 20.  So far as the principle of this Clause is concerned it is one to which we are committed in the Constitution. Whatever may be said for or against the principle of Proportional Representation, it is with us.  It has a great many advantages on the surface, and if later on it may prove to have some disadvantages, still it is one which was without dissent adopted when the Constitution was under consideration in the Dáil.  So far as General Elections are concerned we have the principle of Proportional Representation.  When bye-elections take place, the carrying out of the principle is impossible.  Suppose a vacancy occurs in any constituency, and the candidate whose seat is vacated represents a minority.  We cannot do anything which will prevent the return of a majority candidate.  Consequently the strict principle of Proportional Representation cannot be saved. As the Clause stands it excepts, from the operation of the single transferable vote, bye-elections at which one or two members are to be elected.  I think there is a good deal to be said in favour of using the single transferable vote when there are two candidates to be elected, although the Proportional idea cannot be given effect to very well under these circumstances.  Where there is only one candidate to be elected it is preferable not to have the transferable vote, for this reason: If a minority candidate dies or resigns and you have a single transferable vote, then beyond all doubt the candidate not representing that party will be returned.  If you use the old system of voting&mdash;and it is not necessary for this purpose to make an &ldquo;X&rdquo; on your paper, as the figure 1 will do as well&mdash;then occasionally, things will be evened by a minority candidate slipping in.  As long as we have bye-elections, and do not cause all the members for a constituency to retire and re-present themselves to the electors when a casual vacancy occurs&mdash;as long as we have bye-elections for a single member of the constituency, the scheme of Proportional Representation is bound to fail to some extent. <Col N="736" /> The law of average will insure that in most cases the vacancy will occur in the ranks of the majority party, and in most cases under the old system of voting a majority candidate in any constituency will be returned; but there will be frequent vacancies in one or other minority party, and as far as at least single vacancies are concerned, if we keep to the old system of voting, we will preserve the general scheme of Proportional Representation a little better.  At times, and perhaps fairly frequently, a candidate who is representing a party in the minority in the constituency will get in through division in the ranks of the majority party or the two wings of a party that may otherwise coalesce against that majority party. I think it gives a chance of evening up under the scheme of Proportional Representation, and that as far at least as single vacancies are concerned the old system should be retained.  As far as double vacancies are concerned I think it is a border line case, and that possibly the advantage is even in favour of the transferable vote.</P>

      <P>Deputy Darrell Figgis is unable to be here.  Last evening he arranged with me to move these amendments on his behalf.  Shall I move for Sub-clause 1 merely?  Deputy Darrell Figgis proposes to omit what is in the Draft, and to substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At a contested election for a Parliamentary constituency, each elector shall have one transferable vote, and where there are two or more members to be elected the election shall be according to the principle of Proportional Representation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That differs from the original in a few respects.  Instead of speaking of an election for members to serve in the Dáil it speaks of a Parliamentary election. Evidently Deputy Figgis considers that by introducing the word Parliamentary election he keeps this Clause in harmony with the other Clauses in which a distinction is drawn between election to the Seanad and election to the Dáil.  Personally, I would like, speaking on my own behalf, to point out that there is a wrong conception here, because the second Chamber is a <Col N="737" /> part of the Oireachtas and consequently an election for that is unquestionably a Parliamentary election.  So I formally have moved this Sub-Clause I on behalf of the Deputy, and I hope it does not interfere with my right to criticise it.</P>

      <P>Except for wording and for the use of the expression Parliamentary constituency this sub-clause proposed by Deputy Magennis seems to me to be identical with the proposal of Deputy O'Brien, which is merely to substitute a two member vacancy for a vacancy for more than two members.  It seems to me that as that is the sole effect and as the Deputy who moved this amendment disapproves of the expression &ldquo;Parliamentary constituency&rdquo; it would be desirable to take Deputy O'Brien's amendment.  We can then consider Sub-Clause 2 afterwards. Does Deputy Magennis agree?</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister, while not accepting this gives it a certain amount of support and is prepared to concede at any rate the method of voting in bye-elections, namely, by numbers instead of the old system of the X, and that is a gain and an advantage.  This willingness to concede and admit the proportional system where there are two vacancies is also an advantage.  We think still it would be better if this amendment could be embodied and ensure that a minority candidate would not be elected.  We think, on the whole, where there is a bye-election that while it is quite true to say that nothing could prevent a majority candidate being elected, if the old system is adhered to, that it is quite easy and frequently happens that a minority candidate is elected, when there are two, three or more candidates, which I think is undesirable.  I think there is a fair case for accepting such an amendment as we have put down.  Of course we all admit <Col N="738" /> that the principle of Proportional Representation has got to go by the board in casual vacancies.  There is no method that we know of that can be devised except the system of co-option or something of that kind, or a recognition of the right of the Party of which the retiring or deceased Deputy was a member to put forward a candidate, and there are difficulties about that.  Having regard to that I move the amendment standing in my name, but if it is not carried we will recognise the concession which the Minister has outlined.</P>

      <P>I think it would be an advantage if, in discussing this question henceforth, we should use the term &ldquo;single transferable vote&rdquo; when we are dealing with the method of taking an election.  I think it is unfortunate that the drafters of the Constitution should have embodied the phrase&mdash;I think it was imported from the P.R. Society in London&mdash;&ldquo;the principle of proportional representation.&rdquo;  Now, there are a dozen methods of attempting to achieve proportional representation.  The principle of proportional representation might be very well to speak of when we are dealing with the election of a Parliament, but when we are dealing with the election of a single member, or even two members, it is not right to speak of the principle of proportional representation. The method of the single transferable vote would more accurately describe it. In dealing with the relative merits of the single transferable vote or the non-transferable vote method in bye-elections it has to be borne in mind that the chief value of bye-elections for a Parliament, especially in the case of a Parliament which will only live for four years would lie in the index of public opinion on current questions.  It is not so much a matter of getting a particular person elected as the index that it gives of the trend of public opinion.  In such a case it is unfortunate, where there may be three or <Col N="739" /> four candidates for one seat at a bye-election, that the minority man should be returned, and that the test of public opinion is thereby hidden.  Now, the single transferable vote method, even in the case of three or four candidates for one seat, is a better means of indicating that public opinion than the old system. In the great majority of cases, from past experience, and I think even from future experience, where the single transferable vote method is adopted at bye-elections, there will only be two candidates, or at most three.  In such cases, if the single transferable method is adopted, you are going to get a better answer to the question, &ldquo;What does that constituency think upon the main issue of the day?&rdquo; than by the old system.  If there are only two candidates, then no question arises.  If there are three candidates, it is better that the bottom man should be eliminated, and the test as between 1 and 2 should be contested at the first election.  If we are not going to have this method, we ought then to adopt the second ballot; but the second ballot is cumbersome, and it is gradually being dropped in favour of the transferable vote in other countries.  I would, therefore, urge its desirability, not that it is perfect, and recognising that there are possibilities of mistake, even as there are possibilities of mistake in the system that we have adopted for five or six vacancies, as the risks are very much more minimised by this method of the single transferable vote than by the old method of voting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a very vital question.  I would not like, just now at any rate, to go further than I indicated in the beginning, because I do not find myself in agreement with a good part of the argument adduced by Deputy Johnson.  In my opinion, it is when the old system is in operation, and when there will not be more than perhaps two or three candidates put up&mdash;as there will not be when the old system is in operation&mdash;that you will get a better index of public opinion.  So far as that is concerned, I believe that you will get a better index of public opinion&mdash;that you can get a sort of yes or no issue&mdash;by the old system at a bye-election than you can through the joining up of four or five lines of thought, and joining up for reasons <Col N="740" /> which might be obscure under the single transferable vote system.  If there should happen to be a multiplicity of parties there may, if the single transferable vote system were used, be a considerable number of candidates.  It is, I think, a fact that can hardly be disputed that after the first transfer or two the vote does not indicate any very strong preference. A person who gives his first preference, gives it generally with some strong feeling and strong ideas in the matter; but the third, fourth and subsequent preferences are given sometimes without a great deal of consideration.  I think anyone who has seen a count taking place, and has seen how preferences go will know that the third, fourth and subsequent preferences are given in a very peculiar way.  As I say, it is not a matter of very great principle or importance; but I do feel that to adopt the single transferable vote where there is only one vacancy, means that the minority party who may have lost a seat will have no chance of getting it.  Frequently minority parties will lose a seat.  If you keep the old system a minority party will at least have a chance of getting a seat and the proportion will be maintained.  If you adopt the transferable vote for such a vacancy, then the minority parties have no chance, and will be liable to complain that their already small strength in the Dáil is reduced in that way, and the system is such that, in the event of disagreement among the majority parties, they will be able to slip in their candidates, and the arguments that will apply if we have not Proportional Representation, and which would have a great deal of force at a bye-election seem to lose effect.  It is very undesirable that, owing to split votes by a large number of voters, minority candidates should have an opportunity of slipping in, and should slip in, in a large number.  It is quite a different thing in filling a casual vacancy where the proportion in the Dáil already represents the way the feeling in the country is divided, and when, in most cases, a majority candidate must be returned, it is rather an advantage that sometimes a minority candidate should have a chance of slipping in to maintain the balance.  It is not a very vital question, but, without consideration, I would not like to go further than saying that the single transferable vote would be acceptable where there are two vacancies, and the marking of <Col N="741" /> the papers should be such that there would not be two forms of marking, so that matters may not be confused.</P>

      <P>The amendment only makes a verbal alteration, that is, substitutes &ldquo;Parliamentary constituency&rdquo; for the rather long phrase: &ldquo;At a contested election of more than two members to serve in the Dáil for any constituency and at a Senatorial election.&rdquo; That seems to me a matter for arrangement when the clause is re-drafted, and the real difference between the clause of the Minister and the amendment proposed by Deputy Magennis for Deputy Figgis, is where you have the words, &ldquo;two or more&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;more than two,&rdquo; in the first line of the clause.  The Deputy who moves, agrees that this is the substance of his amendment.

      <P>I desire to move the following amendment:&mdash;Section 22, Sub-section 1, line 53, to delete the words &ldquo;and by eight other registered electors of the constituency, as assenting to the nomination.&rdquo;  Personally, I think there is no need for these eight other persons at the present time.  Originally the eight names, in addition to the proposer and seconder, were necessary to assure the electors that the candidate had a certain amount of support, and in a large constituency the ten names would naturally be taken from one particular district.  It would require <Col N="748" /> all the resources for the whole election contest to get ten signatures in a large constituency like County Cork, and they would have to travel one hundred miles to make it representative of the whole constituency.  I think these names are not necessary and I beg to propose that the clause be amended accordingly.</P>

      <P>This again is not a matter that is of very great consequence one way or the other.  There is just this to be borne in mind, that the holding of a contest where a contest may be avoided in any case will involve very considerable expense in view of the size of the present constituencies and of the increased complication of counties.  This might occasionally prevent some sort of adventurer arriving on the scene at the last moment and going in, as I think has occasionally happened.  If such a person arrives he tries to get some sort of reputable people to put their names to his paper, otherwise he will have nothing to recommend himself to the electors, and to ask that there shall be assentors may mean occasionally that an unnecessary and perhaps futile contest might be averted.  On the other hand, if a man has real support it is not a hardship to get the assentors.  It is a small point, but I think there is some balance in retaining the eight assentors.</P>

I think that would be possible.  I think it has happened, and perhaps it will be in the recollection, especially of some of the Dublin Deputies, that there was an almost classic case of the proposer of a candidate, I think for the Corporation, who by manipulating the thing got himself elected instead of the man he was <Col N="749" /> supposed to nominate.  Now that might not have been quite so easy if the consent to withdrawal of the candidature was required by the seconder as well as by the proposer.  It is to obviate such a thing as that that I want to insert the words &ldquo;proposer and seconder.&rdquo; I think the argument applies in almost a reverse way to that which the Minister has used in the case of the eight assentors, and that while one man may be got at, it is a hundred per cent. more difficult to get at two men.</P>

For the purposes of this sub-section the number of votes polled shall be deemed to be the number of ballot papers (other than spoilt ballot papers) counted; and where the election is held under the system of the transferable vote the number of votes polled by a candidate shall be the number of votes polled by him as first preference.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the words &ldquo;one hundred and.&rdquo;  This amendment proposes to reduce the <Col N="751" /> amount of deposit made on behalf of a candidate from £150 to £50.  In view of the great expense involved in holding elections, we believe that there ought to be some earnest that the candidate has a certain stability and backing, but we think that the amount ought not to be prohibitive, and we, therefore, think that the present deposit ought to be reduced to £50.  Prior to the payment by the State of election expenses, when each candidate had to deposit a certain sum to cover expenses, it was strongly objected to, and it was then universally agreed that if the State would undertake responsibility for paying election expenses it would be reasonable for each candidate to lodge a certain deposit beforehand, so as to prove the contest was not a frivolous one, and that the person proposed had the necessary backing, and this would be made good by a deposit of £50, and I accordingly move that the present sum be reduced to that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the cases where it is impossible for me to meet every point of view.  It may be hard enough on certain candidates, quite genuine candidates, to make arrangements for the deposit of this sum, but on the other hand any less sum would probably not be a sufficient deterrent.  If we made it £50, having regard to the reduced value of money at present, there are plenty of people to whom £50 would be very little to forfeit for the pleasure of running a fake contest.  Any candidate who is elected, and takes his seat, has his money returned.  If he withdraws before the election, finding that he is not likely to receive support, his money will be returned, and as we intend to amend a subsequent sub-section, if at any time during a count he gets a number of votes amounting to one-eighth of the quota his money will be returned.  That is to say, where there are three candidates, if he gets 1/32nd part of the number of votes at any time during the count, his money will be returned, so that as the clause stands there is very little danger of a genuine candidate, not a freak candidate, who has some sort of indication of support from the constituency, being mulcted. The only cause of complaint would be that it might be difficult for some genuine candidate actually to get possession of the cash for deposit.  Then we have to <Col N="752" /> bear in mind that probably the number of poor men who would be run independently, shall I say, without an organisation, would be very small.  I can see that a Labour candidate might not find it easy to raise £150, but a Labour candidate would have the support of Labour organisations before he thinks of going forward, and in view of the fact that a genuine candidate will not be mulcted, and that the only question involved that can be criticised is the difficulty that might be imposed on some people of finding the money, I think that it is preferable to retain the sum of £150 rather than to reduce it to a sum so small that many people might feel that it was no deterrent to their going forward.</P>

      <P>We would be prepared, I think, to consider that.  The real point at issue is that the smaller the sum is made the easier it is put within the power of an organisation of any sort to run candidates who would cost the State a good deal of money and might not give a profitable return.  Two or three thousand pounds might not be much to an organisation of wealthy people and might create turmoil, cost a lot of money, and so on, and the only point we have in view is how far it is possible to regulate these elections.  I presume that is the general intention of all the Deputies.  If we think that £150 is an oppressive amount we would be prepared to consider it, but it is our deliberate view, having regard to our experience of electioneering, that it would be too small, and it would not really mean what we have in mind, that is to have the elections really fought on a <i>bona fide</i> basis.  However, we will consider it before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that the wealthy organisation will not be deterred if it wants to run propagandist destructive candidates, by the difference between £50 and £150, especially in view of what the Minister stated that if a candidate is going to receive 1/8th of the votes in a three or four-member constituency the chances of his being returned are very good.  On the other hand the difficulty arises in the case of the poor man collecting a large sum by <Col N="753" /> the day of the nomination where there is no wealthy organisation with money available.  The money has, as we all know, to be collected by the constituency. Now opportunities for collecting in the constituency do not usually arise before the nomination day.  It is really after the election has begun, after the enthusiasm has begun, that the money is collected, and the very fact that money is paid in that way is an assurance of some popular support.  In some very large constituencies there may be two, three, or even five or six of some party nominated, and the money has to be derived from the same people, unless they are wealthy supporters, and you are multiplying the sum required by the same proportion as you are multiplying the size of the constituency.  With a constituency of six members you might easily have fifteen candidates and the collection, shall I say, of £150 for each of these candidates is a very big obstacle, and while it can be done during the election and after the election, to do it before the nomination day is a considerable difficulty and rather too big a burden to put upon candidates.  I would urge that favourable consideration of the matter be given before the next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that it might be easy enough to collect £50, or, say, £100, for the purpose of scoring off a man, either up for election or standing for re-election. Everybody understands that nearly everyone is your friend before an election, and a time comes when you must vote for either one side or the other, and your friends naturally divide when that happens, and some promise to make that a test question at the next election. If it were £50 I am positively certain you would get one man in each constituency who would, because A. was not appointed to a position, or B. was dismissed, or C. got a contract that should have gone to D., or something like that, come forward.  I am sure that, while we welcome constructive criticism of every sort, it is a mistake to allow elections to be used solely for the purpose of destructive criticism, and <Col N="754" /> to make it almost impossible for new men to take up their seats here as members of this body through being afraid to exercise their opinions on occasions that could be described by the word &ldquo;crisis.&rdquo;  From that point of view I think, although it does appear to be a large sum, and although in the 1918 elections it appeared to be colossal, after all, with a sound body of opinion behind any prospective candidate at an election, it is not as difficult as it appears to get that sum; and, at any rate, it certainly keeps out the candidate who only comes forward for, say, muzzling, or something of that sort, or the fairly well-to-do individual, who for one cause or another has a complaint against either a Party or a man, and would exercise his entire spleen in the particular constituency in order to oust a man who may have done his duty well.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;candidate,&rdquo; and to substitute the words, &ldquo;is withdrawn, the deposit shall be returned <Col N="755" /> to the person by whom the deposit was made, and if the candidate dies after the deposit is made, and before the poll is closed, the deposit, if made by him, shall be returned to his legal personal representative, or, if not made by him, shall be returned to the person by whom the deposit was made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are, I think, two objects sought to be attained by this amendment; first to ensure that the deposit shall be returned to the person making the deposit. As it stands the deposit must be returned to the candidate.  I think it will be agreed generally that the person making the deposit on behalf of a candidate&mdash; if all the other procedure is gone through &mdash;should be the person to whom the deposit is returned.  The second point is the deletion of the word &ldquo;next&rdquo; on line 44, and the substitution of the word &ldquo;closed.&rdquo;  The point of that is, that in the course of an election, on the election day a candidate may conceivably die at say, 11 o'clock in the morning.  The electors learn of the death of the candidate, and consequently they will not vote for that candidate, and he may then not receive the small proportion that is requisite to secure the return of the deposit. My proposal is to see that the poll is concluded before that question arises.  I do not think these require much argument.</P>

      <P>In view of what the President has said, and seeing that there was an official amendment covering the same ground, I did not put forward any argument in favour of my amendment.  It did occur in one definite case during the last election that two persons stood for election and they happened to be Panel candidates. One did actually happen to get returned, but had he ten votes less he would not have been returned.  He got very few first preferences because he did not happen to be the most popular candidate on the particular party ticket.  He was clearly such a person as should have received his money back under the conditions imagined in this Electoral Law; he did not get the first preferences be <Col N="757" /> cause he did not happen to be the most favoured candidate on the party ticket.  There is indicated a clear hardship and injustice that it was the intention of my amendment to remove, and it was the intention also of Mr. Duggan's amendment.

      <P>The only thing, then, is what number shall be taken into account.  Sometimes, as in a constituency which I have in mind, the result was reached before all the votes cast in favour of the candidate came to be reckoned.  Had the counting gone a stage further, the candidate would have a greater preponderance of votes.  In such a case as that, for the purpose of this calculation, what is really the total secured does not go to his credit, whereas in a constituency where a number of members are to be returned, the counting may go on until the fifth preference has been reached, and if those are to be calculated, it is doubtful if in such a constituency anyone could forfeit the deposit. I think the consideration which weighs with the President is that we may, in the case of large-member constituencies, be providing for the return of all the deposits, whereas it is precisely in such constituencies that the safeguard against freak candidates and engineered candidatures should be provided.</P>

      <P>You will have candidates of independent selection, and I hope you will not have any candidates who will be subjected to outrage at the <Col N="758" /> next election.  I think there should be a certain respect for members standing for election.  They should be free from any odious attention.  I do say in this particular instance there were three candidates from the one party going forward for three seats.  If the third candidate had not been returned, the total expenses, which I presume would have been borne by the three candidates jointly, would be £50 each.  I expect they would pool their misfortunes while sharing their fortunes.  Is that too much money to ask where three members stand for one party for three seats? It is not put forward by Deputy Figgis that it is an injustice because the third man manages to get home with a few votes to spare.  That is a poor example to put forward, and if there be no better case to urge against the retaining of the deposit, I am certainly against it.  Are we going to see that every single deposit that is lodged at an election is going to be returned to the aspirant for election?  That is not the idea.  The idea is to see that a person standing for election has 1/8th of the total votes, multiplied by the number of candidates.  Where there are six seats, that would mean 1/48th of the total.  Is that too much to ask&mdash;1/48th of the number of first preference votes at the first count?  Members, as far as I know are not quite <i>au fait</i> with this matter.  I was not a child in the matter of elections years ago.  Take the case in point.  The number of first preference votes received by the particular candidate in whose interest the Deputy was speaking, was 1/24th of the whole. That is not too much, and if he is not able to get that number, he certainly should pay.</P>

      <P>I join with the President in his hope that at no future elections will there be candidates who will be outraged.  I go further and express the hope that at no future elections will there be candidates whose candidature itself will be an outrage.  I take that particular instance as a specific instance, but the general case is true. It may, however, frequently happen that the second name or third name in a Party ticket&mdash;and we will unfortunately in future have Party tickets&mdash;it may happen that the second may not get any first preferences at all.  He <Col N="759" /> may just miss election, and it is to remove that injustice without any specific case that this amendment was put forward.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;To delete all words after `shall be' and to substitute the words `returned to the person by whom the deposit was made as soon as practicable after the result of the election is declared.' &rdquo; This is an amendment rather of substance. The intention is to undo the bad work which was the result of spite and spleen in the House of Lords against the Party of which the President was at that time, and is still, an exponent. The Bill was very badly mauled by the House of Lords, which insisted that no deposits shall be returned until the member had taken his seat.  That was obviously intended as a penalisation of members of one Political Party in this State.  I do not think it would be a good thing for us to carry still further that bad example, and the proposition is that the deposit shall be returned to the candidate who is elected as soon as practicable after the result of the election is declared.  I venture to think that that amendment will not be seriously opposed.  I am asking the Ministers to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am moving to delete Sub-section (6).  I have no very strong feeling on the matter.  If it was not likely to be accepted I would not press it.  The reason it has been proposed <Col N="760" /> is briefly this:&mdash;According to the provision of Sub-section 6, if the candidate stands for more than one constituency he has only his deposit returned for one of the elections for which he stands.  It is thereby intended that this should be a deterrent against a candidate standing for more than one constituency.  The purpose of that is one with which I entirely and heartily agree, because a candidate should only stand for one constituency, but it does occur to me that it is penalising the poor man, and thus may be a certain advantage in favour of the rich man or the rich party who are willing to do this.  If it is going to be returned in any one case the position should be that if a candidate, no matter where else he stands, should get enough votes, his money should be returned.  It is a matter that is worthy of consideration, and it is in that light that I put it forward.</P>

      <P>We would not be inclined to accept it.  We used be amused by seeing accounts, I think in the Belfast papers of a gentleman who, every time an election to the Belfast Corporation was due had himself nominated for every ward in the city, and received a few votes in each ward, and, perhaps, amused the city, but it also cost the city and other candidates something. It may have been a good thing for them, but it is not a sort of amusement we would like to encourage.  In view of the fact that the number of votes required to get the deposit returned will be small, and any gentleman such as that need incur no expense in the matter of election literature, he could have his name put up for quite a number of constituencies, and he would possibly in each of them get enough votes to have his deposit returned.  In any case it is most desirable that a candidate should stand for one seat, and that if he cares to indulge in the luxury of standing for a number of seats then he should be prepared to pay for that luxury.</P>

      <P>Before the entire clause as amended is put, I would like to repeat my question.  I do not think it was answered&mdash;as to whether or not the Minister is prepared to reconsider what is set out here in <Col N="761" /> the matter of the return of the deposit in the case of an election for only one seat.  You will notice that the wording covers the cases of bye-elections as well of elections.  In Clause (4) it provides that the deposit is to be returned unless the number of votes polled by the candidate does not exceed in the case of an election of one or two members one-eight of the total number of votes polled.  Now suppose in a six-member constituency in which a bye-election for one vacancy occurred, it might be very difficult for the candidate who was really a <i>bona fide</i> candidate in the best sense, owing to certain combinations, to get one-eighth of the total poll in such a huge constituency.  That is the way it presents itself to me, and I would like the Minister to consider that when the whole Clause is being considered.</P>

Those of us who have had some experience, salubrious and otherwise, of elections, know that there are a number of papers always that are spoiled, because of not having been marked.  At a busy time of the day, or near the close of the poll, the Returning Officers and Presiding Officers very frequently omit to stamp papers, where they have not stamped them on the back.  A paper that is already stamped should be quite sufficient, without requiring it to be stamped on both front and back.  I think it is an unnecessary precaution adding a certain amount of confusion if there should be any busy period at any time of the day.  I think it would tend to simplicity while ensuring all the necessary safeguards if it were required that the ballot paper shall be marked with an official mark, without saying that it shall be marked on both sides of the paper.</P>

I can bear out what Deputy Gorey said in regard to the recent Kilkenny election in that particular.  The number of papers that came in that were perfectly legitimate votes, and that were cancelled by reason of the fact that there was no stamp on them, I am sure, would be about 500.  That, I think, is not a good reflection upon either the machinery that is put up, or the means taken to prevent such things as that happening. I think there ought to be some arrangement tacked on to this Bill whereby any person failing in his duty at an election would be warned off the course, as it were, or warned off election work for life, and not subsequently allowed into a polling booth for the purpose of discharging any duty.  It is not too much to ask that whoever is engaged in an important office in the case of an election should discharge his duty.  It is possible that sitting there for twelve hours persons might get tired.  If they do there ought to be provision for allowing somebody else to do the work, and if they are likely to get tired some persons ought to be appointed who will not get tired.  At any rate, I think, that where large numbers of votes like that are cast and are subsequently disallowed by reason of the inefficiency or inattention or the neglect of an official that that official should be open to prosecution.</P>

      <P>That point might be met, perhaps, by some amendment in Clause 39 when we come to it.  That clause says:&mdash;&ldquo;Every returning officer, presiding officer and clerk who is guilty of any wilful misfeasance or any wilful act or omission in contravention of this Act shall, in addition to any other penalty or liability to which he may be subject, forfeit to any person aggrieved by such misfeasance, act, or omission, a penal <Col N="770" /> sum not exceeding one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is covered to some extent by &ldquo;wilful,&rdquo; but, perhaps, that clause could be strengthened.</P>

      <P>This is very important. The method is everything.  It is not good enough to be putting a ballot paper into something to give an impression. If the impression comes up it is all right, but sometimes the papers come out without any impression at all.  The experts ought to be able to devise some method whereby proper machines would be available.</P>

      <P>I believe in the majority of cases where negligence had occurred there is a good deal of excuse for the officer.  At one election, for example, it happened to be the South Armagh election in 1918, there was a rush on the poll at about 7.30 p.m. I happened to be in the booth at the time and the officer was stamping the papers in great haste.  I noticed that in several cases he turned over two papers instead of one at a time, and I pointed it out to him.  It was merely owing to the speed at which he was going.  I think the whole thing would be improved if the Minister would accept an amendment, if I may be permitted to withdraw mine, to substitute words like this, &ldquo;the ballot papers shall be embossed with an official mark.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point to be borne in mind with regard to this is that, whether from negligence or indifference or some spite against the particular candidate, occasionally a man's name is almost erased from the ballot paper by the stamp that is put on it. The thing that struck me about it was that it was not a fair method at all.  It may be the first name that the stamp would be put on.  It might be put opposite the name that one would wish to vote for and you have to mark the X over it.  They are stamped in every conceivable way and it is certainly not a satisfactory method and it ought to be improved on the next stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the remedy is to put in proper personation agents to see that the official carries out his work.  Deputy Figgis speaks about being in a polling booth in Armagh.  He had no right to be in a polling booth.  If the officer was doing his duty he would not find out whether the officer used the stamp or not.  I think we sent some recommendations from the late Commission to the Minister which will meet that.  If they procure a proper stamp that will go right through to save the officer from turning over the ballot paper and stamping it front and back it would prevent that.  You can get a machine of that kind.  I saw some of them&mdash;I think it was in Clare&mdash;with two prongs which go right through the paper, so that there is no difficulty about it.  That could be easily provided.  I think when you get the report from that Commission that there will be no necessity of talking about how ballot papers are stamped.</P>

      <P>Certain officers who were employed at the last election abused their position so much that they absolutely refused to stamp these papers.  I consider that these men should never be employed in a polling booth again at any future election, whether Parliamentary or otherwise.  Those could be traced through the officers in charge of the areas and such blackguardism put a stop to.  Such officers should never again have any control over any future elections in Ireland.</P>

I think it is inevitable and necessary however.  The necessity for this was brought home to my attention at the recent election when the boxes were being opened.  It is true it was impossible to identify any one vote as given by any one voter.  It did happen that when a certain box from a particular district was opened, party agents were standing around, and one party stated: &ldquo;We will find out how this district is going&rdquo; and when the district did not &ldquo;go&rdquo; as the various agents desired &ldquo;to their hearts desire,&rdquo; as Deputy Magennis said, the remark was made &ldquo;we must follow that district up.&rdquo;  There is a case where the intention of the secrecy of the ballots is voided with regard to a whole district, and I think the right course to adopt is only to allow each candidate with his agent or one agent for the candidate.</P>

You are only counting the votes to see they tally with the Presiding Officer's return.

It is an extraordinary thing that, according to the Deputy's own confession wherever he has been present, there have been most extraordinary irregularities. With regard to Deputy Johnson's amendment, it seems to me that his objection is sound because the amendment makes it imperative on the candidate to be present in places where he could not possibly be, and so he makes regulations for having his agent present.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to the matter of the presence of such agents.  In the first P.R. elections that were held in Dublin, the agents were all kept outside the barriers, about ten yards away from the counting, and in justification of that the law was quoted for us.  I was present, and I refused to go out, and the police were brought in.  That was in the time when Mr. Campbell was Town Clerk.  I believe that is changed now, but in some cases barriers are put up to prevent the agents seeing the voting papers.  The agents are entitled to see them.  If they were not it would be quite possible for officials to produce a different result and return from what the views of the electors had expressed.  The original No. 1 Preferences ought to be brought to the barriers if you will, where the agents are, so that they can check them.  If you get No. 1 all right, there is very little danger about the others, but if they are not allowed to see No. 1 there will be danger that the opinions not of the voters but of the agents will be recorded.</P>

Under the old Act he could only ask three questions.  We want to give the presiding officer more power, but we want to be careful that we get the right class of man to act.

      <P>This is one of the phases I referred to previously.  No doubt the presiding officer does ask questions, and asks them from people he knows are not entitled to vote.  If he gets a certain answer he allows the person to vote. I have heard a presiding officer tell his subordinates it was not their business to interfere and that if a certain question were answered <Col N="780" /> their duty ceased, although they knew that a particular man or woman was not entitled to vote.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs.  If an official knows that people who claim the right to vote have no right to vote, I say it is a criminal responsibility if he allows such person to vote.</P>

    <P>(1)  The returning officer at any election may use, free of charge, for the purpose of taking the poll at such election, any room in a school receiving a grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, and any room the expense of maintaining which is payable out of any local rate, and may defray any expenses incurred by the person or body of persons, corporate or incorporate, having control over the same on account <Col N="781" /> of its being used for the purpose of taking the poll as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(2)  Wherever no such room as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section is available, the returning officer shall hire a building or room for the purpose of taking the poll.</P>
    <P>(3)  A candidate at any election shall be entitled, for the purpose of holding a public meeting in furtherance of his candidature, to the use at reasonable times between the receipt of a writ for the election and the day of the poll of a suitable room in any public elementary school situated within the constituency for which he is a candidate:</P>

    <P>Provided also that a charge may be made to cover any actual and necessary expenses incurred by the local education authority, or by the managers of the school, in respect of the preparation of the room before the meeting for the purposes of the meeting, and after the meeting for school purposes, and for heating, lighting, and cleaning the room.</P>
    <P>(4)  If by reason of the use of any room under sub-section 1 or 3 of this section any damage is done to such room, or to the building of which it forms part, or to the furniture, fitting or apparatus in or of such room or building, the damage shall be defrayed by the returning officer or by the person by whom or on whose behalf the meeting is convened as the case may be.</P>

      <P>I beg to move <Col N="782" /> the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;Section 33, Sub-section 6: To add at the end of the sub-clause the words &ldquo;if the use of such room would involve a breach of the decorum proper to be observed in the vicinity of the church, place of worship, convent, or other religious establishment.&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to accept this addendum.  It would justify the action of the manager in not giving a room or rooms if he had reason to believe that there would be some breach of decorum or disturbance in the polling station.  For instance, there might be some members of the convent or community, or of the manager's house, ill at the time of the election, and any unusual disturbance might have a bad effect on health.  Then there might be a mission or retreat going on in a particular convent or church.  In such case the clergyman should have the right to refuse such room or rooms, and another polling station should be provided by the returning officer.  So far as my knowledge is concerned, I do not think that any manager would refuse the use of schoolrooms for polling purposes, but it might be necessary to define that right in the Bill.</P>

If you pass this, you will have all the school managers all over Ireland pointing to it and saying, &ldquo;You cannot get my school to-day; we have something on.&rdquo;  Leave it to the discretion of the returning officer.  In my experience, clergymen of all denominations do not want polling near their church or schools. We must get a proper place for the electors to go to, and if you put that clause into the Act you will be referred to it every time.</P>

      <P>I think the argument made by Deputy McCarthy is strongly in favour of the amendment.  If Deputy McCarthy will read the sub-clause, he will find it stated that &ldquo;nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to authorise the use by a returning officer or a candidate of any room in a school adjoining or adjacent to any church or place of worship, or in any school connected with a convent or other religious establishment.&rdquo;  If I understand the amendment aright it is intended rather to safeguard the rights of the returning officers and candidates over <Col N="783" /> these places, and not to put it altogether in the hands of the manager or other director of one of these establishments to say, &ldquo;You shall not have this, because the Act says you shall not.&rdquo;  The clause as it stands rather takes away the right of the returning officer and of the candidate and puts absolute power in the hands of the manager or director to refuse the use of the establishment.  The amendment, if the Minister will accept it, will rather rectify that, and bring about such a position that there must be at least reasonable grounds for believing that such disturbance or breach of decorum would ensue from the temporary occupation, so that the manager would have a good right to object.</P>

      <P>I hope the amendment will not be pressed for this reason: I think it depends a good deal upon the meaning applied to the words &ldquo;connected with.&rdquo;  I think that that means &ldquo;physically connected with convent or religious establishment,&rdquo; because I see the words &ldquo;adjoining a church or place of worship&rdquo; above.  It seems to me that if this amendment is accepted we shall have abundant disturbance in places at the doors of religious establishments, where such disturbances ought not to take place.  No one can tell whether a public meeting in support of a particular candidate will or will not cause a breach of decorum. The candidate never intends that there should be a row, but he is not in control of his opponents, and although he and his agents who take this room, as they have a right, under sub-clause 3&mdash;for the candidate is entitled, for the purpose of holding a meeting, to a suitable room in any school&mdash;can go in and demand it, saying that there is going to be no breach of decorum.  Circumstances, however, over which the candidate has no control, will cause a breach of decorum, without any thought or intent on his part, or those whom he represents. It seems to me that the drafters of this Bill were wise in providing and authorising a candidate or a returning officer for the purpose of an election, to take a room in a school that was adjoining or part of a religious establishment of any denomination.  If it is necessary I <Col N="784" /> think that the thing might be made clear by putting, instead of the words &ldquo;connected with,&rdquo; such words as &ldquo;physically connected with.&rdquo;  For instance, the church to which I go has schools which have been used for the purposes of elections, but though they are connected with that church and under the management of the Incumbent, they are nearly half a mile away from the church.  In one sense they may be said to be connected with the church, but I do not consider that they are connected in such a way as to be regarded as physically connected.  No returning officer ought to be entitled, as a right, to go in and take a room in any school that was up against the walls of a religious establishment of any denomination, merely on his own statement&mdash;&ldquo;I do not believe there will be any breach of decorum, and therefore I will take it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think that the point raised by the Deputy who has just sat down is the essence of this little difficulty.  The words &ldquo;connected with&rdquo; seem to imply organic association and not physical connection.  There would be a barrier placed upon the use of schools, and if there were church schools connected with the church, it would nullify the whole clause.  If it is intended that the use of the words &ldquo;connected with a convent or other religious establishment&rdquo; means physically connected with, then there will be little or no need for the amendment moved by Deputy Colahan.  I think the objection raised by one Deputy as to who would judge whether the use of such room would involve a breach of decorum is a valid objection, but I would urge that some words be found better than &ldquo;connected with&rdquo; to indicate the mind of the Ministry.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the whole of Sub-section 1.  I think it is unnecessary, and I think the latter part of it introduces rather a bad principle.  There are, or there will be, penalties prescribed for neglect or wilful neglect, or wilful acts or omissions by these officers in contravention of this Act, but, in addition to the ordinary penalties, this clause provides that there shall be paid a forfeit to any person aggrieved by such acts of the presiding officer a sum not exceeding £100.  That seems to introduce a bad practice commonly known or popularly called the common informer type.  I do not think there should be any inducement of a financial kind to anyone to do his duty as a citizen by drawing attention to these acts.  I think it is a bad practice, and I think it is an objectionable one, and that the proposal that the money penalty should be payable to the aggrieved person, whoever he may be, should be struck out altogether.  Perhaps in another part of the Bill, or in another Bill, suitable provision can be made to cover what might be essential in this clause, but at the moment I cannot see that anything is essential, and it should be omitted.  I should like, in common with the other Deputies who have spoken of negligence, to say a good deal of it is culpable negligence, as these officers should know their job, and should be punished by law for doing wrongful acts or allowing wrongful acts to be done, and I do not think it should be done in this way&mdash;that this penalty or award should be given to the citizen who draws attention to it or who happens to be aggrieved.</P>

      <P>It seems to me the argument that might be put against a clause like this is really not that stated by Deputy O'Shannon.  I do not think there is any reason why the question of such a penalty as this should not be included, and why it should not be payable to the person who will take the trouble <Col N="790" /> to prosecute, and who has actually been aggrieved in some way.  It seems to me the grievance is in the actual misfeasance or wilful act done.  It would be very difficult to know if it was a wilful act.  I would like to reconsider this clause, but my intention in doing so would not be with a view exactly to giving way, but perhaps to make it more effective.  In any case, Deputy O'Shannon's objection was based on the idea that there should be no penalty of the type indicated.  I do not agree with that, and I would not like to be taken as agreeing to omit, or to accept the idea, that such a penalty should not be in the Bill at the moment. If the clause was strengthened in any way, and if it was possible to bring in a more effective clause which would lead to negligence, if culpable, being dealt with, it might be possible to get rid of that clause.</P>

      <P>The objection raised by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon to the perpetuation of the common informer is a good one.  Common informers are generally a nuisance; they generally come forward, not from any intention of doing good to anybody at all, but simply to try to make a little money for themselves, and I do not think that this clause as drafted does provide for the common informer.  If there is any possibility that it should, I suggest to the Ministry that they revise it and that they should make it quite clear that it is not a clause to encourage common informers.  As I read it, it seems to me that the only person who could recover would be a person who had actually suffered a loss by the wilful wrongdoing of a Returning Officer or Presiding Officer, but I do think that any person who has suffered a loss which he can prove by an act, which must be wilful to entitle him to any remedy, ought to be entitled to recover the loss from the person who is responsible, and I think that a clause which says that the person aggrieved shall recover a penal sum not exceeding £100 does in law produce the effect that he must prove actual loss before he can recover any sum at all, and that the sum he does recover is limited to the amount of the loss so proved by him.  If so I doubt very much if Deputy O'Shannon would press his amendment, but if the Minister would, <Col N="791" /> in looking into it, make it clear that it is not a clause to encourage the common informer, I think that the clause, in some form, ought to be preserved</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment, because my main point was the point that has been dealt with by Deputy Fitzgibbon, but, being a layman it is not easy for me sometimes to see all the implications of certain phrases in certain clauses, and I suppose the whole thing really centres round the legal meaning of &ldquo;any person aggrieved.&rdquo;  If the interpretation which Deputy Fitzgibbon gives to the clause is the correct interpretation, then I would be satisfied on that point with the promise of re-drafting that the Minister has given.  Therefore, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I rise to point out that if this is re-drafted special consideration must be given to the fact that where the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is withdrawn, and &ldquo;from wilful misfeasance or wilful omission,&rdquo; the penalty clause cannot very well stand.  The real effect of the penalty clause is that it is practically enabling the aggrieved person to take an action and recover damages, or compensation, for the loss accruing to him through the misfeasance of the person in question.  Now, if we take away &ldquo;wilful,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; it would have to be a type of criminal negligence, so that I think the thing requires a great deal of careful watching.  I think it would be better if there was a separate clause dealing with negligence than in itself, rather than by thus leaving this as it stands.</P>

      <P>All I am afraid of in a clause like that it will dishearten the presiding officers from doing their work, as Deputy Gorey pointed out a moment ago.  A presiding officer will only have a certain amount of work to do, and that is all he is interested in. Now, if he is going to arrest a man for personation, and he makes a mistake, is it open for the person aggrieved to take an action against him for £100.  If you have that clause the presiding officer will not bother his head about personating. You must give him unlimited power. That is the only way to stop personating, and if that clause is there, there is no encouragement for the presiding officer.</P>

      <P>I think the discussion does show that the clause would need to be reconsidered, and, perhaps, redrawn. The intention was not, of course, to penalise the presiding officers, and I think it will have to be made clear that whatever the powers for dealing with personation that may be given to presiding officers if they are exercised in good faith the presiding officers will have to be protected. As it stands I think this clause is faulty from the point of view of proving the wilfulness of any act that may be done, and because of the fact that the trouble at elections has rather been culpable negligence, or something that could only at most be proved to be culpable negligence rather than wilful misfeasance.</P>

      <P>I gave notice earlier in the day that I wanted to raise two questions.  First, to ask the Minister for Home Affairs to take the opportunity to explain the intentions of the Ministry in regard to sweepstakes.  There have been statements in newspapers touching this subject, and we are not sure whether these are official statements or not, and, inasmuch as the subject has excited a great deal of public interest, healthy or unhealthy, it would be well that this particular Ministry should state their intentions in regard to the exceptions from the Lottery Act.  I do not want to discuss the merits of the Lottery Act, or to say anything about the wisdom of allowing sweepstakes to continue.  They have excited a great deal of interest, and there is developing a belief that Ireland is to become an enlarged kind of Monte Carlo, and I would like the Ministry to give us an idea of their policy on this question. The other question is one of perhaps more human concern; it is in regard to the delays in the payment of dependents' allowances. The Minister for Defence gave us details earlier in the day of the scale of allowances, and the conditions under which these allowances were paid to dependents.  The point that I am raising is that a month or two ago the Minister very generously informed the Dáil that if any complaints arose in regard to delays in the payments to dependents, if he would be informed directly he would take the matter up and see that it was dealt with as soon as possible. That promise has been kept pretty well, I think.  Many cases that I have had brought to my notice have been transmitted to him, and I think in the main they have been dealt with pretty rapidly, but what one would have hoped for would have been a reorganization of the office work, which would have ensured the rapid settlement of these claims, or payments of these dependents' allowances.  That has not taken place, and there is a great deal of delay.  It is not good to have to rely on the Minister's own personal intervention in a case.  We ought to be in a position to say that the work of considering <Col N="795" /> these claims has been brought up-to-date, especially in view of the discussions which took place earlier, and the answers that were given by the Ministers. Within these last two or three days I have had complaints from different parts of the country in respect of claims for the dependents of men who joined as far back as July, and my whole point and intention in raising this matter now is to urge very strongly on the Minister for Defence the necessity for so reorganising, if that is necessary, that particular department so as to ensure that the claims shall be brought up-to-date as rapidly as possible.  It is unjust and unfair to the dependents concerned and to the men that decisions have not been come to for claims put in as far back as July.  It is not fair that the Minister should have to be specially appealed to in regard to individual cases, and I would ask that he would take that matter in hands at once, with a view to ensuring that all the outstanding claims would be brought up to date, and avoid the very frequent complaints of dependents that they have not received any allowances, or only something on account, or that the claim has not been dealt with after a long period. I am sure it is a matter of office organisation.  I would also urge upon him the necessity of taking the matter up immediately, and obviate the recurrence of so many complaints.</P>

      <P>On this question of sweepstakes, perhaps before dealing with the future, and the intentions of the Ministry for the future, it might help if I gave a short historical sketch with regard to the situation for some years back.  The last of the fourteen British Lottery Acts suppressing and preventing the advertising of sweepstakes was passed in the year 1846.  Since then in Great Britain lotteries have been suppressed, their promoters, the printers of tickets, and the newspapers publishing the details thereof prosecuted.  An exception was made by the Act of 1846, in-as much as Art Union Associations were allowed to hold drawings for the purpose of raising funds for purchasing paintings, drawings, or other works of art.  However, it was not the practice of the Government in Ireland to take proceedings <Col N="796" /> under the said Acts as long as the enterprises were <i>bona fide</i> in aid of charitable and philanthropic objects, and so long as they were not run in the interest or benefit of individual promoters.  Prior to the year 1907 various clubs and associations in Ireland were accustomed without Government interference, to hold sweepstakes on races such as the Derby, and for which the tickets were mostly purchased locally.  Sundry fraudulent sweeps then crept into existence, and tickets began to be sent broadcast throughout the United Kingdom.  That was about 1907.  Questions were asked in the House of Commons as to the the legality of Irish lotteries, and replies thereto given.  The Irish Government were then compelled to take action, and proceedings were instituted against fraudulent promoters. At the same time a warning was issued that no further sweeps or drawings would be allowed, and the clubs and associations who had tickets in circulation were compelled to sign undertakings that they would not hold similar enterprises in the future.  The effect was that sweepstakes and lotteries remained dormant in Ireland for practically a decade.  About the year 1918 sweeps on English horse races sprang into existence again, and tickets therefor were widely circulated through the post in Great Britain, the prizes offered being usually large sums of money. Many complaints being addressed to the British Home Secretary of the breach of the law in Ireland, he was forced on 3rd March, 1920, to issue to the Postmaster-General a warrant prohibiting circulation through the post packets containing advertisements or circulars relating to sweepstakes promoted by persons in Great Britain, Ireland or abroad.  The Irish Executive instructed the Police that prosecutions should be instituted in all cases where the Police were not satisfied that the proceeds were for distinctly charitable purposes.  As the sweeps continued to increase at a rapid rate, the Irish Executive were ultimately by warrant dated the 31st March, 1921, compelled to authorise the Postmaster-General to detain and open any postal packets in course of transmission throught the post believed to contain advertisements or circulars relating to sweepstakes promoted by persons in Great Britain, Ireland or abroad. <Col N="797" /> A notice to this effect was inserted in the Press.  The result of these steps was satisfactory.  The sweepstakes ceased to operate, and there was no interference with or cessation of the ordinary bazaar prizes, drawings and raffles for meritorious public purposes.  However, at the beginning of this year, on the assumption that the Provisional Government would take no action, sweepstakes were again revived.  As it is practically impossible to ensure the honesty of these proceedings and it is difficult to make any distinction or exercise discretion in the prohibition of them, I am advised that steps to put a stop to them should be renewed and maintained. During the transitional period people came and explained that they proposed to run sweeps for charitable objects, and asked for an undertaking that the existing law would not be enforced against them.  For one reason or another, such undertakings were given.  For one thing it was a transitional provisional Government; perhaps rather a committee than a Government; and for another thing possibly it was felt that we had quite enough on hands without proceeding in any vigorous way against undertakings of that kind.  There were several such undertakings given during the provisional period, and some of these undertakings did extend beyond the lifetime of the provisional Government, and into the period of the jurisdiction of the Free State Government.  For some time back I have been concerned&mdash;I have given a certain amount of time to it at any rate &mdash;with discovering whether there was any rational middle course that might be adopted; whether changes could be made in the existing law that would ensure adequate protection to the public in the event of sweeps failing, and so on, and that would ensure that undertakings of the kind would in fact be run and promoted in the interests of charitable institutions. In a time like the present one has to have a sense of proportion, and we could not go very deeply into the matter. Such inquiries as I made led me to the conclusion that it is practically impossible to devise such a middle course, and the evil was growing and was assuming alarming extensions.  Application for undertakings of that kind were pouring in, and, finally, about a month ago I advised the Government that, with the exception of certain undertakings that had in fact <Col N="798" /> been given, there should be a complete closing down, and that the undertaking not to enforce the law should not be given in the future.  Charitable interests must find other means of support.  It is not for me to say what those means ought to be, but this evil&mdash;and I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that it is an evil&mdash; was spreading, and things had gone long past the stage when sweeps were being run in the interests of charitable institutions.  What was happening was this&mdash;these people came along to a charitable institution and said:&mdash;&ldquo;You could do with £5,000, and we could do with £10,000, what about lending us your name for a sweep?&rdquo;  It is very hard to exercise discrimination; to put it vulgarly, how am I to know who is a crook and who is not a crook, or how is any one in my department for that matter to know it?  It is also bad to have a law in existence, and occasionally to hold it up.  I think it is particularly bad here, where the idea of law and the idea of ordered government is not so firmly embedded in the minds of the people that you can afford to have an existing law, and periodically say it shall not operate.  I think that was bad.  If there are interests in the country keen about this thing, let those interests, through some member of the Dáil who shares their outlook, put up a private Bill.  The attitude of the Government, on the advice of my Department, is at the moment to strictly enforce the existing law, and, with the exception of the few outstanding undertakings that have been given, to close down all this matter of sweeps and lotteries.</P>

      <P>On the question of Dependents' Allowances, I would like to assure Deputies raising this question that not only during the past month or two have I given attention to the individual cases brought to my notice, but I have been for a considerably longer period after this whole question of relieving, at the earliest possible moment, those people who are entitled to allowances and who have not yet got them.  The actual state of affairs is that payments are being made in 13,427 cases.  Of those cases, 1,763 are only <Col N="799" /> temporarily assessed, but payments are being actually made in the number of cases stated.  There are 1,070 cases in the hands of our investigators at the present moment.  Our investigators consist of special investigators in the City of Dublin, and the Customs and Excise officers in the country. There are 2,896 cases in the offices at Portobello, which have not yet been put into the hands of the investigators. In a large number of these cases the difficulty has been that there is no evidence of enlistment.  This arises owing to the difficulties under which enlistment has been carried out in the different areas, and the difficulties we have experienced in getting proper records of such enlistments.  It has been arranged that all these cases will be put immediately into the hands of investigators.  A system was set out a fortnight or so ago by which these cases would be put into the hands of investigators on the one <Col N="800" /> side, and suitable enquiry would be made through our Army organisation on the other side.  At the present moment the cases are being dealt with by our investigators at the rate of about 400 a week, and I am satisfied that the arrangements that are in existence at the moment will clear off all the cases that we have within another month, and that the causes of complaints that have been in existence will be cleared away inside that period.  I know the volume of complaint has been big, and I also know the difficulties of investigation, and the difficulties of dealing with these matters with fairness to the people themselves and with fairness to the public purse.  These difficulties have been very great.</P>
