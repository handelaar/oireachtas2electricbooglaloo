      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware of the delay in proceeding with the building of six urgently needed houses by the Kilrush Urban District Council; whether this delay is due to the fact that no Clerk of Works has been appointed to supervise the execution of the work; and whether he can take any steps to expedite building.</P>

      <P>The delay in this matter was not due to the fact that no Clerk of Works has been appointed.  It appears, however, that owing to delay in the completion of the conveyance connected with the purchase of the site for these houses the contractor recently stopped work.  It is expected that the purchase will be completed almost immediately and building operations re-started.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Mr. Thomas Hednen, Skeagh, Mearescourt, Mullingar, although unemployed from August 3rd to October 4th, 1922, and having 32 stamps on his card for the year in question, did not receive any unemployment benefit from the Labour Exchange; whether, owing to the state of the finances of the Westmeath County Council, and being a road worker, Hednen was unemployed for the above period; further, whether he will consider the question of exempting <Col N="1416" /> such workers from paying unemployment insurance when, being unemployed through no fault of their own, they are not entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to Mr. Thomas Heduvan, the facts of whose case are as follows: The applicant claimed benefit on 10th August, 1922, having then 39 contributions to his credit.  But the applicant had already received 48 days' benefit, which exhausted these contributions. He consequently had no further right to covenanted benefit, and his claim was treated as a claim for uncovenanted benefit and disallowed because he was unable to satisfy the essential condition that his normal occupation must be an insurable one.  It appeared that it was only at intervals that he obtained employment in the insurable occupation of road worker, and that this consequently could not be regarded as his normal occupation.  The applicant did not attend the Exchange after 30th August, 1922, and the Ministry has no record of unemployment after that date.</P>
      <P>In the light of these facts it will be seen that the suggestion that Mr. Heduvan could not get benefit though he had contributions to his credit has no foundation. Mr. Heduvan received all the benefit to which his contributions entitled him, and it was only in respect of uncovenanted benefit that he failed to establish a claim.  In these circumstances the last part of the question does not arise.</P>

      <P>Before we take up the Orders of the Day I would like to make clear to Deputies a matter of which an example arose yesterday afternoon.  A Deputy made a statement which was deemed by the Chair to be improper, and he was asked to withdraw, and he withdrew.  I wish in no way to reflect upon the incident, but it was mentioned by the Deputy that he would take <Col N="1425" /> the opportunity of proving his statement at a later date.  In the Press this morning it appears that my ruling was that a Deputy could not make a statement that other Deputies were engaged in lawless actions unless he was prepared to prove it.  These were not my words. When a Deputy makes use of a statement reflecting upon the character or personal honour of another Deputy and is called to order by the Chair, the statement must be withdrawn.  It is no defence to say that the statement can be proved, because it is not the business of the Dáil, nor can it be the business of any Legislative Assembly, to engage upon an examination of such allegations. It would be impossible for the Dáil to undertake the functions of a court of law, and therefore I would like Deputies to be quite clear in their minds on that matter.  A statement reflecting upon another Deputy must be withdrawn, and proof cannot be offered.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that I am in no way reflecting upon the incident of yesterday evening, because the Deputy who was asked to withdraw did so at once.  I have no fault to find with his particular action, but, as a certain misconception has crept into the newspapers and as Deputies themselves may be under a misconception in the matter, I think it should be made clear for the proper conduct of our business.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very careful to say that I was in no way reflecting on Deputy Gorey's action yesterday. He obeyed the Chair at once. But it must be clear that we cannot undertake the investigation of charges made against Deputies in the Dáil.  Our only method is to prevent them from being made, and if they are made to compel their withdrawal.  If charges are to be proved that is to be done in another place and in another way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the final reading of the Finance Bill I should like to inform the Dáil as to the position in regard to dividends with regard to the British Government securities, which carried the condition of exemption from income tax, the taxation of which to Free State income tax is provided for under Clause 4 of the Bill.  These securities are the tax compounded securities on which the British Government compounded for payment of income tax in the future, and in consideration for this composition they contracted to pay a lower rate of interest.  It was hoped that some financial arrangement could be arrived at with the British Government which would warrant the Free State Exchequer in continuing this exemption. But the Government has now been informed that the British Government does not propose to enter into any such arrangement.  In these circumstances we have no alternative but to tax these dividends in the ordinary way to Free State income tax, and the charging provision of Clause 4 of the Finance Bill will accordingly operate in regard to any such dividends receivable by residents in the Free State.  In the case of dividends on tax compounded issues that have been paid to Free State residents since the 6th April last it is proposed, in all the circumstances, to waive the claim for payment of the Free State tax, but all dividends received from to-day onwards will be charged to Free State income tax. A notice to this effect will be issued immediately, so that no person who has had possession of those securities will have any cause for complaint in the matter, and any bargain that they make, or may be presumed to have made, in connection with the possession of these particular securities.  If they kept them in good faith they have got no complaint <Col N="1427" /> against the Free State.  They get warning as from to-day to dispose of this particular form of security.  The State loses a little bit of revenue by reason of this advantage.  It is clear that without getting due notice it would not be fair to tax those particular securities.  A public notice to this effect will be issued immediately by the Revenue Commissioners. Holders of tax-compounded securities who are resident in the Free State are now informed of their position, so that they may be able to take such steps as they may desire to take to transfer their investments to other securities.</P>
      <P>I should add, for the information of the Dáil, that the dividends on the tax-compounded issues, when charged to Free State income tax, will not be within the arrangements for relief from double taxation inasmuch as no income tax relief will be allowed by the British Government in respect of these dividends.  Subject to any personal allowances to which the taxpayer may be entitled, the full Free State tax will be payable on the dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter in the Bill to which I wish to direct attention is the provision in Clause 21, Sub-clause 2, to which, it will be remembered, reference was made in Committee.  The effect of this provision is that certain British Government securities which were issued, subject to the condition that they could be tendered at par value in payment of death duties, cannot be tendered in payment of death duties in the Free State in respect of deaths occurring after the 1st of April last, the date on which the clean-cut as regards taxation took place.  On reconsideration, we feel that the 1st April, 1924, would be a more equitable date. These securities have to be held for one year by the deceased person to be eligible for payment of death duties, and where any person has invested in these securities for the purpose of his estate securing the benefit of the condition attaching to them, certain rights exist which it would not be equitable to remove by statute.  The extension of the date to 1st April, 1924, effectively preserves these rights.  As to the burden of the deficit between the market value of the security and the par value of such securities as we may receive, all I desire to say at the moment is that the matter is the subject of representations <Col N="1428" /> to the British Government, and I do not admit that this deficit properly falls to be borne by the Free State Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to have to introduce a subject which should have been introduced at an earlier stage.  The reason why an amendment was not put down in regard to this matter was my ignorance of the condition of affairs. There is a document issued by the Revenue Commissioners relating to Customs and Excise tariffs.  This document, I am sorry to say, was not sent to the members of the Dáil for consideration; some of the members may have received it, but at all events it did not reach me.  It was only about a week ago that I learned that there was a tariff or duty placed on chloroform of 4s. 4d. per 1b, and on sulphuric ether of £1 16s. 6d.  This tariff was not a protective tariff; it was really a prohibitive tariff put on by the British Government to prevent German anaesthetics being brought into England. In England these anaesthetics were being manufactured, and no duty was placed upon them whatsoever.  Not only were these anaesthetics manufactured in England, but there was tremendous competition amongst the manufacturers, so that the price was kept down to a fairly low level.</P>
      <P>The way the matter will work out now will be that the hospitals, which were previously able to purchase a bottle of anaesthetic ether from 4s. to 5s., will be required now to pay 4s. 6d. duty on that bottle.  That is to say, anaesthetics required by charitable hospitals will cost at least double what they cost before. The duty on sulphuric ether is £1 16s. 6d. per gallon, and, as I have pointed out, that will work out at 4s. 6d. per bottle. This will be a serious tax indeed on charitable institutions.  I am not going to make any appeal for reduction of this duty in the case of private hospitals or in the case of individuals, but I am sure this Government does not wish to make money on charitable institutions.  When I say that this tax will amount to a very serious sum indeed in the year to these institutions, I am quite sure that the Government will listen to my appeal with open ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, the working out of this tax would mean that the hospitals <Col N="1429" /> would try to economise.  In trying to economise they will either use an inferior class of ether or anaesthetic, or they will use too little.  Perhaps they will endeavour to save anaesthetics during operations, and in either case the result may be very serious.  It is quite possible to purchase an inferior class of either which will produce anaesthesia in the long run, but I do not think that any of us would care to be put asleep by that class of anaesthetic.  It is the kind of anaesthetic which was used largely in Derry and Tyrone by gentlemen who wanted to get drunk at a cheap rate.  They could have three &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; per day at a cost of sixpence. I hope the Government is not going to compel the charitable hospitals to send their patients to sleep at this cheap rate.  I do not think that one could regard this article as a luxury.  On a previous occasion, when I spoke of the tax on motor cars, the Minister for Finance pointed out that there were a number of people driving about in fine motor cars who did very little towards contributing to the upkeep of the State. This question of anaesthetics cannot be regarded from the individual point of view.  It is not a case of any individual endeavouring to shirk his duty or declining to contribute to the finances of the State.  It is a case of putting an increased tax on charitable hospitals&mdash;institutions which are already overtaxed.</P>
    <P>I might add to the reasons I have given against this tax a further reason.  If the hospitals' finances are reduced to the extent of a couple of hundred pounds per year by this tax, they must reduce the number of poor they are going to relieve. I have already said that this can scarcely be regarded as a luxury.  There is no doubt that the patient going under an operation for the moment may regard it as a luxury that he is not being cut up without an anaesthetic, but in the end it must be admitted it is a luxury one would rather do without.  If Ministers should ever find themselves in that position&mdash;I hope they never will&mdash;I am sure they would like to think that the best anaesthetic that could be given to them was being administered.</P>
    <P>Now, I fear that that will not be the case if an amendment is not made.  I understand the difficult position that we are in in moving an amendment.  Clause 15, I think, is the clause to which an <Col N="1430" /> amendment might be put.  I can see the difficulty of urging it at present.  I have a great objection to the entire tax, and I am quite sure that when Deputy Wilson becomes Minister for Finance, as he hopes to become in the next Government, he will wipe this tax off altogether, so that the individual&mdash;that is to say, the rich person&mdash;will be able to get as good an anaesthetic as the poor people in the hospitals. The case that is being put by the gentlemen who rule us from Dublin Castle is that this is a splendid tax, because it is going to start industries in Ireland&mdash; industries, if you please, to supply anaesthetics to fourteen or fifteen hospitals. Well, I admit that there is an opportunity for a man to get rich quickly.  As I said before, this tariff is a prohibitive tariff.  It is not a protective tariff.  The result of this economy would be, if firms of this sort were started, that a man could produce ether, perhaps, and chloroform of a very bad type indeed.  He could produce it and sell it, say, at a shilling less than the cost of ether plus this prohibitive tariff, and in that way make himself rich quickly.  I say to these gentlemen in the Castle that I have no objection to an industry of this sort being started, and if an industry is being started in which an anaesthetic is produced as good as it can be produced elsewhere, I have no complaint to make.  But I do say that until we have an industry in this country able to supply an anaesthetic that can be used safely, let us give relief to the charitable hospitals in this specific direction.  I am prepared to move an amendment, but I should be better pleased that the Minister for Finance would announce that he is willing to introduce an amendment either in the Finance Act or to amend this document that comes from the Castle.  It would be possible, I find, to amend the list of Excise allowances by the addition of chloroform and sulphuric ether for use solely for medicinal and surgical purposes in public hospitals.  There is an instance of a similar allowance&mdash;molasses.  If used solely for food for stock no tariff is put upon it.  I would suggest that it could be quite easily managed that the hospitals should supply a certificate at the end of the year stating the amount of anaesthetics imported by them and the amount of duty they paid, and that the Government should remit the tax.  I <Col N="1431" /> hope that the Minister for Finance will deal with this in a sympathetic manner, because it is not a question of individuals. It is merely a question of giving relief to charities, and it is not good economics to tax a charity.  I am perfectly certain about that, and I am sure the Minister will deal with it in a kindly manner.</P>

      <P>Whiskey has its place in medicine.  I know for a fact, and I am sure that it is not necessary to point out, that pure alcohol is used for medicinal purposes, and at present I think that, in addition to being rather hard on the sick people, this is a direct menace to a certain extent to the general community. As Deputy Craig has pointed out, this tax is not protective.  Unhappily we have not in Ireland a sulphuric ether or a chloroform factory, or a factory where the various spirits can be manufactured, and I submit to the Minister accountable for this Bill that there should be discrimination when taxes are imposed on commodities coming into Ireland.  I, for one, favour protection, but I do not understand why goods should be taxed unduly coming into Ireland when we have not already manufacturers of these articles in the country.  Goodness knows, the public and charitable hospitals in Ireland have a hard enough time trying to carry on, and I would exhort and beseech the Minister to reconsider his decision before he imposes this tax, because this will be more than a calamity; it will be a barbarity.</P>

      <P>I omitted to mention another thing.  It is another grumble&mdash;namely, that it is almost impossible at present to get these anaesthetics. Some of them are lying in the Customs at the North Wall since the 1st of March, and now it is the 1st June. They tell me that one hospital is begging from another to get a few bottles of anaesthetics to keep them going.  I am told that one large firm has deposited £5,000 with the Customs here in order <Col N="1432" /> that there will be no delay in the delivery of their goods, but the goods are lying at the North Wall, just as if no duty had been paid.  I believe the duty has been paid on all these goods lying there since March, and the delay I believe to be due to the want of a sufficient staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If you were to consult my personal opinion I would be inclined to let all anaesthetics in duty free.  I think that the request here is a fair one.  I notice that the medical profession, when confined to its own particular activities, is a very capable one, but when it takes up other matters it is not so satisfied with the way things are done.  I have not had time to examine these particular amendments, but I will accept them in the spirit in which they are made.  They state that &ldquo;the duty of 4s. 4d. per lb. on chloroform and £1 16s. 6d. per gallon on sulphuric ether were imposed by Section 81 (2) and Sch. 111, Part 2, of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910 (10 Ed. VII. and 1 Geo. V. Ch. 8).&rdquo; That has nothing to do with this, so I take it it is not an amendment. It is further stated that &ldquo;any public hospital using chloroform or sulphuric ether for medical or surgical purposes shall be entitled to an allowance or repayment of the whole amount of any duty paid under this Act in respect of the said articles so used.&rdquo;  It appears to me that that is a very wide amendment, and it perhaps deals with more than Deputy Sir James Craig or Deputy Dr. White asked for.  Then there is another paragraph. &ldquo;Chloroform and sulphuric ether may be delivered without payment of duty in such cases as the Commissioners may approve, and subject to such conditions as to proof, security and otherwise as the Commissioners may impose for the purpose of protecting the revenue.&rdquo; I think, on looking over the matter, that it would be better to leave over the consideration of the Bill, and I would see if it is possible to meet Sir James Craig's request.  Thus due notice will be given.  It is rather late to be introduced now.  I do not think that the amendments are in order&mdash;they are, perhaps, <Col N="1433" /> suggestions rather than amendments&mdash; and if we were to take action on them we might find that they were irregular. I would suggest that the Bill be reconsidered on Report Stage on Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises the question of the necessity for complying with the request that such papers as this should be circulated.  Inasmuch as the Minister has suggested the deferring of the consideration of the Bill on the Report Stage with a view to making amendments, I think that the opportunity should be availed of to suggest other amendments, or at least to make some observations upon the Bill which might lead to the Minister himself suggesting further amendments.  On the last stage we discussed on Section 12, Sub-section 2, of the Act of 1915 certain matters relating to the effect of the new duties, such as the effect on Irish industry of the duties upon opera glasses, motor cars, films, optical instruments of one kind and another, and generally the new duties that were applied under that Act. The Minister mistakenly said that the discussion was not applicable to that Section, and suggested that on the next Section the points raised would be dealt with.  Then, when we came to discuss the next Section, there were questions raised as to the effect of the continuance of the Depreciated Currency Duty, which lays an especially heavy duty upon certain classes of goods if manufactured in Germany.  We hoped that the Minister, in the course of that discussion, would have dealt with the points that were raised, and would have given the Dáil some information as to the effect of those duties upon Irish industries upon the one <Col N="1434" /> hand, and upon Irish consumers, plus the Revenue, on the other hand.  We did not get any information, and my object in raising this now is to press the Minister to give the Dáil and the country some information on the effect of those duties upon Irish industry, Irish revenue, and the consumers' interests.  We pointed out, in respect of new duties under Section 12 of the 1915 No. 2 Act that the motor car industry established by Ford in Cork was likely to be very severely hit, inasmuch as there would be a duty on parts exported to England and a duty upon the same parts when assembled and brought into Ireland as completed cars.  What we desired to know was whether the Ministry inquired into the effect on that industry of the present fiscal arrangements, and, if so, what the result of that inquiry was, and whether any modifications could be made in this Bill, and these taxes, with a view to meeting what is an abnormal situation, and one not contemplated or deliberately designed by the authors of this present Tariff Scheme.  I think the Dáil is entitled to some information upon that point.  In respect of the second point, the effect of the <i>ad valorem</i> duty, 33? per cent. upon certain goods in common use, if manufactured in Germany, it is not pretended that these are protective of any Irish industry.  So far as one can gather, the effect of this duty is to ensure that the goods imported from abroad and purchased and consumed by the Irish public may come into this country without any duty whatever, provided they are not manufactured in Germany.  Therefore the effect is simply to keep German goods out without adding to the revenue in any degree whatever, and it does not protect any Irish industry.  I submit it is quite indefensible for this country to carry on that depreciated currency duty.  In this Bill we have inserted Clause 22, repealing the German Reparations Recovery Act, 1921.  I think I am right in saying that this duty is quite a different one, and is intended to meet a special situation created by the depreciation of currency. The goods referred to in the Schedule are fabric gloves&mdash;that is to say, gloves made of woven or knitted material, termed in the trade fabric gloves. Domestic glassware, illuminating glassware for use with artificial light, domestic hollow-ware, aluminium, steel or wrought iron, enamel, and mantles for incandescent  <Col N="1435" /> lighting, none of those articles is made in Ireland.  You are not protecting any Irish industry.  Even if you were, you were only protecting it against German competition, and allowing France, Czecho-Slovakia, Belgium, or America to import their goods against any potential Irish manufacturer quite free. I submit in such there is no protection, and in such there is no revenue.  We are very foolish to rob the Irish consuming public of the difference between the German cost and, let us say, the English, French, and Belgian cost.  If there is an advantage to be got out of the depreciated currency in Germany without any cost whatever to the Irish consumer, why not let us take that advantage?  It is of considerable importance to the working-class housewife, when she goes to buy pots and pans, if she can get them at one-third less from Germany than she can get them from England.  She does not desire to give special facilities to the English manufacturer. You might persuade her with difficulty, perhaps, but it is impossible to persuade her within limits to give a preference to the Irish manufacturer, if there were such; but I know of no enamel hollow-ware manufacturer in the Saorstát, and I submit that this provision is quite unwarranted.  It has no value from the revenue point of view.  It has no value from the protectionist point of view, and it is simply mulcting the Irish consumer for the benefit of the English manufacturer. We shall probably not require many incandescent mantles for the next two or three months; probably there are good stocks in the country; but in the course of three or four months there will be a normal demand for incandescent mantles.  Public authorities buy them in very large quantities, and individual housekeepers also.  But we are now asked to pass a Finance Bill which says that for your sins you shall pay 33? per cent. more than you need pay for incandescent mantles, all for the benefit of the British manufacturer.  The Minister, on the last debate on this question, said that we ought to maintain the tax upon certain commodities even though it did not produce much revenue, if there was any possibility of such a tax encouraging an Irish manufacturer to begin business in that industry.  There have been a good many suggestion about new industries; a good <Col N="1436" /> many suggestions have had cold water thrown upon them; but there is not the slightest chance within the next twelve months of industries being established in Ireland for the manufacture of aluminium hollow-ware, enamel steel hollow-ware, or mantles for incandescent lighting When the Minister is considering the suggestions thrown out by Deputy Sir James Craig, I would earnestly impress upon him the necessity of adding another Section which would mean the repeal of any regulations which allow him to impose a depreciated currency duty on goods manufactured in Germany, specifying Germany as the one enemy to be feared.  I submit there is no justification whatever for the continuation of that regulation in this tariff.</P>

      <P>There is one further reason why I urge that this Bill might be considered not merely again upon Report, but that certain sections of it might, in the light of what the President has himself said to-day, be actually re-committed.  I am not sure whether the matter is not one that is suitable to be dealt with as a point of order.  It is very cognate at least to a point of order, because the President's speech&mdash;I think he will admit the equity of what I am about to say&mdash;did practically nullify a certain undertaking he gave when the Bill was in Committee. On Section 4 a request was put forward, if my recollection serves me, by Deputy Thrift with regard to that part of the Section that dealt with stock issued in England free of income tax.  I am unable to charge my memory with recollection of the exact terms of the undertaking given by the President on that occasion, but he did suggest that a certain method might be adopted by agreement between this Government and the British Government by which such stock might be dealt with on a system that would be less than the total income tax in this country.</P>

      <P>I am not making a point of order.  I am merely suggesting that this should be re-committed, and I did intend raising it earlier as a point of order.  In any event, it is clear from the speech now that after certain negotiations have passed between <Col N="1437" /> the Executive Council and the British Government that these expectations are not to be realised.  In that case I think that a Section under which these expectations were given in speeches made by the Minister for Finance on the Committee Stage should be reviewed again in Committee.  I did not expect the speech that the President made would be made by him, and I am therefore unprovided with the exact terms of the speeches made by Deputy Thrift on that occasion and by the President, and I am speaking now from memory of the circumstances. His speech to-day does involve a certain cancellation, to what extent I am not prepared to say, of expectations that were reasonably formed on the basis of what he said then.  I think when that occurs that such a Section should be reviewed on the stage on which these expectations were given, that is to say, the Committee Stage.  I also wish to refer to another matter that has been touched upon by Deputy Sir James Craig and Deputy Johnson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question I wish to submit for the consideration of the Minister is that between now and a date that will be arranged for this Bill to be considered in its Final Stage, he should take an opportunity of having a conversation with the Revenue Commissioners regarding the necessity for the detailed information that is asked for in the Official Export List.  As far as I can understand this Official Export List which has been put into operation by the Revenue Commissioners, it is an exact copy of the list in operation between Great Britain and foreign countries.  I am quite certain that, although the Commissioners who are now called upon to administer Irish affairs might have been in the past servants of the British Administration, they are quite capable of devising some other official list more simplified, and perhaps more modified, than the one now in operation.  If we are to take the Press as an indication of the way things are going in this country for some time past, we cannot overlook a certain statement made in a leading article recently in a prominent Irish paper.  The article says that, as compared with last year, our exports <Col N="1439" /> were down 4,408 tons, while our imports had increased by no less than 3,459 tons.  I contend that if this Official Export List were put into operation and strictly applied in accordance with the instructions of the Revenue Commissioners, it would help to decrease rather than increase, and would hamper and restrict rather than help, the exports of goods from this country.  I would like, if it were possible, on the next stage of this Bill that the Minister would supply us with a return of exports for the months of April and May as compared with the same period last year.  Any of us who knows anything about the traffic arrangements of the country knows that, so far as the shipping companies are concerned, large quantities of traffic usually arrive at the port a very short time previous to being forwarded from Dublin to other ports without any invoices, or to use the ordinary term, unentered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This export list demands that certain information of a very extensive nature should be supplied by the trader who forwards the consignments, and power is given to inflict a penalty unless the instructions are complied with.  I have seen recently a case where 10,000 specifications were returned from the Revenue Commissioners to a certain shipping company in Dublin, simply because the information asked for in the specifications was not given.  The point I want to make is that the fault in that particular instance was not due to the shipping company, but to traders in interior parts of the country who failed to comply with the Revenue Commissioners' instructions.  In a case of that kind, where the necessary information is not supplied, the shipping company would be bound, according to the instructions they have received from the Revenue Commissioners, not to ship the goods, and they could not ship them until such time as all the information asked for under the instructions given by the Revenue Commissioners was supplied. I contend that if this practice is going to be insisted upon by the Revenue Commissioners, you will find that the North Wall and other ports will be held up with traffic which would flow through in the ordinary normal way but for the red tape system borrowed from the English Administration. I would ask the Minister to see if there is any chance of having <Col N="1440" /> this list, which he has circulated, modified in any way, but without endangering the interests of the Free State.  I am dealing now with cases where information is asked for on non-dutiable goods.  It appears to me, from reading the list, that the information asked for by the Government is more or less for the purpose of satisfying the statistical experts in the different Government Departments rather than as a measure to protect revenue interests in the Free State.  It is customary, especially in the case of the export of eggs, that from twenty to thirty waggons would arrive at the Dublin port each night unentered without any specification forms or any invoices.  Let us examine the position in such a case as that.  If the eggs were held up, great inconvenience and loss would be suffered by the people who had forwarded the traffic.  I contend that a certain amount of propaganda is necessary in order to educate the trading public as to the necessity for complying with these regulations. On the other hand, I think some consideration should be given to the question of simplifying the details that are asked for in these particular cases.  I contend also that if the information asked for, especially in the case of non-dutiable goods, is for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of statistical experts in Government Departments, that the responsibility should not be thrown upon the railway or shipping companies to get that information.  It is the traders who are responsible and liable to penalties if they do not supply that information.  My whole case is not one for the relief of the different sections of the clerical staff, who are practically driven mad in the effort to comply with these regulations, but rather for the purpose of having something done to simplify the procedure that is necessary, and in order to allow the normal flow of traffic to go on, and not to injure the trade of the country.  I think something in that direction should be done.  Perhaps in the meantime the Minister will get into communication with the responsible authorities, who are, I believe, the Revenue Commissioners, and see if anything can be done to give effect to the suggestions I have made.</P>

      <P>The document which I submitted to the Minister, and which I did not put down on the <Col N="1441" /> paper as an amendment at all, appears to have brought down a terrible deluge upon the head of the Minister for Finance.  It never occurred to me that the document which I drafted, and which he read, would make it possible for anybody to suggest that the whole schedule of taxable articles should be taken back and reconsidered, and gone into all over again.  If you are going to have Customs you must have Customs Duty.  As we are going to have Customs, I for one would not think of suggesting that the Ministry could have done much better in the time at their disposal than to take over <i>en bloc</i> the duties they found originally imposed.  But it appears to me that in one or two grave cases an unintentional injustice has been done by them.  They told us that they were going to devise before next year a whole scale of Customs.  I have no doubt that when they do carry out that revision the schedule of dutiable articles will be enormously changed and the amount of duty payable will be enormously changed.  It struck me as curious that when, only yesterday, we voted nearly £17,000 to public charitable hospitals that to-day we should be called upon to pass a Customs Duty that doubles the price of the anaesthetic used in these hospitals for the relief of the poor.  The result of that must be either that they can only relieve a fewer number or that the poor will suffer by not being supplied with anaesthetics. It seems to me that a remission, not an alteration in the Customs Duties at all, because I never intended to suggest that, should be made in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest now that any person who buys either sulphuric ether or chloroform for commercial purposes or private use should do anything except pay the full amount of the duty imposed by this schedule.  It occurred to me it might be possible, when at this stage of the Bill, to put in a proviso in the form I suggested in the document which the Minister has read, the proviso to be to the effect that if public charitable hospitals satisfy the Commissioners of Inland Revenue that the anaesthetic was supplied and used by them for the relief of the poor, and in no other way, that they might get a refund of the duty they had paid upon it.  I took that suggestion, it was not my own invention, from the Finance Bill that imposed the duty itself.  It is true that the Act granted no relief in <Col N="1442" /> the past on anaesthetics, because the anaesthetics were made in England, but it did grant relief to doctors in regard to the purchase of motor spirits on their proving that the motor spirit was used by them for professional purposes.  It seems to me that when a doctor could get, as he did get under that Act, a refund of either the whole or half of the duty which he had paid for motor spirits on furnishing a certificate to the effect that he had used the spirits for professional purposes, it ought not, I think, to be impossible for the Ministry of Finance and their advisers to devise some means by which public charitable hospitals might get a refund of the duty they pay on anaesthetics used for the relief of the poor in their hospitals.  But it never occurred to me as reasonable or possible that the whole schedule of Customs Duties imposed under this Act should be laid open to revision by an amendment of that kind.  The amendment seemed to me one that, with the good will of the Ministry, it might be possible to bring in at this stage.  I do not move it, because I recognise that without the good will of the Ministry it was quite worthless to suggest any change, and I do not suggest now that the Bill should be postponed until the Ministry have gone into it and reconsidered every item and every article in the schedule of Excise Duties.</P>

    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the decision of the Revenue Commissioners to insist upon the collection of the entertainment tax on theatrical performances conducted under the auspices of the Gaelic League.  That <Col N="1443" /> was not done heretofore under the British regime.  The Commissioners say, of course, that they could only give a rebate either if they themselves were satisfied that the entertainment was of a wholly educational character or if the entertainment was partly educational and partly scientific, and they go on to say that the claims for exemption could only be established where the entertainment which is provided is of such a character as to give instruction rather than amusement; or was an entertainment which is provided in furtherance of the object of reviving national pastimes by a Society or Institution formed with that object, and not conducted or established for profit.  From the facts before them they say they were unable to regard the entertainments under review as falling within the scope of either of the particular sub-sections of the Act dealing with this matter, and, therefore, they were unable to exempt the entertainment from the provisions of the Act.  Some Teachtai here will be probably going to these entertainments, and they certainly will not go to them for amusement, but they will go to help in an educational process, for the whole purpose of the performance is educational. It seems rather peculiar that the Revenue Commission are now attempting to make a decision which would practically mean that the greater part of the public work of the Gaelic League would be classed as non-effective.  I hope the Minister for Finance will look into this matter and see if he cannot find another way of dealing with it than that suggested by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on some of the points made by Deputy Davin.  There is one point that has arisen in connection with one of the railways coming into the Saorstát; that is, the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee.  Owing to the financial changes there are certain clearance charges paid.  Now, inside the Six Counties these charges are very small indeed. I am informed that they only come to something of from about 2d. to 9d., but in the Saorstát on dutiable goods they run up to 6s. 8d.  I think, and on non-dutiable articles to 3s. 4d.  The result of all this is that there is a good deal of trouble upon this particular border area in Tirconnaill, and there is a good deal <Col N="1444" /> of dissatisfaction not only among the staffs of the railway, but amongst the public, on account of these duties.  Of course, it is the Railway Companies themselves impose these charges, but it seems to be on the basis that certain things which certain Deputies drew the attention of the Ministry to before, and that is making a very big distinction between sending things concerning consignments to the railway within the Saorstát and the same things concerning consignments to the railway outside the Saorstát. I need not labour that point any further than it was laboured on the last occasion, but it shows that this thing is growing, and in the long run there will be indeed a very serious position arising between the two Governments.  The Railway Company, I am told, by imposing these new clearance charges on all consignments, are using the income that they are getting as additional revenue. The staffs are being forced to do a great deal more work than ordinarily.  That, of course, may please some Deputies who think that railwaymen do very little work.  But sooner or later a serious situation will arise up there as a result of this. I just notice in one of these documents a matter which apparently the Revenue Commissioners, when dealing with the Gaelic League, have not noticed.  I notice that exemption (E) reads: &ldquo;An entertainment which is provided in furtherance of the object of reviving national pastimes or any Society or Institution founded for their object, and not conducted or established for profit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is rather remarkable that, when going over these exemptions, the Commissioners should pick out certain exemptions which they say do not apply to the Gaelic League and to Gaelic entertainments, and leave out this one, which, on the face of it, does quite clearly and distinctly apply.  I hope Deputies will back me up in the appeal I am making to the Minister to see the Revenue Commissioners on this matter, and to see that the people who are running these entertainments are not mulcted for doing educational work.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the claim of the Doctor Deputies here for exemption on behalf of anaesthetics. I think it is a fair claim, and I am sure it will be conceded.  I also strongly support the claim made on behalf <Col N="1445" /> of Gaelic educational entertainments as mentioned by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon. With regard to excessive charges being made on some Tirconnaill railways, I wish to say that on an early date I propose to take that matter up here when the Railway Bill comes on.  Meanwhile it can stand in abeyance.  I would wish the Minister for Finance, if he can, and I think it is desirable that he should do so, to give us some approximate idea of the effect of the falling through of the reciprocal easements that were put before us in this Finance Bill in relation to the dividend tax; what volume or what the extent of it was approximately, and whether it is to the advantage or the disadvantage of the Free State.  With regard to the Revenue authorities, as Deputy Cathal O'Shannon said, it is true that they are not suspected of very much enthusiasm in support of the Gaelic language or programme.  I think it should be one of their special qualifications for the right to hold the office which they hold at present that they should be in sympathy with the Gaelic League.  I think the language movement is the one thing that should be most favourably considered by the authorities in charge of the State purse of this country.</P>

      <P>There is one point that has been raised about the entertainment tax which, I think, is not strictly relevant to the consideration of the matters before the Dáil.  We are dealing, I take it, with the making of the law, and not with the interpretation of the law, and, unless we are considering an amendment, I think we should be satisfied with having brought a particular matter to the Minister's attention.

      <P>I was going to move the adjournment of the debate on the Finance Bill until Wednesday, but before doing so I wish to answer a few points raised.  Deputies delight in raising points on the Finance Bill.  The first matter that has to be dealt with is the question of whether Deputy Darrell Figgis' recollection is correct or imperfect or is suffering from any infirmities.  I think it is suffering from infirmities, if my recollection of the incidents that he relates is correct.  I think this is the case <Col N="1446" /> upon which the Deputy expected to bring down the Ministry.  We had made certain proposals, and a statement regarding the advisability of getting the order concerning double taxation through.  A certain security which did not lend itself to the treatment of the Double Taxation Order, and which necessarily had to be dealt with, was brought on for consideration under Clause 4 of the Finance Act. That particular section or clause deals with what is known as tax-compounded securities.  A sum of something like two million pounds is invested in these securities in Ireland, and that particular security did not lend itself by any stretch of the imagination to the treatment under the Double Taxation Order, for the reason that it is paid free of tax, and persons investing in that security either now or in the beginning when first issued were always led to believe that it was free from any deduction in respect of income tax. I explained at that time, if the Deputy's recollection will assist him, that in the case of persons like himself who pay super-tax, that the particular interest in question is assessed as if income tax had been deducted from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Any pledge given by us is a pledge we are prepared to carry out.  When we were opening negotiations&mdash;it was this particular clause that empowered us to open these negotiations: without this clause we could not have any opportunity of putting our case on a sound logical basis, I said that persons who had possession of those securities would not suffer by reason of the fact that provision for securing to the State its legitimate share of income tax had to be made and that they did not get notice.  Now, we give them notice from to-day. I think that is fair.  There is no advantage taken of the fact that these people have not got, say, the far-seeing judgment of financiers of the type of Deputy Darrell Figgis, who, I am sure, months ago, having foreseen the possibility of these things, would have sold out any securities he had of this particular order.</P>

      <P>With regard to this particular publication which the Deputy has mentioned&mdash;and I would warn the Deputy that he is putting an extreme tax upon his library accommodation&mdash;we will give him all these documents, but a continuous supply of them will certainly make him liable for increased rent.  This is a document issued by the Revenue Commissioners for the information of traders and other interests. It is a reprint of a similar list that has been in public use for many years, and is supplied on request by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, I will have a number of copies put down here for the use of the Deputies.  I think I told you on one occasion that I was not a poet, and that I did not know much about poetry, but two lines of poetry occur to me in this.  They are&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said Fox, &ldquo;a tax devise which would not fall on me,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Then tax receipts,&rdquo; Lord North replies, &ldquo;for those you never see.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to what I have learned of the discussion here, everybody objects to taxation of any sort or kind which happens to fall upon him.  I do not know where the money is to come from unless we are allowed to tax, and we will have to tax rather generously.  The point made by Deputy O'Shannon that we were interfering with certain educational institutions by reason of an entertainment tax that we were putting on them prompted me to look through the Estimates for the current year.  I find pages upon pages dealing with large sums of money for education.  There is a great danger that the people of this country are going to be educated out of their very existence, and some little enjoyment ought to be allowed to them, and they should be permitted to go to those entertainments and pay for enjoyment rather than education. From the Dundrum Lunatic Asylum to the very end of the Estimates book you will find money for education.  Now, we are asked to insist on people going to theatres in order to get them educated. The import duties imposed by Section 12 of the Finance Act of 1902 deal with motor cars and parts, and include duties on musical instruments, clocks, etc., and duties on cinematograph films.  The duties do not include optical instruments <Col N="1448" /> and glasses mentioned by Deputy Johnson. Those were imposed by the Safeguarding of Industries Acts, and not by any Finance Act.  The Deputy mentioned the tax of 22 2-9ths per cent. on motor cars manufactured in this country and going into Great Britain.  As the Deputy knows, there is a certain advantage in having 1-3rd allowed off that particular tax.  I have already explained that until the whole fiscal question could be considered it is unwise to revise any of those taxes or duties.  If there be a chance of starting industries in this country that chance is improved by the fact that a tax is imposed upon certain articles, even though they are not yet manufactured here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the tax is only on articles manufactured in Germany, how does it apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that ought to be considered by the Fiscal Committee.  The Government has not had an opportunity of examining the question, and before reconsideration or amendment or repeal of this Act should take place there ought at least to be an examination of it.  If it be found, in order to give industry in this country an opportunity of progressing, that even an extra tax over and above that at present imposed is a necessity, and that the imposition of such a tax would make it an economic proposition, the imposition of a high tax would be justified.  If the employment and business and general advantage of the country were to be affected by such a tax the Deputy will realise that it is easier to get from the present tax to a higher tax than from no tax at all to a pretty considerable one.  I would not recommend any alteration of tax for arbitrary reasons until some Committee has reported upon it.  Such a Committee is practically in course of formation.  I anticipate that within the next week or fortnight this particular Committee will take up consideration of fiscal matters. It would be unwise, with the small amount of information at our disposal, and the small amount of time available for the consideration of such important subjects, that we should alter the Finance Bill, even though it serves a temporarily useful purpose.  The mere fact that a person buys a pot or pan for 6d. less is scarcely a sufficient justification to alter, without examination, whatever <Col N="1449" /> fiscal system there is in operation at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we have.  We have not altered the system. The tax is the same as it was last year. If the Deputy means that we have a different tax to what prevails in England, I admit it.  We have also a different beer tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely mistaken with regard to any alteration there is in the matter of income tax.  The basis is exactly the same.  The only difference between persons paying income tax last year and this year is where there has been a reduction in the British tax we get the benefit of it.  The Saorstát gets the benefit.  The individual gets benefit to this extent: If his income were £10,000, and he pays £X tax, he pays £X tax on it, but he does not pay that tax twice.  He does not pay 5s. to us and 4s. 6d. to the British, which he would have to pay if it were not for the Double Taxation Relief Act.  I put forward those points for the purpose of moving the adjournment of the debate on this Bill until Wednesday.  I hope then we will be able to produce an amendment which will meet to some extent the points that have been raised by Deputy Craig and Deputy White.  Perhaps we may not entirely satisfy them, but we will go as far as we can.</P>

      <P>I suppose we only have one hour to discuss this Estimate&mdash; this evening at any rate&mdash;and I would not have been surprised if I had heard that the Minister was again suggesting its postponement in view of that fact. The Estimate is to complete the sum of £10,664,500.  Unfortunately the Deputies are not able to judge what is desirable in discussing estimates of this kind because of the lack of information. Explanation is given that the Army is in a state of re-organisation and that it is not possible to give details.  I venture to suggest that that is a very good reason for postponing to a very much later date in the year the consideration of this Estimate, so that when the re-organisation is completed it would be possible to give us details.  We ought at least to be told on this Estimate how many men we are to provide for.  We have not been told. We have had a number of figures given to us occasionally of what the establishment is&mdash;never very definitely and generally in a casual way, ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 men.  The Dáil does not know officially&mdash;I do not know whether any member of the Dáil knows&mdash;how many men are to be provided for in this estimate, but a more substantial reason I suggest for a postponement of this Vote is that we ought to know now what the legal position of the Army is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this institution we are asked to vote £10,000,000 for?  Presumably, it is for the up-keep of a body of men who have been called together at the initiative of the Executive to defend the State. That is not an Army.  We have adopted, in these matters, the legal and constitutional procedure of the British legislature, and there it is essential that there should be an Army Annual Act, which is the means whereby the authority of the legislature is maintained over the Army. Now, an Army Act has been promised us for quite a long time.  That is one of the many Acts that have been in preparation. Presumably, for purposes of economy, the Ministry thought it wise to limit the number of skilled men at the preparation of Bills for presentation, and the amount of necessary work that the small number of men have to do in preparing Bills is too great.  Consequently, so exceptionally important a Bill as the Army Bill has not yet seen the light.  I presume it is coming.  How soon I dare not presume <Col N="1452" /> to say.  I think the estimates ought, strictly, to be deferred until the Army Bill has been presented, at any rate, so that we should know what the intentions of the Ministry are in regard to the Army &mdash;the numbers we are asked to provide for and general establishment, and what strictly legal relations there are between the Army and the remainder of State institutions.  I do not want to pursue that line of argument very far, but it is desirable, I think, that we should lay emphasis upon the necessity for having some legislation passed to put the Army into a proper position in the State.  My main purpose in rising now, is to avoid the confusion that might arise by a simple discussion of details, ranging from one matter to another in the wide field of activities covered by the Army, for the purpose of confining the discussion at this stage to broader questions of policy, I am proposing to reduce the amount of this Estimate by £3,152,500, that is, the amount of the increase that is asked for this year over the amount that was estimated to be necessary last year.  Incidentally, one might say, in respect of these Estimates, that we find ourselves in a difficulty in discussing them by not having anything to compare them with, and by not knowing to any extent whatever how much of the last year's Estimate was unspent.  I think it is called for that the Minister shall justify their requests that we should vote over £10,000,000 for this year.  I take it that military policy is dependent upon political policy.  I take it that the policy in regard to the Army, the size of the Army, the activities of the Army and the expenditure upon the Army are all dependent upon the political policy of the Government and the general system of administration.  We are in the first day of June, and this Estimate is from the end of March.  April and May have passed and we find ourselves in what everybody hopes to be the beginning of a more or less peaceful condition of affairs as compared with what has been the experience of the last year. If it is the intention of the Ministry to maintain the present establishment through the year I have no doubt that £10,664,500 will be required.  But is it the intention of the Ministry to maintain the present establishment?  Is it the intention to maintain the present Army, no matter what the conditions may be?  I <Col N="1453" /> presume the answer to that question is in the negative.  In such a case so large a sum as £10,000,000 will not be required. I do not think that the Dáil should be asked to vote any increase upon last year's Estimate.  £7,512,000 ought to cover expenditure on the Army, provided no military activity is required, and consequently we are entitled to ask the Ministry to give us some indication of policy which would require so large an expenditure, or to answer the suggestion that I make that a very much smaller establishment, and consequently a very much smaller expenditure, is necessary in the face of the conditions of the country to-day.  I, therefore, am moving the reduction of this Vote by three million odd pounds on its merits, because the money will not be required, and, secondarily, with the object of inducing the Government to express their thoughts and intentions in regard to general policy touching defence and all that is or has been connoted by that term within the last year.  In a supplementary question to-day I suggested that the policy of the Ministry, and the Government generally, in the past has been defended on the only ground on which it could be defended, that of military necessity, and I am going to ask whether it is still necessary, from a military point of view, that prisoners should be tried by special military courts.  I want the Government to state that henceforth the power that has been given to them shall no longer be exercised by military Courts, and certainly not by Military Courts sitting in secret. I wish to urge that the necessity which was urged in the earlier debates on this question no longer exists for trials by Military Courts in secret.  While I am on that point I want to draw attention to a document which reached me to-day, and which has been circulated by what the messenger, who delivered the parcel of these papers, described as the &ldquo;Publicity Department.&rdquo;  I take it that it is the Army Publicity Department.  It is a document headed &ldquo;A Painful Necessity.&rdquo; It is, of course, a defence of Government policy, and probably is intended to be a Party propagandist leaflet, issued at the expense of the State.  In the course of this defence there is a paragraph which reads as follows.  Speaking of the difficulties which faced the Government some time ago, and the patience with which they withstood the <Col N="1454" /> attacks, they say:&mdash;&ldquo;Forced to act, the Government was still patient.  It sought the approval of An Dáil, one of the most representative institutions in the world, in which Labour is strongly represented, before proceeding to inflict the capital punishment.  When the approval was given the Government proclaimed a general amnesty,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Now, one would imagine from that that the approval of the Dáil was given without any protest, without any opposition. Apart from the claim that the Dáil is one of the most representative institutions in the world, which would be true if things were normal and all representatives attended, which, of course is not true, there is a suggestion that the powers that were given were given unanimously, and that there was general acquiescence in the proposals that were brought forward, and carried by a majority of the Dáil.  I only just refer to that in passing, because it decidedly creates a false impression, because we who opposed the proposals at the beginning have never yet regretted our decision, and have never yet been satisfied that the powers given them were justified. That by the way.  I have asked, therefore, that the Government should state their views on the question of maintaining in being these military courts, when there can be no claim put forward with success that a military necessity still compels their existence, I ask also whether it is necessary to continue the policy of searchings, arrests and imprisonments without trial, and whether the time has not yet arrived for a cessation of that policy.  Men are still being arrested on suspicion and for purposes of prevention.  They are being detained, and not tried and not charged with any offence.  I would urge that it is in the interests of the State that that course of proceeding should stop, that the critical stage which existed, and which was said to justify the extraordinary acts and extra legal acts has now passed, and that there is no longer a necessity for continuing the procedure which we have been accustomed to for the last few months.</P>
    <P>Then in regard to the detention of prisoners, this question is embodied in the question of the finances required, because a very great proportion of the money that is asked for is required for the payment of officers, and men and <Col N="1455" /> various other items in this A to Z list. The number of prisoners still in the control of the Army is said to be round about 12,000.  A number, large or small I do not know, probably very large, possibly a majority, have been arrested for sympathy with the Irregular activity, there being, perhaps, reasonable ground for believing that that sympathy might develop into active support.  There are 12,000 men and women under arrest, and I ask the Ministry to tell the Dáil whether they have come to any conclusion as to the length of time that it would be necessary to hold these prisoners, whether the intention is to hold them all until they are satisfied that every gun, every rifle, every round of ammunition, and every pound of explosive material has been raked up, and whether they have made any estimate, any calculation, as to how long it will take to make that general rounding up.</P>
    <P>Further, I would like to ask the Minister to tell us whether, in considering the period of detention, they have also considered the effect upon the country of that detention, provided there is, as we hope, a cessation of armed activities. Can we take it that if the promise of that cessation is fulfilled there will be a steady release of prisoners and a general stoppage of the military activities, the searches, the arrests, and such-like on the part of the Army authorities?</P>
    <P>One can forsee if there is no limit except the limit I have hinted at, of absolute surrender of all arms, ammunition and explosives, the detention of those prisoners going on for a very long time, and the effect upon the public of such detention, while there is no fighting going on, will be very bad indeed.  It will be disastrous to the character of the State and to the Government which is responsible for the administration of State affairs.  There must be, I submit, and there ought to be, a very early release of prisoners so long as the excuse of military necessity has gone by the board.  I press upon the Ministers to give the Dáil some indication of their minds in this respect.  I do not want to raise questions of detailed administration at this stage. We shall have to raise many questions, and, no doubt, they will be met one way or another.  In the absence of more detailed explanation of what is covered by those allowances, the Dáil is somewhat <Col N="1456" /> handicapped in a proper examination of the estimates.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would suggest we should discuss the general question of policy which is bound up with the Defence Department, and the policy upon which the Defence Department is to base its estimate.  While I am moving for a decrease in the vote by £3,500,000, I am not for a moment suggesting that that can be saved in money.  I am afraid it is impossible to satisfy the economists that any such cutting down of the estimates that I desire for Army purposes can be saved to the Exchequer.  All that we can hope for is that we can divert the sum of money so saved to other public purposes, and that the men who would be demobilised, and who, we hope, shall be demobilised in very large numbers within the next few months will be utilised either in the ordinary industries from which they have been taken, or in some other constructional activities.  I do not expect there is going to be any real saving of expenditure, but, I desire that expenditure should be in civil activities and not under the head of the Army.  I know the Minister has occasionally made suggestions about using the Army on work of civil construction. I give credit to the full to the idea that is behind that suggestion.  I want to urge again that it is not desirable in a time of peace, nor in a time of transition from warfare to peace that these works of civil construction outside the necessary military works should be carried through by attested men working under the discipline of an Army.  In that respect I want to draw the attention of the Minister&mdash;this is one of the detailed matters which we will have to deal with later, but it touches the general policy&mdash; to information which has reached me regarding army officers approaching County Councils and asking for information as to what public works are required in the county, not work on repairs to breaches in roads, which might well be continued to be the work for the time being of the Army Works Department as it has been for a few months past, but on new roads and other works of a public character which the County Council in the normal course of its operations, would be carrying through by civilian labour.  If my information is correct the County Council has been so pleased with the prospect <Col N="1457" /> that they have actually deferred doing this work in the expectation that the Army was going to do it for them.  They have deferred taking on men because the Army was going to do the work for nothing.  Some control from Headquarters should be exercised on local officers who are engaged in making suggestions of that kind.  I think that in the course of replying to those questions I am puting to the Minister he should elaborate what is in his mind with regard to the work of the Army in those matters, and state whether he has not been convinced that it should be demobilised men by whom any such work as has been judged desirable should be carried through rather than by attested men still in the ranks of the Army, and subject to military discipline.</P>
    <P>I think, apart from any of the specific questions I have put, that we should ask the Ministers to give us in some detail their views upon the present position, the prospect of the release of prisoners, the prospect of a general legalising of the procedure in connection with prisoners and arrested persons, and the going back or, shall I say, the going forward to normality in respect to the Law Courts, the Army, and citizens.  Perhaps, also, the Minister would tell us when he is dealing with the numbers within the Army, the numbers to-day, the numbers he intends to keep, and how soon he proposes to demobilise, etc., whether he has any fixed policy in regard to existing military establishments or establishments which did exist and have now been destroyed; whether there is any policy yet decided upon in regard to the rebuilding of such barracks as did exist and have been destroyed; where it is intended that the army that is to be shall be billeted; and, generally, to give us some outline of the policy of the Ministry regarding the future army, the numbers they expect to keep as a normal force, and how soon they intend to reduce the establishment to that normal force.  I beg to move that the Estimates be reduced by the sum of £3,152,500, that is to say, the amount which is named as the increase over the Estimate of 1922-23.</P>

      <P>I must represent that we cannot agree to have the Estimate put <Col N="1458" /> back, or any section of it put back, for further consideration later on.  The Estimate as it is before the Dáil is based upon the fact that we began the present year with 50,000 men, approximately, that at the present we have 49,000 men, and that by the end of the year we expect to reduce to between 28,000 and 30,000. That is all we can say with regard to the general policy of the Government as to the strength of the Army.  Just as the Deputy is in difficulties in facing the Estimate from the point of view of not having any previous Estimate or figures or experience in dealing with Army Estimates before the Dáil, the Ministry is faced with the difficulty that it is dealing with a situation which luckily, perhaps, it has not had to deal with on any previous occasion, and we really have no experience of dealing with a national situation of the present type to which to refer, in the present circumstances, from the point of view of prophesying what we shall have to do to-morrow or the day after to-morrow.  To a certain extent you feel that you are on the threshold of having peaceful conditions in the country, but actually we must know, and everybody must realise that you have in the country here a solution that is fairly saturated with quite a number of virtues and quite a number of vices, and that it simply depends upon what particular crystal develops in a situation, what particular crystallisation is going to develop out of it.  An angry word of a man in any particular district might develop your war situation.  A move by some politician, for one reason or another, may give you a war situation out of the vices, shall I say, that are present amongst us to-day, just as, if left alone, out of the very considerable virtue that there is amongst us we could very easily pass to a very peaceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the actual position of the Army, the legal position of it, I doubt very much whether that has created any serious difficulties for anybody's conscience, legally or otherwise, in the country.  You ask to-day what is this Army for which this Estimate is put up before the Dáil, and it is a question that very easily answers itself, bearing in mind our experience of the last six or eight months. Nobody, I take it, seriously suggests that whatever about withdrawing the Army from its actual position of, shall <Col N="1459" /> we call it, interference in the affairs of this country, nobody would suggest its being taken entirely out of the situation. In framing our Estimates we have prophesied to a certain extent that it shall be possible, in, say the near future, to take the Army from the position of actual interference in the affairs of the country; that there shall not be, we hope, in a short time any military necessity for the employment of the Army on the scale to which it has been employed up to the present time.  But that does not mean that it can vanish entirely.  We hope we shall be able to reduce it, and that by concentrating on training that even with reduced numbers we shall be in a position from a military point of view to deal with any military necessity that unhappily might arise.  I think that bearing in mind the whole circumstances of the situation, and what possibly faces us during the current year, that it is unreasonable to ask that the Estimates should be put back for discussion until such time as the present Ministry is in a position to state what is its general Army policy, and what type of Army we would have here in normal conditions.  The Government is dealing with the position of the present year, dealing with the machinery that will bring us through the present year, and it will be later on in this year at any rate, when the minds of the present Government, or of any Government, will be in an atmosphere in which it would be wise to begin to discuss these particular problems, and to base their financial arrangements on the results of these discussions.  The military necessity for using the Army at the present moment, does exist, and the military necessity for utilising the powers under the resolutions passed here by the Dáil for dealing with certain events certainly does exist.</P>
    <P>The next two or three weeks may be able to determine whether a change can take place, but the Government is perfectly prepared to move very rapidly in facing a rapidly changing situation.  If the situation in the country rapidly changes in the direction in which we see it changing, and in which we hope it will continue to change, then it will be possible for the Government to change, and change quickly its attitude of dealing with suspects, dealing with prisoners, and dealing with people convicted of a certain class of crime.  The document <Col N="1460" /> referred to by the Deputy as having been circulated to-day cannot have come from the Army Publicity Department.  I doubt if such a Department exists.  The detention of prisoners is a matter certainly that is a financial infliction in the country.  A very considerable amount of money is spent on their upkeep and the keeping of guards over them, and there is no doubt a very considerable loss to the country in a number of ways by the fact that these men, some of them, at any rate, are withdrawn from what might be called productive employment. On the other hand, your situation here is certainly not a stabilised peace situation, and you can very easily run the risk of inflicting financial losses a thousandfold on the country by anything like indiscriminate dealing with the prisoner problem, or by hasty dealing with it at the present time.  On the question of the possibility of money which it is proposed to include in the Army Vote being taken out of it and used for other and more constructive purposes, I doubt it, and I would not recommend demobilisation of the Army to any greater extent than we have contemplated in putting up this Estimate.  I would not be prepared to recommend it, and I do not think the Government of the country would be on safe ground if anything like it was done.  I have not any very great hope, at any rate, I cannot contemplate at the moment, that any bulk of this. Vote will be taken from the Army Vote and set aside for constructive work. Only as you go along from day to day, or from month to month, can you see where you can introduce restrictions, and where you can introduce economies. Anything that, from day to day, it is possible to do to prevent unnecessary expenditure in connection with the Army is being done, but I cannot agree to have it held over us that the Army as it stands at present can be reduced here on this Vote.  I am perfectly open-minded in the matter of constructive work, whether it should be done in present circumstances by men acting under discipline as soldiers, or otherwise.  Actually we have made arrangements with the Postmaster-General by which in certain parts of the country where there are certain military dangers at the present moment some of the telegraph lines which are in urgent need of being restored for the public use, will be restored by small bodies of soldiers <Col N="1461" /> that we are detaching specially for that class of work.  The work is on a par with that of road-mending and bridge construction, of which the Army has done such a lot recently.  Within the last six or eight weeks in Kerry, the Army there has built over 40 bridges, bringing a very, very great amount of relief to the civil population in that area.  In the area of Kerry, and one or two other areas, we hope to be instrumental in restoring at any rate some telegraphic and telephonic services in the very near future.  I cannot blame, I am afraid, those of our officers around the country who are concerning themselves with what problems of construction lie before the different County Councils, or before the people of any of these areas.  If the County Councils in any particular area expects that the Government are going to do their work by means of the Army I suppose it is simply as a result of seeing the Army doing so many things for so many different Departments.  On the matter of policy there is not at the present moment anything contemplated in that particular direction, and there will not be without perfect understanding of the lines on which such work will be done.  There is no definite scheme made, and there is no definite scheme being worked out.</P>

      <P>I notice one item on this Vote termed &ldquo;civilian workers.&rdquo;  I wonder what that means when the Army Council is requesting civilian workers to attest?  I raised this matter on the adjournment of the Dáil some time ago.  I also desire to mention the orders or invitations that the County Councils have received from officers stationed in certain towns.  I am aware, and I can state without contradiction, that the County Council of Westmeath have left over the making of three or four new roads simply because an officer approached the County Surveyor, the County Secretary and some members of the Council, and requested them to furnish him with details of any new or necessary public works that were <Col N="1462" /> to be done, as the military were prepared to carry out these works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the military were to carry out these works, and certainly this particular County Council congratulated itself on the stroke of good luck that they were going to have by such a generous offer by the military to carry out the work free of charge to the ratepayers, and, consequently, these roads are left there untouched waiting for the military to come down and to make them; and I can supply the Minister for Defence with the cutting from the Press where it is stated that the work was to be taken on to-morrow or at a future date. I think that to deprive the workers in the country generally, and the men who have been engaged at this particular work for years, of their means of livelihood by placing men on the roads in military uniform would be very curious indeed. Another thing, I certainly fail to see how any of the Councils can expect the Army Authorities to make new roads for them free of charge, when every individual in the country, not alone the ratepayers, but everybody else as well, are the people who, by paying duties in the shape of taxes, have to pay the cost of this work, and of course these taxes will not come down while we have to maintain such a huge Army.  I certainly do agree that the Army has done a good deal of necessary work and good work in the country.  I quite agree with that point.  But if the Army has done such good work we are all very glad, and I am sure further that the Dáil was rejoiced to hear the Minister for Defence say that he hopes that in a fortnight or three weeks time there will be absolute peace.  I am sure that the people at the present time require peace, but how can you have peace if you are going to create a new war through the country by placing men in military uniform on the roads while men who should do this work, and who are members of Trades Unions, are drawing the Unemployment dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I want to raise, and that is concerning the prisoners.  The Minister for Defence stated that the prisoners number from 12,000 to 14,000 at the present moment.  I am quite sure <Col N="1463" /> that a large number of these prisoners were men simply arrested on suspicion. I raised a question in the Dáil about some of these men who, I had been informed, signed the form to be released, but whose release is still not sanctioned. If you have 14,000 prisoners, or probably more, men and women, see what a loss that is to the nation.  Surely there must be at least 8,000 of these prisoners who are purely innocent people.  If that be so, if there are eight thousand of these prisoners innocent people it points to one sure fact that the Irish have become a great deal more Irish than they were in the old times.  Furthermore, I ask the Minister for Defence to state if he possibly can, the amount of money it takes for the maintenance of all these prisoners, and further if he can state from what fund that money is taken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that instead of occupying the time of the Dáil as a whole that this matter should be now referred to a Select Committee of the Dáil.  The suggestion, I think, is an excellent one, and I think that it would save the time of the Dáil and of the Ministers and render unnecessary speeches that would be delivered here, and we might evolve a satisfactory measure with a minimum of time and labour.  Therefore, I am willing to accept the suggestion made to me, and I am quite willing also that the nomination of the Committee should be left in the hands of An Ceann Comhairle (a laugh).  I do not see why that statement of mine should stir the risible faculties of Deputies.  The matter is a very serious one, and the choice of An Ceann Comhairle in selecting the Committee, to pass this Bill through all its stages is also a serious one.  But I think he is quite equal to it, and if those who criticise the matter are willing to agree to that course I certainly think it would help to expedite the business of the Dáil, and get us nearer the passing of this Bill through all its stages in the Dáil, but I am quite prepared to go on if that is not done.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would <Col N="1465" /> like to explain the position.  We have here an Order for the consideration of this Bill in Committee of the whole Dáil to-day, and I take it that the Deputy is asking that leave be given to him, without notice, to move to discharge that Order, and to commit the Bill to a special Committee.  If there is dissent from that I am afraid it cannot be done.</P>

      <P>I would like to see the Terms of Reference to the Select Committee.  I would favour this proposal if there was a clause in the Terms of Reference that the Committee would not report sooner than six months.  After all, this is a serious matter as Deputy Milroy says, and requires mature reflection.  In the meantime, we could be getting on with the more frivolous work of the Session.  A Select Committee would want to be a very Select Committee, to do justice to this Bill.  On the whole, I think, if the Deputy drafts the Terms of Reference and produces them to the Dáil it might be well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Terms of Reference are the very matters on the Orders of the Day, dealing with this Bill. I am not very much of an expert on Parliamentary procedure, but I presume that the Committee set up to deal with the Bill has the power of the Dáil in Session as a Committee.  Therefore, the Terms of Reference are the Terms of Reference that this Dáil would have as a Committee if it proceeded with the Orders of the Day.  I regret the rather flippant comment of the Minister for Home Affairs suggesting that the Committee should report six months hence.  I did not make the suggestion for a Select Committee. The suggestion was made to me, and I decided to accept it, as I regarded it as a suggestion to save the time of the Dáil and to expedite the consideration of this Bill whether the Bill eventually be thrown out or carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the refering of this Bill to a Select Committee, The value of having this matter discussed in full is that Deputies generally should be really convinced by the promoters of the Bill of its value, and of the value of specific clauses in it.  That can only be done effectively by public discussion in <Col N="1466" /> the Dáil.  We ought to bear in mind that, in addition to the function of persuading members of the Dáil as to the merits of a particular clause or amendment in the Bill, it is also the function of the Dáil, especially with a Bill of this kind, to educate the public.  Here we have a subject which has excited an immense amount of interest, one on which we are asking the Oireachtas to revolutionise the public view upon the morality of sweepstakes. We have accepted the law that prevailed up to this, which looked upon sweepstakes of this kind as an institution which was not desirable for a community in normal circumstances, and, consequently, that law, which we have accepted, is embodied in our Code.  Now, Deputies come forward with a Bill, the effect of which is to completely change the moral outlook of the public of Ireland.  It is very desirable, if the Deputies who are in charge of the Bill want to change the public opinion of the country, that they should educate that public opinion, and the way to do that is by open discussion in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I submit that the proposal to refer this Bill to a Select Committee ought not to be proceeded with.  I am open to be convinced of the merits of the Bill as a whole, and of the several clauses in the Bill as originally promoted.  I am also open to be convinced of the merits of the several amendments put down in the name of the promoters of the Bill, and in the name of the Minister for Home Affairs and of other Deputies.  It will be a valuable education in politics, in Parliamentary procedure and in public morality to have this matter fully discussed, to have all the arguments and all the authorities that may be brought into requisition to show that this kind of a Bill, bearing in mind its value to the hospitals and its effect upon the public mind, is <Col N="1467" /> such that we ought to pass it into law. Now, we have never yet, in all the proposals that have come before us, even in matters requiring very detailed discussion, matters of technical importance, we have never yet followed the proposal to refer a Bill of this kind to a Select Committee.  I think some of the Bills that have been before the Dáil ought to have been referred to a Select Committee, but they were of a different character from this Bill.  They dealt with technical matters, with matters of administration and of Local Government, and with matters that affected the daily lives of the people.  They were very intricate, and required close inspection from the point of view of detail, but this is not such a Bill.  It deals rather with broad, sweeping and general principles, and, consequently, it is one which ought to be fully dealt with in the Dáil, so that we shall have the value of the expositions which Deputy Milroy and Deputy White and those who are supporting the Bill on these benches will give to the Dáil and to the country, because when our children and our children's children come to read the debates on this Bill, and come to examine into the why and the wherefore that the Dáil, in the first session after its Constitution, should set itself to the work of revolutionising the public view in regard to betting and gambling, and in regard to the morals of sweepstakes, it is well that it should be clear to that public of the future what arguments were brought forward in favour of this Bill. In view of these considerations I submit it is undesirable that the Dáil should agree to the proposition that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee.</P>

Having got notice that some such proposal would be put forward, it has been prepared, and would read something like this: &ldquo;That the Order of the 11th May continuing the Third Stage of Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Bill 1923, be discharged, and that the Bill be committed to a special Committee of the Dáil to consist of the following Deputies &mdash;we would have to name the Deputies here&mdash;&ldquo;and that the Committee have power to examine witnesses in regard to the Bill, and send for papers and records; that ... number for a quorum and that the Committee report back to the Dáil within a fixed number of days.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If there is any Deputy prepared to fill in the blanks in that proposal as to the number of Deputies on the Committee, and the number forming a quorum, and the date on which they would report back to the Dáil, we could then receive the motion and discuss it, and everything would be perfectly in order.  Would Deputy Milroy undertake that?</P>

      <P>I think this motion ought to be adopted.  We have a great deal of business before the Dáil, and later on there will be a considerable amount of private business brought on by Deputies.  It does seem to me that we ought not to allow the time of private members and the time of the Dáil to be taken up with a discussion, in Committee of the whole Dáil, of such a Bill as this. I would add that this proposal to send the Bill to a private Committee is a decent method of burial.  I do not believe that a quorum of that Committee will ever meet.  I doubt that if they are told to report by a particular day they will ever have any report to produce.  It seems to me that when a great man dies you give him a public funeral.  Unfortunately, we have had too many of those lately in this country.  I do not think we need go through the ceremony Deputy Johnson suggests&mdash;that we should bury this Bill in public.  A Select Committee would be better.  They can &ldquo;bury it darkly, at dead of night&rdquo; and whether the members of it turn the sod with bayonets or otherwise, it matters not; they may do it with sweeping brushes if they wish.  Do not let us waste the time of the Dáil as a whole on this.  If the Committee prefer to go on with it, good and well.  If it does not, I have no doubt the Bill will get the ceremonious treatment Deputy Johnson desires to give it, <Col N="1470" /> in detail.  Do not make two bites of a cherry.  Let the Committee chew it up for us first, and then we can deal with it.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at the spirit of levity and I might say indelicacy just now manifested by our respected colleague, Deputy Fitzgibbon.  I am not a member of the legal profession, and I have not the gift of oratorical hot air that my colleague in the Dáil has.  He has made use, as I said, of rather indelicate&mdash;and I might go further and say&mdash;I was going to say blasphemous sentiments, but I do not.  Blasphemous is, perhaps, too strong, but he has sought, in his subtle and judicial manner, to endeavour to pour ridicule on this Bill.  Now, I appreciate the significance of this, and I submit with all respect to the Dáil, the great responsibility that would lie on us when we consider this Bill.  I think it would be much better if Deputy Fitzgibbon would spare his magnificent gift of ironical oratory or hot air for some other place. Now, this proposal to submit this Bill to a Select Committee was made in all sincerity by my colleagues and those members of the Dáil who appreciate the significance of this Bill.  We know that there were very many people dying to display to members of the Dáil, and to the people of Ireland, their scorpionic eloquence on this Bill, and it was with the idea of shutting off this scorpionic eloquence and hot air that my colleague and myself, in all sincerity, submitted a suggestion that the time of this Dáil was more precious than to listen to the hot air of those gentlemen.</P>

      <P>Before he concludes, I would like to say that I noticed, with very complete sympathy, the look of amazement, disgust and pathos on the face of Deputy White as he listened to the treacherous support of his motion given by Deputy Fitzgibbon. He asks us to believe that he holds the employment of calorified atmosphere as something objectionable.  Yet, he himself indulges in it profusely.  He reminds me of the case of Domhnall MacTavish who returned from one of the Dominions beyond the Seas.  When asked by the inhabitants of Dromitractara what manner of people he had lived his life among there, he replied, &ldquo;They are English, and mind ye, they are unco clannish, but I was wise, I never let on I was a Scot.&rdquo;  Deputy White, I think, makes the same eminently successful cover for himself in his animosity to hot air.  This is a very serious proposal, and ought be dealt with very seriously, to withdraw from the full, open discussion of the Dáil a measure which has already occupied us for so many days and so many hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the proposal had been made in the beginning after the Second Reading that this measure should be referred for further treatment to a Select Committee, I undoubtedly would have supported the proposal, for a variety of reasons, which, perhaps, I ought to unfold now in detail But when it has already been submitted on two occasions to discussion in the Committee of the whole Dáil I suggest with all due submission, that it would be highly irregular and unprecedented to <Col N="1472" /> give it this mixed treatment of part discussion in the full Dáil, and part in a Select Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>

      <P>If the diagnosis be that the little manifestation of life that it has made this afternoon is merely molecular activity, then it is not the proper thing to order a prolonged funeral or wake&mdash;because that is practically what Deputy Fitzgibbon proposed for it, a prolonged wake in the name of a Select Committee&mdash;after which the public will be allowed to know the painful fact that it is defunct.  I think some reasons ought to have been given by Deputy Milroy to convince us that this is the proper treatment.  I recall that on this day fortnight, after a very analytical discussion on a proposal&mdash;a wise proposal, let me add&mdash;of Deputy Thrift, it was arranged that the Dáil should suspend the consideration of the measure until important facts had been brought to our knowledge, without which we could not hopefully proceed further in the discussion of that wise amendment of Deputy Thrift.  I have been awaiting with anxious interest, I have been in fact trying to support a painful life in the interval, waiting for those important facts to be disclosed&mdash;to wit, what it costs, or rather what it has cost, to carry out successfully the work of promoting a sweepstake for those large sums in the form of prizes which have hitherto staggered humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Milroy gave <Col N="1473" /> an undertaking&mdash;I need not say a solemn undertaking, for everything Deputy Milroy does, is done solemnly&mdash;to procure the information for us.  It has not been circulated as a White Paper of the Dáil, or as a Green Paper of the Dáil; neither has he communicated it to us orally, and I do not see how we can continue to discuss this measure which, after all, as a practical thing&mdash;if it has any practicability&mdash;depends altogether upon the <i>modus operandi.</i>  We ought to know whether in giving legislative sanction to this work of promoting sweepstakes in the cause of charity, it can be done without having recourse to those processes which Deputy Gorey, on a former occasion, characterised as belonging to the shadier side of what we might call the camp-followers of sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to advance an effective reason why we should not withdraw the discussion of the Bill from the Committee of the whole House.  One of the arguments that appeals with particular effectiveness to me is that under the pressure of criticism in the whole House, and largely because of the lively interest excited in all the Deputies by the considerations made in the Committee of the whole House, we reached this stage of exploration being called for, and the demand for how the working efficiency of the scheme was to be secured in the event of the sanction of the Dáil being given to the measure.  I hope that is in order, sir.  If we withdraw the discussion into Select Committee, I wonder will the Select Committee be authorised to hear evidence upon oath. If I thought that depositions upon oath, that cross-examination, and a public record of such evidence given upon cross-examination, would be forthcoming, then I could, undoubtedly, vote for this motion as having brought about a great public reform incidentally.  Out of small things of little or no consequence, the history of the world shows us that great reformations have issued.  There has been, as we are all aware, a great deal of unnecessary comment made as to the morality of sweepstakes.  I do not propose to enter into that, because it would be disorderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could be assured that this would be done, that Deputy Milroy's Committee would be seriously appointed, that the men would be selected because of their known capacity for the sifting of evidence, and for their dispassionate and judicious methods of dealing with evidence, and that that Committee would be empowered to call witnesses and go into the working of similar enterprises in the past, showing how much has been collected and how much has been paid for the service of employees, how much in commission, and the like, then I would be satisfied that Deputy Milroy&mdash;even though he may eventually fail to carry this measure&mdash; would have done the country a very great service indeed by the publicity he would have secured.  Consequently, whether I vote for or against this proposal will depend largely upon the assurances Deputy Milroy is prepared to give us in this regard.  The outline which you, sir, in the Chair, proposed for Deputy Milroy's acceptance, gave the cadre of a very excellent proposal&mdash;that before we proceed further the personnel of this Committee should be revealed, and that part of the motion should be to take power for the examination of witnesses.  Unless I know what the sequel to this truncated or limited motion is to be, I am not able to make up my mind definitely as to how I shall vote.  As Deputy Milroy is panting to replace me in occuying the attention of the Dáil, I would beg to ask him to give us these assurances, and to unfold his mind in the matter, so that we may treat the question with all that seriousness that it so obviously deserves.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Milroy replies I would like to urge the view that this Bill should not be referred to a Select Committee, and that the considerations for and against the Bill, and for and against particular amendments that are set down to the Bill, should not be urged in private.  It is a matter of public interest, and very considerable duties are imposed by the Bill on a particular Department of the Government, the Home Affairs Department. The considerations that that Department, through its Minister, wishes to urge, ought to be urged in public, and ought to <Col N="1475" /> be known to the people so that if the Bill receives a majority and is ultimately passed, at least it will not have been passed before the view of the Department most concerned is heard upon it Deputy Magennis had adverted to what occurred here upon the last occasion on which this Bill was discussed.  A very pertinent question was raised as to what proportion of the net proceeds of a sweepstake would go to the alleged charitable object, and what proportion would go in expenses and in commissions and in revenue to the promoters.  That is a very important point.  Deputy Milroy was to make inquiries.  Evidently the result of his inquiries is such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendment, I take it, if passed by the Dáil, that power to send for witnesses would be an authorisation to the Minister for Finance to pay the necessary expenses.  The sending for witnesses to Altdorf, in Switzerland, would cost a considerable amount of money.  I do not know whether the resolution, if passed as proposed to be amended, would be deemed as sufficient authority to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to approve the expenditure of money for this purpose, and I take it that even if we do pass the amendment, it is still within the option of summoned persons to refuse to attend.  I wonder whether it would be possible to insert in the amendment compulsory power, so that persons called up be treated as sub-poenaed witnesses who would be bound to attend to give evidence on oath.  Like most other Deputies I am ignorant of the powers of a Select Committee in such a matter, and it would be well on a night like this, when we have plenty of time, and when everybody is in good humour, that advantage should be taken of the occasion to examine into the powers of Select Committees.</P>

      <P>I am not able to make any declaration.  I might be allowed to dissent from the opinion that we have plenty of time.  If we are going to send this Bill to a Special Committee I suggest we ought to do so.  If not, I suggest, instead of giving me the task of carefully listening to the debate, to see that Deputies did not discuss the Bill in Committee, we should go into Committee.  We have had already fiftyfour minutes entertainment upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had any assurance that there was a reasonable likelihood of witnesses responding to the call of the Select Committee, and any good grounds for hoping that the newspapers, which are largely interested in betting men's advertisements, and in reporting the results of sweepstakes and the surroundings of all draws, and generally in matters appertaining to this institution, would report the proceedings at a Select Committee, even with as much, or as little, care that they report the proceedings of the Dáil, I would be inclined to agree with the Minister for Home Affairs in his amendment that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One does not like to think of a Bill of this nature being remitted to a Select Committee, and then that the matters to be discussed by this Committee should remain hidden in the pages of the official report from the eyes and ears of the great majority of the members of the Dáil, of the Seanad, and of the country generally, until the official report is published in a bound volume.  Because of the price of the official report, that the Minister for Finance has insisted upon, the public do not care to acquaint themselves with the proceedings even of the Dáil, let alone of a Select Committee of the Dáil, and we cannot depend upon a very large circulation of the official reports. Without the assistance of the newspapers, and the newspaper reports of the proceedings of a Select Committee, the Dáil would be at a great disadvantage in having a matter of this kind referred to a Select Committee If the mover of the amendment can adduce any reason for thinking that reasonable publicity would be given to the proceedings of a Select Committee, and if he would express his faith in the response witnesses would give to the <Col N="1480" /> summons of a Select Committee, and if the papers which would be called for would be brought into evidence, I would be quite prepared to reconsider my attitude to this proposal.</P>

Before I can make up my mind about these witnesses from Switzerland, I should like to know whether it is advisable to have them.  We also want to know the number of tickets sent out for recent sweepstakes.  We want to know the total of the moneys received.  Unless we are in a position to know all that, we are not in a position to come to a clear decision at all.  If I can be assured the Committee will have all those powers I may alter my views. Until I am assured we have the power to compel a man from Switzerland, or from any part of the country to come before us, I do not think this Committee is worth anything.</P>

He reminded me of Tennyson's babbling brook, &ldquo;Sweepstakes may come, and sweepstakes may <Col N="1481" /> go, but I go on for ever.&rdquo;  There is also another analogy that I might draw.</P>

      <P>His arguments were like the babbling brook, silvery but shallow. I do not mind the youthful Moses on the front Bench, who is trying to formulate another commandment: &ldquo;Thou shalt not buy a sweepstake ticket.&rdquo;  I suppose he, with Deputies Johnson, Magennis, and Gorey, might be called four just men, or, as this has something to do with horse racing, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They have attempted, on a simple definite motion, which merely deals with one of the ordinary steps of Parliamentary procedure&mdash;the committal of a Bill to a Special Committee&mdash;to raise a whole moral issue as if the morality and the fate of this island of saints and scholars were trembling in the balance.  They have also attempted to impute that we, in suggesting this committal of the Bill, were trying to dodge criticism of the Bill.  As I said, the suggestion was not mine.  I am sorry I made the suggestion, and I mean to vote against the committal of the Bill to a Special Committee. I am sorry I made the suggestion, because it has been utilised by Deputies to make a display which is rather humiliating to the sovereign assembly of the Irish Nation.  Deputy Gorey still persists in making that display. I withdraw the motion that I made.  If it is pressed to a division I will vote against it, and I will go on with the Bill, as I said at the beginning I was prepared to do.  I have nothing to be ashamed of, and I challenge any man here to find an alternative means of providing what this Bill hopes to find, If they defeat the Bill.  You would think, to listen to some of the dissertations here to-night, and other nights, that we were engaged in some touting job for some turf agents.  If all the Deputies here know as little about turf agents as <Col N="1482" /> I do, there will be innocence in regard to horse racing and such matters.  I wish that, once and for all, we would get rid of this moralising and this hypocritical pretence of trying to safeguard the interests of the Nation, and consider this Bill on its merits, as to whether it is an instrument that can be made of use for the benefit of these institutions or not. I withdraw my motion, to commit the Bill to a Special Committee.</P>

      <P>I only want to be assured as to the powers of the Special Committee.  I take it that you, A Chinn Comhairle, have acquainted yourself very fully with the matter.  It seemed to me that while our Adaptation of Enactments Act stated that references to the British House of Commons were to be read as references to Dáil Eireann, it would probably be necessary to have an Order under Section 12 of that Act made by the Executive Council before a Special Committee of this Dáil would have the powers of a Select Committee of the British House of Commons.  When <Col N="1483" /> we set up a Committee on Finance, I think it was called, it was necessary for an Order to be made and laid on the Table of the Dáil giving that Committee the powers of a Committee of Ways and Means or a Committee of Supply in the British House, and I think that certainly at the moment, and unless there was going to be an Order made by the Executive Council&mdash;and I do not know that the matter has been before them for consideration&mdash;it would probably be impossible for the Committee to compel the attendance of witnesses.  I would like, for my own satisfaction, to have your view on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a very important legal question involved.  I was under the impression that a Special Committee appointed by this Dáil to consider a Bill would have the same power as similar Committees appointed in England, owing to the very thing in the Adaptation of Enactments Act which the Minister has cited.  If the Executive Council has doubts on that matter, it seems to me that the proper and reasonable procedure would be for the Minister for Home Affairs, who is a colleague of the Minister for Local Government in the Executive Council, to withdraw his amendment.  It would be proper for the Minister for Home Affairs to withdraw his amendment in view of this doubt which exists in the minds of the members of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I suggest to you that it is within the competence of the Dáil to propose an amendment to the amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs, conferring the power upon the Committee so set up to compel the attendance of witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs, I think, purports to confer that power: &ldquo;That the Committee shall have power to examine witnesses with regard to the Bill to send for papers and records&rdquo;&mdash;that is the precise amendment proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dáil approves of that, then, obviously, it would be the duty of the Executive Council to take such steps as would be required to put <Col N="1484" /> the views of the Dáil into operation.  If the powers of the British House are as defined by the Minister for Local Government, the course of action which would be followed in that House by the Ministry there would undoubtedly be followed here, so that, apart from the legal decision, if the Dáil decides in favour of the amendment, I take it the course is clear for such action.</P>

It was in the hope of the useful and edifying information we might be able to extract from that Committee that I moved the amendment.

      <P>I have much pleasure in seconding the proposition. I raised the question this evening as to whether or not what was proposed was to refer the Bill to a Select Committee which would really inquire into the matter by calling witnesses.  I would vote, and I believe the majority of the Dáil, if not all the Deputies, would vote, for the original proposal if satisfied that the Select Committee would have this power conferred upon it.  Therefore our ability to come to a determinate conclusion on the matter is conditional upon our knowledge as to what are the powers belonging to a Select Committee <i>ipso facto</i> of its own nature, or whether those powers have to be conferred upon it by express resolution.</P>

If it eventually can be proved that a Select Committee of this very effective and searching character that we desire, can be brought to bear upon the Bill, then I shall vote for its submission to that Select Committee, although I have my own doubts as to the propriety of allowing a Bill to undergo discussion in general Committee, up to a certain point, and then to do the unprecedented thing, to withdraw it and submit it to a Select Committee.

If we are to discuss this question and come to a definite conclusion, the promoters should put all the facts before us, and time should be given to the promoters for that purpose. If this Committee has not the power, and if it is ultimately ascertained that it has not the power, what is the use of such a Committee.  We will have, perhaps, to examine the Treaty and the Constitution and relations with Great Britain to find out whether we have the power to bring British citizens over here from Britain and examine them here.  This is a very big and a very broad question.  If we have that power it is a big proposition, and then we would have to examine into our relationship with continental countries.</P>

      <P>I recollect that you must hold the balance between all parties, even if it is a Sweepstakes Bill that is fighting for its life, and I believe it is going to survive.  However, that is not germane to the motion before the Dáil, which is the motion of Deputy Johnson, to adjourn this matter until the next day of Private Business, or until, as Deputy Gorey suggests, he finds out what is the international law relating to sweepstakes.</P>

      <P>I think I have as much time in that sense as either Deputy Gorey or the Minister for Home Affairs. I have quite enough of it, and if I am to get another does of it, if either of them is prepared to take my place, I have no objection.  But to come back to the question, if these righteous Ministers and Angels of Grace will permit me, the question before the Dáil is to adjourn to discover what are the international usages of sweepstakes.  I ask the Dáil can they take that as a serious argument in favour of adjournment?  The simple question of whether the Dáil should remit this Bill to a Select Committee can be decided here and now.  A much simpler question, in order to expedite business, is to allow the motion to remit the Bill to a Select Committee to be withdrawn, and let the Dáil proceed with the Bill.  Even in spite of my own reiterated statement, that the intention of those who suggested the committal of this Bill to a Select Committee was in no way a move to cloak the objects of the Bill&mdash;even after my reiterated and emphatic statements to that effect, Professor Magennis has repeatedly insinuated that, and I do not think it is worthy of him.</P>

      <P>I regret that any remarks of mine should have given the honourable Deputy an opportunity to make another speech.  Now I want to come back to the point whether there is any real reason for adjourning on this question.  I do not think there is.  I regret that since 6 o'clock this evening <Col N="1490" /> the time of the Dáil has been wasted, but not by me.  It was quite obvious to everyone that the motion that was made was seized upon as a means of postponing discussion on the Bill.  I see no reason why the Dáil cannot go right ahead now and discuss the merits of the Bill in Committee of the whole House. I know members are tired, they are all anxious to get away; probably they would have got away before now if it had not been for their own folly in making such curious and irrelevant speeches as they have delivered here this evening.</P>

      <P>That is not my intention, especially seeing the protection you afforded me during this critical discussion. I see no reason why the Dáil should not proceed with this business on the Orders of the Day.  I see no purpose to be gained by adjourning this discussion until next Wednesday or Friday.  I do not suppose that by that time the Legal Advisers of the Free State Government will be able to satisfy Deputy Gorey as to the merits of international law relating to this matter.  I have no doubt that his knowledge of these matters is so profound and far-reaching that he would contest any opinions they would put forward, and, similarly, I am quite sure that if the Minister for Home Affairs was able to report a pronouncement of the Law Adviser on this matter, that Deputy Magennis would get up and maintain the House spellbound for an hour or two showing the deficiencies of the judgment of the Law Advisers, and then, when they had finished, I am sure Deputy Johnson would come with those solemn, ponderous platitudes of his to convince the House that even in international law relating to sweepstakes there was no security for the morality of the Irish Nation.</P>

Of course, the terms of reference will be set down in the Notice of Motion, but it is also lawful to give special instructions to a Special Committee&mdash;for instance, not to report until they had got all the particulars and details.

If there is anybody here who could make an impartial nomination it would be yourself.  I am quite certain that otherwise the selection of 9, 10, or 12 men, whatever the number was, would give rise to criticism of a rather undesirable nature.  I do not know what the procedure for setting up committees is. I certainly suggest that the committee should be composed of those who sincerely wish to examine the Bill, not of those who wish to kill the Bill, and I certainly would not take the responsibility of suggesting a full list of persons for such a committee.

If so, I have no objection to doing it, and I certainly would not nominate simply those who had been speaking and voting in favour of the Bill.  But I shall not nominate a series of names which will give rise to unnecessary and acrimonious criticism.

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1422" /> for defence to state on what grounds dependent's allowance has been refused in the case of Frank Phillips, of Killarney, No. 5577, now stationed at the Curragh Camp; whether the evidence goes to show that this man had been earning £2 8s. per week, and was employed by Mr. John O'Connor, contractor, Killarney, who certified to these facts, and that his mother was solely dependent upon him for support; and will he direct that further enquiry be made into this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>This case has been re-investigated, and it has been confirmed that the claim of Mrs. Phillips, who at the most was only partially supported by her son Frank, should be disallowed on the ground that the extent of dependence which is the case of an unmarried soldier is taken to be the amount normally contributed by him to his home over and above the cost (if any) of his own maintenance therein for a reasonable period prior to his enlistment, was less than the minimum required by regulations&mdash;that is, 12s. per week&mdash;before an allowance may be issued.  It appears that Phillips' employment with Mr. O'Connor ceased about a year prior to his enlistment.  It should be stated that the regulations governing the matter are based on the recognition of an obligation on the part of an unmarried soldier to contribute to the support of his dependents a reasonable portion of his Army pay, this portion being calculated as 8s. per week in the case of a soldier receiving ordinary rates of pay.</P>
