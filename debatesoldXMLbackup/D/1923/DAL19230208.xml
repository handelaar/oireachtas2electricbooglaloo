      <P>(for Tomas O Conaill): To ask the Minister for Defence whether the claim of Messers.  White's Automobile Co., Ltd., Ballina, for spare motor parts, tyres, and work done, and for lorries which have been commandeered, has yet been paid; and whether he is aware that there is a sum of over £1,000 involved, and that the Managing Director, Mr. White, has already spent over £50 in trying to collect even part of this amount on account, and so far has been unsuccessful; and further, whether he is aware that a staff of twelve is likely to be thrown out of employment owing to the inability of the company to carry on business unless the accounts are promptly paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It has been circulated, and I regret that there has been so much delay in presenting it to the Dáil, but it was inevitable in the circumstances. The Bill covers a very wide field, as will have been observed, and in asking the Dáil to accept the principles embodied in it, I will just explain some of the points that are involved.  The Bill is divided into three parts.  The first part deals with claims arising out of incidents which took place from the 21st January, 1918, to the 11th July, 1921, that is, from the date of the first meeting of the Dáil until the truce.</P>
      <P>The second part, Sections 2 to 15, relates to injuries to property which were done from the 11th July to the 6th of this month, that is, with property claims from the Truce up to the date of the circulation of this Bill.  It will be remembered that a resolution was submitted to the Dáil (Provisional Parliament) somewhere in September last, the terms of which were to the effect that the Government intended to relieve local authorities of a considerable part of the burden that was occasioned by the damage that was done, and that a certain date would be fixed from which no further liability would be accepted by the Government, and the date that is now laid down in the Bill is the 6th February, and I take it it will be admitted that that is a generous extension of the period.  Some criticism of the terms of that resolution was made, and I think that this is a generous interpretation of the views given in the Dáil at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill is concerned with matters of a general character, and also with personal injuries in the Post-Truce period.  The first part of the Bill deals only with the pre-Truce period, and, as <Col N="1363" /> the Deputies are aware, an International tribunal is dealing with cases which occurred from January, 1919, till the 11th July.  This arrangement, which was come to between the British Government and the members of the Provisional Government, has been open to a good deal of criticism by reason of the delay incurred in the preliminary stages in dealing with cases.  The arrangements, however, have been improved, and there is much more expedition recently in dealing with these cases.  Delay was also occasioned by reason of the fact that certain liens, mortgages, or other arrangements had been made, and the Government had to be safeguarded in that connection, and legal formalities occupied a considerable amount of time.  There is now no unnecessary delay in dealing with these cases, but having regard to the large number some allowance must be made, and the most recent proposals that we have adopted render it possible to have these cases dealt with very much more expeditiously.  This clause gives effect to the policy indicated in the public notice Number 2, in which all the proceedings in respect of the pre-Truce claims were set out.  The relief given by the clause to the local authorities is rendered possible by reason of the fact that responsibility for the period in question is assumed either by the Irish Government or the British Government.  A considerable number of awards have already been reported, and with the improvement that I have already indicated to the Dáil, it is hoped that that progress upon this side of the problem will give satisfaction to all persons concerned.  In the personal injuries cases, where decress have already been obtained before the issue of the public notice, payments are at present in the course of being made, and for dealing with other personal injury cases it is proposed at once to constitute a special tribunal, which will be in a position to deal with cases in their proper categories, for which the British Government did not assume liability.</P>
    <P>Part 2, consisting of Sections 2 to 15, makes provision for dealing with post-truce cases of damage to property.  The Compensation Commission does not deal with those post-truce cases.  The liability of the British Government for anything that happened since the Truce <Col N="1364" /> in respect of such damage is not the same as in the pre-Truce period.  I think that the number of cases that have occurred are very few as far as any liability of theirs is concerned, and it is necessary to provide other machinery for dealing with such cases.  We came to the conclusion that no more satisfactory method could be adopted than allowing these cases to come before the County Courts, but, as already indicated, some modifications had to be made in the law respecting that.  In the ordinary way, the hearing of these cases, in normal times, would be assisted by the presence of legal representatives of the local authorities. Now provision is made in this part of the Bill for the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Finance to contest all claims; and it will be observed that there is no compensation for consequential loss.  The Criminal and Malicious Injury code was specially intended, or had special arrangements in it, for having compensation awarded for consequential loss; and that was equitable in the case where a person was aggrieved, and in any case which arose&mdash; the number was small&mdash;it was natural that provision should be made for consequential loss, but the number of cases and the magnitude of the loss is such now that the Government would not be justified in putting forward any provision for making compensation for consequential loss under a Bill of this sort.  As a matter of fact, if such provision were made, then those who had suffered damage to property might also claim for compensation of the same sort.</P>
    <P>Compensation will not be paid for certain articles, such as ornamental jewellery and loss of money.  As a rule the loss in these cases is rather difficult to establish, and, generally speaking, Insurance Companies do not make any provision for compensation in respect of such loss.  The nearest parallel that can be taken for a similar state of affairs, or a state of affairs that is in some respects like the present, is that of 1916, and no such provision was made for compensation for such articles at that period.</P>
    <P>Now, Clause 10 of the Bill is one of the most important; it deals with a case where damage to buildings has taken place, and it makes provision for fulfilment of conditions which the Court may <Col N="1365" /> impose requiring the building to be wholly or partially reinstated.  This principle is being observed to some extent in the case of the Commission which is generally described as the &ldquo;Shaw&rdquo; Commission, at present sitting.</P>
    <P>Clause 12 of the Bill deals with the method of the payments of compensation. It is proposed in this Clause to adopt the expedient of requiring applicants to accept a proportion of their compensation in the form of Government Securities, and it is only natural to assume that Deputies will have expected some proposal of that sort.  It is the general method adopted in dealing with large sums of money, and affords an opportunity for extending over a period the burden to meet applications of this sort.  It is not expected that securities that will be issued will run for many years, probably a few years.  It is contemplated here that small payments up to £500 should be made in cash, and that one half of the excess above £500 also will be paid in cash, subject to a maximum cash payment of £2,000.  In the case of damage amounting to £2,000 the first £500 would be paid in cash, then £750 further would be paid in Government securities, and a further £750 in cash, so that the sum of £1,250 would be paid in cash and £750 in securities. I think it will be admitted that that is a fair and equitable method of dealing with a matter of that sort.  There is an advantage in issuing public securities such as these, because the stability of the State is largely influenced by the number of persons who have a real interest in seeing that stability insured.  In cases where there is a condition that a building must be reinstated it is proposed that the compensation should be paid not by security, but by cash in instalments as the work of reinstatement progresses.  A further provision of Part 2 is to be found in Clause 14, which deals with certain kinds of losses that would not give rise to a legal right to compensation under the Malicious Injuries code.  We do not propose to confer any legal rights in respect of looting, but that the Judge may hear, consider, and investigate such cases, not making a legal award but reporting the result of his investigations to the Minister for Finance, and any subsequent compensation that would be made in respect of such report would be in the nature of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. <Col N="1366" /> The Government does not feel justified in committing itself to any definite view at this stage as to how far the State should make grants, but it will be possible to realise the dimensions of the problem when we have received the Judges' reports.  Clause 9 deals with the conduct of the claimant, which must be taken into consideration.  The clause is very clear, and it is probably unnecessary at this stage to develop to any extent what is involved in it.  It deals with the legitimacy of the claim of a person. Those who have been engaged in this destruction ought not, in the opinion of the Government, be persons who can derive compensation for the destruction caused by their own friends and people whom they supported.  Clause 8 deals with the railways, and we have been unable to submit a clause dealing with compensation in their case, and the railways are omitted from this Bill.  They are in rather a special position.  The damage done to them is of such a character that the Government feel that it would be unsuitable to have their claims dealt with in the ordinary way before the Country Courts.  Other arrangements for giving fair compensation to the Railway Companies have already been the subject of discussion between the companies and the Government.  Further conferences will be held, and it is possible that before the final stages of the Bill be reached a clause can be inserted dealing with them.  The only other case that I have in mind at the moment is the destruction of title deeds and other legal documents and the method of determining the compensation for such destruction is to be found in Clause 11. The Third Part of the Bill deals with the relief that is being given to local authorities. They are relieved entirely from liability in respect of the period from January, 1919, until July, 1921.  Clause 17 provides for the appointment of additional Judges where necessary to assist Country Court Judges in making awards under the Malicious Injuries Acts, and the number of claims in certain areas is so large that some assistance must be afforded to the Country Court Judges in some cases.  Clause 18 deals with the repeal of certain provisions of the existing law.  In this clause the vindictive clauses, as they have been called, of the Acts of 1919 and 1920 are proposed to be repealed.  The whole of the Act of <Col N="1367" /> 1919 comes within this category, and part of the Act of 1920.  These repeals are not limited in their operation to pre-Truce and post-Truce periods, but are permanent changes in the existing law. This involves the abolition of special provisions of the Act of 1919, for instance for the recovery of compensation in cases of murder, maiming, wounding, or malicious injury to the person, arising out of a combination of a seditious character or unlawful association and also the abolition of part of the Act of 1920 by which a person getting an award in Court is entitled to draw interest at the rate of five per cent. from the date on which the award was made.  The Bill has taken a great deal of time, but it has had to cover a very wide field.  It has had to take into consideration three distinct classes of the community&mdash;in the first case the persons injured, in the second case those who have not suffered injury, and then the State, dealing as fairly and impartially to all persons, having regard to its resources, as is possible in a matter of this kind.  It may be natural to ask what amount of damage is estimated in these cases and what is the probable percentage of the cost of this damage to the State.  At this stage one could not give anything like an approximate figure; suffice to say that very extravagant and very unreasonable claims have been put in, and the work of dealing with cases of this kind is not rendered easier where such extravagant claims are sent in.  I am sure the Government has correctly interpreted the opinion of the Dáil when it means to deal fairly and justly with all these cases, having regard to the resources at its disposal. I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was good enough to make a kind of apology to the Dáil for the long delay in introducing the Bill, after notifying that such a Bill was to be introduced, and I think we shall all be agreeable to recognise that the difficulties and the high pressure that the Law Adviser has been working under has made it, perhaps, impossible to bring the Bill in at an earlier date.  The thought suggests itself that <Col N="1368" /> it might be very good business, and really economical, if a way could be found for assisting the Law Adviser and his department to facilitate the preparation of Bills of this kind in such a way as to allow them to be considered before the Second Reading stage.  This is a very important Bill, and we have not had very much time to consider its implications, but I hope that we shall be allowed ample time between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage before we enter on the latter stage.  The Minister has indicated the general lines, but has not told us anything about a number of clauses that are of considerable importance, that I would like to have heard some comments upon, and more explanations of.  I think, for instance, that Section 9 which deals with the discretion of the Judge in deciding whether a claimant has had any association with any political bodies, is going to place difficulties in the way of the Judge, and while, perhaps, the principle is sound, I think it would be found very difficult to apply in practice. That is a matter that I have no doubt will receive a good deal of attention in the Committee Stage.  Part I. of the Bill deals with pre-Truce damage, and I am glad to learn from the Minister that the Shaw Commission, as it has been called, is getting ahead much faster with its work.  I assume that that Commission covers the cases that ought to be brought into the Compensation Courts pretty fully, and if that is so, then I think Part I. of the Bill is unobjectionable, and will be generally accepted as such.  The explanation of the Minister in regard to ruling out consequential losses raises one or two questions in my mind.  I see the force of the argument, that it might be difficult, if not impossible, to make just and fair selections of the cases of consequential losses, and that the direct consequential losses of the property owner would be equalled by the indirect consequential losses of many people, such as employees, who are really, in equity, entitled to compensation for their losses, at least, as well as the property owner, but because of the difficulties the Minister has found it necessary to rule out all claims for consequential damages.  I think the principle on which that decision has been arrived at is, that the losses of property <Col N="1369" /> which are to be compensated for, are essential to the carrying out of the social and economic life of the country, and, therefore, these losses must be replaced. And if we accept that principle, that it is because such property and such particular classes of property as are indicated in the Bill, are necessary to the common good, it is the acceptance of a very important principle, and I hope it will be recognised by the Dáil and by the country in future legislation.  It indicates to me that in the mind of the Ministry property holding gives rights because of the function that that property holding entails in the common life, not merely because it is property, but because the property implies some useful activity, and assists in the carrying on of useful activity for the country.  Hence, it is deemed necessary by the Ministry that the destruction of such property must be compensated for and replaced.  If that is the principle, and I can think of no other principle by which only one kind of property is to be compensated for, as I said before, it is an important principle, and one which, I hope, will be generally acceptable.  That same thought brings up the clause which deals with the reinstatement of such damaged property&mdash;its reconstruction.  I notice that it is mandatory on the Judge to say that buildings shall be replaced out of the moneys provided in compensation, and that is very satisfactory, but there is an omission, I think, in as much as the machinery for the carrying on of the particular business within the buildings, is not included. I think it ought to be.  It is probably the most important part of the property for the local community, and ought to be replaced, and that should be made a condition.  I have in mind the case of the Balbriggan factory, where the rebuilding clause was included in the award, but the award, I think, was for £40,000, or something about that, and the rebuilding clause, I think, only amounted to £5,000.  Now it was building, machinery, stock and equipment that was destroyed to the extent of £40,000, if that was the sum granted.  It ought to have been granted for the complete reestablishment of that factory in the town. What has happened is, that the firm, which got a large sum of money in compensation, practically said, &ldquo;We are prepared to forego the £5,000, which was <Col N="1370" /> granted conditional on our rebuilding the structure.  We will collar the remainder,&rdquo; thus leaving the town without its factory, and the people in London with the money.  I hope that we shall find a way of insisting upon the equipment of a building, particularly where it is such as ensures or provides for employment in the locality, that the equipment should also be replaced when the building is being reconstructed.  The Minister dealt with the equity, I think he said, of the clause relating to the deduction of such rates, taxes, land purchase annuities, as may be due.  I am not sure whether I could accept the argument that that is right in equity. I would suggest that expediency would lead us to, at least, give some relief in point of time&mdash;that if compensation is to be granted to a man who has lost money, trade and living, due to damage to his property, if he is only to be compensated for the loss of his property, and if consequential damages are to be denied him, we should recognise that the consequential inability to pay rates and taxes and land purchase annuities should exempt him from this liability to deduction, and I hope it will be found possible to introduce an amendment to alter that Clause in the direction I have indicated.  I would like to have heard a little more from the Minister regarding the Road Fund&mdash;the rate which it is proposed to levy in lieu of local charge for the purpose of assisting in the remaking of roads, whether that is to be devoted wholly or solely to main roads, or how the allotment is to be made, and what the position of the present Road Fund may be in that respect.  As I suppose it is inevitable in these times, and in this period&mdash;I am not now speaking of the particular circumstances relating to Ireland&mdash;I mean to say, that in this period of social thought, it is inevitable that it is only property damage that is to be compensated for, and that personal damage is not to be compensated for.  It is pretty generally recognised, unfortunately, that the loss of a hand, an eye, or an arm is of less importance when dealing with such matters than the loss of property, but I am inclined to be a little more lenient in criticism of this series of clauses because of the principle that is involved in the payment <Col N="1371" /> of compensation only for property which fulfils a certain social function.  I would ask the Ministers to consider whether, in the case of loss of limb or life, which is practically a deprivation of the economic resources of the individual, apart from personal suffering, there could not be some exception made in this respect. I am thinking of the principle behind the Workmen's Compensation Acts, where a man's livelihood and his economic wealth, in so far as it lies in his person, has been destroyed, there might well be an exception made and some compensation granted to that person apart from any question of what the late Paul Kruger spoke of as moral and material damage.  I am thinking in this case purely of the sufferer as an economic man whose ability to make a livelihood for himself and his family has been destroyed, and I hope that some means will be found for introducing that principle in the Bill at a later stage.  In the main I think the Bill is a good one, and I hope it will receive a second reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might intervene for a moment to explain that the idea in Clause 13 was that the only compensation we were asking local authorities to bear in respect of the damage that had been done would be 6d. in the £ for five years under the Criminal and Malicious Injury Acts, and that that sum would go into the Road Fund, and would deal with repairing damage that had been done to roads, bridges, and so on.  In other words, that the only contribution that local authorities are going to make towards the damage is a contribution in respect of the services that they administer themselves.  In order that the burden would not be heavy we spread it over five years, so that should it be necessary in certain cases to expend capital sums in repairing either roads or bridges, arrangements might be made whereby sums of money could be borrowed which would be required to be spent almost immediately in order that those transit avenues would be opened up for use immediately.  It is not possible, I think, at the present moment to estimate whether trunk roads only should be dealt with, or whether all roads should be dealt with.  The idea was that all <Col N="1372" /> roads should be dealt with.  It is not even within our knowledge at the present moment whether, if this capital sum were available, together with the ordinary revenue that local authorities would collect in the coming year, it would enable them to complete and repair all the damage that has been done. But I think it will be admitted that it is a fair contribution to ask the local authorities to give, and spreading it over five years brings before the minds of the ratepayers of those districts what a useless thing this destructive microbe has been.  In certain districts very little damage has been done to roads and bridges, but a considerable amount of damage has been done to property.  In that case it is scarcely fair that one local authority, having suffered no damage whatever to its roads or its bridges, but having within the area of its jurisdiction a very considerable amount of damage done to buildings and so on, that they would benefit by the expenditure of such a huge sum of money and be not required by their own local necessities to levy anything extra for the repairs of roads and bridges, and so we are putting it into one fund&mdash;the Road Board Fund, and the Road Board will administer it. There is already a sum of money in that Fund; there is a sum of money due to us from the period of British control, and a small sum of money came in last year in connection with motor licence duties.  Notwithstanding the criticism of motorists and their friends, I do not believe that motorists could not even afford a heavier tax if the roads were put in better order for motor traffic.  Clause 13 deals with the Road Board Fund and everything connected with it, and I would appeal to individual members of the Dáil who may exercise a useful and considerable local influence that they would impress upon representatives of local authorities the justice of this imposition and the useful purpose that it serves not perhaps in that country spirit that is sometimes pushed to extremes, but with the idea of reorganising the road improvements of the entire country. This particular clause should afford considerable employment; it should bring home to people the necessity of killing this destructive microbe, and it should also impress upon them the fact that <Col N="1373" /> damage of this sort is a really expensive experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. SEAN MILROY Mr. SEAN MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEAN MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to range over the whole of the Bill, because I have not had time to digest it, but I would like just to make one or two allusions to Clause 6, which disallows consequential compensation.  Now, I am perfectly disinterested in this matter, because I happen to be one of that large and respectable class&mdash;the men of no property.  I have no property to lose, and therefore I do not expect to get any consequential compensation, but this Clause does seem to me to be too rigid altogether in its terms.  There will be persons who will probably claim compensation for property by which they earn their livelihood, and the destruction of which means, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, the cessation of their means of livelihood.  It would probably be satisfactory enough if the legitimate compensation due was paid immediately, but if payment of that compensation were deferred for months&mdash;as I think it is inevitably bound to be&mdash;it means that these people are deprived for that period of the means of livelihood they had before their property was destroyed.  I have no doubt that many exaggerated claims will be put in, but I think there ought to be machinery for testing whether such claims are legitimate or not. This Clause, as drafted at present, excludes both extravagant and legitimate claims, and I certainly do endorse the statement or appeal of Deputy Johnson, that some provision should be inserted by which legitimate claims&mdash;claims, the withholding of which are an injury to the individual and a consequential injury to the State&mdash;that some modification of that should be inserted in order to bring legitimate consequential damage within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has, in his statement, referred to the unfairness to the ratepayers and to the people who will be called upon to pay for this destruction, of paying large sums of money out of State funds to people who have been associated with the work of destruction. That aspect of the Bill concerns destruction which has taken place since the 11th July, 1921, and I would urge him to consider that particular provision in its application to the payment of money <Col N="1374" /> for destruction of the same kind done in pre-Truce days.  I have been told of a case where, previous to the Truce, a certain number of individuals, who are said to have been associated with the Republican Army in the fight with Britain, acquired a certain valuable property, including a big mansion.  I do not know whether they themselves and all their friends, acting together, could provide sufficient security for acquiring such a large property, but it is said&mdash;and such a thing should be inquired into&mdash; that the friends of the individuals who acquired this particular mansion were the people who destroyed the mansion itself.  If the mansion was destroyed in pre-Truce days by the orders of the Irish Republican Army, the people who sit on the Government benches should have some means of proving it.  If such an order was actually issued and carried out by the Republican Army, then the rumour which is freely circulated in that particular area must be wrong.  I would like that the ratepayers of this country should not be called upon to pay, say, £30,000 or £40,000 for destruction of a mansion when the mansion was destroyed by the people who had acquired the property for the purpose of taking money out of the ratepayers pockets under false pretences.  Therefore, I say that there should be a provision in this Bill to cover the destruction which occurred previous to, as well as since, the time of the Truce.  I would like to know generally&mdash;I think it arises out of the case cited by Deputy Johnson&mdash;what proportion, or percentage, of the amounts awarded by the Shaw Commission, or any other Commission set up since the Truce, represented legal expenses.  I am informed that in one case where the original award was £35,000, and where, on review, it was altered to £28,000, £8,000 of that amount was put down as covering legal expenses.  The President, also, in dealing with the general question of destruction, said that the Shaw Commission, to some extent, made their awards upon the basis of a rebuilding clause.  I do not consider that that covers the position which should be taken up by the Government&mdash;of being a party to very large awards being paid out of the taxpayers' pockets for destruction of buildings in pre-Truce days.</P>

    <P>There is another kind of case, which <Col N="1375" /> may be more or less of an exceptional nature, but which I think the Government should consider in relation to this question of destruction, and do anything, and everything they can, to see that the British Government carries out their part of the contract in connection with the Shaw Commission.  I refer to the cases where houses have been destroyed near a barracks by the order of General Macready as being a danger to the R.I.C. barracks or to the people or armed servants of the Government who were living in them.  I know of one particular case of that kind, where repeated applications have been made to the British authorities, and where the person whose property has been destroyed has not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgment from the British authorities.  I would like the President to look into that particular case, as I think there are a great many cases of the kind, especially in pre-Truce days.  The President has also explained the reason as to why a clause was not inserted in this Bill dealing with the destruction of railway property.  I do not know exactly the lines upon which the conference between Government and Railway Managers has proceeded, or the basis upon which claims have been put forward by the railway authorities for compensation for the destruction of railway property, but I think the Government would be well advised to appoint some one of their representatives to go very closely into the basis upon which such claims are submitted, and to protect the State as far as they possibly can from any unfair claims being submitted or paid out in connection with such matters.  I do not know, after all, if the Government would not be better advised to hold over dealing with the cases of compensation to railways until such time as the Government is in a position to come to the Dáil at a later stage and tell the Dáil and the people of the country what their policy is with regard to the railways of the country.  I merely make the suggestion to the Government to reconsider it from that point of view, and I would urge them in the case of houses deliberately destroyed by orders of General Macready, that the British Government should not deny the responsibility, and should pay the people a fair and reasonable compensation for the property that has been destroyed.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, apologised for the delay in letting it come before us.  As one realises the Bill was of a very complex nature it will in those circumstances be seen that the delay is inevitable, but I think a little further extension of that apology might have been serviceable when it is remembered that the Bill only came to us on Tuesday for consideration on Thursday, within 48 hours.  That does not allow sufficient time for its being considered. The principles of this Bill are principles of very great importance, that affect Deputies of this Dáil directly. Deputies in this Dáil, after all, are merely representative of a certain constituency, and in each constituency in Ireland to-day, cases have occured which would be covered by the provisions of this Bill in respect of persons, bodies or corporations with whom Deputies would like to consult.  I, for one, would have desired to have had an opportunity of putting this Bill before such people, and consulting with them in respect of those provisions, so that I would be in a position here, not merely of expressing the views of one on this question, but of those who in the constituency that I have the honour to represent would have supplied more material criticism.  I think that is a sound principle.  I would wish it to be observed in all cases, but in particular in cases of this kind, that so nearly affected people, who have put upon us the honour of representing them.  Reading the Bill through without any opportunity of consultation, or any opportunity of research, it seems to me&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the general principle in its drafting has been to recognise its extreme complexity, and having recognised its complexity, to put all the complex matters out of discussion by ruling them outside the provisions of the Bill.  That is the only explanation I can find in my mind for Section 6, by which consequential losses are ruled out of the application of the Bill. No other suggestion occurs to me, except the assumption that these consequential losses unquestionably will be <Col N="1377" /> of very great difficulty if they are allowed, and, therefore, the difficulty being so great, it will be better to simplify the Bill by disallowing them, and if that be the argument, it is not sufficient.  I am not in favour of Deputy Johnson's suggestion, so intriguingly put forward, with which I am familiar, and I do not think in putting forward the suggestion that he was expanding the principle of the Bill.  I think it will be maintained in the country that there are consequential losses that are claimed, and that should be allowed.  There are material losses which are as material as the loss of a building.  Deputy Johnson referred to the erection of factories, and that compensation should enable those factories to be re-equipped with their original machinery, but there are many houses that have been destroyed that are in the nature of machinery, the destruction of the houses having involved the destruction of livelihood, and there are people within my knowledge, cases on which I have asked questions here, post-Truce cases, whose livelihood has been destroyed, pending the re-establishment of the business of those houses. The facts are that some of those people are living either on past savings or loans in respect of future restoration of those houses.  If there are such cases those are losses that ought to be made good, and I urge the Ministry to consider this matter between now and the Committee Stage.  I urge them to reconsider it for this practical reason.  It would be extremely difficult for Deputies, without special, skilled legal assistance, which is not available in respect of most of us, to suggest amendments in respect of this matter that would meet the case.  If amendments of this kind are to be brought forward in Committee, then such amendments ought to be brought after passing through the hands of the legal draughtsmen.  I think it would be a good thing if this Dáil were to have available outside the Government a draughtsman, in order to make use of his services.  Without such a man it would be impossible to bring forward such amendments as those touched on by Deputies Johnson and Milroy.  Therefore this matter can only receive consideration from Government quarters, and I urge Clause 6 to be reconsidered, because I believe that the clause as it now stands <Col N="1378" /> is extremely harsh and inequitable, It may practically be that some persons will receive compensation in respect of houses or material property on a scale that would very inequitably compare with compensation received by some other persons, whose real loss has been consequential loss.  There are one or two other matters of principle, and we are now only dealing with questions of principle, to which I wish to make a brief reference.  I heard, with great attention, what the Minister had to say with regard to Clause 7.  There there are certain chattels in respect to the loss of which no compensation will be given&mdash; articles such as &ldquo;coins, Bank of Government notes, or currency of any country,&rdquo; and yet, in a later Clause, certain documents which may be lost, such as contracts and agreements in writing, are to be compensated for. Now, I take it that if a person was going to claim compensation for a contract or agreement in writing that may be lost, his mere statement of its existence will not entitle him to compensation, but that he will have to support his argument by some collateral proof.  But if he can bring that collateral proof, he will get compensation for his agreement or contract, but even though he may bring all the collateral proof in the world he will get no compensation for the loss of bank notes.  In either case the question is not that agreements are more valuable than the bank notes.  I have a number of agreements of no value whatever. I have not many bank notes, but such as I have I hope are of some value. But the question is whether the claimant can prove that such loss occurred, and if the claimant can establish that proof, the mere fact that the paper should have been bank notes or Treasury notes rather than an agreement or a contract should not disentitle him to compensation.  Another point I wish to touch on is Section 12, and I think it is a very important matter that will require attention in Committee. It says that &ldquo;when compensation has been allowed the Minister for Finance may deduct to the amount of any such compensation any debt or other sum of money due or payable by or collectable from the applicant or other person entitled to such compensation to or by the late Provisional Government of Ireland, or the Government of Saorstat <Col N="1379" /> Eireann, or any department or authority of either of those Governments.&rdquo;  I suggest that there is a very important and bad principle raised in this.  Ordinarily, if compensation were allowed and certain moneys were owing to the State, the State would institute garnishee proceedings, but in this case, without the institution of garnishee proceedings the amounts can be deducted.  Consequently the person who receives the compensation has the burden of proof thrown upon him in resisting the claims that the moneys were owed by him, and that is going to involve him in a considerable amount of argument.  One other matter I wish only to touch upon, and that is Sub-section 7 of this Clause 12.  It is already stated in that section that a certain proportion, as the Minister explained, of any compensation should be paid by the State in cash and the rest should be paid in some form of Government security.  I am glad that that question of Government security has been entered into, because I think it is very important that such Government security should be created.  But how do you create it actually under the section? It says: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may, for the purpose of the foregoing sub-section, by order create such securities, bearing such rates of interest and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption, or otherwise&rdquo;; and it goes on to say: &ldquo;Every order made by the Minister for Finance under this sub-section shall forthwith be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Now, I suggest it is not proper that the issue of Government securities of this kind should take place in quite so casual a manner as that.  These securities will be quotable securities.  They will have a definite quotation on any Stock Exchange, and I think if that is going to be the case, then any securities raised under the provisions of this Bill should be securities raised in a definite Act under very carefully considered conditions dealt with in this Dáil, and I suggest that that casual method of creating very important securities of this kind will not be beneficial either to the Government or to the eventual receivers of the compensation so created.</P>

      <P>As a representative of a local authority I took the earliest opportunity when I received the Bill of discussing it with the Legal Advisers <Col N="1380" /> of that authority, and the conclusion we have come to is that, on the whole, it is a most excellent measure from the Corporation's point of view. There are one or two things, perhaps, in which it might be possibly improved.  In Clause 10, Sub-section (3) (B) and Sub-section (4), it would be well to empower the local authority, as well as the applicant, to show reasonable cause why the full reinstatement condition should be attached to the decree.  It does not appear that any provision is intended to be made for compensation in the case of injuries to the person or the taking of life, and we think it would be desirable to put in a provision to cover these cases, in many of which the loss to the sufferer is even greater than if he lost the whole of his premises and property.  There is no mention in the Bill at all of local authorities or the part they are expected to take in investigating definite claims, nor is there any provision made for the great cost which they will have to incur if they do so seriously.  The scheme of the Bill is that all decrees shall be paid by the Ministry, and none of the same borne by the local authorities.  The local authorities, on the other hand, are to make a contribution of 6d. in the £ for five years. It is admitted that it would not be reasonable to provide for such a contribution by the local authorities, but as the matter stands the local authorities have no financial interest in seeing that the claims are substantiated, and that only a fair and reasonable amount be included in the decrees for compensation.  Consequently it would not seem as if they had some encouragement to exercise their legal rights in making elaborate investigations, and in employing experts to check the accuracy of the claims put forward.  The question may even arise as to the standing of local authorities on the hearing of claims in respect of which they will not be pecuniarily reponsible, except as taxpayers as distinct from ratepayers.  This difficulty might be removed by defining in the Bill the duties of local authorities with regard to the defence of such claims and by providing for the payment of the costs incurred by them in doing so, especially the fees and expenses which they will necessarily incur in the employment of expert valuers, assessors, solicitors and counsel.  In the absence of such a provision it is likely that many local authorities would be very slack in taking steps which <Col N="1381" /> would give them a considerable amount of trouble, and involve them in heavy expenditure. In the statement made some months ago in the Dáil it was intimated that the burthen of the investigation and the defence of the claims would be laid upon the local authorities.  If that is still the intention of the Government, it should be made clear.  I say, on the whole, the Bill is a good Bill from the local authorities' point of view, and there have been so few faults found with it, it is a tribute to those who drafted it, but I would ask the President to take note of the few remarks I have made, because they are the considered opinion of experts in local administration.</P>

      <P>I would just like to raise a few questions in regard to the roads.  The roads are the arteries through which the life-blood of the nation flows, and the prosperity of the country and the encouragement of industry and commerce depend to a large extent on their excellence. I would impress on the Ministry the great necessity of improving the roads, and in this connection I would ask the Minister who is in charge of the Bill to consider carefully, and also favourably, the straightening, widening and steam rolling of the coach roads.  This is a pretty big work, I know, but I ask for favourable consideration for it.  I can assure the Minister that the country will recognise the necessity of this very great work, and it will fully appreciate the work of the Ministry when the Government of the country carry it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WalterLeonardCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in sympathy with the suggestions made by Deputy McBride in regard to the roads, and I take the same view that he does with regard to their improvement from the point of view of the commerce of the country.  I hope it may be possible even to extend the particular reference of the Bill in that respect, and I do not know whether the Ministry have finally decided the rate of contribution from the local councils.  It seems to me that the reference, as Deputy Byrne has stated, to the share which the local authorities would be called upon to pay should be considered, but it seems to me that the proposals of the Minister for Finance are exceptionally light and favourable to the local councils.  I think, in view of the excellent proposal, it may <Col N="1382" /> be possible to borrow money for the local councils, and a rate would come very easy on the local districts, inasmuch as it would be a very useful and advisable way of getting public works and of getting great improvements and extensions and the straightening of roads undertaken by local Councils in a very much bigger way than they would do if they had not this right to borrow money.  It is noticeable to anybody who reads the discussions of local bodies in regard to roads that they are loath to raise a heavy rate for the improvement of roads, but are rather inclined to carry on and strike a rate which will just meet current expenses and keep the roads in workable order rather than go in for big improvements and put their whole county on a model system of roadmaking.  This proposal, I think, in connection with this Bill would enable them, with a very light burthen locally, to have roads such as anybody could wish to have.  In that respect I hope that the Bill will be made as far-reaching as possible, so that without heavy burthens local bodies will be able to carry out improvements in the very best way.  I hope that the road question will be looked upon from the national point of view, so that the roads can be standardised both in regard to the making, the width, the rules regulating their course and shape and direction, and practically every aspect of road-making, because undoubtedly in Ireland it is one of the things which should suggest great improvements, and which will be of untold advantage to the country.  In regard to the railways, I am altogether in line with the proposals.  I think it will be very much the best thing to do in regard to the whole railway question, to consider it as a thing apart, as a special subject, and treat it on a different basis from the other claims.  Railways are a monopoly, and not like ordinary property, and I think the more they are dealt with as a special subject to themselves the better the results will be for the country and for the interests concerned.  I think that this matter of local contributions in cities and towns, which Deputy Byrne has put before us, is one which may require further elucidation, and perhaps further proposals, in view of the liability that may devolve upon them by reason of their position, and I hope that that aspect of the case will be considered by the Government, <Col N="1383" /> and that proposals will be put before us before we reach the Committee stage, because it will affect local bodies, particularly urban bodies.</P>

      <P>Owing to the unpopularity with which Malicious Injury Bills were received in Ireland in the past, I am sure the Ministry had a great deal of trouble to reconcile their consciences and draft this one.  I think the Government is to be congratulated on the provisions of the Bill.  The most important part of the Bill, to my mind, is that part dealing with matters raised by Deputy Cole and Deputy McBride.  The roads of Ireland, as we all know, are a byeword, especially in some parts of the country where I come from.  Some of them are more like ploughed fields than roads, and unless the Government takes this matter up seriously, and takes it out of the hands of the Councils altogether in such a way as they propose, I do not believe the roads in the future will be very much better.  I do think that that particular clause ought not to be left as vague as it stands at present.  I think the Bill will commend itself to the public, but undoubtedly there will want to be some explanation in the Committee Stage or before the Bill is finally deliberated upon, because the Ministry ought to let the Dáil and the country know what they really intend to do, and what particular roads this money is to be spent on.  Will it be the County Councils will get the money, or large municipal areas? These are things the people would like to know, as, to my mind, if the County Councils are handed this money, some of the towns will be neglected, and during the past few years roads in towns have suffered very much in consequence of military traffic.  Might I say, like Mr. Johnson, that we believe the Bill is a pretty good one, but we would like a little more explanation on Clause 13.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this question with regard to roads that one of the Deputies said was vital and fundamental.  To improve the roads of the country for modern traffic there must be a radical change in the system of road-making, and now when you are going to enter into the question of large expenditure is the time to deal with it.  Modern traffic, according to the present method <Col N="1384" /> of roadmaking, would mean the bankruptcy of the country, as the ordinary macadamised system of roadmaking would not do for heavy traffic.  No matter how well a steam-rolled road is made, with the traffic now obtaining in Ireland the life of a road is 1 or 1½ years, whereas formerly the same roads lasted 5, 6, or 10 years.  I think the time will come when you must make the roads in Ireland on the English or Continental system. They met the road question in these countries in order to deal with heavy traffic and in order to get for them a reasonable life.  In Ireland that system does not obtain at all.  This is a very serious question, and the Government or engineers and men at the head of affairs in the Local Government Department should take it up, and get expert advice as to the best method of dealing with heavy traffic.  I do not know if the law dealing with heavy traffic is in force at all in Ireland.  We see a 3 or 4 ton lorry eating up the whole foundation of the road, so that I think the Government should consider the whole question when expending all this money.  With regard to Clause 6, the people I represent are probably more at a loss from consequential damages than any other section of the community.  The question is so complicated and so intricate, and to my mind lays itself so open to fraud, that I am doubtful if the Government have taken the proper attitude.  I do not know that they would be able to deal with it, so that perhaps it is better to avoid the question altogether.  The Bill, I think, will commend itself to the Dáil and have the support of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the expenditure of money raised under this Act for roads, that money will not in any case be expended on ordinary maintenance. It will be expended for special repairs and improvements.  The Road Fund can at present be used in such a way as to include ordinary maintenance, but the policy that has been adopted has been that it should not be so used, but should be used for special improvements.  Now, there is no doubt at all but the roads of this country are in a very bad way, apart altogether from the special damage that has been done lately.  The roads have been going down the hill for a number of years past, and if there is what we might expect to be a normal development of <Col N="1385" /> heavy motor traffic, within a reasonable period the roads will be entirely cut to pieces.  It is necessary very large sums should be expended in order to make the roads fit for heavy traffic.  There are parts of the country where it is probable that nothing but ferro concrete foundations would do the job.  If that is to be done anywhere, to prevent the roads sinking into the bog, as they have done in places, it means very heavy expenditure indeed, greater expenditure even than would be provided by Clause 13.  Some members propose to found a new and drastic road policy on that clause, but they are hardly allowing for the very heavy expenditure that would be required for the sort of policy that is suggested.  Certainly there would be no possibility of carrying out the improvements that are really necessary in the immediate future, except on the roads that are definitely artery roads. In regard to the other matter that has been discussed, that of consequential damages, one of the reasons that consequential damages have been left out of the Bill has been for the same reason as that for which the question of compensation for loss of coin and bank notes was left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequential damages very frequently are merely problematical losses; even where there is a real consequential loss, the amount certainly will always be highly problematical, or nearly always. To include provision for consequential losses in the Bill would open the gates for a flow of fraudulent claims.  Then, even when no fraud was very definitely intended, the State would be mulcted if we admitted the principle of paying for consequential losses, because of the impossibility of calculating surely.  If a shop is burned and we admit consequential losses, we would have beautiful tables prepared showing the amount of the losses the shopkeeper had suffered, though it may be that during the same period his neighbour who was not burned out had suffered loss just as great as that shown in the tables.  The table may be prepared in fairly good faith, but still it would mean, if it were admitted, and the calculations accepted, that the State was being obliged to pay an applicant for losses that he probably would have sustained if his premises never had been burned.  Then, again, if you once come to deal with the question of consequential <Col N="1386" /> losses, there is no logical reason at all for confining the payment of the consequential losses to the owner of the property. It may not be, and it frequently is, not only the owner of the property who is deprived of his means of livelihood by that destruction. Others who have no proprietorial interest at all in the property may be just as much deprived of their means of livelihood as the owner, and on logical grounds they can just as well claim compensation for consequential losses as the owner.  There, again, you would open the gate very wide indeed.  I think that if we admitted the principle of compensation for consequential losses you would find this country trying to live by that rather exploded method, or something parallel to the exploded method, of gaining a livelihood by taking in each other's washing.  Everybody would claim consequential losses&mdash; everybody nearly could claim consequential losses&mdash;and the people who were claiming would have to pay.  There is no inconsistency such as Deputy Figgis thought he had found when he talked about the question of coin and the question of contracts in the Bill.  The compensation that will be paid for agreement and contracts destroyed will be the amount that will be necessary to do the copying and the research and the investigation required to have those replaced, so that they are on an entirely different plane from coin or bank notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, if I am permitted, to just say on this point that the gravamen of my argument was that absolute proof would have to be brought, in the case of such contracts, in which case some compensation would issue.  If equal proof could be given in respect of paper money, paper worth money in some other form, why is it not just that compensation should issue there also, assuming that the proof were equal in each case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue the matter at any great length at this stage, but there is no parallel.  A contract may deal with a matter of £50,000, and the cost of having to replace it may only be £1.  If notes alleged to be burned amounted to £50,000, the matter would be very serious.  I think no Deputy, except Deputy Figgis, has challenged the decision of the Government to follow the lines adopted by insurance companies, <Col N="1387" /> for instance, to refuse to entertain any question of losses sustained by the burning or destruction of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterJWard" hpid="Mr. JOSEPH WARD Mr. JOSEPH WARD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOSEPH WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points in regard to this Bill I would like to have made clear by the Minister. Alderman Byrne touched upon one point; that is, injuries to the person.  I have not had much time to consider the Bill.  No malicious injury claims will be allowed in respect of injuries to the person. Claims have already been lodged with most of the local authorities by relatives of soldiers shot in ambushes, and also in respect of persons who were shot accidentally by soldiers, and where persons were shot by Irregulars, accidentally or otherwise.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that it is very hard upon those people, who have in some instances lost the head of the household, that they should be deprived of compensation.  There should be some method of compensating them for the losses they have suffered.  I know of instances where the fathers of families have been lost, leaving widows and families of six, seven and eight without any support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point with regard to the Bill that I should like to have made clear.  The Bill covers all cases from the 11th July, 1921, where damage has been done.  A number of claims have been lodged with local authorities for damage caused by the orders of the Second Dáil. That particularly applies to the case of the Belfast boycott, where goods were destroyed at stations because they had been ordered from Belfast in defiance of the orders of the then Government.  I would like the Minister to state whether those cases will also come under this Act, and whether compensation will be payable in respect of those cases.  I only received this Bill to-day, and until one sees the sections of previous Malicious Injuries Acts which have been repealed, one cannot see how this Bill stands.  The point is that in previous Malicious Injury Acts where damage occurred within one mile of the border line of a county, claims were lodged in either of the two counties, and, as a general rule, both counties were sued, the claims being lodged with both County Councils.  There are a number of cases at the present time pending in the Six-County area where councils in the Twenty-six Counties have been cited as <Col N="1388" /> respondents, and I think some attempt should be made in the Bill to settle that point definitely.  I do not believe that if a judge in the Six Counties allowed a decree to go against a county outside the border line, it would be collected.  But some provision should be made in the Bill with regard to it.  With regard to the local authorities, I think the only persons who can really defend these claims are the local authorities, because they are on the spot.  They have all the local evidence dealing with these claims, and I do not think that the State having taken upon itself responsibility of paying claims, that the local authorities will raise any question about defending the claim.  In any event they have an interest in defending the claim because, whether these claims are paid in rates or paid by the State, they will have to be paid by the ratepayers in some form of taxation or other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is my duty to point out that the delay in introducing this Bill is not the fault of the Law Adviser or of any particular pressure of work that he had.  The main things which held up the Bill were questions of policy and the particular methods of distributing the burthen, such as are indicated by Clause 13.  It is right that I should myself accept the responsibility for the delay.  Now, &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo; has been dealt with by many of the speakers, and some criticism is made of the Bill by reason of the fact that consequential loss is being excluded.  I think the Dáil will realise that the Minister for Finance has not, and had not, a free hand in dealing with this Bill.  There are limitations which everybody knows and must appreciate&mdash;the limitations of our ability to bear this burthen.  It is a very heavy burthen, and sooner or later it will come home to every Deputy in the Dáil, and to most of the public outside the Dáil, that in shouldering the burthen we have shouldered within the four corners of this Bill, the country is certainly taking on as much as it can bear.  That is fundamentally the case against compensation for consequential loss.  The point mentioned by Deputy Johnson in connection with reconstruction of plant and building I will take note of.  It is a very good point, I think.  As is quite natural in reading over Bills of this sort, one <Col N="1389" /> loses sight of some of the provisions.  I do not know whether this is in it or not, but I will see that the matter gets very careful consideration.  Deputy Davin mentioned, I think, about legal expenses.  It is rather a surprise to me to learn that £8,000 of legal expenses should have been incurred in a case in which £28,000 was awarded.  I do not know.  This is the first time I have heard that, and I will make enquiries about it.  As regards the second case, mentioned by Deputy Davin, I think I know the case he has in mind.  The sum awarded in that case was, I think, £28,000, and we are alive to the seriousness of the situation.  I have asked already for information about destruction of houses by military, and I will look into that.  Now, I come to the duties of local authorities.  As Deputy Ward has said, this Bill deals with a very large sum of money which the tax-paper will have to pay, and most, if not every single one of the ratepayers or residents in the area of each local authority, are tax-payers. I do not know, having regard to the enormous sum involved, if it is fair for local authorities to ask for any contribution in respect of the expenses they will be put to in respect of this particular Bill.  One Deputy, whom I know very well for many years, urged that side of the case.  I would ask that the Government side of the case be considered by the particular local authority that that gentleman represents&mdash;the huge sum of money we gave that local authority for housing, the big sum of money that particular local authority will get by reason of the damage done, and the fact that that particular local authority benefits more largely than any other from the presence of Government institutions within its area.  Certainly there ought to be consideration for those matters.  The Government purse is very slim, and that particular local authority is not in a bad financial position.  I know that because I have some experience of its work and some responsibility for that particular local authority having a very good purse at the present moment.  The sooner every single person in the country realises that the country is his as much as it is the Government's, and that the good work of the country is his concern, just as much as it is that of any other person, civil servant or soldier, or officer or member of this Dáil&mdash;the sooner there <Col N="1390" /> is some real appreciation of all our difficulties, the more beneficial will be the effect on the country.  We are in this position now, that this Dáil is so popularly constituted that the one enemy of the people in the Dáil is the Minister for Finance.  He must be.  He has to stand out against claims coming in, and suggestions coming from different sides of the Dáil that this person has suffered, that that person must be compensated, and that that local authority must get something else, and that we require the development of industry and commerce and fisheries, and other things in every part of the country.  There is only one fund, and the feeding of that fund is limited, and any distribution that takes place is a distribution for which each and every one of the Deputies here is as responsible as the Minister for Finance.  That is the one real limitation there was in bringing forward this Bill.  With regard to the Road Fund, I calculated by a rough and ready method that the sum of money which this particular imposition on local authorities will amount to in five years will be a million and a quarter, and I estimate that the whole of the resources of the Road Board Fund for the next five years&mdash;bearing in mind what sum of money there is to credit at the present moment&mdash;will make up the balance of three millions of money that there would be available in that fund during the whole of the five years.  The one infirmity there is in this proposed enactment is that local authorities may say, &ldquo;Oh, this is a new source of income, and we need not assess as much money for repair of roads as we did last year.&rdquo;  I hope Deputies in the Dáil who may be in touch with members of local authorities, or who are members of local authorities, will impress upon those bodies that the ordinary normal expenditure that would be incurred by them if this Act had not been passed should be incurred in order that a real improvement will be effected, and that they will not be looking to the revenue made available by reason of this particular clause or the ordinary income of the Road Fund to carry out their particular work. In other words we want honest appreciation of this Bill and of the particular section of it which deals with local authority.  Now some criticism has been given of the repealing of the Acts of 1919 and 1920.  I think that most of the members of the Dáil who have <Col N="1391" /> had a close and intimate knowledge of Local Government for the last two years will realise that the two Acts of 1919 and 1920 were the real cause of the downfall of the Local Government Board administration at the Custom House. It was because of this huge imposition that an alien Government imposed upon local authorities and which local authorities resented and repudiated and would not accept liability for&mdash;that is, soldiers, police, magistrates and other persons who were injured or killed were a charge upon the funds of those local authorities&mdash;that was really the cause of the fight between the Local Government of Dáil Eireann and the Local Government Board administered under the British Government.  Those Acts were unpopular.  The people never subscribed to them.  They never admitted their legality or morality, and it is right that now having for so long taken that view, and since it has been generously subscribed to by the people, that those Acts should be repealed and we propose to repeal them in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, a tribunal would be set up which would deal with compensation to persons who ordinarily would have claimed under personal injuries or in certain cases their relatives or their next-of-kin would have claimed.  For dealing with other personal injury cases it is proposed at once to set up a tribunal which will deal with cases for which the British Government does not accept liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of the thing is what we are now once and for all finally determining, that is, that no such compensation will be admitted in future.  We are taking away that.  I do not know whether the fact that such compensation would be payable has to any extent been responsible for the very poor estimation of certain people of the value of human life.  It is possible that if it were generally known that there would be no compensation in respect of the person whose life was taken in such a crisis as we have been passing through for the last ten or twelve months or more that certain people would hesitate before taking away life.  You often hear the saying, &ldquo;Well, they will be well compensated.&rdquo; That certainly produced a callousness that was not here previous <Col N="1392" /> to the passing of the Act of 1919 and 1920.  It is a matter upon which the Dáil may exercise its discretion.  That is my view and that of the Government, and it has been generally accepted by the country that those two Acts were punitive and distasteful and there was no real support behind them.  I think that deals with the points that were raised.  I do not know whether I have missed any of them.  If there are any other points I have not dealt with perhaps some Deputy would remind me of them.</P>
    <P>The real point I should have stressed was that this special tribunal is proposed to be set up over the whole of the country.  Where there are 26 or 27 County Court Judges it is quite possible that the same case or a parallel one in counties far part would get different treatment from different County Court Judges.  That is the reason we are proposing this special tribunal so that no person affected would have any cause of complaint or any reason to say that if he lived in such and such county he would have got better treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not necessary that any of the Clauses of the Bill should be re-committed.  Most of the amendments in the paper are put down in consequence of undertakings given during the Committee stage.  Only amendments to the Bill itself are on the paper to-day, so that the report stage cannot finish to-day, and will have to go over to to-morrow.  I now move the first amendment which is in Sub-section 2 (b) of Section 1, to delete all from the word &ldquo;for,&rdquo; line 29, to the word <Col N="1395" />&ldquo;others,&rdquo; line 32 inclusive, and to substitute the words &ldquo;Business premises.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 2, in Section 1, Sub-section 2 (c), line 37, to insert the word &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; before &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; and to add after &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; the words &ldquo;Or if a woman obtained a non-foundation scholarship.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical matter concerning the University of Dublin, but the Dáil may fairly ask that I should explain that technicality so that all can understand it.  There are two points, one is that the words as standing in the Bill are indefinite because there are various scholarships in the University of Dublin.  From the date of the Charter there was one special kind of scholarship established which gave the holders of the scholarships the privilege of becoming members of the Corporation of the College&mdash;that is the Corporation of the Provost, Fellows and Scholars, and as they were members of the Corporation they were called foundation scholars.  These were the words chosen by the Minister so that he accepted the principle of the words I am proposing here.  I wish to put the word &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; before &ldquo;scholarship,&rdquo; so that only those who obtain our principal scholarships or foundation-scholarships would be entitled to the Parliamentary vote.  We have various other scholarships which do not entitle those holding them to the Parliamentary vote, but all I ask is that those who have in the past been entitled to vote should be able to get their vote in the future.  There is a second point which involves a principle which the Dáil has already sanctioned, and that is that we should not impose any disability upon women.  Some twenty-five years ago when we opened scholarships to women there was the difficulty that if they obtained foundation scholarships they would have the right to the Parliamentary vote, to which women were then not entitled by the law of the land.  And, further, they would have the right to rooms and Commons in the College which was inconvenient, and therefore the University set up scholarships to be awarded for the same examinations and for the same literary qualifications which they called <Col N="1396" /> non-foundation scholarships, because they were eligible only for women. If a woman obtains a non-foundation scholarship she is as qualified by her scholarship and her literary and scientific attainments as a man is, and I take it, therefore, that there will be no objection to this amendment which means that if a man gets a particular scholarship, a foundation scholarship, he gets the Parliamentary vote, and if a woman gets a non-foundation scholarship she will also get the Parliamentary vote.</P>

      <P>Will not that carry with it in equity that scholars in the National University should be entitled to the vote?  Will it be sufficient to answer that this is the perpetuation of the historical arrangement that scholars in the Dublin University always formed part of the electorate?  It seemed to me before the Minister accepted the amendment that the only way out was instead of creating an inequality between the Universities inasmuch as women scholars were debarred from election privileges, the remedy would be to confine the privilege of the vote to graduates in the Dublin University as it is confined in the National University.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The expression &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; in this section means, land, buildings, or other premises occupied for the purpose of the business, profession or trade, of the person to be registered, of the rateable value of not <Col N="1397" /> less than ten pounds, and includes part of a house or other building.</P>
    <P>Where any such business premises are not separately valued the rateable value shall be deemed to be the amount which would, in the opinion of the registration officer, be the rateable value if they were separately valued.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where business premises are in the joint occupation of two or more persons, each of the joint occupiers shall, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as occupying the premises, subject as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The aggregate value of the business premises must be not less than the amount produced by multiplying ten pounds by the number of joint occupiers, and</P>
    <P>(b)  Not more than two joint occupiers shall be entitled to be registered in respect of the same business premises, unless they are <i>bona fide</i> engaged as partners, carrying on their profession, trade or business on the business premises.</P>

      <P>On the Section as a whole I just want to speak <Col N="1398" /> on Sub-Section 6.  The Minister, on the Committee stage, promised to consider some alternative phraseology to the terms &ldquo;similar institution,&rdquo; but no amendment has been tabled and therefore I presume he has not been able to find any satisfactory alternative description. It seems to me to be unfortunate to have so loose a description as &ldquo;any other similar institution,&rdquo; such as a lunatic asylum, prison, poor-house.  It was pointed out in Committee that there were institutions which some might consider similar to a poor-house and others which would be by no means similar. That loose phrase gives opportunity for a good deal of doubt, and perhaps legal controversy, and I would again ask the Minister whether it is possible to find another phrase which would be better.</P>

      <P>(2)  The first register to be prepared under the Act for each University constituency shall be a register of electors who were qualified on the 15th day of October, 1922, and shall come into force on the 1st day of June, 1923, or on such later date as the Minister for Local Government may fix by Order.</P>
      <P>Each subsequent register shall be a register of electors who were qualified on the 15th day of November, and shall come into force on the next following 15th day of June.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister for Local Government may from time to time make such alterations in the Rules contained in the Second Schedule to this Act as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying this Act into full effect, or for carrying into effect any Act for the time being in force amending or affecting this Act.</P>
      <P>This is a substitute for Sub-section 2 of Section 15 dealing with University constituencies. There is power to make alteration under the rules on Schedule 2 if it should prove necessary.  There is a provision whereby the Post Office authorities will assist the University authorities in the revision of University registers.  There may be further rules necessary to secure that revision is carried out satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move the following <Col N="1401" /> Amendments 14, 15 and 16 (Section 16):&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (2), line 22, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister for Home Affairs,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (8), line 49, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister for Home Affairs&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (8), lines 54 and 55, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister for Home Affairs,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;Governor-General of the Irish Free State on the advice of the Executive Council,&rdquo; and in lines 57 and 58 to delete the words, &ldquo;as the Minister for Home Affairs may direct and subject to any conditions which he may impose,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words, &ldquo;and subject to such conditions as the Governor-General of the Irish Free State on the advice aforesaid shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with one matter.  It was provided in Sub-section (2), that the Minister for Home Affairs might decide the distribution of work between County Court Judges.  I accepted the amendment from Deputy Johnson, that the chief Justice of the Supreme Court should be substituted for the Minister for Home Affairs.  There is a consequential amendment in Sub-section 8 of the same section, which provides that instead of the Minister for Home Affairs determining that assistance is necessary and appointing an assistant, the Chief Justice shall find if assistance is necessary, and in accordance with the Constitution, the Assistant Judge shall be appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I doubt if this amendment is in the direction of conciseness.  It is to delete Sub-section 1 and substitute a new sub-section.  I think I raised the point before.  The use of the term &ldquo;according to the principle of Proportional Representation&rdquo; is rather overstressed and used in such a way as to become unwieldy, unless we say, following a recent example, that by using it in this way it comes to have a new meaning.  I think &ldquo;the method of the single transferable vote&rdquo; would be better than &ldquo;the principle of Proportional Representation&rdquo; when you are dealing with an election of two or three members, particularly if there are only two or one to be elected.  The deletion of Sub-section 3, and saying all elections shall be conducted according to these rules, seems to me better than the proposed amendment.</P>

I think the wording might simply lay that down and make every election on the single transferable vote, except where there are more than two candidates.</P>

      <P>This is a matter I have not very strong views on.  One reason for keeping in the phrase &ldquo;according to <Col N="1403" /> the principle of Proportional Representation&rdquo; is that it was the phrase adopted by us when we were getting through the Constitution, and we know the meaning of it.  With regard to what Deputy Figgis says about leaving out the words &ldquo;when there are more than two candidates,&rdquo; that is a matter perhaps we could agree to.  The votes, I suppose, are transferable under this, although when there are only two candidates no transfer can take place.  Sub-section 3 is deleted as the matter in it is covered under Section 24, so that it was redundant. I propose to accept Deputy Figgis's suggestion and leave out &ldquo;when there are more than two candidates for election.&rdquo;</P>

The Government was unable to accept that amendment.  We felt that £50 was not an adequate amount to prevent frivolous contests. We think on the other hand that we can safely go the length of meeting him half way, which is the object of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 20&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section (4), to delete all from the word &lsquo;in,&rsquo; line 51, to the word &lsquo;such,&rsquo; line 55, inclusive, and to substitute &lsquo;one-third of the quota as ascertained in accordance with the rules contained in the Third Schedule of this Act, and in such case the.&rdquo;  This question was discussed in a sketchy way when the Bill was before the Dáil on the Committee stage.  It is necessary to change from one-eighth of the total number of votes cast to one-eighth of the total credited under the rules.  The last election for County Cavan illustrated the necessity for that change very clearly.  In the Cavan election the quota <Col N="1404" /> was 6,030.  Deputy Milroy, who was elected, on the first count I think only got 534 votes, and he was elected ultimately by a somewhat narrow margin. If instead of being elected by a narrow margin he had been defeated by the narrowest of margins he would not be eligible to have his £150 returned although it was quite clear that his candidature was not a freak candidature or a frivolous candidature.  It was clear therefore that we have to change the proportion of the total of the first preferences&mdash;the proportion of the total votes credited.  Then there came the question of what the proportion should be.  One-fourth of the quota would have been about the equivalent of one-eighth of the total votes polled.  Of course you do not get a constant figure when you take a proportion of the quota, but if you have regard to the case of where there is only one vacancy the quota is approximately one-half of the total votes polled, so that one-fourth of the quota is the same in that particular case as one-eighth of the total votes polled.  As I say although the figure would not be constant still one-fourth of the quota would be roughly equivalent to one-eighth of the total votes polled.  It was felt however that that was too low a figure, that practically nobody would ever forfeit a deposit under those rules, that people who went forward having no chance of being elected and yet took it upon themselves to put the State to the expense of a contested election would get off.  It was thought, therefore, better to raise the figure somewhat, and consequently in the amendment it is provided that the total votes credited shall be one-third of the quota. I think it is not a drastic amendment upwards. Nobody can deny that the previous figure was somewhat low.  In fact, even when there was only a single member constituency it was somewhat low, and when we had Proportional Representation it certainly worked out very low indeed.</P>

      <P>One does not want to be factitious in a matter of this kind, but this is really a matter of some importance, because this question was considered by us in Committee and in Committee a certain agreement was come to.  It is now proposed on the Report to change the agreement come <Col N="1405" /> to in Committee.  In other words we are going to report something that did not occur, or we are going to misreport something that did occur.  I think that the agreement come to was more desirable than the change which is proposed now. I will not press any point of order, but I seriously suggest that it is not in order to move this in the form in which it is now being moved inasmuch as this is a definite change from something that was definitely agreed upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I understand there was raised yesterday the question as to whether the particulars <Col N="1406" /> given in the Press with regard to Ballyconnell were correct, and, if so, what is the explanation of it.  Also, the general question as to the Defence forces of the country as relating to the function of defence.  As far as Ballyconnell is concerned the Press reports are substantially correct.  The official report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On morning of 5th instant, at 7 a.m. a party of about 50 Irregulars, fully armed and with three machine guns, entered Ballyconnell.  On entering the town the Irregulars broke into Richardson and Owens' grocery establishment, where an assistant, Wm. Ryan, Kilbracken, Belturbet, was taken out of bed and shot dead. One of the proprietors, Wm. Owens, was badly wounded, his thigh being broken.  The house of John Drum was next entered and John McGrath, an Irish teacher, was mortally wounded. Quantities of goods were also taken away out of these shops.  The motor premises of Thomas Dolphin were blown up and then completely burned. Two Ford cars were taken away.  The Post Office was also raided and the instruments smashed.  The Irregulars fired several shots through the town and consequently broke windows in several establishments, including the bank.  A train was held up outside the town and a couple of shots fired at it.  The Irregulars remained in the town about 35 minutes and then left. They travelled in touring cars, and apparently went back to the Arigna Mountains, where they have hidden for several months.  Our troops in Belturbet got word of the raid, and immediately set out in all their transport. They were joined en route by two Fords of troops from Cavan, and all proceeded to Ballyconnell, where they arrived shortly after 9 o'clock. They followed the Irregulars past Ballinamore, but failed to get in touch with them.  This raid was evidently a reprisal for the shooting of a looter named Cull about a month ago.  He and others were raiding in Ballyconnell when a couple of officers who were in the area got in touch with them. This gang of Irregulars have been in the mountains for several months past.  The recent Ballinamore and Blacklion raids were their work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the detail of the matter, as far <Col N="1407" /> as I have been able to get it up to the present. The reasons why it is possible for a body as large as 50 Irregulars to be concentrated in that area there are partially geographical, partially because of our organisation in that area, and they are partially political, although not political in the sense that I understand was suggested yesterday.  Anybody who knows the hinterland of mountains lying behind Ballinamore and Ballyconnell will understand that for the work we have to do in that area we have not sufficient troops effectively to control those mountains and to get that band of Irregulars that we know have been hiding there for some time.  On the organisation point of view, these mountains mark a point of convergence on a number of our areas.  On the political side, it has been possible for these men to be in that position because some of our men in that area, not undertaking to believe that those men were as black as their present deeds have painted them, have, contrary to orders and contrary to the spirit of discipline in the Army, been carrying on a sort of negotiations with them, mar-eadh!&mdash;they were going to settle down and go home and do no damage to anybody again.  Those types of interchanges between men who are soldiers and men who are of this particular type are bound to have a very bad effect, not alone on the soldiers themselves, but on the whole of the people in that particular area, and negotiations of that kind have had a bad effect on that area, and have prevented action being taken against those Irregulars when it might have been taken, simply because, just like other people who are not soldiers, they refused to believe these people were as black as they are.  Steps have been taken to secure, as far as it is possible to do so, that an occurrence like this will not take place in that particular area again.  Reference was also made in the Seanad yesterday to Nenagh, and the burning of the workhouse there and the inferred general incompetence of the Army.  I have not been able to get satisfactory information up to the present with regard to Nenagh, but I got this wire from the General Officer Commanding in Limerick.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Newspaper report of Nenagh burning grossly exaggerated.  Night patrol <Col N="1408" /> on in Nenagh each night.  Patrol did not see any fire until time of leaving off duty at 3.30 a.m.  The first notice of fire was by guard at barracks about 5 a.m.  Troops were rushed to the scene at once, and under great difficulties and shortage of water succeeded in saving the important part of the workhouse.  The workhouse is over half a mile from town, and was the last place a burning was anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Actions such as the burning of the workhouse at Nenagh, portion of which was used as an infirmary and portion for housing the poor, and actions such as took place at Ballyconnell disclose a particular type of madness in the country that the country and the Government, if they face the fact of what a dangerous type of madness it is, cannot hope to cope with by an Army of 35,000 men.  I do not want to be brought into the position, just at the present moment, of defending the incompetence, or otherwise, of the Army, but we are asked to face facts, and if we do face the fact that there is this particular type of madness amongst a section of the people in the country who are armed, who are supported in their madness by feeling that they are following an ideal and by gathering to themselves all the phrases and all the words that have supported our national struggle in the past, you cannot hope, from the Army point of view, to deal with them with 35,000 men.  And I believe you cannot hope to deal with them if you have the particular type of expressions of sympathy and the particular type of help that is fairly generously being bestowed upon them from the general public&mdash;or sections of it at any rate&mdash;and particularly from the sections of the general public who are only too glad to point out the inefficiencies, and what they call the incompetencies, of the Army.  You can only meet that madness and that destruction that is there by realising that it is there and by realising that if we catch any of those men who came into Ballyconnell the other day and if we deal with them in the way in which this Government has decided to deal with them&mdash;that is by charging them with the offence, and if they are found guilty of it, by executing them&mdash;you cannot hope to succeed against it if you are going to have public expressions of sympathy <Col N="1409" /> with them, and if you are going to have the policy of the Government thoughtlessly decried, without any alternative being put forward to replace it, and if you have a feeling in the minds of the people such as makes it possible for public representatives to vote away public money for the support of these men or for the support of the people who are in any way depending on them.  There has been a lag in the development of this madness and a much bigger lag on the part of the people in realising its dangers and the great extent of it, and men are at the present moment supporting this madness who never thought they ever would and men are at the present moment speaking kindly of the authors of it who never thought they ever would. And in facing the fact squarely, and it has to be done, you have to cut away from the people who are guilty of this the people who have been thoughtlessly supporting them, or the people who have been thoughtlessly aiding or sympathising with them.  I am happy to say, although it is nervously happy&mdash;because people cannot think straight and cannot see straight, and cannot act straight in a very large number of cases, and among very large sections of the people at the present time&mdash;there are evidences that people who entered the struggle and people who sympathised with the struggle are facing the fact that the acts which took place, such as at Nenagh and Ballyconnell, are madness which will destroy the country, and they are, I feel, drawing back from that, and showing that they have moral courage enough and strength enough even to repudiate it.  With the samples we have had for the last week or two, it is up to them, and it is up to the Government, and it is up to the Army to face the thing squarely and to say that if it is to be dealt with it is to be dealt with, and it is to be dealt with by methods that must be strong and vigorous and untrammelled by useless and unhelpful criticisms.  Many of the people, I say, who have supported this, and who very largely have been responsible for the creation of the condition of affairs in which this is possible, draw back now from it, and the Government finds itself in the position that it must establish for all time in the minds of the people among whom such a state of affairs as the present is possible, the sense and the ideal of Government. <Col N="1410" /> There is one thing that we cannot admit at the present time.  We cannot admit that any section of the people can arm themselves for any particular reason, uncontrolled by the Government, and hold arms to be turned against the representative Government in this country.  If there are people who are drawing back from the present destruction, and realising what it means, realising what has been their part in bringing this particular state of affairs about, if they consider and think clearly they must realise that we make our watchword in this particular struggle that arms must be controlled by the Government and that we cannot tolerate that any section of the people shall hold arms against the Government. If they want to think straight and see straight they must see that there is no getting away for any Government, no matter how well disposed it may be, from that principle.  We cannot dissociate from those people who acted in Ballyconnell and who acted in Sligo and who are acting and destroying houses around the city any group or any party that is in arms against the Government and we do not intend to do it. We do not intend to be dragged aside from our line of policy or from that particular principle by criticism of any kind or by charges of any kind.  We may have those faults in our organisation and in our administration that are ascribed to us, but surely no thinking person, knowing what the last eight months have been, will let themselves go in destructive criticism because of a weakness here and a weakness there, considering the chaotic state of June and July last that we have so successfully emerged from.  To-day we find ourselves faced with nothing but the bomb and the mine and the torch and the petrol can.  Surely anybody must know that there are hundreds of towns in Ireland like Ballyconnell, and there are hundreds of buildings in Ireland like Nenagh Workhouse, and that you cannot have a detachment of the Army in every small town in the country, and that you cannot have in any town like Nenagh or any town like Dublin an army that will see into every nook and crevice and cellar in every house.  We, from the Army point of view, are working, if I might say it, in the subsoil where true growth comes from and <Col N="1411" /> where we are away from the fluctuations of temperature which find themselves so very much in the Press and in conversation and very often in this Dáil.  We are perfectly aware of the necessity for being on the alert, and of the necessity for preventing that it shall be possible for a group of men to act as the Irregulars from the Arigna Mountains acted at Ballyconnell.  We thoroughly sympathise with Deputies here who realise what terrible things these are, and what a terrible thing it is to have a quiet country town walked into in the morning and to have its inhabitants pulled out and murdered in the streets and to have shops looted and robbed, but on the other hand realise that there is this madness about you and realise that it has to be faced squarely, and that you cannot allow anybody to have a finger in the pie and receive sympathy simply because he professes nationality of a particular type or an ideal of a particular type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. THOS. JOHNSON Mr. THOS. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOS. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, not to his discredit, adopted the method in this discussion of replying to a case which has not been made, and thereby trying to turn the flank of the criticism.  He has taken the line of replying to an assumed criticism which I am sure Deputy Milroy did not intend to make, that there should not be this thing done or that thing done to the Irregulars' forces because of their ideals, and because of this or that or the other. He has replied to Deputy Milroy's challenge just as he would have replied to the challenge we might have made to-day, yesterday, or six months ago; but I think the Minister has misunderstood the line of question rather than criticism. The question was raised yesterday by Deputy Milroy, and following upon his statement other comments were made, not with a view to calling for leniency or asking for sympathy or trying to evoke clemency, but to get some kind of explanation from the Minister in charge of the defence of the country as to why the defence was proving ineffective.  The text was Ballyconnell, but that was only the text; and while one can quite well recognise the difficulties, the impossibility, perhaps, of defending an isolated town like Ballyconnell, it is simply because Ballyconnell was the climax of a <Col N="1412" /> long series in all parts of the country of acts which seem to disprove the claim of the Minister that the chaotic state of June and July last has been successfully emerged from.  But there is more chaos to-day than there was in June or July last.  That is the criticism that the Minister has not met, and that the country would like him to have met.  A few days ago we had an exceedingly happy example of what might be called Mark Tapleyism from the President when he asked us to look around and see how many buildings still remain in the country and how many people are still alive. O'Connell Street&mdash;well, look at it! There are quite a number of buildings still there, and that is a matter to rejoice over.  The Minister for Defence takes the same line.  He says: How much more might have been done; and because those much greater evils have not happened, let us rejoice.  Now, that is a very happy frame of mind, and I do not think it is habitual with the Minister; but really the Dáil and the country would like some evidence in justification of that happy frame of mind.  I do not think the Minister is reasonable in suggesting that there has been a lot of useless and unhelpful criticism.  I think I said before, and I say it again, that I do not believe he could find in the history of any country or any Government so much restraint of criticism of the Government in the circumstances of the last few months. It is somewhat ungracious, I think, and it is certainly not in keeping with his general bearing, to charge the Dáil or any section of it with having indulged in unhelpful and useless criticism.  Possibly if there had been abler and keener criticism it would have been better for the Ministry and better for the country. It is suggested that critics ought to provide suggestions for an alternative policy to that which is being followed.  I think it would be unwise for any critic to offer, with any confidence and with a sense of responsibility, an alternative policy, unless he were in possession of many more facts, very much fuller information, about the state of the country, the Army, and the military situation generally, than the Government allows us to come into possession of.  It would be tolly indeed to make suggestions of an alternative policy unless we were given an opportunity to know very <Col N="1413" /> much more of the facts of the situation than is allowed to come to us.  We cannot but respect the suggestion that has been made by the Minister that he should not be pressed to make a general statement.  I am sure he has good reasons for that request; but it has been made rather frequently and for quite a considerable time, and I hope that not long hence we shall be given a full and frank statement of the whole of the facts relating to the present position in the country, including the general Army policy, and the proposal for meeting the acknowledged inefficiencies&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;in the Army. There was one remark of the Minister that calls for some comment.  He referred to the debate that took place yesterday in the Seanad, and references to the support of dependents of prisoners. I want to make my own position and the position of my colleagues clear on that matter.  The Minister speaks of public money being provided for the support of these men, indicating men who have been engaged in arms and actively supporting those in arms against the Government.  That is not the case at all.  No one that I know of has made any claim of that kind.  The Minister, though, asked us to assume that these men and all other men who are in custody are guilty of being in possession of arms, or engaged in activity of one kind or another against the Government of the country, which is a very different thing indeed.  The Minister wants us to assume their guilt because they are imprisoned. That is not sufficient evidence of a man's guilt in these days, and there has been no suggestion made from the Ministerial Benches that the men in question are any more guilty than any other person who is in the custody of the military authorities to-day, many of whom, I have no doubt, whatever their sympathies may have been&mdash;and political opinions are not yet banned&mdash; have certainly not given any positive assistance to the campaign against the Government.  The Minister laid it down that there was a principle which must be adhered to, that arms were only to be held in the country by people who had the consent of the Government to hold those arms.  I once held that view, which was perhaps modified to some extent by the advocacy of men whom Ministers generally followed, and I am <Col N="1414" /> inclined to think that on the whole, taking a full view of both sides, that the advocacy of those men was the right one.  I will ask the Minister to consider whether this is the essential principle, the ultimate unbreakable principle, that he has in mind, or whether he should not alter it to this: that there should be no other than one Executive authority in the country trying to carry out the functions of Government.  That is, I contend, an absolutely irrevocable principle to be adopted by any people who want to live in amity.  It is quite impossible to have for any lengthened period two Governments in the same area, each trying to function with the sanction of force.  But that is not quite the same thing as saying that every citizen of that country must be deprived of his arms except with the formal consent of the Government, and I make bold to say, if it is the intention of the Government, without any modification, to stand by that particular doctrine, it will be impossible to enforce, and I question whether it will be essentially desirable to enforce.</P>

      <P>I was not particularly anxious to speak, and I do not think I would have spoken but for certain constructions put upon my remarks by Deputy Johnson.  He spoke of Deputy Milroy's challenge to the Government. I had no intention of challenging the Government; I had no intention of trying to lift the slightest edge of the veil of necessary obscurity that shrouds the Army organisation.  I was only concerned with the human factor in this case, or rather, perhaps, it might be more correct to say, the inhuman factor, that certain of my constituents had been shot down like dogs, and that those who are guilty of that atrocity had done so with impunity.  I do not want to go over the whole range of things that have been elicited by this debate, but I do not think we understand the real position. In Ireland to-day we do not understand what a fragile thing society is, and how easy it is for a few determined, unscrupulous and ruthless men to shatter the whole fabric of society if they make up their minds to do it, and if the forces that stand to defend society are not in a state of matured organisation to meet such contingencies.  There is no country in the world, if there arose within it a <Col N="1415" /> few hundred determined, ruthless and unscrupulous men that might not have suffered infinitely more disaster than Ireland has suffered.  If there was such a band of men in England to-day destroying railway bridges, bombing factories and public buildings, they could, within 24 hours, before society could rally itself to cope with them, have carried out infinitely more damage and disaster than has been carried out in a country like Ireland during the episode we have gone through.  We have to recognise, not merely the horror of the situation, but the inevitable limitations that have been placed upon those who, owing to circumstances, have had the terrible task of trying to avert, or diminish, these disasters in the country. I am satisfied with the speech of the Commander-in-Chief.  He says they are taking steps that what happened in Ballyconnell is not likely to happen in that area again.  I hope it will happen in no area in Ireland.  He said also we had to recognise the fact that there was a species of madness in the country, and, if we recognise that fact, we must recognise also that you cannot meet madness as you would meet political opposition.  You cannot meet a mad dog in the same way as you would meet a dog that is merely barking.  You will require much more drastic measures to deal with him.  Society and the Irish nation is of much more importance than the predilections or dispositions of those who are afflicted with this madness in Ireland to-day, and if we put the safety of those who are afflicted with that delirium over the safety of the nation then the nation is going to go down under this extreme delirium that has already played such havoc with the country.  As I have said, I have no wish to range over the whole thing, but this I would like to say that I believe if we had in those who are opposing the Government the same rational argumentative criticism as that which was put up by Deputy Johnson there would be no necessity to have to resort to those drastic measures.  But there is a difference which cannot be bridged between the logical political opposition of Deputy Johnson and his followers, and the atrocities that occurred at Ballyconnell and other parts of the country which are <Col N="1416" /> symptoms of the attempt to destroy this Government, and the whole basis and principle of representative Government in Ireland and to bring back the regime and the idea of the feudal barons as the dominant factor in the Government of Ireland.  We have got to recognise the fact that we cannot judge the active militant forces against the Government by the standards and the principles of democratic opposition to representative Government.  You have got to understand that you are faced with men who, whether they realise it or not, are acting as the enemies of the Irish State, and you will never overcome them unless you meet them in the spirit that you are confronting the enemies of the State.  I do not agree either with Deputy Johnson when he says that we have more chaos and confusion now than we had last June.  I certainly think he misjudges the situation, because what we are confronted with to-day is not a real organised military campaign, but a series of stunts.</P>

      <P>I think that out of the chaos and confusion there is emerging the germ of organised society.  I think in all these Bills that have been introduced in this Dáil and discussed within the past few days we see the workmen operating who are moulding the fabric of society which as it grows and gathers strength will eliminate those elements of disorder and give to the Irish nation the bulwarks of stability and security that will make it impossible for these disasters ever again to fall upon this country.  I believe, too, that no man is doing a greater share towards that end than Deputy Johnson, for on every one of those measures that have been brought before the Dáil he has brought to bear an intelligent, sane and constructive mind. Although I differ fundamentally with many of his points of view, I recognise the value of his judgment, and I wish to heavens that it was the most formidable thing that the Free State had to face in its effort to assert itself.  If it were so, I think the future of Ireland would be assured, and I think that future would be a happy and prosperous one.</P>
