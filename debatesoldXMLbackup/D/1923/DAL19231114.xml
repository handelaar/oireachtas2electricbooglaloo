      <P>replying for <b>The President:</b> As has already been stated in the Dáil, the Government is considering measures for the relief of unemployment by stimulating work on the roads and on housing schemes, if it proves possible to carry out such work at a reasonable cost.  The city of Dublin will have its share in any such arrangements as are made, but no special scheme limited to Dublin is in contemplation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, owing to the present serious financial position of traders and farmers in Ireland, reasonable facilities will be afforded to persons on whom demands for income tax arrears for past three years have been served; whether the amounts claimed may be paid by instalments, so that the present drastic steps of seizing on such person's property may only be exercised where the person is well known to be able but unwilling to pay.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are always prepared to give full consideration to a request for payment by instalments in any case where payment of arrears of Income Tax in one sum would involve hardship.  It must be understood, however, that it rests with the taxpayer to obtain this concession in the first instance before the question of enforcement of the tax arises.  Where no concession has been obtained and compulsory measures have to be taken, the Revenue Commissioners cannot then consider any question of instalments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no official statistics available on this matter, but it may be taken that the number of <Col N="707" /> cases in which income tax of 9s. 6d. in the £ has been deducted from dividends payable to residents in Saorstát Eireann is very small in proportion to the total number of dividends received in this country from outside.  Residents in Saorstát Eireann can in nearly all cases avoid the deduction of income tax at a rate exceeding 5s. in the £ by completing certain prescribed forms which are obtainable from bankers or the British Inspector of Foreign Dividends, York House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2.  Where owing to the non-completion of forms at the proper time, or otherwise, an excessive deduction of British income tax has been made repayment of such tax may be claimed from the British Chief Inspector of Taxes (Foreign Claims), Cecil Chambers, 86 Strand, London, W.C.2., who, it is understood, will make the necessary repayment with as little delay as possible.  On this matter generally I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by me to Deputy Good on 31st ultimo.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state what is the annual value of patent medicines sold within Saorstát Eireann; whether any duty is payable thereon, and, if so, what is the amount of revenue derived from such duty; or if no duty is payable, whether an estimate has been made of the revenue that would be obtained if a duty equal to that now payable on patent medicines in Great Britain were imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. The Patent Medicines Duty has never been levied in Ireland.  The Act (the Medicines Stamp Act, 1802) under which the duty was last imposed was passed before the Irish and British Exchequers and taxing systems were unified following the Act of Union. The Medicines Duty was never extended to Ireland, and at the present moment the position is that patent medicines are dutiable in Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland or here. The answer to the second part of the <Col N="708" /> question is that patent medicines are not liable to duty in the Saorstát. The answer to the third part of the question is that there is no information available at present as to the annual value or quantity of patent medicines sold in the Saorstát, and that in the absence of such information it is not possible to frame an estimate of the revenue that would be obtained from a duty on patent medicines.</P>

      <P>Certain prison officers were compelled to vacate their quarters in Waterford Prison in August, 1922, on the occasion of the occupation of that prison by Irregulars. Authority was given for the payment to the officers concerned of allowances based, for the first 14 days of absence, on the rates paid to officers detailed for temporary duty in other prisons, and based for the subsequent period of absence on the usual rates of lodging allowance appropriate to the various ranks.  This authority did not extend to cover the cases of unmarried temporary warders.  These officers hold their appointments on a daily tenure, and on the occasion referred to were exceptionally well treated in being retained in the service, instead of being paid off when the prison was evacuated by the Prison Authorities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that rabbits, which have increased enormously in numbers during the past few years, have caused immense damage to crops throughout the country, including rape and potatoes, crops not hitherto touched by this prolific pest; whether he is aware that farmers are powerless to cope with this evil; whether he would consider the advisability of using demobilised soldiers during the breeding months next season to shoot down the rabbits, killing thereby the unborn young, which method has proved most effective in Australia; whether he would consider the advisability of appointing Inspectors of the Department to investigate and report on the destruction done by this pest and on the loss to farmers resulting therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that during the last two years rabbits have become a serious pest and have done considerable damage to crops in some districts.  I am informed that this was because rabbit warrens had not been systematically trapped, professional rabbit trappers being averse to carrying on their work in country districts owing to the disturbed conditions. For the same reason farmers have not been able to use guns, while farmers in many districts have reported that traps set by them have been stolen from their lands.  In these circumstances, it can hardly be correctly said that traps, snares, and ferrets have not been effective in clearing away the rabbits. Enquiries have been made as to the methods used in other countries, more particularly in Australia, and those inquiries covered the use of poisons and of an apparatus for the fumigation of burrows, but the information obtained indicated that where the use of poison and fumigation had been successful the conditions were totally dissimilar to those obtaining in this country, and apart altogether from the dangers attending the use of poison, it was considered unlikely that good results would be obtained here from these methods.  I have no information as to the value of guns as compared with <Col N="710" /> poison but trapping, snaring, and ferreting are regarded in Ireland as the best means of destroying rabbits.  It is not considered necessary to take steps to get cheap ammunition and to employ demobilised soldiers during the spring months of next season, because it is expected that, with the return of normal conditions, the trapping of rabbits on demesnes will be undertaken by owners or let to trappers as heretofore, that trapping by farmers will be again undertaken, and that as permits for the use of guns are being issued, farmers will be able to keep rabbits in check by shooting.  It is felt that the putting into operation of all these measures will reduce the number of rabbits down to the point where the damage they will be able to do to crops will not be appreciable.</P>
      <P>Where the circumstances warrant it, and the necessary information is given to the Department, the owners or occupiers of demesnes which are situated in proximity to cultivated lands will be approached with a view to making some arrangements for the systematic trapping of the rabbits thereon.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in the last part of the question that proceedings for payment in lieu of rent, rates, etc., should not be taken against occupiers of holdings on which rabbits are numerous could not be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

There was no untenanted land on the Estate, except bog; but there are large areas, <Col N="711" /> including non-residential and other tenanted holdings, within a distance of a few miles which it will be possible to acquire under the powers of the Land Act, 1923, for the relief of local congestion. When the Land Commission come to deal with the district they will consider how far it may be necessary to migrate some of the tenants in the acutely congested townlands named in the question.</P>

      <P>Inspections were made of the lands in County Meath for the purpose of ensuring the destruction of noxious weeds, and from reports received I am aware that there were in this county 532 holdings on which noxious weeds were growing.  In 273 of these the occupiers satisfied the Department's Inspectors that they would voluntarily destroy the weeds.  In 259 cases notices under the Weeds and Agricultural Seeds (Ireland) Act, 1909, requiring the destruction of the weeds within a specified time, were served upon the occupiers, and 39 of these notices were issued in Dunshaughlin Rural District, which is specially referred to in the question.  After a final inspection it was found that in only two cases in the county the occupiers had not destroyed the weeds or started on the work of destruction, and in these cases prosecutions are being instituted. One of the farmers to be prosecuted is in the Dunshaughlin Rural District.</P>

      <P>West Clare Railway.&mdash;The Guaranteed Dividend for the half-years ended 31st January, 1923, and 31st July, 1923, have not yet been paid.  The last payment received by the Company from the guaranteeing areas was for the period ended 30th April, 1921.</P>

    <P>Reply:&mdash;1. (a), (b), and (c) It is not possible in the middle of the financial year to give an actual statement of Post Office accounts without much trouble and delay.  There are many accounting transactions with other countries and with other departments. I fully reviewed the situation to the Dáil in June last when I indicated that <Col N="714" /> expenditure in the Post Office during the present year would be considerably reduced.  So far as I can ascertain from approximate figures, the financial position is working out as I forecasted.</P>
    <P>(d) The main classes employed by the Post Office are Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists and Postmen.  Their scales of pay vary according to the class of office at which the staff is employed. The highest scale obtains in Dublin, and the weekly rates, including cost of living bonus for Dublin, are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists (Males), 33s. 4d., rising to 101s.</P>
    <P>Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists (Females), 33s. 4d., rising to 71s. 9d. Postmen, 37s., rising to 71s. 9d.</P>
    <P>And the lowest rates obtaining at the smaller provincial towns are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists (Males), 29s. 8d., rising to 84s. 3d.</P>
    <P>Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists (Females), 29s. 8d., rising to 62s. 11d.</P>
    <P>Postmen, 33s. 4d., rising to 62s. 11d.</P>
    <P>(e) Rural Postmen are employed in the delivery of letters and parcels, in the collection of letters and parcels, and on some incidental duties thereto.</P>
    <P>(f) The limits of travelling for rural postmen are fixed, and are, for a walking postman 18 miles a day, and for a cycling postman 26 to 28 miles a day. The duties are revised occasionally to see that these limits are worked up to as closely as possible but not exceeded.</P>
    <P>(g) There has been no change in the regulation limits since 1914.</P>

      <P>Vehicles and persons passing through the Camp by means of the public road do not now require passes.

Only persons who wish to enter the Camp on business or to use Camp roads proper require passes.  This procedure is deemed necessary for the present.</P>

      <P>The rates of pay and allowances for officers and men given in my reply to a question asked by the Deputy on the 23rd March last are still in operation, with the addition that extra pay has been allowed to certain officers employed in the technical services and lodging, fuel and light allowance have been fixed for single officers.  The rates given in the reply referred to for officers not yet formally commissioned are gradually lapsing as such officers become gazetted or are demobilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revised rates of pay and allowances for N.C.O.'s and men are, however, now about to be applied in cases of all future enlistments and re-attestations.

These rates and the current rates of pay and allowances for gazetted officers are set out in Defence <Col N="716" /> Order No. 16, of which I am sending the Deputy a copy.  I may say that that Order was largely reproduced in the public Press on the 12th October.</P>
    <P>The pay of officers of rank higher than that of Major-General is fixed in respect of the offices they hold.  These officers and their salaries are:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the <Col N="717" /> Minister for Defence if any body has been created by him to lay down the lines to govern the discharge of officers from the Army; and if not, on whose recommendations these discharges are being made; and if such discharges are being made in such a manner as to retain only the most efficient and capable officers from a military point of view. Further, if he will state what provision, if any, is being made for officers who are being discharged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the demobilisation of officers surplus to requirements has been for some time under careful review by the Defence Council.  This Council itself has laid down the lines governing the discharge of officers, and the case of each individual officer discharged is previously considered by the Council.</P>
      <P>In making such discharges due regard is given to the necessity for retaining those officers capable of giving the most efficient and satisfactory service from the military point of view.</P>
      <P>The number of officers to be dealt with under the Demobilisation Proposals is approximately 2,000.  Apart from resignations they fall into three classes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Officers whose work has not been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>(2)  Officers whose service dates from a date subsequent to July, 1921, and whose services, while satisfactory, have been such as not to show special merit or indicate special qualifications.</P>
      <P>(3)  Officers whose service dates from a date prior to July, 1921, and who, while having given satisfaction, are surplus to requirements.</P>
      <P>All officers' cases are considered on their history sheets and files.  Officers of the No. 3 class have been grouped in order of efficiency, and demobilisations from this class are taken from the lower positions in such lists.</P>
      <P>The financial provision made for demobilised officers is indicated in Defence Order No. 28 of the 15th of September, a copy of which is forwarded to the Deputy and which states that&mdash;</P>
      <P>Such officers will be granted demobilisation pay as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  For the first two months after <Col N="718" /> demobilisation, full pay of rank (without allowances).</P>
    <P>(b)  For the second two months after demobilisation, half pay of rank (without allowances).</P>
    <P>In addition, a grant of Five Pounds (£5) will be made to each officer on his demobilisation to assist him to provide himself with civilian clothing.</P>
    <P>It is thought necessary specially to consider the cases of officers coming into the third class, and it is anticipated that it may be desirable, in the case of some, at any rate, of those officers to make an additional grant based on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The nature of the services rendered in pre-Truce days by such officer.</P>
    <P>(2)  The period over which these services extended.</P>
    <P>(3)  The extent, resulting in loss, of the consequent upset in his ordinary course of life, and</P>
    <P>(4)  Services subsequently rendered by the officer in the National Forces.</P>
    <P>A Committee, consisting of three of the Senior General Officers Commanding, has been set up to consider the case of each officer of this class, and to make a recommendation in each case to the Minister.</P>
    <P>A re-settlement branch has been set up in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, for the purpose of resettling officers and men in civil life. In addition, certain facilities will be granted in the matter of competition for Civil Service Examinations, and, at present, practically all temporary Civil Service male positions are retained for demobilised officers and men.</P>

The difficulty in dealing with old accounts is mainly one of certification, but so far as the Ennis district is concerned, most of the claims of this type have been paid off and there are now not many outstanding.  If particular cases are brought to my notice, I shall see that attention is given to them at once.</P>
      <P>In the case of goods not ordered under contract, it is usual to reduce the amounts claimed to a figure at which the same class of goods could have been bought in the district at the time they were supplied.  The deductions vary in accordance with the amounts claimed, but the prices allowed are those at which goods of the same quality could have been purchased at the time in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the passing of the Electoral Act, 1923, the principal enactment in force relating to all franchise was the Representation of the People Act, 1918.  That Act both prescribed franchises and fixed the dates for compiling the electors' lists and registers. Both Parliamentary and Local Government franchises were determined by reference to residence or occupation of premises for a period of six months ending on the 15th day of July.  All persons so qualified were to appear on a register which was to come into force on the 15th day of October.  During the life of the Provisional Parliament, there was no opportunity for drafting a measure so intricate as the Electoral Act, and that Parliament, by resolution of the 12th September, 1922, directed the preparation of a register according to the law then enforced, but the principle of adult suffrage was applied to the Parliamentary franchise in accordance with the Constitution.  The 15th October, 1922, was substituted for the 15th July (the date in the Act of 1918), <Col N="731" /> and the other stages were to be fixed by order of the Minister for Local Government.  The Local Government franchise, which is on the basis of occupation, was in no way effective.  These resolutions were subsequently confirmed in the Electoral Act which formally enacted the Constitutional Dáil and Seanad franchises, and fixed the 15th November as the qualifying date for those franchises.  Nothing in the Act of 1923 dealt with either Local Government franchise or Local Government registers, and all the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1918, were expressly left unrepealed.  According to the letter of the law, a register should, therefore, have been prepared of all persons who were qualified to be Local Government electors on the 15th July last, but on that date the register prepared under the resolution of the Provisional Parliament, above referred to, had not yet been completed. Experience has shown here, and elsewhere, that a register cannot be prepared in the short prescribed period, 15th July-15th October.  Six and a half months are allowed by the Electoral Act.  Furthermore, the Parliamentary and Local Government electors have always been noted on the same register.  The new register, which, under the Electoral Act, will be commenced at once, will show Dáil, Seanad and Local Government electors; a person who is qualified for each franchise will have three distinguishing letters opposite his name in the register, e.g., S.R.O.</P>
      <P>S=Seanad Franchise.</P>
      <P>R=Residence Qualification</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>O=Occupation (Local Government).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the registers of Dáil, Seanad and Local Government electors are not prepared at the same time, and do not appear in the same document, there would be a heavy needless expenditure of money both in payment to officials for double work and travelling and in double printing.  The present Bill, therefore, proposes to adapt the dates and machinery of the Electoral Act to the preparation of a Local Government register, but it does not in any way alter the existing provisions of the Representation <Col N="732" /> of the People Act which prescribes Local Government franchise. The Bill does not deal with franchise in any way.  It is merely a question of combining the Local Government register with the ordinary Parliamentary register, and is merely an economy measure.</P>

    <P>This Bill will amend the original Elections Postponement Act of 1923 in the following way:&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section (1) of Section 1, instead of reading thus: `Every statutory election of councillors of boroughs, councillors of urban districts, and commissioners of towns which, but for this Act, would be held within twelve months after the passing of this Act, shall be postponed until such date not being later than the 1st day of January, 1924, as the Minister shall by Order prescribe,' it shall read as follows: `Every statutory election of councillors of boroughs, councillors of urban districts, and commissioners of towns, which, but for this Act, would be held within 12 months after the passing of this Act, shall be <Col N="733" /> postponed until such date, not being later than the 30th day of September, 1924.&rdquo;</P>

I do not think it is altogether fair to press the Minister for an exact answer to questions of this sort until he has had ample opportunity of examining the question in all its phases, remembering that the internal government of the country is only secondary in its importance to the ordinary administration we are discharging here, and when he has had an opportunity of surveying the whole field, I presume he will bring his proposal for any decision he may wish to take <Col N="734" /> before the whole Dáil, and he will take the Dáil into his confidence with a view to remedying, should it be considered necessary, the existing state of affairs.</P>

      <P>There is one question the Minister might reasonably answer and which was not suggested until the President himself had spoken.  Do I understand his words correctly to mean that he proposes the local elections will not be held upon the present Register, but that a new Register will have to be completed before further local elections are held? That would mean a long postponement, and if there is to be a postponement quite so distant as that surely we ought to have it in a clearer form, than in the inferential form the President put it before us.  Surely we ought to know whether the elections, if postponed, are to be held on the present Register, or if there is to be a new Register or a more complete Register, before the elections are held.</P>

      <P>There is one point <Col N="735" /> that I would like to make in connection with this.  It is to the effect that it would be, to my mind, very detrimental to the interests of the country to have local elections until the rates situation has been pretty well cleared up.  There were counties in which rates were very much outstanding when the last Order was issued postponing the local elections. If any attempt had been made to hold elections while those rates were outstanding it would be utterly impossible to get public bodies elected in those areas that would have done their duty in any sort of decent way.  There are places in which County Councils have been replaced by Commissioners, because of failure to do their duty. Until the whole situation is made clear, and the rate collections brought up to date, to hold elections in those places would simply be inviting the return of Councils that would immediately have to be dissolved.  In County Leitrim, for instance, there was, before the General Election, a rate collection going on, at the rate of £5,000 or £6,000 a week. When the General Election was announced the rate collection stopped practically, or it fell to £40 or £50 a week.  People stopped paying arrears until they saw they could not escape. When the election was over, these payments were resumed.  Any notion that a local election was pending in such areas would stop the collection of rates. They would hope that there would be new Councils elected, which would enable them to escape for some time further. Whatever other considerations are involved, the clearing up of the rate situation is a necessary one before local elections can be held.</P>

      <P>I am asking the leave of the Dáil to introduce this Bill.  I am doing so on behalf of Deputy O'Higgins.  It raises a less serious issue than we have been discussing.  The Bill is to repeal Section 2 of the Gaming Act, 1835.  The effect of Section 2 of that Act was to enable any person who had paid money in consideration of a gaming transaction to, let us say, a bookmaker, to sue for a refund, or to enable a bookmaker to sue for a refund of any money which he had paid in respect of losses.  That is the law in Ireland.  It is not the law in any other country.  As a matter of practice, both parties got over it by ignoring it, and as a rule no cases came into court.  The matter became really serious when either party died, because an executor was compelled to sue.  An executor has no discretion.  You had cases where executors were sueing in consideration of gaming transactions for money that had been paid four or <Col N="737" /> five years previously.  I think you also had cases where executors of bookmakers were suing for losses which the bookmarker had paid by cheque or bill. These actions only arise where money is paid by bill, cheque, or mortgage. This is not the law in any other country.  The present position is obviously impossible, if we are to allow betting transactions to take place.  This Act is merely to amend the law in that respect.  In case there should be any misunderstanding, I want to explain that this Bill which we are introducing, does not amend the Gaming Act, so as to enable a bookmaker to sue for a debt.  The old law remains, and a man may still plead the Gaming Act.</P>

    <P>I think it would be better if the in-production of this report were postponed until Friday next, so that Deputies would have an opportunity of bringing forward amendments.  There is one necessary amendment which I would like to propose to the Standing Orders <Col N="738" /> relating to Private Bills&mdash;that is, that during the current Session the promoters óf any Private Bill may publish the notices of intention required by Standing Orders during the months of December and January, instead of October and November, and that the dates for deposits of plans and documents, notice of the deposit of copies of the Bill, and objections against the Bill shall be correspondingly altered.  It is necessary to make those changes in order that promoters of Bills may have an opportunity of having their Bills dealt with in the present Session.  It may also be necessary to have the Orders amended, so that Private Bills can be initiated in the Dáil as well as in the Seanad.  Therefore, I think it would be well if the introduction of this report were left over until Friday next.  I propose that this be done.</P>

According to the papers that have been distributed to us, it would appear that a draft identical with this draft of the proposed standing Orders, is before the Seanad, and that certain amendments are to be moved in the Seanad.  If the same draft is before the two Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time, and if different amendments are moved, it may lead to a little complexity later on. But what I was going to suggest was that some consultation should take place with a view to arranging that the draft should be initiated in one House and sent up to the other. Otherwise, we will have reached a stage when we perhaps will be submitting amendments to the Seanad at the very moment that we may be considering amendments which the Seanad have passed and sent on to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to make permanent <Col N="741" /> provision for the method to be adopted in making appointments to the Civil Service.  It provides that, generally speaking, admission shall be by open, competitive examination.  That is the system which will on the whole give us the best service.  Alternative methods might be put up and it might be possible to have panels for selection which would give us as good a Civil Service and leave us a choice as well.  But that would be subject to suspicion at all times, and it would be very difficult to ensure that at no time was there ground for suspicion.  Consequently, the Bill is brought in in the form in which it stands.  In certain cases, power is taken to have the examination confined to special classes. That is desirable.  For instance, at the present time it is desirable, in view of Army demobilisation, that certain appointments should be confined to men with Army service.  We are able, with the machinery that this Bill provides, to have competitive examinations for the various candidates in a class which are eligible, and to get the best possible material from the class to which, for public reasons, we desire to confine the appointments.  In certain other cases examination may be dispensed with&mdash; that is, in cases where there are professional or other peculiar qualifications. It is quite obvious that, while for the junior posts and the ordinary run of posts, competitive examination is good enough, there are positions for which you could not rely on getting the best or nearly the best candidate by any method of examination.  There is a class of post which requires a man of experience, administrative ability, certain force of character, and knowledge of the world, and you might easily have the best candidate for that class of position surpassed in examination by a bookworm or quite a young student, who would be altogether unfit for the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided that in cases like that, and in other special cases, it will be possible to admit persons to the Civil Service otherwise than by examination if a certificate is issued by the Civil Service Commission, and they can refuse it when any special name is proposed to them.  That certificate must be gazetted, so that Clause 6 does not <Col N="742" /> provide what might be described as a &ldquo;back door entrance&rdquo; to the Civil Service.  Nobody can be admitted secretly or privately to the Civil Service by the operation of this clause. It simply gives an alternative to the examination system in certain cases where examinations would not be satisfactory. It cannot be used, and will not be used, for ordinary appointments to the Civil Service.  We have heard a lot of talk of the Commission which was appointed under the Act, which this Bill is intended to replace, not having held examinations.  The present time is not the time to rush into the holding of examinations and to recruit large numbers of people to the permanent Civil Service.  We have really to finish our stocktaking and to see what services we are going to retain and whether we require any additional permanent Civil Servants.</P>
    <P>We have considerable numbers of temporary Civil Servants, and if services are to be dispensed with these Civil Servants can be dispensed with. If we add unduly to the number of permanent Civil Servants we would be tying up our own hands.  It is not possible, as many people would desire us, to rush in and hold examinations, right, left and centre.  Certain examinations have been held.  For instance, there have been examinations for Customs and Excise, and they were confined to men with Army service.  Fifty posts were offered there, and there were four posts offered in the National Health Insurance Department.  The staff of the Revenue Department is, of course, a staff that has grown greatly, and it was found necessary and justifiable to make certain permanent appointments in the Revenue Service.  An open examination to qualify men for appointments as County Surveyors has been held by the Civil Service Commissioners. There have been examinations in the Civic Guard for men to act as Inspectors of Weights and Measures. Examinations are being held for women Writing Assistants who will largely do certain work thrown on the Land Commission by the passing of the Land Act.  Some of the appointments to these positions will be reserved for women who hold temporary posts in the Government Service, and <Col N="743" /> other posts will be open to girls of school age.</P>
    <P>There will be examinations also for technical appointments in certain departments of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  Examinations are also pending, limited to boy messengers in the Post Office, in connection with a number of permanent posts as postmen. For the future, appointments of Shorthand Clerks and Typists will be made, in Dublin, from a list compiled as a result of competitive examination. As far as possible we will keep to the competitive examination system for all appointments.  It will be more satisfactory in every respect.  We will know where we are, and the examinations will give an equal opportunity to everybody.  In the past Typists and Shorthand-Typists have been recruited in a rather casual way, and although the appointments are only from week to week, we feel that the best thing to do is to draw up a list as the result of competitive examinations and take from that list in order of merit.</P>
    <P>The Bill has no new features.  It was before the Dáil, and I do not think it was much discussed when it was last brought forward.  It continues the system with which we are familiar.  It has worked well with the British, and has given them an efficient and very capable Civil Service.  It has done the work of administration exceedingly well, on the whole.  I believe with us the system will also work well, and as time goes on we will be able to get a good Civil Service at as cheap a rate as will be consistent with requirements. The system will give a chance to all who may aspire to enter the Civil Service, and it will give fair play all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with practically every word the Minister for Finance said as to the desirability of competitive examination. It is not the most perfect test, but, broadly speaking, it is a test that works best over a wide field.  I agree with him also that you must settle those things some time ahead, otherwise the candidates and the people training for the examination will not know where they are.  There are one <Col N="744" /> or two details, however, to which he did not refer, and which seem to me desirable to comment upon, even on the Second Reading of the Bill.  There is no provision whatever for a pension for the Civil Service Commissioners.  You pension the Judges and the Civil Servants, but the people who are to be the judges and to select your Civil Servants are not to have any pension at all.  I am not anxious to encourage pensions, but it does seem an anomaly. You are conferring responsible functions on officials who receive no pension whatever.  Secondly, there is the provision that these Commissioners are to be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.  That means that year after year they will come on the estimates, and their salaries will have to be voted here.  Everyone of us who has a constituent who has failed to pass an examination will be liable to raise complaints.  One aggrieved person may say: &ldquo;Why did so and so get more marks than my Tommy?&rdquo;  All these matters may be brought before the Dáil.  That, I think, is not a wise provision. These Commissioners, who are virtually judges, should be paid from the Central Fund and not from the Estimates every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third provision is a more remarkable one, and it differs entirely from the British method.  It is that the Commissioners shall hold office during the pleasure of the Executive Council, and may be removed from their posts at any time the Executive Council may think fit.  I believe in England and in Canada they have permanent tenure, and it seems to me most undesirable that men in this position, a position of grave and serious responsibility, should feel they are liable to be removed from their posts and sent away, without any pension, at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  I do not mistrust the Executive Council, but I think it means that with every change of Government there will be a tendency to change the Commissioners. These are important and well-paid posts, and it is not unlikely that there will be supporters of the Government then in power looking for these posts.  I do not think the Commissioners should be changed at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  I <Col N="745" /> do not say that any Government would do it, but it makes it possible for any Government to introduce the American spoils system.  If the Commissioners are to be changed with each Government, the American spoils system will be introduced. I do not think anybody will contend that that system has worked well in the United States.  I do not propose to oppose this Bill on the Second Reading, but at a later stage I will submit amendments.</P>

      <P>I have no intention either of opposing the Second Reading of this Bill, but I am surprised and disappointed that the Ministry have not taken the opportunity, in introducing the Bill, of extending competitive examinations to a much greater extent than is suggested here.  As my friend on the left here has said, competitive examination may not always be the very best test of a man's capacity for the work, but, on the whole, it is the best we have got.  The Government have had brought before their notice from time to time recommendations of certain important bodies with regard to the extension of competitive examination to the medical service.  It is with regard to these recommendations that I wish, for the moment, to address myself. During the sitting of the Convention in 1917, the Convention, by a very large majority, which included practically all the representatives of the South and West, made a very strong recommendation for the extension of the competitive examination to all classes, and particularly included the medical service.  In 1920 the Public Health Council, appointed to draft a Public Health Bill, also made a strong recommendation which was unanimous, and it reads: &ldquo;The establishment of an Irish Medical Service appointed by competitive examination and paid by the Ministry, from which will be provided the medical and veterinary officers of health, the medical and surgical staffs of the various public hospitals, sanatoria, asylums, etc., as well as the medical officers engaged in the treatment of insured and poor persons.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>When the resolution came before the delegates of the Medical Profession, representing the entire profession in <Col N="746" /> the country, it was unanimously adopted by these delegates.  Furthermore, a referendum had been taken in 1910 of the Medical Profession in Ireland, and 90 per cent. of a very extensive poll of the profession were in favour of the Medical Service being open to competitive examination.  As late as a few months ago the General Council of the County Councils in Ireland made a similar recommendation, namely, that all these State appointments should be gained only by competitive examinations.  There is not any question that competitive examinations would do away with one or two things.  On the question of corruption in the past, we heard from time to time that it was possible for a man with a cheque book in his pocket to go around the country, and distribute cheques varying from £10 to £20 to secure a vote.  Competitive examinations would do away with that class of thing.  But far more desirable is it, that we would be able to keep at home in Ireland the very best of our young medical men.  If the appointments are open to competitive examinations, and if the men are decently paid, we shall keep here the best of our men instead of having them go over to the other side where they will be better remunerated. I take it for granted that what the Ministry have set before themselves is the word &ldquo;Efficiency&rdquo; as the text for all their preachings.  I do not think they can get satisfactory efficiency in any other way than by means of competitive examinations.  As far as the medical service is concerned, one reason why I am speaking to-day is that we were promised a Public Health Bill.  This I hope will be coming before us in the course of the next few months.  Under the Public Health Bill there will be certain provisions made for new appointments.  I would rather see the Bill torn to shreds if it merely means putting into jobs men who are inefficient; if it does not mean that we are going to get the very best men we can to work in the interests of Public Health, I would rather see the Bill scrapped.  Furthermore, in connection with this, I presume that it might be possible on the introduction of a Bill to make provision for the establishment of an examination.  As Major <Col N="747" /> Bryan Cooper has said, it is well to look a little beforehand, and I should have thought that if the Ministry intends to have a competitive examination in the future, they would have looked a little bit ahead and given these Commissioners, that they are now appointing, power to arrange for, and conduct examinations on lines that can be easily set forth in consultation with the bodies which are interested. I finish by saying that I hope before the Bill comes before us in Committee the Government will have taken these matters into consideration and perhaps do something to please the Medical Profession, and the other bodies who have suggested competitive examinations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points that I want to raise.  One is regarding the remarks of Major Bryan Cooper, which seemed to me to be directed to a Bill which might have contained provisions for making the Civil Service Commissioners a body, which I for one rather suggest they should be made, to make appointments. So far as I can read the Bill, it is rather a body to set and conduct examinations. In that case I am afraid I am not able to follow him regarding the necessity for pensioning these Commissioners, and paying them out of the Central Fund, as contrasted with the proposal in the Bill.  The other point is a matter which the Minister could reassure the Dáil upon, or give us some information upon.  That is whether it is the intention to place under the test of competitive examinations the recent appointments to the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it is, perhaps, desirable that some qualifications, which would be found out by examination, should be put forward, and made applicable to those who have entered the Civil Service during the past two or three years.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what Sir James Craig said, the Bill gives power to the Civil Service Commissioners, when requested, to hold examinations for any position under <Col N="748" /> any authority or authorities.  It will be a matter for the Local Government Department, in its Bill dealing with Public Health, to make arrangements that the appointments shall be made as the result of competitive examination, if it so desires.  This Bill simply sets up the machinery for the holding of those examinations, if it is desired to avail of it.  I do not think it will be desirable, in this Bill, to deal with the local administration.  It will be out of place to go any further until we come to the Committee Stage.  With reference to the permanence of the Civil Service Commissioners, they are no more permanent in Great Britain than it is proposed to have them here. I do not think it is desirable they should be put into the position of Judges.  They do carry out a very important function, but I think it is entirely wrong to assume that we are going to have corrupt Governments in the future.  If we are going to have corrupt government no safeguard you will put in the Bill will save you from that.  You must believe that the Government will carry out the law in the spirit and in the letter.  This law does away with the question of the patronage of Ministers, and you must assume that the Ministers who will be appointed by the Sovereign Assembly of the Irish Nation in the future, will not attempt to get behind any decision come to; that they will not strive to do things they are forbidden to do and not expected to do.  There is really no use in talking about paper safeguards. There used to be a lot of talk about paper safeguards in the past, but when there were no paper safeguards it was found that we were just as well off without them.  The idea of setting up a Civil Service Commission in a very high position and making them Commissioners, equivalent to Judges of the High Court, and all that sort of thing, arises from a desire for paper safeguards which would be no good.  Now, in regard to salary and pension, if a Civil Service Commissioner is paid a salary, I agree that he should be paid a pension, and I think the Bill enables a pension to be paid.  In fact, the present Civil Service Commissioners are not paid any salary.  Two of them are Civil Servants <Col N="749" /> and the other is An Ceann Comhairle. The matter of pensions is not pressing and it arises in no special way.  With regard to recent appointments, nobody can come into the permanent Civil Service except by way of open competitive examination, or Clause 6.  In regard to recent appointments, if they were professional appointments they will come before the Civil Service Commissioners in the usual way.  If they are appointments that do not come under Sub-Section (a), Clause 6, then there might be some that would come under Sub-Section (b), but the Civil Service Commissioners will have to be satisfied that it is in the public interest that they should be appointed without examination. There have been no appointments to the permanent Civil Service in recent years.  Anybody who has been taken on his only temporary.  He can only become permanent in one or two ways.  So there is nothing to fear in that respect.  In normal times it would be probably quite sufficient to have two or three of the higher Civil Servants acting as a Commission, but as times are not normal, and as we have not all got used to carrying on the business of Government as a normal matter, we asked An Ceann Comhairle if he would kindly act on this Commission, so that we would have some person who was independent and outside the influence of the Government on it.</P>
      <P>There can, as I say, be no admission to the Civil Service otherwise than by competitive examination, unless the Civil Service Commissioners are prepared, after consideration, to grant their certificate and to have that certificate published in the &ldquo;Gazette.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed at the outset of my speech to quote, for the sake of simplicity, certain words which I used in this Dáil last April when speaking on the Budget as the basis of certain comments I desired to make upon the important financial statement made by the Minister for Finance.  Speaking on the Estimates when they were before us at that time, I said: &ldquo;I think that when the Estimates are reduced to Budget form, the Minister for Finance might, with advantage, remember the difference between expenditure strictly stated as non-recurrent, and expenditure that is recurrent, and classify the entire expenditure of the nation under these two separate categories strictly recognisable in finance, viz., recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure.  That expenditure which is recurrent and which is due to each year, and is more or less in the nature of establishment charges should be liquidated completely within the financial year in which it occurs.&rdquo;  I went on later to suggest that the two chief matters that might be treated as non-recurrent were expenditure in connection with the Army and in connection with compensation. I mention that now because the Minister for Finance, at that time the President of the Executive Council, was a little derisive at that classification. Nevertheless, that is the classification that has been adopted by the present Minister for Finance, and is the basis of the statement he made.  He adopts different words, but the principle is the same, and I naturally think that the principle is a sound one.  He states in his speech that careful consideration has been given for some time past to the relation that at present exists between revenue available from taxation on the present scale at one end, and on the other hand the expenditure that is being incurred on the normal operations of the Government.  That is excluding compensation charges and that part of the Army charges which are now regarded as abnormal.  I think it might have been to his advantage and to the advantage of the clarity of the <Col N="751" /> national accounts if the principle had been still further extended, because buildings have been purchased and buildings have been set in order and buildings have been re-built and reconstructed into permanent dwellings which have been taken over, and surely if it is right to regard any expenditure as being in the nature of foundation charges it is expenditure of that kind where you can levy the renewal charges and the dilapidation charges.  I suggest that if the principle which the Minister has already accepted be rightfully extended he will find a considerable asset come to him when he comes in the future to amplify the matters he has dealt with in his resent speech in laying the estimates of expenditure before us at the termination of the current financial year.  At the present moment I desire to do no more than just mention that such is the principle that has been accepted, and upon the basis of that principle it is stated that so much of the expenditure that this Nation must incur will be charged to taxation.  Certain other matters which the Minister describes as abnormal expenditure, but which I believe could be more accurately described as non-recurrent expenditure, will be taken over and funded in a National Loan.  I propose quite briefly to touch upon the first of these two before coming to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think wisely, at this stage avoided any attempt to go into details of the figures with which he was dealing, in order to show exactly how he arrived at his deficit.  But he did say that at the end of the financial year he expected a deficit of £1,000,000, that is to say, that the normal expenúiture, after abstracting the abnormal expenditure for allocation to date, would leave a balance of £1,000,000 that he was not able to meet out of current taxation.  To that he adds a further two million pounds for debt services in the next financial year. Now, that figure of two millions I would like to touch upon briefly, because the Minister has, in effect, said to us exactly what the amount of the Loan is going to be, because unless he is going to take a much higher rate of interest than the circumstances would <Col N="752" /> warrant, a debt service of two millions a year means a national loan of £40,000,000.  The Minister for Agriculture, being an expert mathematician, agrees entirely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that will practically be in effect the National Debt that will be incurred.  I would like the Minister, if he can, at a later stage in this debate, to deal with one matter of some importance not touched upon in the course of his speech.  I refer to Article 5 of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there may be certain liabilities that other people are expecting in the course of Article 5 which it is the confident belief in this country will not be forthcoming; but while Article 5 remains open, while there is no decision taken on that Article, then a certain element of doubt has been introduced which it is wise and desirable that we should get rid of at the earliest possible moment.  Outside the provisions of that Article, outside whatever may happen under that Article, it would appear then that when we have got that loan floated, it will constitute practically the entire National Debt.  The Minister addressed the greater part of his remarks to the three million deficit which has got to be met, and he stated that that deficit cannot be met out of taxation or by any increase of taxation, leading to the conclusion that since it has to be cut off, it can only be cut off by a very vigorous process of retrenchment.  The Minister indicated that this country would have to take a share all round in that retrenchment, a share in which everybody must bear their burden from the highest to the lowest.  I think it will be agreed that that is perfectly sound, and that whatever retrenchment is required, it is a retrenchment that every person will have to take a part in, and that it is a retrenchment that should be participated in by everybody from the highest to the lowest.  But I do not say, although the Minister seemed to indicate that he has got his preferences, that this is a <Col N="753" /> share that should be participated in not from the highest to the lowest, but from the lowest to the highest, which is quite a different matter altogether. He has indicated only two sources in respect of which savings are to be effected, one pensions and the other the teachers.  A 10 per cent. cut is to be applied in each case.  In the case of pensions, the cut will mean a reduction of £320,000, and in the case of the teachers the reduction will amount to £330,000, giving a total of £650,000.</P>
    <P>My attitude towards these cuts is this: These cuts may be necessary, but they have not yet been proved to be necessary, and they will not have been proved to be necessary until every other source has been examined, and every other source has not yet been examined. The proposals may be necessary, but at the present moment they would appear as being put in the vanguard of retrenchment, and they would appear to be extremely unjust.  I think it will be admitted that, unjust or just, they are at least politically very unwise. In regard to the pensions, I ask why it is decided to levy a cut of 10 per cent. all round.  The Minister knows, and everybody in this country knows, that if the pensions were kept at their present level and were to be administered better than they are, that very considerable savings could be effected in respect of the persons receiving pensions who are, nevertheless, not entitled to receive pensions.</P>
    <P>I know that economies are being effected in that direction, and I venture to say that probably one entire half&mdash; and I throw this forward as a suggestion&mdash;that one entire half of all that he hopes to save by taking a shilling off the old-age pensioners could be achieved, and will this year be achieved, by a careful examination of all those persons who ought to be in receipt of such pensions.  In regard to the teachers, I desire to say one or two words, because I think that this proposal of the Minister has raised a very far-reaching principle.  I am not going to touch at all upon an aspect of the case that a deal has been made or that a contract or agreement has been made, and that this proposal is going back upon pledged word.  There are those in this Dáil who are in touch with the actual <Col N="754" /> facts who will argue that case, and I leave that aspect of it to them.  But there is one aspect that ought to be touched upon and it seems to me to be of outstanding importance.  It is that the teachers in a country are probably the most important persons in that country, seeing that it is they will be instructing the future generation who will have the continuance of the State for which legislation is proceeding in this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I remember a long time ago hearing a man in the city of London make a comment to a friend.  I was only a young man at the time and overheard it.  The phrases he used clung in my memory since, and they were these:&mdash; That in the conduct of his industry, in the interests of efficiency and capability, he discovered certain positions that were regarded by him as being pivotal positions, and any salary he attached to these positions were attached definitely to the worth of the position, irrespective of the person who was to fill it, and then he proceeded to get the best person for that salary and wherever else he cut, these positions were kept up by him because they were regarded by him as being pivotal positions in his enterprise.  I suggest that the teacher occupies one of these pivotal positions in the enterprise of the State, and should be so regarded. I have said that whatever the future is to be it is the teacher who will decide that matter.  I know that in this Dáil it has been urged in the past by the Farmers' Party that retrenchment might be effected in the teaching profession, but I would urge upon them, and the Minister, that the very future of farming is concerned in this matter; that it is the efficiency of the future farmer that is concerned in the efficiency of the school of to-day, and it is the efficiency and the worth of the future State that is being decided to-day by the teachers.  For these reasons I think it very deplorable, not that this saving should be effected, which might be ultimately proved to be necessary, but I do urge that it is unwise that this should be the very first that should be attacked instead of being among the last to be touched.</P>
    <P>There are other sources.  There is the Army at the present moment.  The <Col N="755" /> Minister used certain words in regard to the Army that were heard with peculiar attention in this House and should be underscored.  He said that the day of destruction has gone.  Now, it is perfectly clear to everybody that the day of destruction has gone.  And yet, consider the Army that is being maintained at the present moment.  Consider the savings that might be effected in the Army.  I elicited from the Minister for Defence to-day the salaries that were being paid to the Army Council. The Chief-of-Staff was getting £1,300 a year, the Adjutant-General £1,100 a year, the Quartermaster-General £1,100, plus free quarters and messing in barracks. He might further have added plus orderlies and free motor cars.  We would all consider that a very princely income indeed, even on parity of exchange it is a salary equal to what is being received, at this moment, by Marshal Foch.  Considering the difference in the exchange, it is about three times as much as Marshal Foch is getting. I consider, whatever the military worth of these gentlemen is, it is not three times the value of that great soldier.  I have heard the suggestion that the Quartermaster-General is worth the salary, because he is three times the size, but these are not matters that enter into estimates.</P>
    <P>There are other matters.  There are three military gentlemen as aides-decamp to the Governor-General.  I understand that the salary of one of the three is £1,100 a year; the salary of another is £900.  These are very considerable salaries.  Considerable economies could be effected in one of the most wasteful of the Army establishments; that is at Gormanstown, which is costing this country £150,000 per annum.  I suggest to the Minister that here is a very fruitful subject of enquiry, if savings are to be effected, and I urge upon him that it would be a very popular thing to do, and a very instructive thing to do to order a public audit of the Army accounts, an audit that should be published by him.  I consider that, at least, such a course should be adopted by him long before the Old Age Pensions should be touched.  What is the cost to-day of the Canadian Army?  In the monies current in the <Col N="756" /> Free State the Canadian Army costs 1½ millions.  The Minister states he will be able to reduce the Army from ten and a half to something in the vicinity of four million pounds.  If an army were to be run in Ireland on the militia system, same as it is run in Canada, an army could be maintained of equal efficiency, though without the same extended personnel, on a sum that need not, at any moment, exceed two million pounds a year.  I am not making any guess at that figure.  I have worked it out in some considerable detail, together with persons who are quite competent to assess the figures.  Consider what that, in its turn, would imply.  If we had in Ireland an army established on the militia system we would be able to save two millions a year.  In other words, we would, out of that one economy alone, be able to pay the entire debt service that the Minister spoke of, as being necessary to estimate for in the coming financial year. There is also the Civil Service, concerning entrance to which we have just passed the Second Reading of a Bill. The Minister has already indicated that something is going to be done in that matter.  But it is notorious that appointments have been made during the past two years to the Civil Service that were not justified by the attainments of the persons appointed, and certainly were not justified in respect of the salaries those persons are receiving. The salaries were on a much higher scale than the salaries that prevailed up to that time.  It is true that a large number of the persons who have been appointed would not be able to retain their positions to-day if they were called upon to pass an examination.  I think a considerable economy might be effected in that regard if the Minister were to make the coming examinations for the Civil Service retrospective, so that persons who have been appointed within the past two years shall be called upon to pass such an examination, and if they fail to qualify their positions shall automatically fall vacant.  It would be rather surprising to discover exactly the economy that might be affected out of that one single measure.</P>
    <P>There are other matters pending, not immediately before the Dáil.  There <Col N="757" /> are matters of which we have already received notice.  There is the Ministers and Secretaries Bill.  We will deal with that when we come to it.  I will only make this comment upon it now, seeing that it is in the possession of the House, that £8,400 a year is going to be spent under it on Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Dáil will be able to work out a very interesting arithmetical calculation to discover how many old age pensioners will be called upon to do without their shilling a week in order to contribute towards these new offices that are about to be created.</P>
    <P>When all economies have been effected we come then to a matter which we can, at least, regard as a matter of common agreement; that is, a loan is necessary that will be the common concern of every citizen in the Free State.  The Minister, in his speech, stated that it is important to have it understood that the public finance of the country does not need to be conducted and will not, under the present Government, be conducted in a manner that can render us subservient to any external interests. This is a very admirable principle to set out as a headline.  Unfortunately, it is not altogether true.  It is true that the raising of this loan will make us subservient to external interests, because the loan will be raised in terms of British currency.  It is perfectly true that Irish citizens are to be asked to contribute, and no definite overture will be made to British citizens as such. Much less, I gather, will overtures be made to the British Government as such.  But the Irish citizens who contribute will be contributing in currency notes of the British Government, currency notes that will be dependent upon British financial policies, currency notes that will have to be purchased by Irishmen across the Customs frontier of their own creation&mdash;a necessary frontier, a frontier that follows upon the provisions of the Treaty, but a frontier, nevertheless, that will make those loans more expensive here than they would be made for ordinary British citizens in Great Britain.  I raise that matter now, because I do think that the Minister ought to take very early into his consideration the very important matter of currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> Directly we touch the question of a loan, we touch a matter closely dependent upon the currency upon which any State relies.  We already have the conditions under which that currency can be created.  I urge that it should be created.  I was speaking the other day to a business man of some weight in another country and put before him the figures of exports and imports in respect of the Free State, by which it appears that we are exporting every year one-third in value more than we are importing.  When any country can show a position like that, it is a country of which the credit is very high indeed&mdash;a credit equal to that which any other country can show.  In any case that is the position to-day.  A loan somewhat of the order of forty millions pounds is to be issued.  It may not all come at once, but if that debt service is to be as assessed by the Minister, such naturally must be the order of the debt.</P>
    <P>Here we come to a question involving a grave public duty for every citizen of the Free State.  It is incumbent upon this country that that loan should be made a resounding success. I do not deceive myself that any words of mine would reach even people outside calling themselves Republicans, who have said that they would not recognise any such loan, if created, and that they would afterwards repudiate it.  Words like those can be disregarded. They are having a certain measure of weight with certain persons, but they can be disregarded, because no matter what the Government of this country may be, that Government could not continue for five minutes if there were not to be a recognition of the National liability incurred in the name of the people. It is a liability in which every individual is concerned.  Business men in Ireland to-day would find that their own personal credits in other countries would be affected injuriously if the National credit were to be impaired by any failure to raise what this country needs in the way of money for the continuance of the normal processes of its business.  I urge the Minister to recognise that this is a matter that cannot be treated and will not be <Col N="759" /> treated by anybody in a merely party spirit.  I urge him to put the people of this country in possession of the full facts at the earliest possible moment, to organise a drive and to put every Deputy in his district to the task of assisting in the collection of the loan that is required by the Free State. Let the Government itself give the headline in the recognition of the principle that this is a matter&mdash;whatever differences we may have on other questions&mdash;that is not a Party question, that it is a matter in which every citizen is concerned and in which every citizen is called upon to give his assistance. In that way we may be able to prove that in this ship of State every person will have his or her duty.  I believe that if the matter be regarded in that way, and a proper publicity campaign instituted in which every person who can help will be called upon to help, there will be no difficulty in raising within this country what this country wants for the administration of its services and for putting this State into a condition of solvency.</P>

When that amendment has been disposed of, amendment No. 1, dealing with the Fishing Industry, can be taken up and disposed of.  Then, the main question would be again before the Dáil, and Deputies who desire to raise other matters, not <Col N="760" /> relevant to the question of economy and retrenchment, would be in order in doing so.

    <P>These matters undoubtedly come up in regard to the whole outline, form <Col N="761" /> and proposals contained in the Governor-General's speech, and if Deputies are not to be allowed to refer to them again, when they desire to take part in a general discussion, I think, for the benefit of the Dáil generally, it would be better to proceed with the general discussion now, and have a limited discussion later on the amendments according to their terms.</P>

      <P>I suggest that if we branch off now to the motion on the Governor-General's speech, we will be getting into matters relating to Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Local Government, matters absolutely foreign to the subject we have been discussing.  From that point of view it would, perhaps, be better to deal with the amendments specifically, and afterwards deal with the general question. My only point is that we will be taking up something absolutely new and entirely foreign&mdash;or at least foreign to a great extent.  We will be discussing Industry, Local Government and other matters if we adopt Deputy Redmond's suggestion.</P>

      <P>I do not think it wise that the discussion on the Address should be continued in general terms. The financial statement made by the Minister has introduced new matters. The principal part of the two amendments deals with the financial statement. It would be better to dispose of the amendments first, and I suggest we do so.  Let us not be mixing up matters. The question raised on the financial statement is altogether foreign to the Address, and it should be dealt with separately.  I quite agree that anybody speaking to the financial statement and the amendment ought not be allowed to introduce those matters afterwards.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that that is exactly my point.  When we proceed it discuss these amendments, we will not be discussing the Governor-General's Address, because neither of these matters were mentioned <Col N="762" /> in the Address.  My point is, that we are not now discussing the Governor-General's Address, but the Address as amended by the financial statement, and as amended also by another statement which I intended to refer to.  I think the method adopted of dealing with the Governor-General's Address in this fashion of dribs and drabs is bad for the Government and bad for the Dáil.  The Address should be disposed of in an allotted time. These matters were not brought up on the Address.  That is my complaint in regard to the Address.  They were overlooked and now we are going to discuss, as Deputy Gorey has said, two questions which were not mentioned in the Address, and then we are going to go back to the Address again.  I bow to the will of the Dáil, but I think it would be more logical and reasonable to dispose of the Address first and then proceed to deal with the amendments.</P>

      <P>I have not given any ruling on this matter. I have merely made a suggestion as to the most convenient way for Deputies to discuss the matters which they themselves are very anxious to discuss.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I dissent from that view because the words actually quoted in amendment No. 2 from the Address are &ldquo;The decision of the Ministers to avoid waste and extract the utmost value from all public expenditure.&rdquo; Upon that it is surely relevant for a Minister to state how he proposes to avoid waste and effect economy.  Proceeding further, it is surely relevant for Deputies to state that they do not agree with the Minister's method of avoiding waste and effecting economy.  The method we have been following is that the address is a statement of Government policy.  The Government, having made its statement through the Governor-General, seeks the approbation of the Dáil for their policy as outlined in the Address by means of a motion such as is on the paper.  The Minister for <Col N="763" /> Finance took the opportunity of making an important financial statement, and Deputies desire to propose an amendment and get a vote on a specific matter indicated in it.  That has very distinct relevance to the Governor-General's Address and to the question of whether the Dáil does or does not approve of the Government's programme as outlined therein.  It seems to me that if we continue the general discussion on the Motion of Thanks it would be impossible to avoid the matters mentioned in Deputy Johnson's amendment. Deputy Figgis mentioned matters quite relevant to this particular amendment.  Seeing the position we are in, my suggestion is that we should discuss the amendment, and considerable liberty should be allowed in the discussion of the amendment in dealing with matters of finance.  Having disposed of that, we could then take the other question of Fisheries.  I make the suggestion after a consultation with some Deputies and with knowledge of what certain Deputies will want to discuss.  There is one Deputy, not present at the moment, who will appear sometime in the discussion and will want to speak about Railways. That is a certainty.  He will not be in order in regard to the amendment, but he is entitled to discuss the matter somewhere.  Similarly, Deputy Gorey and others who sit with him will desire to make some statement on Government policy which will give food for thought to the Minister for Agriculture.  These may not be quite relevant to Deputy Johnson's amendment, but I wish to make an arrangement which would allow these matters to be brought up.  It is entirely for the Dáil as to what is decided, but if we discussed the question of finance on this amendment and then went on to the general question and took up other matters, I think it would be conveninent, and the Chair would deal with the matter in a very lenient way from the point of view of irrelevancy with a view to not interfering with the rights of Deputies to discuss the important matters arising out of the Government's statement of policy. While offering that leniency, we could not possibly have a speech made on <Col N="764" /> the amendment and repeated in substance on the main question.  That would be completely wrong.  Before Deputy Johnson moves, I would like to have the view of the Dáil.  I would like it made clear so that the question may not arise later on.  I think Deputy Redmond's statement will be quite in order when we come to the general question.  May I take it that is agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I subscribe to that, and I ask the Dáil to subscribe to that wholeheartedly.  I think it is a very good definition of the term <Col N="765" />&ldquo;economy&rdquo; that we should extract the utmost value from every public and private expenditure.  My amendment seeks to put into this warning the proviso &ldquo;That while approving of that decision, the Dáil cannot agree to methods of retrenchment which would be detrimental to education, or which would cause suffering to the aged poor.&rdquo; I submit that any attempt at retrenchment on the lines indicated by the Minister in regard to education and in regard to old age pensions would not be economy, but would be added waste &mdash;additional waste to the waste in administration, of which mention had been made.  The Dáil listened to the statement of the Minister for Finance with a good deal of interest.  With respect to some parts of it, as far as some Deputies of the Dáil are concerned, they listened to it with great astonishment and surprise.  The majority of the Dáil no doubt were well aware of what was coming.  But those Deputies who are dependent for particulars of policy from the Government upon statements of policy which are made to this assembly, which ought to be the first to hear them, were, I think, taken with surprise by some of the statements made by the Minister.  I was personally inclined to whisper &ldquo;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,&rdquo; but I know the Minister is not a fool, and I had to think of some other explanation of the extraordinary announcement made in the manner in which it was made.  I rather suggested to myself that there was some Iago tempting him to take advantage of his newness to the office, tempting him to do harm to the State under the plea of financial policy and the plea of national economy.  The Minister has got a reputation, I think well deserved, of being intellectually honest, of being very candid, even if I may say so, without disrespect, brutally candid, in his statements to the Dáil.  Again, without disrespect, I would suggest that his statement was not candid, not wholly candid, as I will try to show, but brutal in respect to his reference, both to the teachers and to the old age pensioners. The suggestion of the Minister regarding old age pensioners, which I will deal with first, took the Dáil by surprise. The arguments that were <Col N="766" /> adduced in favour of his proposal rather show me that he had not the time or had not taken the trouble to examine his case with that intellectual honesty which I credit him with, or he would not have stated the case in the manner he did.  He told us that when this pension was first introduced in 1908 the rate in the most usual case was 5/-.  It was not intended at any time that the pension should provide the recipient with an independent and complete means of livelihood.  I do not know whether he intended to infer that 10/- a week was a sufficient sum to provide the recipient with an independent and complete means of livelihood. That is the inference which nine out of ten people would take from the statement. He pointed out that the 10/- was fixed when the cost of living had risen to 120 per cent., and it was now 80 per cent.  Therefore, as he suggested a reduction was valid and justifiable. That proposition is not valid and is not justified.  And if he had examined the case, as normally he would have done, he would not have made that statement. The 10/- rate was adopted when the cost of living had risen to 120 per cent. above pre-war.  It remained at 10/- when the cost of living figure was 176 per cent. above pre-war.  I quote that from the Minister's statement.  If the cost of living figures are to be the index which is to denote the rate for old age pensions, then there ought to have been a rise considerably above the 10/- when the big figure was arrived at. But that is not so.  The Minister will not admit that there is something due to the old age pensioners in consequence of the failure to add to the rate of pension when the cost of living rose above 120 per cent.  I want the Dáil to realise that 5/-, which is the basic figure for the majority of pensions was fixed not in 1914 but in 1908. It remained at 5/- up to a time considerably after the war began, and considerably after prices began to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices rose nine points between 1908 and 1914, and if the Minister wants to argue for his shilling per week reduction on a basis of cost-of-living prices, and he examines the position honestly and candidly, he will see that on that basis there is nothing due to be deducted.  All these prices, according <Col N="767" /> to the figures quoted by him, as compared with 1908, will show an advance from 100 to 195.  Now if he likes to take one-fortieth of a £ off the 10/-, and justifies it on the basis of the decline in the cost of living, these figures will entitle him to do that, but that is all they will entitle him to do.  I submit if there is going to be any argument for a reduction of 1/- per week from old age pensions on the basis of the decline in prices you must take the prices at the time the pensions were fixed, and compare all these prices with present prices.  But I want to ask the Dáil to believe and recognise this consideration that this index figure referred to is a figure based upon family expenditure.  Everyone who knows anything about children knows that the family will consume a very much larger proportion of those articles which have not risen as greatly as other articles which are consumed by old age pensioners. The old age pensioner does not eat so much bread as the youngster &mdash;the growing boy or girl&mdash;and in the family expenditure there are three or four children taken into account in arriving at this index figure.  So that you are trying to mulct the old age pensioner on a basis of declining prices when you take into account these things which are not normally consumed by men and women over 70 years of age.  The largest proportion expended is on tea, sugar, and tobacco, all of which are taxed to a very much greater extent than the normal commodities consumed by the average family, and the Old Age Pensioners by virtue of their consumption of these taxable articles have paid back very much of the increase through the extraordinary increase in taxation upon these articles, such as I have named. So that on the basis of these figures you have no case to put before the Old Age Pensioners of the country in favour of a reduction in the amount of the pensions.  Now the Minister relies to a greater extent perhaps upon another argument.  He speaks of the resources of the country not affording those pensions at the present rate, and he quotes the cost to the Revenue of pensions in the Free State as compared with the cost of pensions in Scotland.  He shows <Col N="768" /> to-day that the cost of pensions in the Free State amounts to 13.2 per cent. of the Revenue, while in Scotland it is only 2 per cent. of the Revenue.  I suppose that fact was known to the members of the Dáil and to the Ministry before they sought to be severed from the British Financial System.  We have all a right to assume they took that into account because if they failed to take that into account they are asking the Old Age Pensioners to bear the burden of their failure.  Are you asking them to be responsible, and to bear a loss consequent upon the history of the last 100 years.  Because Ireland has an extraordinary and abnormal number of men and women over 70 years of age, we are being asked to make these people responsible and to bear that burden.  I say that is not worthy of the Dáil, if the Dáil agrees to that proposition.  We had our eyes open when we were seeking to be served from the British Government system, and we know this was one of the charges that would be imposed upon the country.</P>
    <P>I have never heard, nor read, of any Ministerial statement, or of any statement by any member of the Dáil, which told the people they were going to cut Old Age Pensions as soon as they got control of the finances of the country. The Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture and members of the Dáil in all parts have emphasised the position of agriculture, and the position of the small farmers and we know that there is a very large proportion of these in receipt of Old Age Pensions, that is, that there is a very large class of small farmers in receipt of these pensions.</P>
    <P>In the main, I believe they are entitled to have pensions.  I believe, having done their work for the State as they have done, they are entitled to be considered in their old age, but I think I have heard it said in this House, as I have heard it said elsewhere, that agriculture in Ireland has been notoriously a sweated industry, sweated by the community and, I put it to the farmers' representatives here, this is one way of paying back some of the debt due by the community to the small farming community.  I do not think we should agree for a minute <Col N="769" /> to make old men and women the first portion of the community to be called upon to bear the charges which we now think the State cannot afford.</P>
    <P>The cut in the teachers' salaries, and the proposed additional cut in their salaries is, I submit, distinctly and inevitably a means of hurting the educational system in this country, which we had hoped, and indeed felt confident, was going to be immensely improved under the new condition of affairs.  I say we hoped it was going to be immensely improved under the new condition of affairs, and, perhaps, members of the Ministry interested will recognise the value of a full page advertisement, which appeared in the newspapers on August the 20th, addressed to the people of Ireland and signed Liam T. MacCosgair.  August the 20th is not very long since, and the memories of Deputies can easily go back so far as that date.  The programme of the Government party, signed by the President of the Executive Council, contained this clause:&mdash;&ldquo;Education has long cried out for reconstruction, and we seized the earliest opportunity of making the first and most urgent reform.  We have changed this whole character and outlook by placing the National language and all that concerns the Nation's life in their rightful place, and the next generation will enjoy the fruits of our policy in a citizenry reared in the atmosphere of love and respect of their Motherland, her language, her history, her tradition, her lore.  But the reform of public education cannot rest here. It must be truly modern and progressive, and made a real and a living thing by close relation to the life and the social, agricultural, and industrial conditions and life of the country.  It must have no artificial barrier of class or grade, and it must attract to its service teachers enabled to be efficient and enthusiastic by adequate remuneration. The record of what we have already done shows that we have set our course in the direction of National efficiency and progress in education, and we will introduce early legislation to give effect to a well-considered scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I ask Deputies on the other side of the House is there a single one of <Col N="770" /> them who, three months ago, believed that that proposition was going to be followed by an immediate cut of 10 per cent. in teachers' salaries, with the prospect of an indefinite cut to follow.</P>
    <P>I challenge any member of the Dáil to say that he told his constituents there was going to be a cut in teachers' salaries.  That proposition, which appeared in the programme of the Government Party, signed by the President of the Executive Council, suggested that you were going to enlist the enthusiastic support of the teachers; that you were going to give them adequate remuneration, and that you were going to utilise their enthusiastic support in building up &ldquo;a citizenry reared in the atmosphere of love and respect of their Motherland, her language, her history, her tradition, and her lore.&rdquo;  The Minister for Education, having subscribed to that proposition, consents to this action of the Minister for Finance in cutting the teachers' salaries, and destroying their enthusiasm, in making them discontented and quite unfit to do the work which was in that programme set out by the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy O'Connell has already touched upon the financial proposal, and I have no doubt other Deputies will have more to say on that.  I am not going to enlarge upon the actual financial facts, or the justification, or non-justification, of any action which the Minister has outlined, but I say that the evil genius who first prompted the Minister to take this action seems to have shown an utter disregard of the Government's policy as stated on frequent occasions in regard to the relations between the servants of the State, employees in industry, and their governors or their employers.  A very respected Deputy who was elected to the Dáil, but unfortunately who does not appear here to enable us to add to our admiration of him&mdash;Deputy Alfred O'Rahilly&mdash;used these words when speaking to the Teachers' Congress at Easter time:&mdash;&ldquo;Just as after the French Revolution the pseudo-democratic educators sought to abolish all corporate life and combination, so, in a small way, after our little revolution, there is a distinct tendency to abolish all Councils and Boards and consultative <Col N="771" /> bodies in Education, Agricultural and other Departments.  One of the first fruits of liberty is apparently to be Ministerial bureaucracy.&rdquo;  Perhaps he might have added Treasury autocracy. I think I can see signs of assent from certain Ministers to the suggestion of Treasury autocracy.</P>
    <P>Some little time ago there was raised in the Dáil the question of the action of Treasury officials in ordering that wages should be reduced in certain Departments, without notice and without consideration, cutting them below the ruling rates in the district, and thereby over-riding all questions of fair wages clauses or the usual conditions of employment. Here, again, we find at work the same influence, presumably, which says that the Education Minister may whistle; the salaries of teachers must be cut on the first of November, and no questions asked.  There is a clause in our Constitution which deals with Vocational Councils, and I think the Minister for Finance has indicated a certain assent to that general idea. This method of simply decreeing that certain public servants shall have their salaries reduced on a certain date, without consultation with anybody, is very far removed, indeed, from the idea of Vocational Councils&mdash;is very far removed, indeed, from modern practice in regard to employment, whether in State offices or in private offices.  But mind, it is only these two indefensible elements that are being attacked, notwithstanding all the Minister vaguely hinted at about retrenchments in other Departments.  He did not say in any single case there were going to be reductions. There was a statement that there had been reductions in respect to the Army, but there had not been any reduction in the rates of Army pay to existing soldiers.  The only reductions are in new attestations.  The Minister for Defence was not told by the Minister for Finance that, on and after a certain date, every soldier would have to be cut 10 per cent. in his pay.  He dare not.  The Minister for Home Affairs, through one of his Departments has given assurances that there will be no reduction in the pay of the Civic Guard without consultation. But they can strike back, and I <Col N="772" /> suppose that is the reason.  The Old Age Pensioners have no redress. The teachers can only refuse to teach the children.  What does the Treasury care about that? The late Minister for Education in England very recently said &ldquo;The Treasury notoriously know nothing about education, except that it costs money.&rdquo;  That, apparently, is the position of the Ministry of Finance in the new Saorstát.  I submit that it is bad politics; it is bad economy; it is waste of political knowledge, to attempt to introduce new scales of pay in this autocratic manner without notice, without consultation, without intimation to the Dáil even, that such reductions were going to take place, apart from any question about violation of agreements. I leave that for discussion in another manner.  Even assuming there was perfect justification, apart from agreements altogether, the method of doing this thing is a bad one, impolitic, and ought not to be sanctioned by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Old Age Pensioners may attribute a high degree of responsibility for this reduction in the amount of tea or tobacco or sugar they would have been able to enjoy, to those who have wasted and impoverished the country during the past two years.  It is very easy to blame everything upon the events of the last two years.  It is very easy to say that the Irregulars and the Irregular campaign were responsible, but I think that is another exhibition of lack of candour, at least a failure to examine with that honesty which I say is his general characteristic, this proposition.  The proposition to reduce Old Age Pensions and to reduce teachers' salaries, is to meet normal&mdash;or, as Deputy Figgis calls it&mdash;recurrent expenditure.  It is not touching the abnormal cost of the Army.  It is not touching compensation, and while the Minister may retort that the ability to pay has been reduced, I am going to ask Ministers if there is in existence, and if they will produce to the Dáil, any financial estimates which were before them when they were discussing the Treaty in London? You had the cost of administration before you.  We have the estimates based upon the expenditure of the past <Col N="773" /> few years, and know what the cost of the administration of this country is, and has been.  We had no right&mdash;any of us&mdash;to anticipate that there was going to be any big reduction in the national charges for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>The Treaty was made with certain financial obligations.  It was accepted by the Dáil and the country and confirmed in the Constitution.  That Treaty contemplated the possibility of even larger expenditure than is contained in the estimate that has been placed before us.  We knew that within the bounds of that Treaty every Civil Servant might have resigned and claimed a pension, and that we would be bound to meet those pensions.  We knew that within that Treaty&mdash;it has been mentioned here this afternoon &mdash;we undertook to bear a share of the British National Debt.  I suggest that there are very few members of the Dáil, if any, who have examined the proposition but expected that we would have to pay interest charges upon a portion of the British National Debt. In these estimates that are placed before us there is no charge for that share of the National Debt, and we have no right, therefore, to think that, even if the history of the last two years had not been gone through, the annual charges would have been any less.  Certainly we had no right to count upon that.  We had a right to assume that every item that we were making ourselves possibly liable for, we would have been called upon to pay.  I do not believe any member of the Dáil, or any candidate, elected or not elected, ever put to the people that there were going to be cuts in the cost of education and cuts in the charge for Old Age Pensions. Do not let us hide our responsibilities for present and future taxation behind the Irregular movement. We went into this Treaty with our eyes open.  We knew it was going to be an expensive matter for a few years. Let us bear it, and not try to cut the humanitarian services and those services for education, which are the best investment that the country's money can be put into.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that running through the Minister's statement and through much of the discussion that we are <Col N="774" /> being treated to in the newspapers, such expenditure is being accepted as the same thing as National income.  Of course it is not.  It might well be that the National income was high and State expenditure low.  We ought, if we want to look at this problem seriously and earnestly, distinguish between National monies paid out for education, National monies paid out for these humanitarian social services, such as Old Age Pensions, hospitals, and Poor Law, and the ordinary National expenditure on administration of the army, police, and the like.  Supposing the charge for Old Age Pensions was taken off the National Exchequer and thrown upon the rates, the country would still have to bear it.  The totality of expenditure would be just as high, and perhaps higher.  If the Dáil refused to pay any more money for education, it would not necessarily mean that education was going to be any cheaper, or that the country would have any less money to raise.  It would be simply paying through a different channel, but it would have to be paid or the country would go to ruin.  It seems to me that the Minister is proceeding in quite a wrong direction. Economy in expenditure by all means, full value for all expenditure, private or public, by all means.  But do not take steps which will reduce the value you are getting for the money you are paying.  I would say, without any doubt whatever, that to create discontent and unsettlement amongst the teaching profession is going to reduce considerably the value you are getting for the money you are paying.  That is not economy, and that is not retrenchment in any true sense.  I think, instead of moving towards mere cutting of prices, mere cutting of wages, and mere cutting of salaries, the policy of the Minister should be, rather, to stimulate production and encourage that better return for labour expended. I would be with the Minister heartily if he would say, &ldquo;We are paying four millions for education.  That four millions is being raised out of the taxpayer's pocket.  We want to see that a larger proportion of that four million is expended upon articles produced in this country, thereby employing other people through the expenditure of the <Col N="775" /> salary that the State is paying.&rdquo;  You will need to raise more money.  I have not the slightest hope that the Minister will be able to carry out his policy of reducing taxation.  I have not the slightest hope that it will be possible to carry on on the present rate of taxation.  You may have to change the incidence of taxation, but you will have to raise the present amount, and perhaps more.  I suggest that the true line of policy should be, not to cut on those services and reduce their value, but to look round for other means of raising money to pay for this necessary and useful public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he cannot consider increased taxation.  I hope he will be able to carry on the Government of the country in the manner which was outlined in the programme of the Government Party at the elections, without increased taxation.  I believe it is impossible, and I believe, before the winter is through, that he will find a very heavy demand upon the public Exchequer, if he wants to save trouble from the rising numbers of unemployed. In the spring-time we warned the Ministers that the new system of paying Insurance might be all right, provided that employment were to become general before October.  The Minister, through the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce, told us that the plans outlined in that Unemployment Insurance Amendment Bill contemplated and hoped for a general revival of industry before the end of October.  That has not taken place.  The number of unemployed is increasing, and their ability to sustain themselves while unemployed is steadily decreasing.  The prospect is not hopeful for the promise of the Minister that he will carry on without increased taxation.  He may find, as he will find, that he will have to put taxes upon imported manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>He will have to find revenue by some means and probably he will find it by that means.  It would be of some interest to the country and to many anxious employers of labour to know what the Government's policy in that respect is, or if they have any policy yet.  Perhaps, before I sit down I may ask the Minister if he would, before <Col N="776" /> the debate closes, enlarge a little more upon his references to expenditure on roads and expenditure on houses.  He is not prepared, he says, to involve the State in any additional charge for an expenditure on roads, but he hopes that perhaps there will be a million and a quarter spent during the next eighteen months on improvement and repairs. That one and a quarter millions partly is to come out of motor vehicle duties apparently, plus the special rate which the County Councils are required to pay to the Exchequer under recent legislation.  I would like some enlightenment on that because the best figures I can find do not show me any sum beyond £800,000, at the maximum, for that 18 months, and it would be a pity to deceive the country into thinking that there will be an expenditure of one and a half millions on roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one and a quarter millions on roads, and there is not much sign of it as far as the figures that have been presented in different quarters up to now, would show.  Further, I would like a little more enlightenment on what is meant by the Minister when he says it is an essential feature of these schemes that they cannot be initiated until definite recognition is given to that fact that the Government and the financial and economic interests of the country cannot consent to allow them to be conducted in a manner that would keep prices or wages above the nominal level at which they stand at the present time.  That to me rather suggests that, while promising that there will be expenditure, he is taking good care to show that there will be none.  I may be wrong in my interpretation, but it seems to me to suggest that there must first of all be a campaign of wage-cutting before there will be any expenditure on public works.  By allowing a loud clamour of unemployed men to be heard, and keeping them clamouring, you will be able to cut down the level of wages, and then all things will be beautiful.  I hope the Minister is not building upon that.  I am afraid if he is it will be calamitous. <Col N="777" /> I do not want to say anything in that matter that would make things more difficult.  But, if there is any intention to use the unemployed as a lever to bring down the general rates of wages and to allow that to happen by virtue of that clamour and that contest and competition for jobs, well, that way madness lies.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Dáil in this amendment to declare that it will not agree to any curtailment in expenditure which will be detrimental to the interests of education or will cause suffering to the aged poor.  I hope the Dáil will tell the country by its vote on this question that it is not prepared to put burdens which we all foresaw upon these two elements in the community, and make them bear the first charge. I am one of those, and I have said it here before, who believes there will be need of a very general simplification of life in this country so far as the better-off sections are concerned.  If we try to emulate in expenditure Great Britain, or even the habits of the past, when we were identified with and bound up with the British economic and financial system, we shall perish.  I believe it will be good for the country to reduce expenditure on luxuries.  I am with Deputy Egan on that.  But when I see forms of luxury, when I see lavish expenditure on motor cars, and other forms of luxury, I wonder whether the Minister is looking in the right direction for his economy, for his retrenchment and for his additional finance.  I think not.  I think certainly he has been tempted down the wrong road when he was tempted to have a slap at the old age pensioners and the school teachers.</P>

      <P>I hope the Dáil will give full and complete support to the Minister for Finance in the two cuts he proposes to make, amongst the many other cuts which he will find it necessary <Col N="778" /> to make, if we are to run this country successfully, namely, to balance the Budget.  I will try to meet, as far as I can, the numberless points which Deputy Johnson made, but I hope I will not emulate his heroic language. I will attempt to meet his points.  First of all, he complains about the methods.  He objects to the methods adopted by the Minister for Finance in this regard.  He talks about autocracy.  He asks us do we hear of Vocational Councils now.  He complains that there is a tendency to abolish all Consultative Bodies.  I do not know what that has got to do with this case.  The Minister for Finance comes forward here with two proposals. They are only the first steps.  He tells the Dáil that he proposes to make these cuts.  There is a full and free and frank opportunity for criticism.  No member of the Dáil will be gagged. No member of the Dáil will be forced to vote for the Government.</P>
      <P>We are here in the hands of the Parliament of the country, and the Parliament can, if it wishes, turn this down. That is not autocracy; it is democracy. We defend these proposals on their merits.  We put them to you on their merits, and it is you who have the last word.  If that is autocracy, then the word has taken up a new meaning. Deputy Johnson's speech was like the sting of an adder.  I think it is the adder that has the sting in its tail&mdash; or is it?  The speech, however, is like whatever animal has the sting in its tail.  After a speech of an hour, he made just one suggestion to meet this deficit, namely, a cut in the salaries of certain officers in the Army; that was his only specific suggestion in the way of cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is mistaken.  While I might agree with the proposition, I did not make the suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, perhaps, a little too subtle for me.  When he referred to Army salaries, I took it that what he really meant was that we might look for retrenchment in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the cut had not been made in existing Army <Col N="779" /> salaries, but on new attestations, and men would attest on new terms; that is the point I was making, and it is very different from the method of treating the teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to take it that Deputy Johnson did not mean to suggest that some retrenchment could be made on Army salaries, then he made no suggestion except one, and that was increased taxation.  After one hour's speech, the one constructive proposal of the Deputy is increased taxation. In an impassioned moment he turns to the farmers and asks them are they going to stand this&mdash;are they going to stand for a one shilling reduction from what Deputy Byrne calls the poor old age pensioners, and what Deputy Johnson himself properly calls the aged poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson asks the farmers are they going to stand for this, and he suggested to them that a way to meet the case is to increase taxation and to put a tax on imported manufactured goods.  I deal with this at length because it was his one constructive proposal.  I think we all agree on one thing, and that is, it is absolutely necessary for the Minister to balance his Budget.  The one constructive proposal of Deputy Johnson was increased taxation, and the putting of a tax on imported manufactured goods. I hope that commends itself to the farmers. I hope they like the prospect of increased taxation, and I hope the country will like it, as the Labour solution of the present problem.  I hope the farmers in particular will like the proposal to put a tax on imported manufactured goods.  At the present moment the increased figure for farmers' prices is between 36 and 40 per cent. above pre-war level, and the index figure for what they have to buy but do not produce is about 100 per cent. What will be the case if a tax be put on imported manufactured goods? Deputy Johnson is good at mathematics, as he has shown in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> I would like him to tell us what the index figure would be for what the farmers must buy, and what effect it will have on the index figure of what the farmer sells.  I do not think it would improve it, and I would be surprised if the farmers thought so.</P>
    <P>When all the heroics are set aside, and when we have to come down to hard facts, then we find ourselves in the same position as the Minister for Finance found himself when he came down to hard facts.  The one proposal of the Deputy is increased taxation and a duty on imported manufactured goods. I am perfectly certain that Deputy Johnson examined the field pretty carefully. He always does his work thoroughly, and I am sure if he could have pointed out alternative methods of finding money instead of increasing taxation and putting a duty on imported manufactured goods, he would have done it.  I will say that for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the responsibility is not yours.  The responsibility, unfortunately, is on the Minister for Finance.  He must do it.  The Deputy has been criticising him, and has been showing how wrong he is.  The Deputy pointed out: &ldquo;This way madness lies.&rdquo; The responsibility is on the Minister for Finance, but the irresponsibility seems to be Deputy Johnson's.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Dáil that if Deputy Johnson, on behalf of the Labour Party, could have made a single constructive suggestion except these two he would do it.  Now, we have got to get this money by means of these cuts.  We have got to get more money, and there will be many more cuts, and these will have to be made, too.  The Minister for Finance will balance his Budget, if it can be done, and this is only a beginning. These two cuts should be looked upon in that light.  Deputy Johnson dealt with old age pensions first.  He went into figures, and announced that we were not justified in proceeding on the cost of living figure in making this cut.  These pensions were increased in the year, I think, 1920.  I am not sure about the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made <Col N="781" /> was, and I think the Minister will agree when I remind him of it, that if the cost of living figure is to be made the basis of the cut, then I say it is not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the point. The pensions were increased when the cost of living figure was 120.  I do not remember at the moment the year in which the increases were given, but I know that the cost of living figure at the time was 120.  Why, I ask, were the pensions increased?  They were increased because of the increase in the cost of living, and as a concession to the fact that the cost of living had increased. Therefore, I say the Minister for Finance is perfectly justified, unless somebody goes into the merits of the case and shows him that he is wrong, in taking the pensions in that year, the year in which the pensions were increased because of the fact that the cost of living had increased, and in saying that &ldquo;the cost of living figure in that year was 120, but it has decreased by 33 per cent. since; therefore, I propose to decrease the pensions only by 10 per cent.&rdquo;  On the face of it, I say that is a reasonable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson wondered why the Minister for Finance should have said that the pensions were never meant to take the place, let us say, of wages, and that they were never intended to be the sole means of livelihood of a particular recipient. The Deputy wondered why the Minister said that.  He said it for the simple reason that arguments were being advanced here which would have no validity, except that the people using these arguments had suggested that these pensions were fixed on that basis.  They were not fixed on that basis.  I do not think it was ever suggested by anyone that they were fixed on that basis.  There has been a decrease of 33 per cent. in the cost of living figure since they were fixed, and I think the Minister for Finance has made a perfectly reasonable proposal. He proposes to put the pensioners in a far better position than they were in at the time when the pensions were fixed originally, having regard to the cost of living figure.  There is no doubt about that.  He proposes to put the old-age <Col N="782" /> pensioners in a better position than they were in immediately after the pensions were fixed on the last occasion. There is no denying that.  Deputy Johnson, I must say, worked out his own suggestion to its logical conclusion. It was that we should not take the year 1914, which has been invariably taken up to this, but that we should take previous years.  Will he, I ask, admit that principle in regard to other questions that may arise.  I would be interested to know that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Johnson asks us to do at this stage is to pay the old-age pensioners what they should have been paid in respect of losses between 1908 and 1914.  That is what his suggestion comes to, and that is what you have to consider in the present state of our finances.  You have also to keep before you the fact that the Minister for Finance proposes to leave the old-age pensioners in a much better position than they were in at the time the pensions were fixed on the last occasion, having regard to the cost of living figure, then and now.  But, if we were to follow Deputy Johnson's suggestion to its logical conclusion, what we should do is to pay the old-age pensioner what he should have got between the years 1908 and 1914.  I say that the Deputy's suggestion is merely juggling with figures, and leads us nowhere, and that life is too short for that sort of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of heroics about the poor old-age pensioners, but we here on these benches may have just as much sympathy with the old-age pensioners as the people who employ all the adjectives.  I will tell Deputy Johnson and Deputy Alfred Byrne how they can put the old-age pensioner in a far better position than he would be in, even if we were to leave him this shilling a week.  If they are really interested in the old-age pensioners and in the teachers, if they do fear that this cut of 10 per cent. on the teachers and of 1/- in 10/- on the pensioners is going to have very serious results, so far as education is concerned on the one hand and the poor laws on the <Col N="783" /> other, they can at least help to remedy it if they would only tackle the problem with half the enthusiasm that they are tackling us at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Help to reduce the cost of living figure&mdash;and Deputy Johnson can help more than any man in that direction&mdash;to 72.  That is a proposition that labour can help in just as it is a proposition that capital can help in. I just want to say this, that having been in fairly close touch with the industrial situation during the last month, my experience is this, and it is the truth: Labour does not care whether the cost of living figure goes up or down provided the present wages are maintained, and capital, the employers in Dublin as a body&mdash;there are exceptions of course on both sides&mdash; does not care whether the cost of living figure goes up or down provided present profits are maintained.  That is undoubtedly the moral to be drawn from what has happened during the last month.  Labour and capital between them can solve these questions which have many reactions, far more reactions than these reactions on the teachers and old-age pensioners, but that is a matter which I will take another opportunity to deal with.  I repeat that if Deputy Johnson and Deputy Alfred Byrne are really in earnest, and if they really feel the sympathy with the poor that they say they feel&mdash;Deputy Johnson certainly and Deputy Alfred Byrne almost equally certainly&mdash;and if they tackle this question with the same enthusiasm and conviction that they have shown as regards these two cuts, they could help the poor five times as effectively by bringing down the cost of living figure and, in addition, they would be doing a good turn to everybody in the country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These heroics that we have listened to are absolutely unreal.  All this talk about the old-age pensioners and about the teachers sounds very hollow to anyone who knows the real facts of the case.  I would want a lot of persuasion to believe that there is any real sympathy <Col N="784" /> with the old-age pensioners or with the teachers or with any of the other down-trodden classes in the country amongst any persons or parties who have examined the industrial, and the general, situation in the country.  If you want to help the people who are poor in this country, and if you want to help national economy, the thing to do is to concentrate in bringing down the cost of living figure, and that must be done from both sides.  Unfortunately, the farmers, who are being appealed to, are in the position that they must wait while both sides here in Dublin, which is the key to the position, say, &ldquo;Who will begin?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards the teachers, Deputy Johnson did not take exactly the same line as Deputy O'Connell who suggested that we had broken an agreement, and that this cut was a violation of a contract.  That argument does not hold water.  Would anyone suggest that if the cost of living went up by, say, 500 or 1,000 per cent., as it might easily do&mdash;a very small thing would bring about such a situation as you may realise if you look at Germany and other countries&mdash;that the teachers would not come and ask for an increase in their salaries.  Equally, is it suggested that if the cost of living suddenly fell to par that the State should look on and say &ldquo;We made an agreement with the teachers in 1920, when the cost of living figure was 180, and we cannot touch their salaries now.&rdquo;  These are two extreme cases. Surely, no reasonable man will say that the teachers would not be entitled to an increase if the cost of living figure went up enormously, or that, on the other hand, the State would not be entitled to make a reduction if the cost of living figure fell to par.</P>
    <P>If that is so, the one question to consider here is, whether the 10 per cent.  cut is justified on the facts, figures, and merits of the case.  We had three speeches on this question, one from the Minister for Finance, one from Deputy O'Connell, and one from Deputy Johnson.  The only figures quoted in these speeches were the figures given by the Minister for Finance. He said that the teachers' salaries had been increased three and a <Col N="785" /> half times.  Deputy O'Connell called attention, and rightly called attention, to the fact that the basic salaries paid to the teachers were very low.  I will agree that you could conceive such a state of affairs that would justify an increase of three and a half times if the basic salaries were extremely low. It may be that at the present moment, in the interests of the teachers and of fair play, that their salaries should be increased three or three and a half times.  But, I ask, let us have the figures.  The Minister for Finance makes a plain suggestion.  He says that the salaries were fixed in 1920, at a time when the cost of living figure was 180, and he proposes to take 10 per cent. off their salaries at a time when the cost of living figure has fallen by more than 100.  That, I think, is a reasonable proposition.  Let Deputy O'Connell produce his figures here if he has a good case.  Deputy Johnson did not attempt to do it, but let Deputy O'Connell produce his figures and give the salaries that the teachers are paid if he says we are doing wrong.  Let him show what 10 per cent.  would amount to; let him show it to us and to the country, and we are willing to be judged on the merits of the case; but, as I have said, there has been no attempt made to do that.  We have to carry all the blows and do the unpopular thing, but there has been no attempt made up to the present to show the Minister for Finance how he is to get about one million pounds to balance his Budget this year, the recurrent Budget of this year.  The Minister stated that he has to meet a deficit of something over a million on his Budget this year.</P>
    <P>We were asked some time ago not to approach this question in a party spirit.  We were advised, and I think it was good advice, to take the country and the Dáil into our confidence, and to put all our cards on the table, and we were promised co-operation and told we could not get on without co-operation. We realised that.  This is a big job, and we want the help of every man of good will and of every man who means business.  But, it is not exactly in that spirit that these sort of speeches have been made. People are not entitled to get up and <Col N="786" /> attack us, on what they consider a politically vulnerable issue, in extravagant language, without at least making reasonable suggestions.  We heard a lot about salaries, and that the Dáil is entitled to know if people are being paid too much.  I say that the Dáil is entitled to know that the salaries we pay are what we can afford to pay. We hear a lot of loose talk about salaries. Letters appear in the newspapers which save other people from troubling to think about them.  They say they know what salaries are being paid. There may have been extravagances; it would be impossible if there were not, but they have been extremely few in the circumstances.  We do not pretend to be perfect, but every sensible man here knows that no possible retrenchment of salaries in the case of the men who have been appointed since the Treaty, could get us £50,000. Let us have some measured language in our criticism.  We will not fill up this big gap of over a million pounds simply by saying &ldquo;salaries.&rdquo;  It is hardly fair to suggest either, as Deputy Figgis suggested, that we are now proposing to appoint seven Parliamentary Secretaries at £8,400.  That is not a fact.  The Ministers' Bill is to construct the framework of the various Government services for the future.  It is proposed, under the provisions in that Bill, to co-ordinate services like agriculture, education, and industries which were previously scattered under this, that, and the other head.  That will do more for economy, in my opinion, in a year or two years than any other measure that could be brought forward with the same object.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling. In the end, in addition to the two constructive suggestions which Deputy Johnson made to meet this deficit, namely, increased taxation, and putting taxes on imported goods, he suggested additional expenditure.  After balancing the Budget by increased taxation, we are to borrow, I presume, for the <Col N="787" /> additional expenditure we will have. I agree, we have to spend money on useful reconstructive work, but it is to put himself in a position in which he can go with his head up and ask for money that the Minister for Finance proposes these cuts, and he will find it necessary to make more cuts.  We cannot be going round in a circle.  There must be no decrease in wages, no decrease in profits, and old age pensions must remain the same.  There are going to be a good many increases in taxation and other things, but there must be no decrease in expenditure and yet we are to find money to balance our Budget.  It is not business. I invite the other Deputy who has put down this amendment about the aged poor to tell the Minister for Finance where he is going to get this million.  We have, I think, exhausted salaries.  In addition to these cuts we want others, and I invite Deputy Alfred Byrne to show the Minister where he can get the necessary money.</P>

      <P>If I had been framing this amendment perhaps I would not have used the exact words which we find on the Order Paper, but with the general intention of the amendment I am in complete accord.  Now the Minister for Agriculture has sought to reply to Deputy Johnson's various arguments, but I approach this question from a somewhat different angle, though perhaps arriving at the same conclusion as Deputy Johnson himself. The real question I want to put to the Government is, why have they&mdash;and presumably they must have a reason for doing so&mdash;hit upon these two specific cases for immediate reduction and retrenchment?  I want to know <Col N="788" /> whether they have exhausted every channel of inquiry into every other means whereby they could secure this million which will be required to make up the unfortunate deficit and if they have not made these necessary inquiries, I say that it was, and is, their bounden duty to do so.  These two items&mdash;old age pensions and teachers' salaries&mdash;are, to my mind, the very last sources from which the Minister for Finance should seek to make up his million deficit.  Therefore, I seriously would urge upon the Government the sensibility of the proposal put forward the other day by Deputy Bryan Cooper, namely, that if they had not yet had inquiries made into every other means of securing this supply they should now, and it is not yet too late, set up a small Committee to make inquiries into every possible, available, financial source, including, especially, Government staffs and Government departments whereby they may be enabled to raise the sum by methods of retrenchment. It would not possibly take very great time, and it would put the Government in a particularly strong position if they would be enabled to come to the Dáil and to tell the country that after making these exhaustive inquiries they find that these two sources are the only two whereby for the moment they shall be able to secure this sum.  I do say this, that if it were at all possible, any other source would be better than to deprive the aged poor of their wretched and miserable pittance, because it is nothing else, and also the teachers of the salary which was agreed upon by the late Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has taunted Deputy Johnson with making no alternative suggestion, but the increase of taxation and the diminishing of salaries.  This is the first occasion I have had the opportunity of making any suggestion, and most tentatively I immediately accept his challenge and venture to make some upon my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, I welcome most heartily the Minister for Finance's statement with regard to the general policy of retrenchment, but he was exceptionally vague as to how that policy was to be applied, except in regard to these <Col N="789" /> two particular instances.  It is true he did say it might be possible to scrap some Ministries in the future.  I will make one suggestion here at once: that is, that the Ministry for Fisheries should be scrapped here and now.  I am as interested in fisheries as any Deputy in this Dáil, but to have for us, a population of little over three and a quarters millions in the Free State, a separate Ministry of Fisheries, when Great Britain, with a population of thirty-three and a quarter millions, has no separate Ministry of Fisheries, but whose Ministry of Fisheries is incorporated with the Ministry of Agriculture&mdash;I think is utter extravagance upon our part.  I think that no better or more capable Minister could be found to deal with the necessary and, perhaps, complicated problems in regard to our Fisheries in the future, than the Minister for Agriculture who has spoken.  There is one definite proposal I make now, that that Ministry be instantly scrapped.  That may not amount to a million pounds, but it goes some way towards it.  I will make further suggestions.  It is not only in the question of particular individual salaries that economies can be made. Enquiry is necessary in order to avoid that snake-like system of redundancy which, unfortunately, has crept into our administration to-day.  It is common knowledge that there are walking about the streets of Dublin efficient Civil Servants who have not only nothing to do, but are not allowed to do anything, but who are paid huge pensions, and in whose place others have been put who have to be paid salaries. I say that after examination by a Committee such as I suggest, the Minister for Finance would be able to make extraordinarily large economies by cutting down existing staffs of the various Departments.  I would make further suggestions.</P>
    <P>Is it proposed still to indulge in the policy of &ldquo;sack the lot&rdquo;?  Are all the existing Judges to be dispensed with? I do not think that is the present intention of the Government, but it may have been their intention some time ago.  At the commencement of the sitting of this Dáil I asked a question of the President whether it would be an <Col N="790" /> immediate saving to the Irish Exchequer to retain as many of the present Judges as possible.  He admitted that was so.  Is it the present intention of the Government to do so, or do they intend paying two-thirds of the salaries of those Judges out of the Free State Exchequer and appointing additional ones?  I think that is a very pertinent question.  This does not only apply to judges.  It applies equally to Civil Servants generally.  It applies to Clerks of the Crown and Peace.  Is it the intention of the Government to scrap them and appoint new ones?  I would like to know what was the cost of doing away with the late Crown Solicitors. We have had to appoint other solicitors in their place, and we have paid for dispensing with the existing ones.  The Minister for Agriculture also seemed to suggest that it was up to both employers and employees, typified, as he made them out to be, by the persons of Deputies Johnson and Hewat, to bring down the cost of living and thereby place the old age pensioners in as good a position as they were previously. That is a very good idea, and one to which I thoroughly subscribe.  But why apply it solely to old age pensioners? Why not fix upon some other group of citizens in the country?  Reduce the expenditure upon them, and the same argument applies both in regard to Deputy Johnson's and Deputy Hewat's efforts in the future.  I think we have yet to be told by the Government, not so much on what grounds they justify this actual cut of 10 per cent, but why they propose the cut at all in regard to these two classes and not in regard to the others.  The Minister for Agriculture has said, in regard to teachers, that if the cost of living went up would it not be suggested that their salaries should be increased?  He knows as well as I do, and as well as the rest of the members here, that the salaries of the teachers were not increased on the basis of the cost of living, but that their salaries were increased because they were endeavouring to exist upon a starvation wage.</P>
    <P>It was never an adequate wage.  That was the finding of the Committee of Inquiry, the result of which was the agreement, stated to be a permanent <Col N="791" /> one, the breaking of which is complained of by Deputy O'Connell.  Therefore, as regards the teachers it is not a question of the cost of living, and I may say here, for my own part, if there is one branch of all others where I would be generous, where I would be lavish, even to the point of extravagance, it would be in regard to the proper remuneration of Irish teachers. Goodness knows, I had enough experience in another place of endeavouring to extract some recognition of the value and the worth of teachers.  The Government of that time had their lesson in their treatment of them, and I hope that the Government of to-day will not find the same result.  I do not propose to go into the question of the merits of these reductions.  I am in favour of a policy of retrenchment; I want retrenchment, because it is a living necessity.  If we are to exist, we must cut our cloth according to our measure.  But, what I do object to is that these two classes, without adequate explanation, should be specially singled out and fixed upon as the two who are to be made the victims of immediate reductions.  The statement of the Minister for Finance&mdash;which I think was rather overdue, because it was really the first financial statement of any importance, for the last year at any rate&mdash;contains some items which I certainly would like to have cleared up.  We know that there are debt charges for loans from banks.  We have not been told either the amount of the loans or the amount of the debt charges, and I think that that is a very important consideration.  Neither did the Minister for Finance refer to what we might term our Great War Debt.  We all hope that under the Clause in the Treaty the set-off of overtaxation in the past will more than counterbalance the amount of War Debt due from us to the Imperial Exchequer. I think we are owed more than that, because, judging from newspaper reports, and from Ministerial statements, the Six County Parliament has already been allowed a considerable amount of abatement in regard to the War Debt which they so eagerly and so willingly adopted.  I think, therefore, that it would be well, especially <Col N="792" /> in view of the coming Loan, if matters like this could be cleared up.  In regard to the question of currency, there I must part from Deputy Figgis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I am not altogether in agreement with Deputy Figgis in regard to the question of currency.  I think, as we have to float a Loan, the least we say about currency the better, except perhaps to make that Loan a success.  Now that the matter has been raised, I think it would be most advisable for the Minister for Finance to assure the country that he has no intention of tampering with the existing currency. I think that that would distinctly reassure the people who would have doubts about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the amount of the Loan, the rate of interest and its character, we are in complete darkness.  I think it would be well also if the Minister for Finance could clear the air on that point.  Before he comes to any definite conclusion, at least, before he makes any public statement binding himself and his Government to any particular form or amount of Loan, perhaps I might be allowed to make this suggestion. Taking for granted that we want to raise this Loan in Ireland, our problem is how best to achieve that object. I would divide the investing community into two classes, the one, the larger investor, the man who has large sums of money at his disposal, or companies, or charities, for that matter, and the <Col N="793" /> other the small individual investor, and I would provide one form of Loan for each.  I would suggest that there should be, as there was in Great Britain during the war, a Loan at, if necessary, a lower rate of interest, but free of Income Tax, for the large investor, similar to the 4 per cent.  Loan which was such a success in Great Britain, and I would go so far as to say that for the small class of Irish investor nothing would secure the money and fill the coffers for the Minister for Finance better than an issue of premium bonds. To the ordinary Irishman it does not matter very much, when he invests £5 or £10, whether he is to get 5 per cent. or 3½ per cent., but it does matter if, when investing £5 or £10, and getting only 3½ per cent. interest, he may have a chance one fine day of finding himself in the possession of thousands of pounds.  I throw out these suggestions on this occasion because, according to the ruling, I am afraid that this is the last opportunity that I will have for doing so on the Governor-General's address. That is why I have taken advantage of this opportunity to ask the Minister for Finance to consider these various aspects and, if he possibly can, to clear the public mind of any doubts that exist in regard to these various questions in order to ensure the success of the Loan which he is about to issue. I do say in regard to these proposed cuts that there are, in my opinion, other means at the disposal of the Government for obtaining this £1,000,000, and even if they cannot see to it, even if they are able to come here and say, &ldquo;We know of no other means,&rdquo; I say it is still their duty to take advantage of the suggestion put forward by Deputy Bryan Cooper, to have a Committee appointed to exhaust every possible channel of inquiry before they proceed to cut down the salary, in the one case, and the pension in the other, of the two classes who should be the last resource of any Finance Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up much of the time of the Dáil in connection with this discussion, as I understand the matter will be taken up again on Friday, but I would like, if possible, that the Minister for Finance would put before the Dáil the <Col N="794" /> cuts he intends to make as regards the various other persons in receipt of salaries.  Undoubtedly there does appear to be a difficulty from the point of view of the selection of National teachers and Old Age Pensioners, because the first question put to the person is &ldquo;Why are these selected?&rdquo; and if the Minister for Finance would outline his other suggested cuts it would leave the Dáil in a very much better position, and we would know better how to record our votes.  It is perfectly evident to the Dáil and the public that cuts and retrenchments must be made in the various positions, and it would be well if the Minister for Finance would state what he intends to do in this respect, so that teachers and Old Age Pensions will not appear to be victims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely endorse what Deputy Redmond has said on the subject of the Loan.  I do not endorse everything he said, but on the subject of the Loan he has expressed my views better than I could. I do not know if the Minister for Finance expected his proposals to be agreed to with joy.  If so, he will have been disappointed.  I regret that he finds it necessary to make a cut in the Old Age Pensions, and the reason I regret it is because I am extremely anxious to see Income Tax brought down to the British level.  I realise that in a democratic state it would be very difficult for a Minister for Finance to bring down the Income Tax, having reduced the Old Age Pensions.  I do not ask him not to make the cut, but I suggest while making the cut he should look into the Income Tax Acts, and into their administration carefully, because he made a strong case, a case that has never been answered outside the Dáil, and which Deputy Johnson has not attempted to answer, when he said that 13 per cent. of the National Income went to pay Old Age Pensions as against 2 per cent. in Scotland.  I think Deputy Johnson's answer to that was that Ireland had an abnormal number of people over 70 years of age.  That abnormal number of people are old friends of mine.  I have been meeting them for the last 15 years.  From 1908, when the Old Age Pensions were introduced, <Col N="795" /> we were told that Ireland had an abnormal number of people over 70 years of age.  That was true in 1908, but if true now there must be an abnormal number of people now over 100 years.  There were special circumstances in these days, owing to the effect of the famine and the exodus caused by the famine, but I believe now that the balance has been redressed, but that there is an abnormal number of people prepared to transfer their property to other people to get the pension.  We should take into consideration not only the pensioner's own means, but the means of his children, who ought to support their parents in their old age, if they have the means to do it.  An amendment should be introduced on these lines, and the Minister should not shrink from the consequences of making it legal liability for children to support their parents where they have the means to do it.  A man is legally obliged to support his wife, and why should not children who have farms be compelled to support their parents?  I have heard of one case, in Co. Carlow, where a man has the old age pension, and he has a son who is receiving £1,000 a year in the Police Force in Singapore.  There are, as we all know, cases of that kind.</P>

      <P>The jurisdiction does not extend to Singapore. Deputy Johnson has made a point against that on legal grounds, but that is not a thing on which I would make a suggestion on.  I leave it to the Attorney-General.  I wish to turn from the old age pensioners with that suggestion&mdash;to the question of National Teachers.  It is very remarkable we have heard so little from the Labour Party, that Deputy Johnson's has been the only speech on this amendment, and it is still more remarkable that Deputy Johnson, with his usual wisdom, will not go into Deputy O'Connell's point regarding broken contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been made a great deal of.  I think it is germane to the debate because Deputy O'Connell used it in argument on this question.  It has been made an enormous amount of outside <Col N="796" /> the Dáil, both by the National Teachers at their meetings and in correspondence in the Press.  It was stated that a contract was made in 1920, and it is now being broken by the Minister. Was there never a contract made before 1920?  Did not every Teacher who entered the employment of the State, enter into a contract to serve for a certain salary?  Did the Teacher ever hesitate to have that salary increased? Never.  You cannot have a contract binding on the employer and not on the employee.  I took that view when I heard Deputy O'Connell speaking, and I am confirmed by this publication which is issued by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>

      <P>This publication says that in October, 1918, the teachers applied to have their claim for a temporary war bonus considered by the Arbitration Board.  It was considered and adjudicated on, and it was far from satisfactory; but one of the conditions under which it was decided was that all the parties should pledge themselves beforehand to accept and abide by any decision arrived at by the Arbitration Board.  The Teachers accepted the 1918 award, much as they were dissatisfied with its terms.  The Teachers renewed their application for increased salaries and in June, 1919, they put forward a claim for a permanent scale.  They abided by the award for nine months.  They never hesitated to agitate to have their wages increased whenever they got an agreement they did not like, and is the Minister for Finance then to be debarred from taking steps to have their wages decreased when a new situation arises? Are the Teachers to be at liberty at any time to agitate against an agreement they have made, and pledged themselves to abide by?  No wonder this publication is called &ldquo;Broken Pledges&rdquo;; the title is very appropriate indeed.  Surely the common sense of the whole matter is that every contract is subject to variation.  Take a case in which Deputy Good is to build me a house and a contract is entered into.  Circumstances arise which make it onerous or impossible, and we can go <Col N="797" /> into court.  If we establish a case we can have that contract set aside.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has appealed to Caesar in this amendment. If the amendment is carried, the Government go out of office and the Deputy has made his point.  Surely it is not illegitimate on the part of the Minister to bring this forward?  If he made the cut and refused us an opportunity of discussing it, I think it would be unfair; but, in the circumstances, I do not understand Deputy Johnson's point.  I understand it almost as little as the suggestion that the National Teachers are peculiarly helpless, and not like the Army or the Gárda Síochána; they cannot strike back.  I have been reading the reports of meetings of National Teachers, and I am bound to say that they have a pretty shrewd idea of how to hit back.  I read the report of a meeting in Dublin.  I do not know if Deputy Johnson was there, but Deputy O'Connell was, and he made a very judicious speech.  A gentleman called Quinn at that meeting remarked that it would be the duty of all Teachers to advise the parents of the children not to invest in the Government's loan.  That is a somewhat new idea of patriotism.  He <Col N="798" /> finally wound up by saying that if the Minister for Finance gave them all they wanted they would do their duty, but if not he might look out for trouble.  These are the gentlemen who cannot strike back.  It seems to me they can strike pretty effectively.  I think that gentleman is a constituent of mine.  As a teacher of citizenship and patriotism, I should say he was very highly paid, indeed, whatever salary he got, even if it were only a penny.  Deputy Johnson's remedy is increased taxation.  He made a great point of the Government's election manifesto.  Unfortunately, during the elections he was laid up, and I do not think he can have brought home to those responsible for his campaign that his idea for removing the evils of the State was to increase taxation.  I do not remember seeing anywhere in print: &ldquo;Vote for Johnson and Increased Taxation.&rdquo;  I sometimes wonder what would be the result if he had issued that?  Secondly, his remedy was that the well-to-do classes would have to be content with simpler mode of living.  They would have to do away with their motor cars, for instance. My withers are unwrung.  I sold my car fourteen months ago and I could not get another one, because I have to meet double the taxation I was liable for in 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to pay double taxation now on a smaller income.  I wonder has it escaped Deputy Johnson's notice that there is an island three hours' journey away where that scale of living does not apply.  Deputy Johnson must have a most extraordinary idea of the patriotism of the well-to-do classes in this country.  I never realised it before, but I did not gather it from his speeches.  He thinks that this class who have money in investments&mdash;investments that can be transferred&mdash; are tied to Ireland.  They are not. What is left of their property they can easily dispose of, or they are probably prepared to sacrifice, and yet Deputy Johnson expects them to stay here and pay heavy taxation, when it is perfectly easy for them to transfer themselves and their investments to Great Britain, the Channel Islands, France, or anywhere else on the globe, and <Col N="799" /> enjoy those amenities of existence that Deputy Johnson would not allow them here.  His one remedy and solution for the evils of the State is increased taxation.  Surely that way madness lies.  No, sir, nobody likes economy.  All economies are unpleasant, but taking it in this scale between Deputy Johnson and the Government I shall vote for the Minister for Finance's proposal and against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is more or less expected from me and from the Party that I represent, that we should define our attitude on this question.  I believe before the Minister for Finance ever came in for hard knocks over this question of the teachers' salaries that I had been having my share of it.  I, too, have occupied columns after columns in the Press for the part I took here seven or eight months ago over the very same question.  At that time, I simply gave a bald statement of what the salaries were.  I made very little comment, and the statements that I made then have been borne out by several others.  The statements that I made then, I am prepared to repeat now.  The income, I said, of First Class Principals might be taken at £370 for men and £300 for women, with a Capitation Grant added.  The Minister for Education is my authority; I am quoting his figures.  These are the figures he gave.  The facts are that 85 per cent. of the married teachers in my county are married to each other.  The fact is that the male National teacher and the lady teacher are, in a large number of cases, husband and wife, and they run the schools between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later.  The facts are that an income not less than £700, and probably not more than £800, is very often coming into one house in the country.  Deputy O'Connell has interrupted about farmers. A good many of these teachers are also farmers.  I can quote him dozens of them who are also farmers.  I had one with me on Sunday evening who is also a farmer.  He was canvassing <Col N="800" /> me.  Now, a 10 per cent. cut off a £700 or £800 income would mean £70 or £80 of a cut.  That is a big thing coming out of any home.  But I think these people who complain of their cut in income might easily console themselves with the fact that they have an income to cut.  There are very few people in this nation at the moment, who have any income that can be reduced, and there are many people who have no income at all.  There are very few people in the Saorstát at this moment with any income, and the man or woman with £700 or £800 of an income coming into the home is in a very happy position. They are the favoured few of the community. A good many people down in my part of the country, I am very glad to say, are able to indulge in some of the luxuries of life.  It is no uncommon thing in my town.  Last Saturday the teachers had a meeting, and anyone could see ten or twelve private motor-cars, belonging to the teachers, passing through the town.  Well, the reduced cost of petrol will more than balance the proposed cut.  They will be in a better position, considering the reduction in the price of petrol, than before.  Lower grades will be quoted by the teachers.  They have been quoted, in some arguments, as being in receipt of a salary of £120 a year or something like that.  Now, these people in receipt of this salary are young men and young women living in the country and living very largely in their own homes.  We know what living in your own home means in comparison to living in the City of Dublin, or in places other than your own home.  I will not go into their educational qualifications at all, or into the cost which their educational qualifications entail.  But I will try to contrast it with the case of the average citizen of Dublin.  Thousands of young men and thousands of young women come up from the provinces to earn a living here.  Then there are the cases of those who are born in the suburbs of Dublin.  Some of these have to find a home far from their own, and have to live in what are called &ldquo;digs.&rdquo;  I understand the least figure at which they can live in decency in the City of Dublin would be 35s. a week.  That is quite different <Col N="801" /> from the tariff in the country.  How many in the Government Departments here are in receipt of £3 a week?  How many of the thousands of the typists in the City of Dublin are in receipt of £3 a week&mdash;people whose education cost them something and whose years of study were not a few.  Take the case of stenographers and the other hosts of people who come up here from the country to make their living.  Their education has cost them a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not in receipt of any thing like the amount of even these low grade salaries and they have to live in Dublin, and to be respectable and to dress themselves well.  These are the people&mdash;the average citizens&mdash;and these are the people asked to deny themselves the means of subsistence in order that the favoured few may be put in a position that they themselves can never attain to; for the citizen in Dublin with £3 a week, and the citizen in the country with £3 a week, are two different cases altogether.  None of the speakers here, in dealing with this question, has made any contrast whatsoever with the position and salaries of teachers in other countries.  I made a statement over half a year ago with regard to this question.  The figures I quoted were not my figures; they were the figures of one of the leading journals in England&mdash;the &ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo;  Its columns were opened to anybody who wanted to contradict their figures.  Were they contradicted in the columns of the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; or in any newspaper in Ireland with any circulation?  They were contradicted just on the eve of the late election in provincial newspapers where the men who wrote them knew they would never be seen.  Mr. Mansfield and the rest of them wrote in the columns of the &ldquo;Kilkenny People&rdquo; to contradict these figures, and they tried to throw dust in the eyes of the electors. Column after column, week after week, were published in little country journals, where it was known they would never be seen, except by the local electors.  Why were not these figures questioned&mdash;the figures for Belgium, France and America?  If we were able to spend more on education than any of these countries and were able to pay our teachers more than any of these countries, then by all means <Col N="802" /> let us do it, but are we able to pay more?  Are the resources of this country greater than the resources of any other country?  We stand higher on the list than any other country with regard to primary education.  We pay more to our teachers, with the exception of England, than any other country.  The only argument to justify this would be that we were in a better financial position if we were able to get money easily; but can we?  Deputy Redmond very wisely said we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We had better do it, and if we have to cut it on every other section of the community not only with people in receipt of salaries and wages, then we had better do it in regard to the teaching profession.  It is asked why anything else has not been touched except these two services.  The Minister for Agriculture has said that this is only the first instalment of the cuts in the different services.  I welcome that statement, and I accept that as the Government's intention.  It is time that not alone these services but every other service, including the Government service, should be recast, and seriously recast, and recast not from the bottom, but from top to bottom.  Agreements have been entered into, and Deputy Cooper has dealt with these.  We have all been reading these leaflets sent out by the Teachers' Organisation, and I see there have been several agreements.  I think there were at least four.  If these different agreements were broken, why not the last one be broken?</P>

      <P>All these arguments against this cut are put forward from the Labour Benches ostensibly in the interest of the rank and file of Labour. I do not think for a moment we are deceiving Labour at all upon this question; we are not deceiving the rank and file.  Labour will look for money where it thinks it is; it will look for income or a share of income where it is.  It would be very foolish if they did not look for it where it is, and if we want money for reconstruction and for employment and for development we will have to retrench and look for it where it is, and the rank and file of Labour <Col N="803" /> will find it on the Labour Benches represented by Deputy O'Connell; they will find there an income running into something like seven or eight hundred pounds a year.  That is the place to look for it and not where it is not.</P>
      <P>I have been talking to several men in the rank and file of the Labour movement on this question, and I know there are no cobwebs on their eyes at all. Deputy Johnson advised us to look around for other means to make a saving. I have heard that phrase from the Deputy before, but he has never yet pointed his finger as to where we are to look.  He must have some idea himself, because otherwise he would not have given us the advice, but he has never yet told us where to look.  Deputy Redmond also spoke, particularly with regard to the old age pensions.  I want to make our position perfectly clear with regard to the old age pensions. We accept the proposal of the Minister for Finance only because of the fact that 9/- now represent a good deal more than 10/- did two years ago. As a matter of fact, from the figures put before us, 7/- now are worth as much as 10/- two years ago.  We would not accept the reduction in the old age pensions were it not for the fact that 9/- to-day leaves the old age pensioner in a much better position than he was in two years ago.  Deputy Redmond talks about the miserable pittance of 10/-.  If it was a miserable pittance when it was fixed in 1920, what was it before that year?  I believe it was only 5/- at first.  If that is so, it must have been a still more miserable pittance then.  What, I ask, was Deputy Redmond doing during all these years when the old age pensioners were receiving that still more miserable pittance of 5/-?  He was a member of the British Parliament, which passed the Act dealing with the old age pensioners, and that was where he should have made his voice heard.  He was in a position to make a protest, but did he do it?</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  We welcome these proposals as a step in the right direction.  We accept the proposal with regard to the old age pensioners because the money value proposed in the cut represents, for the pensioners, a better position than they were in two years ago.  Only for that we would oppose it.  We recognise the fact that money must be found and that more millions must be found.  We know that this year's revenue is not a normal revenue.  I would like to know from the Minister for Finance how much of the income tax he received was normal for the current year, and how much of it was arrears that had been accruing for years.  It has also to be remembered that we have to face reconstruction and development problems, and that we have to find employment for the unemployed.  We will have to find money to do all these things, and in my opinion if we are to tackle all these problems we will have to find more than the million that has been referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Someone made the suggestion to scrap the Ministry of Fisheries, and so spare us the £1,700 a year that is paid to the Minister in charge of that Department. I do not care what title you give to the Ministry of Fisheries, whether it is put under the Department of Agriculture or some other Department, it is going to cost the amount that it is now costing, and you will want some Department to deal with it. I say that if the Minister for Fisheries is to do justice to the position, and succeeds in developing the industry as it should be developed, he will have earned his £1,700 a year, and the money will have been well spent.  No matter what heading you put the Ministry of Fisheries under it will cost just as much money as it does now under the title of Ministry of Fisheries.  You will have to employ the same staff and there can be no saving in that respect.  There has been some reference to this in the newspapers, but I say, with all due respect to these people, that they do <Col N="805" /> not know what they are talking about. We heard another suggestion that money could be spared on the Governor-General's establishment, that a few thousand pounds could be spared. It would be well for people to remember that we want millions saved, and that millions and not thousands must be saved if we are to make this country solvent.  If economies are to be made everyone in the nation will have to bear his share.  The people in the country have not incomes of £700 or £800 a year.  The average man in the class that I represent has no income at all.  His income has disappeared.  He had a bit of an income during the war, but he has none at all now, and he has to pay his way out of capital or pay out of the bank or not pay at all.  If all the industries and all the professions of this country are going to be saddled on the agricultural industry, you will have this position: that every man engaged in agriculture will combine into one party and scrap every other section in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>In the discussion which we are having, and which is supposed to be on recurrent expenditure, Deputy Figgis dealt with certain points regarding the army to the prejudice, I think, of a clear discussion as to what is recurrent expenditure.  The remarks that he made with regard to the army and its position were, from the point of view of non-recurrent expenditure pure and simple, and I think it well to deal with some of those points in order to remove certain impressions that may be created to the prejudice of what we are discussing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention, with regard to Gormanstown, which is said to be a place in which vast retrenchment can be brought about, that there has been already within the last few days marked down for immediate demobilisation 211 men.  As we use it at present, we do not anticipate that the life of Gormanstown as an institution will be longer than the present financial year&mdash;will outlast the present Army Vote.  At the same time, it is absolutely essential that it should be thoroughly realised that we could never have got on up to the present without Gormanstown.  It was absolutely <Col N="806" /> essential in the circumstances in which we found ourselves that we should have an institution such as Gormanstown capable of doing all repairs to our motors without letting them outside army hands.</P>
    <P>It is not fair also to say that the Government has not applied itself to cutting down expenditure in the Army in the same way as it proposes to cut down expenditure on salaries to teachers and payments made to old age pensioners.  At the present moment you have upwards of 15,000 men in the army who are time-expired.  In the next two or three weeks the demobilisation of that 15,000 men, as far as demobilisation in respect of the old terms is concerned, will take place.</P>

Army officers at present serving are serving under very special conditions, and in a service that may terminate at any time.  There is not a single officer in the army to whom you could hold out a definite prospect that he will be continued in his position for, say, two or three years, and it would be unreasonable, considering the work that officers in the army have done, and the problematic term of office, that there should be any cutting down of the salaries paid to the present officers.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt, but I should be sorry that the Minister should labour under any delusion or illusion with regard to what I said.  I was not dealing with the question so much of economy as the question of morale.  I was therefore dealing, not with the salaries of the majority of the rank and file officers&mdash;<Col N="807" /> if I might use that expression&mdash;as with regard to the higher type of officers, and, therefore, with the highest type of salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the three members of the Army Council, the Deputy did not suggest what particular cutting down could be made in the amounts paid to those officers.  I doubt if there is anybody who, realising the responsibilities that rested on the members of the Army Council for the last 12 months, could reasonably suggest that there should be any cutting down in the amounts paid to them as persons occupying the particular position that they occupy.  The name of Marshal Foch has been mentioned, and I fear that the Deputy has mixed up his calculation when transferring Irish money into French money.  The task that Marshal Foch was called upon to face, with his experience and training, for his country, was not greater than the task that these members of the Army Council, with their training and experience, were called upon to face for their country, and the achievements of the members of the Army Council for their country will, I am perfectly satisfied, not be written down in history as less than any achievement of Marshal Foch for his country.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the present army might not be replaced by a militia, costing two millions or one and a half millions, is not a question that arises on the points of criticism that the Deputy raised.  You have to deal with the present situation; with the machinery that you have.  At the beginning of the period of hostilities here you might say that you had a militia, and your militia system, faced with the circumstances of 12 months ago, left you without any control of any kind over very much the greater portion of your country; and you cannot, in my opinion, talk of establishing a militia system for, at any rate, the next three or four years.  You are tied by your circumstances here.  We are laying our plans in this matter of the demobilisation in such a way that we shall probably leave you, at the end of this financial year, with an army of 20,000 men&mdash;that is, 10,000 men less than we estimated we would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> The circumstances in which we will leave that army of 20,000 men at the beginning of the next financial year will not be such as will bind the Government or this Assembly to the retention of an army of that size for the twelve ensuing months, if circumstances do not warrant it.  The expenditure on the army will have to depend on the circumstances that face you in the country.  While we may hope that they will be such that you can reduce your army even below 20,000, you cannot afford experiments in shifting from the type of army you have at present to a militia system, or any other system like that, until you know in what particular atmosphere you are discussing a proposal like it, and for, at any rate, three or four years.  These matters are being thought of by the army authorities. On the general matter of army accounts and army extravagance, which is so much talked of, you hear it suggested from time to time that there has been unnecessary extravagance in the army because inexperienced people have been in charge, and because you have an inexperienced army.  I doubt if anyone who knows anything about armies will be very much struck with an argument of that type.  Armies in warfare are extravagant, but they are carrying out a business in circumstances where you cannot have ordinary routine methods. There must inevitably be additional extravagance as a result of the manner in which matters have to be carried out.  I think it well, for the comfort of Deputies, to state that the system of keeping army accounts is such that I can give you the figures of expenditure in the army up to and including the month of October.  That is, on the 14th of November, I can tell you what the army has spent on itself up to the 31st of October.  The total Army Estimate was £10,679,500.  For the seven months ending the 31st October there was £6,750,810 spent, or 63.2 per cent of the total Army Estimate.  Seven-twelfths of the Estimate would be less than that.  It would be 58.3 per cent. The first seven months of expenditure for the army were, naturally, the heaviest months.  The expenditure for the month of October itself was £779,750, that is, 7.3 per cent. of the whole Estimate.  If the expenditure <Col N="809" /> during October was on the ordinary <i>pro rata</i> percentage, it would be 8.3 per cent.  That is, 8.3 per cent. would be one-twelfth of the total expenditure. So that your expenditure in October is only seven-eighths of a month's <i>pro rata</i> expenditure, showing that, while you are to some extent overspent for the first seven months, because of the excessive strength the army carried during that time, your expenditure in October shows you are very much on the decline.  The expenditure will decrease much more rapidly during the ensuing four months, say, December, January, February and March.  While, as I say, that has to some extent crossed the present discussion, I am glad to see from the general feeling of the Dáil that it has not prejudiced the appreciation of the necessity for cutting down both the amount of money set aside for payment of teachers and for old age pensioners.  It is not correct to say that the cutting down of either <Col N="810" /> of these amounts is simply because of the fall in the cost of living.  Cutting down these amounts is owing to the absolute necessity of reducing your total expenditure, and these are two obvious and outstanding items in which it is possible to reduce expenditure. The reference to the cost of living was made simply in order to demonstrate that it is not unreasonable that such cutting down should take place, and particularly when the cutting down does not bring undue hardship upon any one of these two classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the facts.  There is no question of payment of vendors in cash.  They are paid in bonds.  The purchase money of an average tenancy was fixed at fifteen years' purchase of the rent.  In the normal course the purchaser pays the purchase money, and under the terms of the Land Act would pay 4¾ per cent. on any money lent to him by the State for this purpose. Under previous Land Acts the tenant's payment was either 3¼ per cent. or 3½ per cent. on the purchase money.  The increase in the rates of interest was due to the European War. In order to relieve the tenant from this increase in the rate of interest, I suggested, and the Dáil agreed, to pay the interest and sinking fund on one-eleventh of the purchase money.  Provisions to effect this were inserted in the Land Act of 1923, and I do not propose to introduce a Bill to alter <Col N="722" /> these provisions.  The total amount which the State will have to find for this purpose, when land purchase under the 1923 Act is completed, will be about £60,000 per annum.</P>

    <P>The small increase in the cost of the Inspectorate staffs on 31st October, 1923, over the figure for 31st October, 1922, represents the cost of taking over that portion of the work of the Chief Inspector of Taxes, London, which covered taxes administration in the Free State area before 1st April, 1923.</P>

      <P>The Class I. men of the late Railway Protection, Repair and Maintenance Corps, now serving in the Army Corps of Engineers, were paid at a flat rate and were not entitled to Dependents' Allowance. An arrangement was, however, made whereby a man would allot the whole or any portion of his weekly pay to his dependents, the Paymaster undertaking to forward the money allotted in accordance with the man's instructions. The payments were arranged so that a man had always one week's money due to him.  The re-attestation of the Army Corps of Engineers has now begun, and as each man is reattested or demobilised his account will be cleared to date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="724" /> for Defence when the pay for Sunday work performed by Class I. men, non-railway workers, who were, and are still, paid on a six days basis and agreement, of the late Railway, Protection, Repair, and Maintenance Corps, and now in the Army Corps of Engineers, will be paid.</P>

      <P>When Class I. men (i.e., railwaymen and other personnel coming under this heading) of the late Railway Protection, Repair, and Maintenance Corps were attested it was proposed to deduct 15s. per week from their pay to cover rations. Subsequently the question of Sunday pay and overtime was raised.  It was decided after agreement with the men that instead of deducting 15s. per week in respect of rations this amount would be paid by way of set-off to the claim for Sunday pay and overtime.  This arrangement still holds good in the cases of men who are still serving and who are being employed in the Corps of Engineers.  On their re-attestation in that Corps which is now proceeding they will be paid on a scale based on daily rate for the seven days of the week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the General Prisons Board is acting in accordance with Circular 7,398, dated the 3rd September, 1920 (Pars. 2 and 3), in refusing to pay for overtime in cash and substituting time off in lieu; if he is aware that overtime, as per pars. referred to, was paid for in cash by the British Government and also by the Free State Government up to March of this year, when it was stopped by order of the Prisons Board; (2) whether the Prisons Board is acting in accordance with the Board's Circular 8088, dated 13th November, 1919, in refusing to pay the sleeping-in allowance to married Principal Warders; if he is aware that this allowance was granted by the British Treasury, as one of the details of a scheme of assimilation with the English Prisons Service, sanctioned by the Treasury, and was paid up to the signing of the Treaty; (3) whether the Prisons Board is refusing to allow superior officers, separated from their families, a free railway warrant every two months; whether this concession was granted on the same ground as No. 2 above.</P>

      <P>(1) The practice of the General Prisons Board in dealing with claims for overtime worked by Prison Warders has not been altered since the transfer of Government. When overtime is worked on escort or other special duty, payment is made in respect thereof unless time off in lieu is allowed.  In former years it was more difficult to arrange for the grant of equivalent leave than it is at present, but such equivalent leave was always granted when possible.  This practice will continue to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> (2) The General Prisons Board have no authority to pay &ldquo;sleeping-in&rdquo; allowance to officers other than those of the warder class who were appointed prior to June, 1922, and no extension of this authority will be made.  Where prison officers are required to reside in prisons, with free quarters, there is no reasonable ground for the payment of additional remuneration because of their residence in the prisons.</P>
    <P>(3) The privilege of a free railway ticket every two months to enable married officers separated from their families to visit their homes has been granted to subordinate officers only. The General Prisons Board have no authority to extend this concession to superior officers, and I am not prepared to recommend to the Minister for Finance that any such extension should be authorised.</P>
