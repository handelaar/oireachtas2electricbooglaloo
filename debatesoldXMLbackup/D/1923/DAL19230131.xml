      <P>A committee is at present considering the operation of this Act with a view to advising whether or not it should be continued, and, if continued, in what respects amendments, if any, may be necessary or desirable.  This Committee has already held several meetings, but I understand that it will not be in a position to report for some weeks to come.  Until this report is received I am not in a position to make any definite pronouncement as to when a Bill can be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion I would like to refer to what occurred yesterday when a somewhat dangerous <Col N="1149" /> precedent was in danger of being introduced. The President was, as I think, very badly advised by one of his subordinates when he came down here and told the Dáil it was not competent for us to proceed with a certain measure until such time as we had passed the financial resolution. The President will probably do me the justice to agree that he was wrongly advised.  There is nothing in the Constitution which bears out that contention. Arising, therefore, out of that bad advice we have this motion put on the paper to-day.  Surely it is a bad precedent, and I put it to the President as the Minister for Finance that it would be wise for him to consider it a bad precedent for a motion of this kind to be introduced, which authorises expenditure in general terms without limit.  We have a proper machinery for the appropriation of votes of money.  If the President says he wants so much for one item and so much for another, there would be very little objection, but in principle it is wrong for the Minister for Finance to come down here and ask for a general authorisation to expend money without saying how much he contemplated, and without asking the Dáil to sanction a specific amount.  If he specified the amount and that it was too little to go along with he could come here and ask to have it increased. And it would be done, but there is very real objection for a financial resolution to be passed in general terms without specifying a vote for a specific amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection it is right to say that it is impossible to frame the resolution in other than in general terms.  Take one of the items referred to&mdash;&ldquo;Deputies for Under-Sheriffs.&rdquo; I do not know how many deputies will be required.  I do not even know that any such deputies will be required. It will depend upon that very uncertain quantity, the extent of intimidation that is exercised.  It may depend upon the accuracy of aim of some bandit or bandits.  The other item, &ldquo;Persons to act as bailiffs&rdquo;&mdash;that cannot be decided with mathematical accuracy.  It will depend also on circumstances that cannot be analysed at the moment, and may change from day to day.  The resolution to meet the purposes for which the Bill was framed cannot be in other than general terms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)&mdash;It shall be lawful for any Under-Sheriff who shall, after the passing of this Act, take any goods, animals, or <Col N="1151" /> other chattels in execution under a writ of <i>fieri facias</i> or under a decree of a Civil Bill Court, to sell such goods, animals, or other chattels at any time after he shall have taken the same in execution, and it shall not be necessary for the Under-Sheriff to publish any advertisement or public announcement of any sale of any such goods, animals, or other chattels, or to publish or announce that any such sale is a sale by an Under-Sheriff, or is a sale of goods, animals, or chattels taken in execution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) So much of Section 28 of the Civil Bill Courts Procedure Amendment Act (Ireland), 1864 (27 and 28 Vict., ch. 99), as prescribes times within which goods or cattle taken in execution under any decree of a Civil Bill Court shall or shall not be sold is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any delay there was in the past, as I stated on the previous reading, was a right of the creditor rather than of the debtor, or was inserted for the advantage of the creditor rather than for that of the debtor, but it did not in the past work out just in that way.  In many places the three days' interval simply gave to the debtor and his friends an opportunity for organising to ensure that there would not be many hardy bidders for the goods in question, and generally it proved to be an opportunity for defeating the ends of the law rather than being of any advantage to the creditor.  It is considered now that that interval should be abolished and it should be left in the discretion of the under-sheriff to sell at any time that he considers most favourable, and to sell in such a way as to ensure the best price for the seized articles.</P>

      <P>I move the first amendment on the Paper as follows:&mdash;Before Section 3, to insert as a separate Section:&mdash;&ldquo;It shall be the duty of a bailiff and of any other person employed by an Under-Sheriff pursuant to Section 2 (1) of this Act, immediately upon entry and before seizure, to produce to the defendant (or other person in apparent possession of the lands and premises upon which he or they shall enter) the warrant of his or their authority from the Under-Sheriff, and to deliver a true copy thereof to such defendant or other person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> We are now coming to the more important parts of the Bill, and I recommend the amendment to the attention of the Dáil.  This amendment is to make the bailiff or the person acting as the bailiff hand to the judgment debtor his authority or a copy of his authority for going into the debtor's house.  At present the debtor cannot call upon the bailiff for a copy of his authority and I understand that the bailiff need not even show the original authority.  That might be very well when dealing with bailiffs who are certified and of whom there is a list in the courthouse&mdash;men of some responsibility and easily identified.  But here you are introducing powers to unidentified persons of whom we know nothing to go into the house of a debtor.  Supposing three or four of them come in and say that they have come to levy an execution by the order of the Sheriff, as the law stands now and under this Act, as drafted, they cannot be called upon to show any authority whatever for their entrance.  In the times in which we are living it is fairly obvious that it would be a safe thing for three or four men to come into a house of any man against whom there is a judgment and pretend on the authority of the Sheriff to collect a debt.  In these circumstances it seems to me absolutely essential that the debtor should be in a position to identify the persons who come into the house and to know what their authorisation is.  Supposing these gentlemen are guilty of &ldquo;Black-and-Tanism&rdquo; when they get into a house, it is right that the debtor should have his right of action against them. At present in the case of every recognised bailiff a list is to be found in the Court house, and where a creditor wants to employ other people as special bailiffs he has to advertise their names in the newspapers.  I am not asking that that should be done, but I am asking that you should protect the debtor to this extent, that if these men misbehave, he shall have had put into his hand a document showing there was authority from the sheriff for entry, and their names.  If the debtor has not got their names he goes afterwards to the sheriff or the Court and complains, and he will be told that these particular men were unauthorised, that the persons who committed the offence <Col N="1153" /> are persons of whom the sheriff knows nothing.  You must give him that natural protection, if he is injured, of knowing who is the person he is to go for.  Ordinary bailiffs can be fined £5, I think, for misbehaviour and be punished, but nothing can be done to these gentlemen under the Act.  The very least protection you can give the unfortunate judgment debtor is the right to take proceedings against persons who misbehave, and in order that he may have that right you must tell him who the people are.  Further, he is clearly entitled, in my view, to see the authority, signed by the sheriff, in order that he may know they are real bailiffs who are coming in.  I want this to apply to the general law, apart from this Act, but whether it is applied to this general law or not, there is a double argument where you are dealing with new and unknown men, for inserting some such new method as this.  If the Minister chooses to propose another method I do not mind. I want two things secure (1) that the men who go in shall show themselves to be men with necessary authority, (2) if these men misbehave that they shall be identifiable.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of force in the consideration the Deputy urges, and with modifications, the amendment might be accepted, but as it stands it leaves openings, and the purpose of the Bill is to stop openings and to make a bag of the net by stopping the holes.  Now, there is a big hole here, inasmuch as it would be open to any judgment debtor, by the simple process of what has become a familiar process of going &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; to entirely defeat the object of this Act.  If he were not in possession and available, so that he could be handed this warrant, or that he lived down a lane and cleared over his back ditch on the approach of anyone, until he was quite certain it was not an agent of the sheriff, then I could see him playing in and out with the law, for quite a considerable period.  The Deputy in his amendment speaks of land and premises. There are lands without premises; there are out-farms without buildings attached. What is the proposal to meet a situation of that kind.  The defendant might not be physically present or available, and there might be no other person in apparent possession of the land and premises.  If the Deputy can suggest <Col N="1154" /> means by which these difficulties can be overcome, if he will undertake to remodel his amendment, I will certainly be open to consider it, but I am not prepared to accept it as it stands, as it would simply enable people to drive a coach and four through the Act.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment as it stands will be quite as bad as the Minister says.  It does provide for delivering a copy of the authority to &ldquo;other the person in possession.&rdquo; Take the case where there is no one in possession.  You can easily insert a word so that a copy can be left on the premises.  That, I think, would meet any difficulty there might be.  If there is someone on the premises, you can give him a copy of the document. If there is no one on the premises, the document can be stuck on the door.</P>

      <P>I must say that I do not agree with the Minister or with Deputy Gavan Duffy that having an authority is any safeguard in present circumstances.  I do not see that the new bailiffs are going to be any worse or much better than the old bailiffs, and I do not think that we ought to build anything on the assumption that the new bailiffs appointed under this Bill will be very much different from the old bailiffs.  Further, giving an authority to a bailiff may really cut the <Col N="1155" /> other way.  It is quite easy to forge an authority of any kind, and it really gives the bailiff a little more latitude than he would have under the existing law.</P>

      <P>No; it is much more easy to forge an authority of that sort than to forge a writ.  I think the suggestion to give an authority to a bailiff is really defeating the object which he has in view, and I do not think there is any real danger that this will be abused.  There is much more danger that people will enter premises not pretending they have the authority of the Sheriff, but rather that they have the authority of the I.R.A., or some other organisation of that sort.  I think we are really making a difficulty that does not exist, and so far as the difficulty does exist, this does not meet it.  I suggest both to the Minister and Deputy Gavan Duffy that it is not worth while wasting time over this amendment.</P>

      <P>I must press this amendment.  The Minister who has just spoken overlooks the fact that neither a bailiff nor any other man can go into any premises and seize without written authority from the sheriff or under-sheriff and it is provided for by statute in the case of the bailiff.  I am anxious to meet the case raised by the Minister.  I will accept any form of words designed to that end, that his legal draftsman may draft.  That is really the only point between us.  That being so, I suggest the amendment may go through as it stands. One does not want to draft words on the spur of the moment, and to have to change them afterwards.  It would be much better to leave it to the official draftsman to put in words to that effect.</P>

I would agree to accept his amendments if he would insert after the words &ldquo;to produce&rdquo;&ldquo;produce on demand.&rdquo; When a person comes to seize goods it does not require a person of secondary or university education to ask the very obvious question, &ldquo;What right have you to take my goods?  Who sent you here?&rdquo; It is the first question that springs to the lips of any man whose property is laid hands on.  &ldquo;What right have you to <Col N="1156" /> take my property?&rdquo; The reply will be, &ldquo;I take it under the instruction of the Under-Sheriff.  This is my warrant.&rdquo; It is, I submit, an ordinary horse-sense solution of the difficulty to insert there &ldquo;produce on demand&rdquo; to the defendant (or other the person in apparent possession, etc.).&rdquo;</P>

He accepted the principle of it.  It is designed to compel the Sheriff's man to give an inventory of any chattels that he seizes. I do not know if there is any criticism of the wording or any change to be suggested in it.  I take it the principle is agreed.  It is obviously a very vital matter to the debtor that he should have a detailed list signed by way of receipt by the bailiff before the bailiff leaves the premises.</P>

      <P>I will be quite frank with the Deputy, as usual.  It is simply this.  In the vast majority of seizures it is live stock that is seized.  I visualise a situation like this&mdash;an out-farm in the country belonging to some person who <Col N="1157" /> lives in the town, a station 3 miles away, a train going at such a time, a van ordered for that train awaiting the result of the seizure.  It would not be practicable and it would not be advisable to give an undertaking that in every case before any removal an itemised inventory will be handed to the judgment debtor.  He may be absent either deliberately or otherwise, and it is a reasonable thing that within 48 hours of the seizure he should be handed an itemised inventory.  I would be prepared to consider the matter if the Deputy would change &ldquo;removal&rdquo; to &ldquo;sale.&rdquo;</P>

The Minister is thinking of another class of chattels that may be seized.  I see the force of his remarks, but his amendment takes away the protection a debtor is entitled to, namely, that before the bailiff goes out of the house he supplies a list of the things he is taking away.  That I think, the Minister will see is reasonable.  I suggest that if before the words &ldquo;before any removal&rdquo; there were inserted &ldquo;and if practicable&rdquo; it might meet the case.</P>

      <P>I move the next amendment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Before Section 3 to insert as a separate section&mdash;(1) &lsquo;From and after the passing of this Act no judgment, order, <Col N="1158" /> or decree made in respect of a cause of action arising before the first day of January, 1923, shall be enforced by a Sheriff or Under-Sheriff, unless the leave of the Court shall first have been obtained upon application made in such manner and pursuant to such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Minister, and if, on any such application, the Court is of opinion that time should be given to the defendant, the Court may in its discretion, after considering all the circumstances of the case and the position of the parties, by order withhold, postpone, or subject to such conditions as the Court shall think fit, grant such leave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment raises a matter of very considerable importance.  It is an attempt to revive a power which the Court had during the Great War to protect people who were unable to pay their debts on account of circumstances for which they were not responsible.  The Dáil will remember that for quite a number of years it was not open to a creditor who had obtained a judgment to enforce any kind of execution without going to the Court and asking leave.  This provision was very wisely made in England during the Great War in order to prevent the serious hardship that might occur through the enforcing of decrees at a time like that.  The provision was found so useful that it continued in force until last August, and it only ceased to be in force in this country because it happened to be of no further use in England.  But England had not a civil war raging, and in my view the clause was more than ever necessary in this country at the very moment that it happened to cease to operate.  People will differ as to the extent of distress in this country, but I think everybody will agree that there are very many cases in which people are not able to pay their debts from day to day through no real fault of their own. People ordering goods last June or July or August could not foresee the course of events we have seen since then.  Very few of them, I venture to say, supposed that the present civil war would be raging in February, 1923.  Consequently people entered into engagements which were reasonable enough for ordinarily prudent men to enter into on the assumption that the country would return to a normal condition before long.  I have suggested in this amendment that, in <Col N="1159" /> respect of debts incurred before the first day of this year, a special clause should operate making it the duty of the creditor to get leave of the Court before putting decrees into execution.  I take that date&mdash;I am not particular about it, but I take it because it seems to me that it is near enough to the passing of this Act to be a fair date.  By that time everybody could see that the struggle was going to be more protracted than they expected it would be originally. People who, with their eyes open, enter into obligations now are not entitled to the protection they would be entitled to, on entering into such obligations some months ago.  You have, first, the Great War, the disturbances of last year, the present Civil War&mdash;one after another&mdash;to say nothing of the Black-and-Tan period, making the position of people up and down the country extremely difficult.  The Ministers who spoke on this Bill the other day recognised, I think, that a distinction must be made between the honest debtor and the dishonest debtor.  The question is how are we going to make that distinction? There is no difficulty in getting leave to put decrees into execution in a proper case.  The President, I remember, so well recognised the necessity for discrimination between the rogue and the honest debtor that he said, the other day, that the Sheriff will have to use his discretion as to executing and as to how far he would execute.  We cannot exactly give a Sheriff discretion.  After all he is an officer of the Court.  He has got to do his duty when put in motion by the creditor just as he has to go out of the debtor's house when the creditor orders him.  We cannot give an option to the Sheriff.  You can give an option to the Court, and that is what I am asking the Dáil to do, to see that in any case where it is unfair to make a man pay up at once and sell him up if he does not pay, that in no such case as that will you allow this Act to operate against him.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that it is not a very scientific classification of debtors to say that the honest debtor is he who has incurred his debts within the last month, and that the dishonest debtor, the rogue, is he who had the misfortune to incur his debts before January, 1923.</P>

      <P>Oh, yes, it is rather the other way about&mdash;that is, that it is the dishonest debtor who has incurred his debts within the past month, and that it was those back before that period that the Deputy, with other people, is so anxious to protect.  This amendment contains a very serious proposal.  I acquit the Deputy of being temperamentally an anarchist.  But his proposal is fundamentally anarchic. It is to deprive a great many people in the country of legal rights.  For no very definite reason all the creditors who have been owed money for more than a month are to be deprived of their legal remedies subject to their going through a certain procedure which, no doubt, would involve delay and which also, if lawyers know their business, will involve expense.  It is not a sound proposal. A decree of the Courts, I understand, lives for a year and may be renewed for a period of six months.  I could not undertake to accept or even seriously to consider the amendment which would deprive people of legal remedies and of legal rights and which would practically set at naught decrees of the Courts given throughout last year and only validate decrees given within the last month. The proposal is unsound and fundamentally anarchic.</P>

This is a very serious matter and the Minister would be perfectly within his rights in objecting to the amendment if he had an alternative. But he and his colleagues have admitted that this Bill is intended to hit the rogue only.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation the Deputy is harping on this so often that I think it calls for comment. I do not pretend to be able to discriminate without personal contact, to discriminate regardless of physical considerations of place and so on between <Col N="1161" /> the rogue and the honest man in Kerry or Cork.  I never stated that this Bill was going to hit and hit only a certain class of people whom we were to brand as rogues and that it was going to pass by another class of people whom we were going to compliment as being beyond all question honest men.  The Bill has been introduced to ensure that the writs, the writs of the Court, of the Courts of the people will run.  All this talk about the rogue and the honest man is scarcely in accordance with facts.  It is simply a human nature tendency to evade payment as long as it seems reasonably possible, and a great many people have given into that human nature tendency.  They are not of necessity rogues any more than people who pay their debts are of necessity or <i>ipso facto</i> honest people.  There are a great many dishonest people who pay their debts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the position taken up by the Minister.  I think this Bill is so bad because of the fact that it does not discriminate, that you cannot make it discriminate by an amendment of this kind.  You are dealing with the machinery for the enforcement of the law, and you want to tack on to that a proposal to instruct the Courts that they must make some discrimination, and that the particular machine that is now being brought into operation must not apply to a particular class of case.  I do not think it is possible to make this Bill anything but a bad Bill.  The justification for the introduction of the Bill, and the only justification, was that there existed in the country a large number of people who were hiding behind the present disturbances and armed rebellion to avoid payment of just debts.  That was the only justification.  The Minister confesses that the same bad machinery is going to be made operative in all cases of debts which are owed and cannot be paid because of circumstances which cannot be controlled by the debtor. It is simply because it cannot be amended in the direction that the Deputy wishes that I have opposed the Bill, and will hope to be recorded against every section of it.  To ask the Courts to discriminate without passing a special Act of Parliament to deal with a particular class of case is, I think, quite unwise and undesirable.  You are dealing with the <Col N="1162" /> machinery for the enforcement of decrees in this Bill, and, I think, it is perfectly right for the Minister to say that we cannot tack on to this Bill such a proposal.  The opposition which I have given to the Bill has been misunderstood. It is suggested that we want to protect the fraudulent debtor or the debtor who refuses to pay his just debts though he can, and is, hiding behind the present state of the country.  That is very far from the truth.  We object to this Bill, and we support the Minister in his view of this particular amendment simply because you are altering the law regarding the enforcement of debts in such a way as could only be justified if it could be confined to such cases as were quoted by the Minister in introducing the Bill.  As you cannot confine it to such cases it must inevitably apply to decrees given against innocent debtors, and, therefore, it is a bad Bill.</P>

      <P>Support either for the whole Bill or for parts of the Bill is welcome even from unexpected quarters, but Deputy Johnson, speaking just now and speaking previously on this Bill, has taken an extraordinary line.  He has taken the line of thinking, or pretending to think, that the Bill is some revolutionary measure; that hitherto there existed in this country a statute or a convention that people shall not pay their debts; and that we had come along blundering, like young bulls in a china shop, with this startling proposal that people shall pay their debts, and that altogether we look like bringing down the orderly house.  You would think that such a thing as a seizure by an Under-Sheriff was unknown in this country before I had an evil brain-wave and framed this Bill.  That is not the position.  One would think, too, that it was well understood in law and in practice that people should only pay their debts where it was perfectly convenient for them so to do; that they should receive from an honest man or a dishonest man across a counter certain goods, undertaking to pay for them, and that subsequently they should not pay for them, or should pay only in their own good time.  Of course, all that is very incorrect, thoroughly fallacious. The existing law in this country, as in most other civilised countries, provides that people should pay their debts, and that in the event of their failure to do so <Col N="1163" /> the creditor may come to the Courts and obtain a decree against them, and that in execution of that decree the Under-Sheriff shall seize so much of their property as he thinks will produce the amount of the debt and something over by way of fees for himself and his agents. That was a well-recognised practice in this country, and, just in the conditions that exist at the moment and have existed for some months back, certain minor provisions of the existing law need strengthening.  I pointed out how on an historic occasion the pound failed in Ballinasloe. I said, of course, that that position could not be allowed to extend. I pointed out that the local auction, in the conditions of intimidation that existed to some extent in the country, was not likely to be a highly successful affair, and consequently some amendments were needed in respect of that.  The only change that this Bill makes for practical purposes is that it enables the Under-Sheriff to bring out of his bailiwick the seized chattels or livestock and to sell them elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have been running with a limp, and this Bill is put forward to enable them to run much more smoothly.  When people continue to suggest that this is some strange procedure not intended to apply to a class of people who for the time being will be complimented by being called honest people, and that it will not apply to rogues, I know no such principle that only a rogue shall pay his debts and that an honest man shall not.</P>

      <P>The matter mentioned by Deputy Duffy is possibly open to misinterpretation.  It is possible, on the other hand that I have misinterpreted it.

      <P>No doubt there are limits as to debts.  It reproduces substantially what those statutes prescribed. For large sums you may make separate legislation if you like.  For most purposes the present law is quite good enough, and the Minister when introducing the Bill, and his colleagues when they spoke on the introduction of the Bill justified a Bill so rigourous as this by reference to the thieves who are hiding behind the present disturbances to avoid payment of debts, and they could not justify extreme measures such as are contemplated here except by references to men of that kind.  I regret the Minister has not seen his way to accept that amendment, or make some other provision for making a distinction between persons whom it is right to take action against and persons whom it is wrong to take action against.  I must say that the Minister's own statement has justified the attitude taken up by Labour on this <Col N="1165" /> Bill from the beginning.  I thought an amendment would be accepted which would take the bad parts of the Bill out and which would confine the Bill, so far as it is repressive, to persons who deserve that type of repression.  The Minister says he cannot do it, and says one of the primary duties of the Home Affairs Office is to see that people pay their debts.  Surely it is also the duty of the same Minister to see that people who cannot pay their debts owing to the state of the country, for which they are not responsible, shall not be sold out of house and home unfairly and unjustly. You must make this distinction, and the Minister's refusal to make this distinction will make it impossible for some of us to support clauses in this Bill which we might otherwise have supported, because it leaves these clauses open to use against honest men.  There are other ways of doing the same thing. I say that distinction must be made and I am certain if the Bill gets through here as it stands the Minister will find very considerable difficulty in getting it through the Seanad, unless he recognises, as he recognised when he introduced the Bill, that it is one thing to deal with a thief and another thing to deal with a man who cannot help himself in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>I understand the Bill to which the Deputy refers deals with debts incurred previous to August, 1914.  The Deputy himself is therefore under a misapprehension if he thinks it ran against every debt accrued since the Great War.  It did not.  Therefore this particular section which is proposed is extra; it is over and above, and outside of, a similar regulation, if he meant a parallel regulation to the one which deals with debts incurred before 1914.  His case would be very good regarding penalisation if it could be supported by facts or evidence. As I understand the case, something like 100 and, in some cases 200, decrees are still unlevied in certain counties.  The Deputy did not say whether, it was a fact that, the whole of the 100 or 200 persons concerned would have been put out of business in the event of these decrees being levied.  If he were Minister for Finance, he would come to the conclusion, being, I expect, an honest <Col N="1166" /> man like myself, that everyone in the country was on the verge of bankruptey, believing every statement that came before him; but, on review, he would have come to the conclusion that the cases must have been exaggerated.  For something like six months I have been dealing with practically every business in the country requiring a subsidy.  I suppose all the debtors, against whom decrees have been secured, require subsidies to enable them to carry on.  Where they are to be got, I do not know.  Perhaps the Deputy will tell us; it would be of great assistance to us if he told us where they are to be found.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this Bill, and on this particular amendment up to this, reveals, to my mind, a most extraordinary point of view.  We are here in Parliament passing laws, making and discussing laws, and defining things.  It seems to be the idea that we are merely making them for the purpose of hearing ourselves talk; that we are here spending three or four hours per diem discussing principles of Constitutional law and all sorts of abstract matters; but that once we have the law passed we are not going to enforce it.  The conception of the Parliament seems to be some place where Deputies can show their mental agility, their knowledge of Constitutional law, their ability to split hairs, and so on; but, my idea of Parliament, and my idea of law-making is, the making of regulations for the running of the country. It seems to me, it may be an extraordinary doctrine, that it is absolutely useless to make laws unless you enforce them.  We are not going to alter the law of contract, and we are not likely to alter the law of tort.  It has not been suggested here that the laws of contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing my remarks to sub-section 3, which amounts to a notice to every debtor under contract, or any other way, that he need not pay his debts unless the creditor goes to court again.  That is what I am addressing my remarks to.  I am suggesting that the existing laws of contract, under which these decrees were <Col N="1167" /> got, are quite good.  If they are wrong, or unsound in any way, the Deputy can show us where.  If decrees have been obtained by creditors under the existing laws of contract, or tort, they are entitled to be enforced; but this amendment is simply a note to creditors who have been waiting, perhaps a year or more, for their money, that they must go to court again, employ barristers and solicitors, and go through what they must have come to regard as the farce of getting another decree.  That is really what the amendment amounts to.  All these decrees could be executed; at least they could if there is sufficient power under the existing law.  But the suggestion of the Deputy is that we should take away rights under this Bill which are merely for the purpose, as Deputy Johnson pointed out in his speech, of strengthening the hands of the Sheriff and of toning up the machinery of the law.  The suggestion is that we should take away rights which creditors have already enjoyed.  I ask the Dáil under no circumstances to accept the amendment, which would, to my mind, render the Bill quite useless.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;Before Section 3 to insert as a separate section: &lsquo;From and after the passing of this Act, the wearing apparel and bedding of a person against whom an execution shall be levied, and the wearing apparel and bedding of his family, and the tools and implements of his trade, not exceeding in the whole the value of £15, shall be exempt from liability to seizure.&rsquo;&rdquo; I take it this amendment will be agreed to. It simply reproduces the law for protecting the wearing apparel and necessary implements of trade of the debtor, and the wearing apparel of his family.  It proposes, however, to change the law in one respect.  At present the debtor can keep £5 worth of stuff.  I am proposing to make the amount £15, for two reasons. The present law goes back to the forties or earlier.  At that time £5 would represent in value £10 or £15 to-day.  Therefore I think £5 is too little.  That will be obvious to the Dáil.  Take clothes, for instance. £5 pre-war would cover a different quantity from what you could purchase for the same amount to-day. Therefore £5 is not enough for protection <Col N="1168" /> for the different things the debtor would require.  The other reason is that up to now, under the old law, the debtor could attend the auction, and always had an opportunity of buying in the things he really cared about.  It was very proper he should have that opportunity. Now, what will happen if this Bill goes through?  You may very well lose things of which the money value to other people may not be great, but of which the value to the owner may be very great.  It will be some compensation to him if the implements and apparel and bedding which you allow him to keep are not confined to what is now the nominal figure of £5. But if you increase that sum, as I suggest, to £15, it will allow him to keep something in the house which is worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is substantially the same as one I have lower down in the list, and they might as well be dealt with together, I think.  The amendment I have put down was taken word for word from the Recovery of Small Debts Act, which was passed, as Deputy Gavan Duffy told us, some time in the forties, and £5 was not very much to leave a man who has been stripped of everything he possessed by the Sheriff's bailiffs to cover his back, and to cover the family, and to go out in the streets to earn his bread with such tools as he possesses.  It would be a small concession to increase the figure that was given even by the hard-hearted legislators of the forties, to the sum of £15 now, having regard to the increased cost of everything.  The Government do not always realise that this statute will not deal solely with men who are going out to collect debts that are due to the State or the debts due to the municipalities and local authorities.  I have no doubt whatever that that is what is mainly in their minds, and, of course, it is because it is vital that those debts should be got in that I made no addition to the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill, because I tried to look at it from as many sides as I could, and tried to see it from the side of the Government, and I found no difficulty in seeing that they must take drastic measures to collect the debts that are due to the State, and they must empower the local authorities to take drastic measures to recover the debts <Col N="1169" /> due to them.  I also tried to look at the state of the unfortunate judgment debtor.  In this city there is as much money levied by the Sheriff on the decrees granted in Green Street by the Recorder of Dublin for small shop debts as you will find in the whole of Ireland for municipal or State debts recovered by the authorities.  The Sheriff's bailiff goes into the poor man's house to levy on a £5 or a £10 debt.  Bound by the law to take the goods that he finds, it was to protect the poor man from being stripped and being left naked in his house and left without the means of going out, and trying to earn his living again, that they decided in 1840, that he should be left, at least, with clothes to cover his back and with a blanket to cover his bed.  It would be not only ferocious, but barbarous, to leave that in the power of the Sheriff. If he is sent to a man's house to levy a debt it is his duty to levy to the utmost extent of that debt unless so far as the judgment debtor was protected by law, and it was for that reason that the law protected him by leaving him the tools of his trade and the clothes on his back. I do hope that the Ministers will see their way to accept this amendment making the amount £15 instead of £5, and also giving the family of the judgment debtor their wearing apparel as well.  If they think it necessary to put in the word I have put in&mdash;&ldquo;necessary&rdquo; wearing apparel&mdash;then that would make it perfectly clear that such wearing apparel as was luxurious or superfluous over the sum of £15 was included.  I have tried hard to see all the good that can be seen in the Government, but I am afraid a cloud will come over my vision unless they see their way to accept what seems to me to be not only a reasonable but a just amendment.  Unless this be done the position of the judgment debtor would deprive him of the means of earning a living and would put him on the rates.  Surely the £15 you leave him to enable him to earn his living is better than to make him a pauper in the County Home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, in Sub-Section 1, line 40, to insert after the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; the words &ldquo;after the expiration of a period of twenty-four hours.&rdquo; The Ministry have already accepted an amendment making it the duty of the Under-Sheriff to make out an inventory within a period of forty-eight hours.  I think that probably it might be found that my amendment ought to read &ldquo;forty-eight&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;twenty-four&rdquo; hours, but I move it as printed. The object of this amendment is this: an Under-Sheriff goes in to seize, and under the Section as it stands he can make his seizure at any time. He can go in and make his seizure at 12 o'clock at night, and at five minutes after twelve he may sell on the doorstep for £5, or whatever may cover the amount of the claim, or whatever value the Sub-Sheriff chooses to put on the goods, and he may transfer the property there and then.  One of the fearful dangers that is necessarily involved in this Bill is the possibility of a man's goods being seized for a debt that is not his, because hitherto the sale was postponed for a period quite sufficient to enable an innocent third party &mdash;not the judgment debtor&mdash;whose goods had been taken in honest mistake or otherwise by the Sheriff, to put in his claim and recover his goods by the process known as inter-pleader, or in some other way.  Now, under this Act where <Col N="1172" /> a Sheriff may seize at any time, and he may sell within five minutes, there is no objection whatever left for the man who did not know that a judgment had been recovered and whose goods happened to be in the house, or upon the land on which the Under-Sheriff went to levy a distress and that man's goods without his knowledge and without any complicity on his part, and without any liability to pay, may be swept off and sold to somebody else, and unless he can prove gross negligence or fraud on the part of the Sheriff, which would be difficult, he is left without any remedy at all.  Now my amendment seeks to give at least twenty-four hours, and I think it ought to be forty-eight hours, to the innocent third party to put in a claim for his goods while they are still in possession of the Sheriff and before they are sold to somebody else.  I think the Government have looked too acutely at that branch of the law of debtors and executions that most vitally concern Government and Ministerial authorities and they have not thought of the small judgment debtor in the cities and the towns against whom the Sheriffs' distresses are mostly levied and that they have not visualised the danger of a gross injustice that may arise through this necessary act to people who are in no default of any kind.  It is bad enough for a lodger when his property is seized for the landlord's rent.  That is in accordance with law which at any rate favours&mdash;I do not say unduly favours&mdash; landlords and because it may fairly be said that the lodgers are in the house and they are the belongings of the lodgers they are under the protection of that house, and it must be remembered that, up to now, before the Sheriff could take the landlord's goods in distress, he had to present a judgment and give the lodger an opportunity of paying it in order to save his goods from being distrained for his landlord's debts.  That is done away with now because the third party who knows nothing of the judgment may not have the money to pay the debt, and the Sheriff seizes and sells at once before the poor man has even time to go to a bank or a friend to raise the money to save his goods from being taken and sold to someone else.  Now, I do think that there ought to be some suspension of this right of immediate sale, <Col N="1173" /> not for the sake of the defaulting debtor. It is his business to pay his debts.  If he has money, why should he not pay his debts?  The man I am trying to protect is not the defaulting debtor at all, but the man whose goods, through no fault or complicity of his own, happen to be on the premises and are seized and sold without his being given an opportunity of recovering them.  Indeed, it does not seem to me a postponement of 24 or 48 hours can do very much harm in the way of crabbing the subsequent sale.  They will be able to get just as good a sale after 48 hours as in the middle of the night.  Where they are empowered to deport the goods to wherever they would be able to get a good market for them, they will be able to get a real price for the goods because they have power to sell them and put them up for sale without stigmatising them as Sheriff's seizure; and it seems to me, whatever the goods may be&mdash;whether furniture, stock in trade, cattle or anything else&mdash;where you are allowed to send them away and nobody knows they are a seizure, you will get a good price for them.  Therefore, there is no harm in imposing a delay of 48 hours, because it gives time for the unfortunate owner to come forward and put in a claim, and say those goods should not be sold for another man's debt.</P>

In line 41 the addition of words prohibiting unreasonable delay in sale by the Sheriff would have this effect, that whereas under the Bill the Sheriff can take things away to London or Paris or Australia, and can store them for weeks and months, and then saddle the unfortunate debtor with all the costs, if you put in these words there will be some chance of having a whack at the Sheriff.  I do <Col N="1174" /> not know how any human being outside an asylum could confer upon a Sheriff absolutely unlimited powers to hold up a sale as long as he likes.  Supposing he seizes a vast quantity of furniture for a substantial debt.  If he is an honest man he will do his duty and sell as soon as he can to the best advantage.  If, for some motive he takes these things across the Channel and stores them for months, the charges are mounting up all the time and the debtor has to pay.  I do not find anywhere in the Bill any clause which will protect the debtor against that kind of hardship.  My attempt is a feeble one, but at least, if we have these words against unreasonable delay, a Sheriff will not be in this matter immune from an action for damages if he does not do his duty.</P>

      <P>I beg now to move after the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo; in the next line to add the words &ldquo;in his bailiwick.&rdquo; The clause authorises the Sheriff to sell without advertising the sale, or rather it deals with one aspect of that permission to the Sheriff.  I am prepared to agree that the Sheriff need not say that it is a Sheriff's sale.  I am also prepared to agree that, provided the goods are advertised for sale, they need not of necessity be advertised in the Sheriff's own district but I entirely dissent from the view that the Sheriff is to be allowed to sell these goods without making public the fact that there is going to be a sale and auction.  That, however, raises a question that comes up on a later amendment.  Here I propose to insert the words dispensing the Sheriff from publishing within his own bailiwick and thereby implying that he must publish somewhere, leaving it to him whether it be within or without his own district.  I think it is exceedingly dangerous and objectionable to say, as the Bill does, as at present drafted, that it shall not be necessary for the Under-Sheriff to publish any advertisement, or public announcement, of any sale.  That arises in the next amendment, which deals with the question of private treaty, and I will leave over what I want to say about that until we come to that amendment, <Col N="1176" /> but if this power of the Sheriff be qualified by giving him power that may be necessary, and which I gather was really in the Minister's mind, of abstaining from advertising in his particular district, as I here suggest, then I think the main part of the objection would disappear.  But I do most strongly object to the Bill as drawn, which would allow the Sheriff not to publish the sale at all, but to sell in secret.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment, though it does not seem to me to be as vital as one or two others that I have proposed, but I think at the same time it is an eminently desirable amendment.  The whole object of abolishing the necessity for advertising is to prevent ill-disposed people in the vicinity of the seizure from boycotting the sale, and thereby preventing the judgment from being realised.  But the power, as I said, to transport the goods to an undisturbed locality will, to my mind, get away from any difficulty of that kind, and surely it should not be forgotten that there are many places &mdash;and in the city&mdash;in which the Sheriffs are proceeding about their business in the ordinary way, and that is going on day by day.  It is undesirable to withdraw that from those people who have at present some protection in law, and to disturb all that in places where it is not necessary, and where it is not in the public interest to have it withdrawn. Therefore I think when you exclude the Sheriff from the necessity of publicly advertising on the spot, and make it entirely unnecessary for him to publish, in any way, that the sale is a Sheriff's sale, you get all the protection for the sale that can reasonably be required, and you leave some protection to the person who is the person that will suffer if they do not realise the ordinary amount, owing to a bad sale, that they expected to realise.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is advisable to accept this particular amendment.  When we come to the amendment dealing with private treaty I hope to prove that the abolition of this notice is not done with a view to enabling the Under-Sheriff or his agents to sell in a furtive way, or in a way that <Col N="1177" /> would injure both the debtor and the creditor.  The alternative proposed in this amendment is that there be the fullest notice that the chattels or live stock are chattels or live stock seized on foot of a decree by the Under-Sheriff. That is objectionable and renders the buyer open to a form of intimidation which could not, in reason or fairness, be practised against him if there was no such publication or advertisement. As a matter of fact it is in the interests, I submit, both of the creditor and the debtor that there should not be notice. Everyone knows that people flocking to a Sheriff's sale expect to buy at two-thirds, or possibly even half the value. If there is no notice and cattle or goods are put up in the ordinary way then prospective buyers will realise that there is no feature in the case that would justify them in thinking that they were going to get a bargain.  I submit it is in the interest both of the judgment, debtor and creditor that this notice should be done away with.  On the private treaty amendment I am prepared to meet the points made by Deputies.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Section 4, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Notwithstanding any statute, rule of law or order to the contrary any Under-Sheriff who shall have taken goods, animals or other chattels in execution under any writ of <i>fieri facias</i> or under any decree of a Civil Bill Court may sell such goods, animals and chattels by public auction or private treaty at such place or places, whether within or outside his bailiwick, and whether within or outside the territorial boundaries of Saorstát Eireann in which in his opinion such goods, animals and chattels can be sold to the best advantage, and may remove such goods, animals and chattels or any of them or cause same to be removed from the place where same were seized to such place or places of sale.</P>
      <P>(2)  All goods, animals and other chattels taken in execution by any Under-Sheriff under any such writ or decree as aforesaid may pending the sale thereof be impounded, stored and kept by the Under-Sheriff in such place or places whether within or outside his bailiwick and whether within or outside the territorial boundaries of Saorstát Eireann as he shall think fit, and notwithstanding that such place or places is or are not appointed or authorized by law to be used as pounds.</P>
      <P>(3)  Wherever any goods, animals or other chattels shall be removed under this section by or by order of the Under-Sheriff to any place outside his bailiwick the Under-Sheriff shall in addition to the amount of the debt stated in the writ or decree under which such goods, animals and chattels were seized and of all charges leviable by law levy for the amount of all costs incurred by him,</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  in or about the removal of such goods, animals and chattels from the places at which they were seized to every place (including the place of sale) to which such goods, animals and chattels are removed before the sale thereof,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  in or about the storing, impounding and preservation of such goods, animals and chattels (including the feeding and watering <Col N="1181" /> of such animals) between the time of seizure and the time of sale,</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  in or about the sale and any attempted sale of such goods, animals or chattels other than a sale or attempted sale within the bailiwick of the Under-Sheriff.</P>
    <P>All such costs and expenses as are mentioned in this sub-section may be deducted by the Under-Sheriff from the proceeds of the sale of the goods, animals and chattels as a first charge thereon.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Under-Sheriff shall be sole judge of the place or places at which any goods, animals or other chattels taken in execution by him can be sold to the best advantage and no action shall lie against any Under-Sheriff on account of his having sold any such goods, animals or chattels as aforesaid outside his bailiwick.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section the expression &ldquo;charges leviable by law&rdquo; means charges leviable under any enactment, rule or order in force at the passing of this Act or under any provision of this Act other than this section.</P>
    <P>I will not pretend to any optimism and will not say as is sometimes said when introducing such motions that I am sure it will be accepted unanimously.  I am sure it will not, but it is a necessary provision, and it is one of the main proposals of the Bill.  It is to give the Under-Sheriff power to sell outside his bailiwick, to remove chattels or live stock he may seize and sell elsewhere. The local auction in existing conditions in the country is not likely to prove a success and would not be in the truest interests of either the judgment debtor or the creditor.  It is therefore proposed at the discretion of the Under-Sheriff to abolish it whenever he may think fit to do so, and that he shall have power to remove seized chattels or live stock outside the bailiwick.  It provides that they may be impounded outside the bailiwick and if necessary outside the territorial boundaries of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>This is not a penal provision.  It is not penal in its intent and it will not prove penal in practice.  Instead of the local auction, which resulted either in a defeat of the law by a cheap purchase by a judgment debtor or his kinsman or kinswoman, there will be a genuine sale, and <Col N="1182" /> it will not be a sale the public will go to believing that it is one where the man who is selling has no particular personal interest in getting the best price or where people will go expecting to get goods at half or one-third of the value.  It means that the goods or live stock may be removed outside of the bailiwick, outside the tone of possible intimidation and certain local odium, and sold for their real value in an ther place.  I submit the result to the creditor and to the debtor will be beneficial.  It will be beneficial to the debtor as the real value of his property seized and sold will be secured, and of course, over and above the amount of his debts, and the amount of charges and fees, the proceeds of such sale will be handed back to him.  In the past he was liable to have a beast worth £14 or £15 seized and sold for £7 or £8 as a bargain, because it was known it was a sheriff's sale, and the under-sheriff had no particular interest in the matter, beyond clearing the amount of his debt, plus some fees.  Now, under this Bill the position will be, that the live stock will be removed outside the zone of intimidation and odium, and will be sold at their real value.  It is not a hardship in these circumstances to say that the cost of their removal will be on the judgment debtor, in view of the fact that the whole thing is calculated to produce a much better price, and consequently to redound to his own interest.</P>

If it were desirable to open, wide the doors of corruption, certainly the words in the Bill are admirably adapted for the purpose.  I desire to call attention to the curious effect of the acceptance of that amendment, withdrawing the powers from the Sheriff to sell by private treaty, and the refusal to accept the amendment to the last clause in connection with the publication of advertisements.  To my mind, a public auction without an advertisement is a contradiction of terms.  Assuming you could hold a public auction <Col N="1183" /> without advertising, the &ldquo;publicity&rdquo; would be no good, and I really would press the Minister, between now and the next Reading, to reconsider the effect of his refusal to amend the previous section, inasmuch as he now accepts withdrawal of the words &ldquo;private treaty.  In the previous section, which is connected with this one, the Sheriff is expressly told it is not necessary for him to advertise.  I suggested that we should modify that, and say he need not advertise in his bailiwick.  If the Minister does that, then the previous clause will tally with this one, in which you are now going to tell the Sheriff he must sell by public auction.  As the matter now stands, I submit Clauses 3 and 4 are contradictions, inasmuch as Clause 3 says you need not advertise this sale at all, and Clause 4 says he must sell by public auction.</P>

      <P>I am not at all sure that this amendment goes far enough, because under this wide Bill it may be that the Sheriff can sell in Great Britain, even if we take these words out.  That is a matter for consideration on the next Reading.  For the present I am anxious to get out in the two places where they occur the words giving express permission to the Sheriff to sell abroad.  There may be reasons that can be advanced for giving him this permission.  I absolutely fail to discover them.  The Minister when introducing this section said, if I recollect, that the Sheriff could sell abroad if necessary, but this section does not limit him in any way.  It gives him absolute discretion. The Deputies will see that you pile up the cost of execution enormously, if you are going to transport goods to England, France or Germany.  I have the strongest objection to this section, because I fail to see any need for it, because it is contrary to the principle on which executions have always been carried out, because you are introducing a revolutionary suggestion, that creditors cannot get a fair deal in Ireland, and I suggest that the matter is completely met, if you remove the goods in the case of absolute necessity out of the particular district where there may be strong local feeling.  I do most strenuously urge that these words, authorising the Sheriff to sell in England or elsewhere abroad, should be struck out.</P>

The acceptance of the elimination of the words &ldquo;or private treaty&rdquo; does not conflict with the failure to accept the amendment referring to the publication and advertisement.

      <P>You asked that I should adhere to the public advertisement. I think the objections to this Section that have been voiced so far are insular. Circumstances might very well arise in which it would be easier to convey cattle to an open market in England than to bring them, say, to a Dublin market.  Cattle are shipped from various ports around the coast, from Waterford, Wexford, Drogheda, Derry, and so on, and in these days, when certain enlightened people are destroying railways through the country, it is very often easier and cheaper to convey cattle out of the country than to bring them to the big market in the capital of the country for sale.  It is not to be supposed that the Under-Sheriff, or anyone else, will bring cattle to England if they can more easily and more cheaply convey them to a convenient market within the confines of the country.  This provision was simply put into be used in case of necessity, in case of emergency, and to prevent a situation arising in which we would have to come back to this Dáil, and say such and such a railway bridge was blown up last night, and in view of that it becomes impossible to transport cattle from that particular area to the Dublin market, and we would ask you to amend the Enforcement of Law Act to permit of cattle being conveyed out of the country. The provision enabling cattle to be conveyed out of the country will only be availed of when cattle can be more conveniently and more cheaply brought out of the country than brought to the capital for sale in the Dublin market or elsewhere.  I was more sympathetically inclined to consider the amendment to that provision before the Deputy had spoken than afterwards, because I found that the objection to it, was simply based on insularity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of all the sections of this Bill, with the general intention of which I have been in agreement, I think Section 4, to which attention was drawn by Deputy Magennis when he described the Bill as &ldquo;ferocious,&rdquo; does unquestionably in its present form deserve that description.  The worst feature of Section 4 it is the intention of this amendment to remove.  I am impressed to some extent with the argument put forward by the Minister in his rejection of this amendment that it might be cheaper and that it might be more convenient to remove goods from certain parts of Ireland to England than to remove them to other parts of Ireland. As to his objection to the insularity of motive, that is another question altogether. If to be Irish is to be insular, then one can bear that charge with one's customary fortitude.  But that is not the construction that will generally be put on these words.  The construction that will be put on them when goods are taken out of this country is this, that the Government of Ireland has failed to find some place within the territory of its jurisdiction where it can ensure the safety of such a sale.  It is in order to protect the Government and in order to protect the Legislature against that aspersion that I would still urge that these words be deleted, and that even if there be extra cost, that the sale of goods be limited to the jurisdiction of the State which appoints the Sub-Sheriffs or Deputy-Sheriffs as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I think it is only right to oppose this amendment.  Clause 4 of the Bill is exceptionally villainous in its extremity, and the Minister in supporting it practically admitted the consciousness of its iniquity.  He did not expect support for it with any enthusiasm.  No <Col N="1187" /> doubt he knew that, unless the subsequent sections are very radically altered, he was, as I described it before, outlawing, or possibly providing you with what is in effect outlawry of, innocent debtors. It is better therefore, in my opinion, that the Bill should go through this Dáil with all its vices thick upon it, for the amendment will be defeated in any case, and it is better that the public should understand that when we come to make emergency legislation we are so impressed with the fact that it is emergency legislation that we become panicky and introduce measures, such as are indicated in Clause 4, that admit of no reasonable defence. I have already pointed to the possibility there is in this of leaving room for collusive fraud.  The Minister spoke exclusively of cattle.  It is very hard to remove a herd of cattle and deal with it without some measure of publicity; but there are other types of chattels dealt with in this Bill that are much more easily removed.  What this Bill proposes to do is to empower an Under-Sheriff to deal with valuables in the possession of a judgment debtor according as the Minister calls it to &ldquo;his discretion,&rdquo; but which I prefer to call his indiscretion.  Under the later clause which the Minister read with a certain amount of unction, Sub-section 4, the Under-Sheriff shall be the sole judge of such place or places, whether within or outside his bailiwick, and whether within or outside the territorial boundaries of Saorstát Eireann, in which in his opinion such goods, animals and chattels can be sold to the best advantage.  He asked himself the question&mdash;&ldquo;to the best advantage of whom,&rdquo; and he answered with a certain amount of hesitation, &ldquo;to the best advantage of the judgment debtor or the creditor.&rdquo; But what about the information of the Under-Sheriff?  We know with regard to auctions that a celebrated Lord Chief Justice in England spent months trying to devise a formula to circumvent the process that is technically known as the &ldquo;knock-out.&rdquo; We know perfectly well how works of art sent across to Christies' for sale are &ldquo;crabbed&rdquo; by a combination of dealers who have got a hint of what to do.  An Under-Sheriff would think that in dealing with works of art that one was sending them to the best market in sending them across to Christies', and that he would <Col N="1188" /> get the highest amount, but he would be ignorant of the circumstances that are peculiar to these markets.  &ldquo;Notwithstanding any rule of law or any statute:&rdquo; we are sweeping away that protection of the law that hitherto existed, and we are putting it in the power of a comparatively ignorant Under-Sheriff, or a man whose qualification for appointment was his civic and moral courage under circumstances of danger, not his knowledge of life, or the conditions of life, or his acquaintance with law or equity, or any of these things&mdash;we are putting it absolutely in his power to deal as he pleases with his seizures, and to remove them out of the territory of Saorstát Eireann. I say that it is better to let that stand in all is hideousness than for us to try to amend it.</P>

      <P>That is quite right, A Chinn Chomhairle, provided they are debtors and ought to be made to pay. I have not at any time spoken against putting into operation drastic powers&mdash; I do not care how drastic or how fierce they are&mdash;for the recovery of certain debts.  But the net has been cast so wide by this Bill that other cases may be included, and my friend Deputy Fitzgibbon has drawn attention to it in another context. A man may be made the victim of a gross seizure, and his property may be dealt with in the way I have indicated, and he has no remedy in law left to him. Every remedy is taken from him that hitherto existed.  I have no objection to the Minister's attempt to repel injustice, but some Clauses of this Bill must be radically amended, so as to make it possible for a County Court Judge to give a certificate that though this debt was due, it was not possible under prevailing conditions for him to meet the claim to exempt him from the operations of this Clause. That is not in the Bill, and I have to speak of the Bill as it now comes before us unamended.</P>

      <P>That is the only point that the Deputy made.  We are in Committee and we are passing this Bill section by section, and if there is something else wrong with the Section, why not put it? The only point that has been made against this Section is that it empowers the Sheriff to take the goods outside his bailiwick, and for giving powers of that sort to the Sheriff the Section is described as hideous, outlawry, villainous, and so on.  I must say, and I think the Dáil will agree, that that is simply a misuse of language.  It is not business, and we will keep to business as far as possible. There is no alternative at present except to give the Sheriff a discretion in cases to sell outside his bailiwick.  The Sheriff has discretion to sell inside his bailiwick if he wishes, but no one who <Col N="1190" /> knows the conditions at present can deny that a case might arise in which the Sheriff would find it necessary to go outside his bailiwick.  That is all the Clause proposes to do.  Will the Deputy suggest some other way of doing that if he agrees that it will be necessary in some cases to give the Sheriff such a power? That would be more like business.  I agree with the Minister that it is both in the interest of the debtor and the creditor in certain cases that the goods should be taken outside the Sheriff's bailiwick. There would be many cases in which it would be impossible to sell inside.  A better price is likely to be got outside, and I think this is one of the most useful and necessary Clauses in the Bill, and I would be very sorry to see it removed; I think it would take away entirely from the virtues of the Bill, and I think the Bill has a great many virtues.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the Minister forgot that I spoke against the amendment.  Consequently, approaching it from that angle, I was entitled to use the entire Clause, and I used the entire Clause.  It was not merely because goods seized might be taken outside the territory of Saorstát Eireann that I spoke of this thing in strong terms of condemnation.  That is one of the vices that are thick upon it.  But I described the Clause as a whole as the most iniquitous part of the measure.  The Minister invited me to say how else the purpose which the Bill exists to promote could be secured.  I have already pointed out that as it stands there are certain latent elements in it which in my conception of it are not susceptible of being made acceptable to anyone who is interested in Justice, but that a later Clause could be so amended as to secure that this Clause should have application only to those who are, in effect, as much disturbers of the social order as the destroyers of railway lines and other malefactors who are engaged in anti-social activities at the present time.  I have no objection to the Bill's intention.  If I had I should be guilty of gross inconsistency in voting as I have done for two Clauses already and in voting for the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is against this panic which the Minister himself, after I used the phrase &ldquo;panic haste,&rdquo; has himself given manifestation of that I protest.  Not once or twice the Ministry have asked &ldquo;What <Col N="1191" /> are we to do?&rdquo; This is a loose paraphrase of the language that they have used: &ldquo;What are we to do?  Can any critic of the measure suggest something better. We must get these debts paid.&rdquo; They are ready to sweep away every legal protection that now exists for debtors, so eager are they to find &ldquo;something&rdquo; that may be done.  I do not approve of that. I do not approve of this first Legislature under our newly acquired freedom showing so little regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The wide sweep which this Clause takes, by which it empowers the same treatment to be dealt out without remedy or protection to the innocent as to the debtor who refuses to pay, and who would make use of the dislocation of the law and of disorder in the country to save himself from the payment of debts which he lawfully owes, is what makes this thing so objectionable. Again I repeat what I have already said on the Second Reading.  The principle of the Bill, the purpose for which it is brought in, is commendable.  But, as I was about to say when the Minister interrupted me, why are we to indulge once again, as we have been doing recently, in the setting up of evil precedents merely because we want to do something right?  To do something right we are to <Col N="1192" /> do a great wrong, or, at any rate, leave the potentialities of doing a great wrong open.  I beg to assure the Minister who has just spoken that if I am talking nonsense it is absolutely without being aware of it.  I never was more sincere in my life; I never was more anxious to help to make a bad Bill good than when I speak upon this measure.  To speak of my having more intelligence than to hold the views that I hold is, no doubt, courteous, but it does not remove at all the essential part of the allegation that I treated the Dáil to a speech merely for the sake of hearing my voice, and to a discussion of a matter in which I had no serious interest. I do hope the Ministry are not going to proceed, as of late they have been showing the intention to do, by imputing motives and making suggestions of ulterior purpose, instead of meeting criticisms, and criticisms which are sincerely put forward.</P>

I am not a lawyer, and I do not understand the niceties of legal phrases and language, but I do know a little about the realities of life, and I can understand the position that might easily be created by an organisation or a conspiracy where a sale could be easily prevented.  It is all right to say that the Sheriff must make a sale.  To make a sale you must have somebody to buy, but in this country it is very easy to prevent the ordinary individual in the country from being a buyer.  We can understand such a position, and I take it that this instrument may or may not be used.  It is not an instrument of general application at all, but an instrument to be used in cases of this description with discretion. My interpretation of it may be wrong or right.  But that is the view I take of it.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is much fear that Sub-Sheriffs will transport goods that have been seized for sale to Germany or any other part of the world out of Saorstát Eireann.  But there is one aspect of this particular Clause, and it rather impresses me, and I wondered that it had not been relied upon by the Minister at first.  Unfortunately we may suffer from insularity, but still more unfortunately we have not <Col N="1193" /> got a complete island.  It seems to me that the Sub-Sheriff of the constituency that is so well represented here by Deputy McGoldrick would find this Clause rather convenient for him, and for the benefit of those judgment debtors against whom a distress was levied in Donegal.  Because it would be very difficult, indeed, for him to find a market outside his own bailiwick, without taking the seized goods out of the territory of what is at present Saorstát Eireann It may be, in happier days, counties now bordering on Donegal will be included in the Irish Free State.  But unless and until they are, some market immediately outside the County Donegal, and yet not within the Free State, would be the proper place for a Sub-Sheriff to realise cattle or goods of any kind that would be seized anywhere along that border, and without some such powers as this they would have to be transported through alien territory down to some place nearer to the place we are now.  For that reason it seems to me this Clause, or some form of it, will be really necessary.  I do not fear the enormous exportation of goods seized by Sheriffs at enormous expense, to a great distance to be sold at a gross under value.  I think there are very much more dangerous provisions in this Bill than this particular Clause, and, therefore I would not be prepared to oppose the Clause as a whole, and I cannot but think, in some form, it is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say that I thoroughly appreciate the remarks made by Deputy Fitzgibbon on this amendment.  I have to say that we, fortunately, do not want it in Donegal.  We do not require it.  We have no need for it, and it is never done there, but that does not apply generally, I am sure.  We can get on with our own business there.  We have no need for transporting anything. Our people will pay their way when called on to pay, and when the Courts function in the way they should function <Col N="1194" /> all through the whole country, there will be none of these agencies at all that will apply themselves towards preventing the possibility of honesty prevailing all over the whole country.  That is the character I have to give of the constituency that I have the honour to represent here.  As to the general principle of the amendment, I believe it is a wise principle.  I do not see, if there is a conspiracy or difficulty about getting a just price for an article that the Sheriff is called on to seize, that the Sheriff should not have recourse to the best market he can find.  I think he is only serving the interests of the State for which he is acting, as well as the interests of the parties themselves.  It is the interest of those who make the laws here to give him that opportunity, and they would be doing wrong if they did not give him that opportunity by passing the legislation that they are now passing, and which enables him to do so. It is an honest transaction, and I do not see why gentlemen should labour the question so fully and so vehemently, and pursue words and phrases to such a nice distinction to put into them interpretations which do not belong to them. I do not attach so much importance to words and phrases.  We, down in Donegal, call a spade.  We don't go round to find nice subtleties and distinctions about words and phrases.  I don't think they apply very much to the general position of affairs in this country, because this country at the present time has not time to wait for fine words and phrases and subtleties.  It has got to go on and get its work done, and get it done directly.  I do not see why we should apply ourselves or continue to keep a body like this concerned with the niceties and the fine distinctions about niceties that should prevail if everything was in perfect order in the country, and if everything went on in the way in which everybody would wish it to go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice earlier to-day that I desired to draw attention to a matter of urgent importance, to wit, the proclamation which appears in this morning's papers purporting to come from D. Hogan, Major-General, G.O.C. Dublin Command.  I take it the terms of the proclamation are familiar to all Deputies.  We are told in it that a conspiracy exists to kidnap certain persons, and that in pursuance of such conspiracy Senator John Bagwell was, by force of arms, seized and removed to an unknown destination.  Then a warning is uttered that in the event of the said Senator John Bagwell not being set, unharmed, at liberty, and permitted to return to his own home within 48 hours of the date and hour of this proclamation, punitive action will be taken against several associates in this conspiracy now in custody and otherwise.&rdquo; But for previous experiences one would say that such a Proclamation was astonishing and surprising. I want to ask the Dáil if it approves of such a document being issued in the name of any person acting under the Dáil's authority.  In the event of Senator Bagwell not being set at liberty, &ldquo;punitive action will be taken against several associates in this conspiracy now in custody and otherwise.&rdquo; Punitive action!  You are going to punish, not the culprit, but other people, who are presumed to have known something about this conspiracy; people, bear in mind, who, so far as we know, may, or may not, have been tried and convicted of any offence. <Col N="1197" /> We are kept in the dark about these people who are in custody; but &ldquo;punitive action&rdquo; is going to be taken against persons who are not guilty of the offence of kidnapping Senator Bagwell.  I do not know whether it is intended to defend this proclamation on the grounds that it is a deterrent, or on the grounds that it is punitive, as this proclamation itself says, or on the grounds of military necessity. I want to say that no civilised people, and no Legislature of a civilised State can defend this doctrine of reprisals, and that is what is meant here.  Somebody commits an offence, and somebody else must suffer for it, because, forsooth, the Executive arm is not capable of bringing to justice, or what purports to be justice, the offenders.  Therefore, somebody else must be made to suffer.  Certain action was taken some months ago, which was the subject of discussion in the Dáil of an accomplished fact.  Certain executions took place as a deterrent.  I do not know whether Ministers will argue that it was a deterrent; I do not know whether many people in the country would believe them if they did so argue.  The evidences of the last few weeks rather suggest that they were at fault in their judgment, but, on that occasion, we were told by the Minister for Defence that the action was not taken as a punishment.  Now it is going to be taken as a punishment; &ldquo;punitive action&rdquo; is to be taken against people in custody and against people not in custody, for an offence committed by somebody in Howth last night.  The Minister for Education told us, on the same occasion, that it was not an act of retaliation.  What are the punitive measures to be under this proclamation?  Will they be an act of retaliation?</P>

      <P>Now, the implication behind the Minister's disavowal, and, I think, behind this proclamation, is that all persons who are in military custody to-day are parties to this offence committed last night, of the arrest and deportation, <Col N="1198" /> or the removal to an unknown destination of Senator Bagwell.  Presumably that is the theory: that you have an organised corporate being which may be punished as a corporate being because of the action of one section of that corporate being.  Is that the argument?  If it is not then I say that there is no possible defence of such an act on the part of any Ministry.  If it is a corporate being, and if it is supposed to be a case of conspiracy of which these people, on the one hand, were parties to, and these people in custody were also parties to, then I say you are simply, by this act, raising that whole body into something which you had insisted, time and again, does not exist. You are raising it into the position of a corporate body and army, with which you have to deal as a military organisation. But the people against whom punitive action is threatened are of classes and of sections who are thought, by somebody within the National Army, to be either in sympathy with, or who might be in sympathy with, the action of such people as committed this offence.  But we are driven back to the whole question of why these people are detained for so long without any attempt to prove their guilt. Punitive action is to be taken against several associates.  We are left to guess whom those associates may be, and we are left to assume that the offenders in this case will be terrorised because some unknown person may be punished, may be made to suffer, unless some conditions are complied with within 48 hours.  I submit that this policy is bad for the State, is bad for the individuals who are participators in it, and it will not bring about any earlier cessation, but will rather extend the policy of strife and warfare. It will be suggested, I have no doubt, judging by precedent, that in raising this question we are trying to be lenient towards offenders, or, on the other hand, that we are trying to save our skins.  Motives will be suggested, if precedent is to be followed.  But I want to say that the motive in thus drawing attention to this proclamation is to try to save the Dáil, to try to save the Army, to try to save Saorstat Eireann from doing a thing that is indefensible in civilised life.  Military necessity, judging by the arguments that were used on previous occasions, will be urged in this matter.  It can only be defended by military <Col N="1199" /> necessity.  &ldquo;The safety of the people is the supreme law,&rdquo; and nothing must be conformed to that has hitherto been considered necessary because the military arm says that a certain other thing is necessary.  &ldquo;The safety of the people is the supreme law,&rdquo; and I am prepared to subscribe to that.</P>

      <P>But this does not insure it; it does not assist in the safety of the people; it tends towards the destruction of the people; it tends to the destruction of the whole view of civic morality and the supremacy of law which we hear so often about.  Deputy Fitzgibbon, in an earlier discussion to-day, spoke of certain things as being ferocious and barbarous.  I say this is the sort of thing that would suggest ferocity and barbarism.  It is not going to bring peace; it is not going to assist in bringing peace; it is not going to bring the criminals to a sense of what they owe to the Commonwealth, to civic life, law and order.  It is not going to save John Bagwell or any other person; rather it is a challenge to them to do their worst to John Bagwell. But that is a small matter compared with the evil result of this kind of thing upon the mentality of the people, and I submit that it is not worthy to go out in the name of the army, it is degrading to the army; it is degrading to the people behind the army, and it is, more than all, degrading to the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has challenged me on several points that arose out of a previous debate.  In that previous debate I can remember pointing out that those who criticised the policy and the action of the Government and of the authorised servants of the people, completely failed to produce any alternative, or to suggest any glimmer of an alternative.  I am perfectly sure that every one of my colleagues would agree with me that if the Deputy who has just spoken could induce the people of Ireland to invest him, and any colleagues that he might select, with the government of this country, and if they could produce a plan or a policy which would establish the right of this people, in the form to which they are <Col N="1200" /> committed to its establishment, my colleagues and myself would be very glad indeed to make way for the Deputy who has just spoken and for his colleagues.</P>
      <P>There are two points in the Proclamation to which he has drawn attention, but the significance of which has apparently escaped his observation.  First of all, the Proclamation states that a conspiracy exists. It certainly understates that conspiracy. A conspiracy does exist, and I am quite certain that not one single member of this Dáil will deny its existence, and its object is avowed.  Its object is to overthrow this State.  That conspiracy is based on the doctrine that every one of us here, the Deputy who has just spoken included, is acting here, not by the authority of the Irish people, but by some other authority which is not a lawful authority, that we are here as usurpers, that every act committed, aye, every word and syllable of ours uttered in this place is an illegality and an offence, and that we are punishable for it.  That conspiracy exists to defeat the right of the Irish people, as expressed in this Assembly, to overthrow this Assembly, and to overthrow the authority of the majority of the Irish people, and that particular manifestation of it that is alluded to in the Proclamation is but one item in the conspiracy.  Will anyone here deny that such a conspiracy exists? The leaders of the conspiracy themselves avow it, and they glory in it.  Deputy Johnson, just as much as I am, is an ursurper, a criminal, a traitor, and this conspiracy is just as much directed against his right to do what he has just done, to stand up here in order in the proceedings of this Assembly, as it is against my right to act here as a servant of the people.  Now surely we ought to recognise that fact.  I am very glad indeed that this discussion has been raised; I am glad that the challenge has come on this particular issue, because I hold that those who take up the position taken up by Deputy Johnson now put themselves in the wrong.  I will say nothing at all about methods, and I will say it is a complete error of judgment that they themselves, by that error of judgment, and by the position which they take up generally, are undoubtedly assisting in that conspiracy.</P>

      <P>Now I will pass to another word which occurs towards the end of the Proclamation.  The Proclamation is directed against the associates in that conspiracy.  That is not retaliation.  Every single person who is engaged in a conspiracy of that kind against the right, the plain right of the people of Ireland, every single person so engaged is a public enemy.  It is altogether in vain to endeavour to thrust aside by speaking slightingly of it, the maxim which the Deputy quoted:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The safety of the people is the supreme law.&rdquo; It may be that, in the Deputy's judgment, the steps that are taken from time to time are not efficient.  Other people judge differently.  The Deputy is entitled to express his difference of judgment on these matters.  He is entitled to come to different conclusions and to suppose that a certain policy, prosecuted in a certain way, will not ultimately succeed, but to endeavour to persuade us that a civilised community is limited in the right of preserving its own safety&mdash;for that is really the doctrine&mdash;against a conspiracy of this kind, that endeavour I do not think will succeed.  The conspiracy is not denied, it will not be denied, the fact that a large number of persons are associated in that conspiracy will not be denied.  It is against associates in that conspiracy that the punitive action announced in that Proclamation is announced, and not against any others. It may happen in times of this kind, in a crisis of this kind, that a mistake might be made as to whether a certain person was or was not an associate in such a conspiracy.  But in all the criticisms that we have heard up to now we have not been told that any such mistake was made, or that punitive measures were directed or put in force against persons that have not been associated in this manifest and avowed conspiracy.  I say once more that I am glad that the challenge has been taken, because I am confident that the result of that challenge will be that this Assembly will once more assure the military servants of the people of Ireland that they expect them to do what they can in defence of the rights of the people of Ireland.  I remember reading of a General of old <Col N="1202" /> who was entrusted in some similar crisis with the defence of the rights and safety of the State.</P>
    <P>It was said of him in his own time that he did not value more highly the rumblings of dissatisfaction than the safety of the people, and that, therefore, now and henceforth the glory of that man stands forth clear, and if the military servants of the people of Ireland, or any one of them, act in the same spirit, and do not place the rumblings of dissatisfaction before the safety of the State and the safety of the people, the people of this country in the future will look for no defence for what those men are doing now.</P>

      <P>The Minister who has just spoken said a good deal on first principles.  Some of the general principles he enunciates, I think, we can all find ourselves in agreement with.  He very carefully avoided the whole point of Deputy Johnson's speech against the issue of this proclamation, and against the punitive action announced in this proclamation.  The Minister says if I interpret him correctly&mdash;and I hope he will correct me if I am mistaken&mdash;that no drastic action was taken against anyone who was not acting in this conspiracy to overthrow the State, but very little information as to the activities of many of the people who have suffered in one way or another through the action of the Government has been given to the Dáil, or of those particular activities of the men who are associated in this conspiracy. Right from the beginning of the assembly of this Dáil we on those benches have begged, pleaded, and implored for all information that ought to be given, and time after time we have been refused that information.  We even find that when certain men are executed, that the actual proclamation announcing the execution does not even tell you when the offence was committed.  We cannot understand why the Ministry should be so persistent in holding back all this information. Now the Minister has stated that through what he calls or considers certains errors of judgment of Deputy Johnson and those of us who are his colleagues, we are assisting the conspiracy against the State.</P>

      <P>Including ourselves.  That is a matter of opinion, but if it is the considered opinion of the Ministers, then the duty of the Ministry is plain, and it is to prevent us from assisting, even in that way, the conspiracy against the State.  Of course, we deny we are assisting the conspiracy.  Now, if there is one act more than any other act, whether done by the opponents or supporters of the Government, that has aroused distrust in the Government of the Free State, that act is the act of reprisal. I have found only a very small percentage of those who were firm and constant supporters of the Free State but have deplored that act, and pointed out that the consequences of such an act would not be such as the Ministry in-intended. That act has shaken the confidence of a great number of people who are supporters of the Free State, and has shaken their confidence in the Free State Government.  It is easy enough, quite easy, for the Ministry to turn round and say that if we on these benches could do better, and could get the confidence of the people to do better, then that they would be very glad to get out.  But that does not get over the consequences of such acts as are foreshadowed in this proclamation just issued.  Does anyone seriously believe that the duty of any Government is to punish somebody who has had no active part in this kidnapping, instead of taking such measures as would prevent kidnapping.  Now, I know quite as well as the Minister for Defence knows, the difficulties that the protective and offensive arms of the State are met with&mdash;difficulties of building up an army, and the difficulty of doing police as well as army duty.  But even in this very evening's paper there is a reflection upon the Minister and upon the Ministry. Senator Sir Horace Plunkett's house was mined the night before last, and within 24 or 48 hours those or their associates who had not completed the job were able to come back and finish the job and set the place on fire.  The paper says something about the Civic Guard doing their work well enough.  Now it is that state of mind in those people who have the protection of the people of the State in their hands that allows such things as the kidnapping of Senator Bagwell to take place. I do not believe for a moment that whatever punitive action is taken will deter <Col N="1204" /> those opponents of the State from kidnapping other people.  I think that kidnapping is a criminal act of the worst kind; I think it is not only criminal, but, like many other acts of those associated with those who did it, I think it is a stupid act, but to punish somebody else instead of the culprits and criminals who committed the offence is not going to put an end to that kind of thing.  There has been on previous occasions some argument running like this: that if the friends and relatives of those in arms against the State would only exert themselves, especially where those in arms against the State are very young men, a good many might be detached from the opponents of the State.  But what does the Ministry think is the state of mind of the friends and relatives&mdash;some of them supporters of the Free State&mdash;of the prisoners in the jails and camps on reading this proclamation this morning, except to come to the broad and general conclusion to which the Ministry have come, that everybody associated with these prisons are all in the conspiracy, and are fair game for this punitive action.  The ordinary people do not argue as nicely or so closely as Ministers or Deputies do, and do not see the implication so well as Ministers and Deputies do.  The Minister will reply that if they come to punish anyone in the prison they will take care that they will not pick out at random, but will punish those people who are well known rebels; but that is not what strikes ordinary people up and down the country at all; they look at it in a different way, and consider that any prisoner is fair game for this kind of thing. The Ministry does not take into consideration that point of view at all.  I associate myself most heartily with Deputy Johnson's denunciation of the spirit behind those reprisals, because it is nothing short of a reprisal, and is unworthy of a civilised people.  It may be said there are a great many in Ireland who are not civilised.  It is quite true there are many things done in Ireland that ordinarily would not be done by a civilised people.  There have been many illusions, and unless I am very much mistaken, some of the Ministers are suffering from those illusions, but the Dáil, the National Assembly of Ireland, is the last place in which official sanction should be given to anything that is unworthy <Col N="1205" /> of a civilised people.  The duty of the Dáil, even at the cost of the life of every man in the Dáil, is to preserve the good name and the civilised outlook of a civilised people.  This State&mdash;the Free State&mdash;and all the things that have been won are very well worth defending, however some of us may view some of the things in connection with it.  But it would be a better day for the Irish people and the Irish nation, and for the very idea of statehood in Ireland, that this State should go down, that this Dáil should go down, and that every Senator and Deputy should go down, rather than that the Dáil and the Government, responsible heads of the State, should lower the whole State down to the level of those who are doing uncivilised things, savage things, and barbarous things.  By approving of the measures proclaimed in this document the Dáil and the Ministry will be lowering the whole thing back again to barbarism, because the doctrine of reprisals on people who are not the actual people guilty of specific offences is nothing but the doctrine of barbarism.</P>

      <P>The speech made by the Minister for Education places one in a position of some difficulty. I imagine that there is not one single Deputy in this Dáil who is not convinced that there is a conspiracy to destroy the State, and who is convinced, moreover, that that conspiracy is a felonious conspiracy.  It is a conspiracy of maddened criminals, and an end must be brought to it.  That, I imagine, is a doctrine of which the Minister himself would not pretend to hold a monopoly. It is one with which we would all very heartily concur.  But he goes further and says: unless each Deputy in this Dáil is in agreement with the method brought forward by himself and his colleagues for ending that conspiracy, if there are any of us who believe that unwise, foolish, nay perhaps wrong, things are being done, that the expression of these beliefs constitutes those who express them, aiders and abettors of the conspiracy.</P>

      <P>I gathered that from the tenour of his remarks, and <Col N="1206" /> I am very glad that he should disavow that construction, because it relieves one of a great deal of the difficulty one feels. There is a conspiracy, and there are a number of methods by which it may be met.  The Minister stands to-night over one of the methods enunciated in the papers this morning, and he states here that the safety of the people is the supreme law.  I imagine that the actual expression that was intended to be quoted is that the salvation of the people is the supreme law.  Here is a statement made this morning that, because a certain Senator has been captured and removed to an unknown place, certain other persons shall have punitive measures taken against them, not the persons who removed the Senator, not the persons who might be proved as having participated in this conspiracy.  It is proposed that this will save the Senator who has been captured, because, surely, as has already been suggested, it must be fairly clear that the measure taken this morning will do more to jeopardise Senator Bagwell's life than any other action that could have been taken.</P>

I venture to think that the Deputy who spoke before me in this matter will prove right, and that health and sustenance will be given to those who constitute this conspiracy and who are conducting it to-day by taking action which will be just as destructive of law as any action that they could take. They are taking action for which there is no sanction in law.  And, as I said previously, if we have to oppose them, the only way is by seeing that the action we take shall, at least, have the sanction of law, so that we shall oppose lawlessness with lawfulness, and not lawlessness with counter-lawlessness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, when speaking here yesterday evening, is reported in to-day's papers&mdash;and I think correctly reported&mdash;as saying: &ldquo;The more criticism there is now of the manner in which the administration of authority is carried out, the more Irregularism will spread.  The sense of suspicion there is in the Dáil amongst certain persons is <Col N="1207" /> spreading throughout the country.&rdquo; That, in effect, is repeated throughout the statement made this evening from the Ministerial Benches by the Minister for Education.  To me that appears to be a denial of the right&mdash;the constitutional right&mdash;to criticise fairly and constructively the policy of the Government carrying on the affairs of this country. I am not, certainly, going to deny&mdash;in fact, I am going to admit&mdash;and I think there will be nobody so foolish as to deny, that there is a conspiracy in this country to do all the things stated by the Minister for Education.  But in examining into the state of affairs created by that admission, I think nobody knows better than the Government and the Minister for Defence, that that conspiracy is not a conspiracy headed or carried on by one individual from a centralised authority.  I believe whatever conspiracy there is in this country to destroy the power of the Government elected by the majority of the people, is comprised of a number of classes, and of a large number of people, with different objects in view.  I believe that the state of affairs that exists is largely due to the deplorable speech that was made at the beginning of last year by Mr. de Valera in Thurles, when he told young Irishmen, and I emphasise young Irishmen, that they could only march right through successfully to the achievement of this royal Republic over the dead bodies of their fellow-countrymen.  It may not be correct to say that when he went that far he realised that the state of affairs you find in Ireland to-day would exist. I am sure he never anticipated that, in leading a conspiracy of that kind, he would gather behind him, in achieving his object, all the elements that are behind the conspiracy that certainly exists to destroy the power of the Government.  I believe the fight now going on is not one for Republicanism, or, if it is, that a very small percentage of the people opposed to the Government are fighting with any political conviction so far as that aspect of the question is concerned.  We have a small number drawn from that class.  Another element is what some will call Bolshevists or Communists, and a further section are fighting against the Government simply to attain their own selfish ends. <Col N="1208" /> These are nothing more nor less than armed robbers.  In that way, I will admit, there is a distinction, and that must be always made between what are termed by people outside the Dáil political prisoners.  I do not admit, and never will admit, that a man who goes out to fight against this Government, and to rob and plunder and destroy the country is a political prisoner in that sense.  In that way I think the Government must be very careful as to how they proceed to deal with what they call, and what I admit is, certainly, conspiracy. Now, I believe for some time past that the time has arrived&mdash;if it has not passed&mdash;when if this country is going to be saved from anarchy, destruction and chaos, that the people who believe in ordered civilised Government, must, through some form of similar organisation, range themselves rightly and definitely on the side of the people standing for that system of Government. I believe, arising out of that, that the policy initiated by the Government, if they stand over the Proclamation issued this morning, is not going to bring people in that direction behind them.  The Minister for Education was careful to avoid trying to justify what we are protesting against, that is, to put it plainly, the policy of reprisals.  Nothing less is put forward in this Proclamation.  I believe no Government, and no body of men, elected by the people as a constitutional authority, can ever stand behind the word reprisal.  I have known Mr. Bagwell a number of years.  No one regrets more than I do, although I differ with him in outlook, and I believe we all do, what has happened to him, and no one would be more glad than I would be that the people who took such action should be punished in a proper way.  I believe, and I was informed this afternoon not very far from here by a close personal friend who works in daily association with Mr. Bagwell, that the last paragraph of that Proclamation more endangers Mr. Bagwell's life than it would have the effect of trying to save it.  The Minister for Education has invited us on these benches if we have an alternative form of Government to put it up, and that he will be glad to walk out, and let us walk in.  Personally I am not anxious to share the invitation that was issued to us.  I would <Col N="1209" /> say, arising out of that, personally, that if I thought Ireland would be saved to-morrow from the destruction that is creeping over it, myself and every other member of the Dáil would walk out, and let Mr. de Valera walk in, if he could control the people behind him.  But I believe the very element Mr. de Valera has helped to create would be the very first to destroy the Government that he would set up if he took your place to-morrow. Therefore I can sympathise with him, even in what he calls the system of Republican Government, because every patriotic Irishman, and every man in other countries, too, who attempts to form a Government must start with punishing the criminals who oppose the will of the majority of the people.  The last paragraph of the Proclamation states: &ldquo;Warning is hereby given that in the event of the said Senator John Bagwell not being set unharmed at liberty and permitted to return to his home, within 48 hours of this Proclamation, punitive action will be taken against several associates in this conspiracy now in custody.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Government have known those people to be associates of a conspiracy of this kind, what did they do before Senator John Bagwell was kidnapped to deal with them?  I put it definitely to the Minister for Defence to say, when he is replying, what do they intend to do with those people if Senator John Bagwell is released unharmed?  I appeal to the Government to reconsider the terms, especially the last paragraph of that proclamation that has been issued.  I believe on reconsideration of the matter they may possibly, if they are not blind, come to the conclusion that they themselves are embarking on a policy similar to the one that we here protest against&mdash;namely, that of the people who are opposing them by armed force.  I believe, if they would reconsider the matter and withdraw the last paragraph at any rate of that proclamation, they would do more to save the life of the man who has been kidnapped than any other action they may take.  I hope that eventually they will discover the people who are responsible for the kidnapping of Senator Bagwell, and punish them in the only way they should be punished.</P>

      <P>As nobody else <Col N="1210" /> on the Government benches seems inclined to speak before the Minister for Defence puts forward his plea, it may be necessary for me to throw in my lot with my colleagues on these benches.  I wonder what do the Irish people look to in the future as regards government, if men can be kidnapped by an armed minority in the country, and if the majority are going to carry out reprisals in order to prove that they are a majority. In that event I think it is time that the Government should withdraw.  Ninetyfive per cent. of the people of Ireland are looking to this, their duly selected Government, to safeguard themselves and their property.  I have said elsewhere, where I had no protection whatever, that I intend, for my part, to support majority rule in this country.  The people who are out against this Government functioning, or the majority of them, are not out for a political purpose, but, as Deputy Davin said, for personal gain.  Certainly I do not agree with proclamations of this kind being issued.  I was more than rejoiced when I heard the Minister for Education, Deputy Professor MacNeill, say that the army are the servants of the people.  The people in the country imagine that the army are the masters of the people, and, as far as I can see, every order that is issued, every motion that is brought forward, every execution that takes place is by the authority of the army.  No notice of sentences are left on the table of this Dáil, and there is no evidence of trial. Everything that I can see shows that this nation of ours at the present time and the Government are governed by military force.  If the army are the servants of the people, surely they should look to the people before they carry out such proclamations as this.  They should ask the leave of this Dáil before they issue them. I certainly agree with Deputy Davin when he said that the Minister for Education issued almost a challenge to the Labour Deputies that if they could put forward a better alternative they could step in as the Government.  Like my colleague I have no desire whatever that they should do that.  It is not that it is too dangerous a job.  I do not disagree with him when he said that Labour had no desire to step in as the Government. They may come in in the near future, and when they do come in the Irish question, I think, will be settled.  I disagree <Col N="1211" /> with him when he said that de Valera could come forward here and take charge of the Government.  De Valera can come here when he has with him the majority of the people.  Until then, I hope the majority will rule.  I do not like Deputies, such as the learned Deputy MacNeill, to stand up and put forward a plea in order to change the opinion of the country or of this Dáil against the Deputies who stand up here and speak against this and other proclamations and motions put forward by the military authorities. I sincerely hope that it is the opinion of this Dáil that neither Deputy Johnson nor the other members on these benches stand up for the sole purpose of saving their skins.  As we have said heretofore, so we shall say henceforward&mdash;we are acting with the majority, and with the majority we intend to remain.  But we do object to executions.  I wonder what will the Irish people say in forty-eight hours when they see in the Press that four or five men, prisoners held for the past four or five months in a certain prison, have been executed as a reprisal because Mr. Bagwell was not released.  I wonder what credit the Government will have for that.  I sincerely hope the Government will not take such a drastic step as this.  Certainly punish the culprit if you can find him, but, above all things, don't punish the prisoners&mdash;the unfortunate men you have in your charge&mdash;the men you are in duty bound under the law of the land and the law of heaven to protect while they are your prisoners.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, we are quite anxious to preserve what some of the Deputies who have spoken called the good name and the civilised outlook of this country, and, being to some extent charged with the preservation of the country and its particular outlook, I certainly would feel that I had not helped to preserve its good name and to preserve any kind of up-to-date outlook in it if I had allowed action to take place which would result in, one by one, our Senators, and, one by one, our Deputies here in the Dáil, being taken away to some unknown place; or ten of them or twenty of them, or half of them, and then the body responsible for this present conspiracy to turn round and say &ldquo;Now, if you do this, or if you do that, or if you <Col N="1212" /> do the other thing, it will be bad for those people we have got together.&rdquo; It has been said here that previous action of ours, to which this proposed action of ours now is supposed to be analogous, has shaken the confidence of a number of people in the country, in the Ministry, and in this Government generally.  Now, the action that is complained of was taken on the first occasion on which a member of this Assembly was assassinated as the initial step in the carrying out of an order which stated that those members who voted for the upkeeping of the Government policy here should be assassinated. It may be a pure coincidence, but I am&mdash;and I take it the Ministry and their supporters in the Dáil are&mdash;perfectly satisfied that what put an end to that particular line of policy on the part of the Irregulars was the action we took then. Now, we are going to oppose by whatever lights the Lord has given us an attempt on the part of anybody to destroy this Government, to take away any section of the population, and to say we hold these as hostages until such time as you bow to our will, to our pistols, to our bombs, and to our tin cans of petrol.  It is because we are going to do that that we issued the warning that appears in to-day's papers.  We are asked what have we been doing with those people whom we intend to punish in the case of the kidnapping of Senator Bagwell, and what are we going to do with them if he be returned. As regards what we have been doing with them, we have been dealing with them and holding our hands in a spirit of clemency, and as regards what we are prepared to do with them, if Senator Bagwell is returned, we are prepared to deal with them as we are prepared to deal with their other associates in this conspiracy, with all the clemency that all the circumstances of the day and of the week and of the times generally allow.  A few days ago I did see a gleam of hope, and during those few days&mdash;and a number of men were to have been executed on Saturday morning&mdash;I held the military hand that appears to be so heavy on the country, and I have been holding it for a few days, and I was prepared to hold it until I would see whether this gleam on the horizon was going to broaden into something like daylight of reason in the country.  While waiting for that gleam of light to develop and to grow <Col N="1213" /> big I am not prepared to stand by and see a number of our Deputies and a number of our Senators here kidnapped, and if some Deputies seem to think&mdash;and it is a matter of opinion&mdash;that the action we have taken this morning is going more to jeopardise the life of Mr. Bagwell than otherwise, well, it is unfortunate that lives have to be jeopardised in the prosecution of a policy to put down a conspiracy that is near to crushing this country; it is unfortunate that lives have to be sacrificed, but we are determined to show that a policy to put the Government by any means into such a position that it has to bow to a few pistoliers in the country, that policy is not going to be allowed to be embarked upon with freedom or with impunity.  We have it suggested here that Mr. de Valera has stirred up forces which he cannot control. Now that is a very specious plea for Mr. de Valera.  A certain confidence has to some extent been broken, and that puts me free, at any rate, to mention a certain fact.  Subsequent to the events of the Four Courts, because certain representations were made to me by outsiders, I met Mr. de Valera personally, took it on my own responsibility, without the knowledge of any of my colleagues, to see and take a last word from him definitely before settling my own definite attitude as to the policy I would recommend to the Government.  His position was this very spacious plea that is now made for him.  He said he did not agree with what was being done, that he had no responsibility for what was being done, that certain people thought it right to adopt this particular line of action, and as long as there were people in the country to adopt that line of action he was an humble soldier behind them.  Two or three or four months after that we find him arranging to be the President of their Executive Council, arranging to support their so-called army in their work, arranging to sign with Liam Lynch all matters concerning defence.  And we know what matters concerning defence subsequently were: orders to destroy our railways, to shoot our public representatives, and to burn their houses.  I do not accept that plea that the people who stirred up this in the country cannot to a very large extent make it subside.  And I will not <Col N="1214" /> accept it until they have made some attempt to undo what they have done.  I believe they can do much.  We, then, are in the position that we are up against people who take the type of acts against the life of the country, that are being taken daily, and of which there has been a crescendo within the last few days. Our proclamation, the proclamation of the officer in charge of the Dublin District, is to make it perfectly clear in the only way which we have left, to make it perfectly clear beforehand at any rate, that we are not going to leave unused any powers that we may have to put down the people who are responsible for carrying out this work.  We are told that misgivings may be caused in the minds of the people, because they do not know what exactly we mean when we issue a proclamation saying that punitive measures will be taken against some of these people's associates.</P>

    <P>What we mean is that the clemency that we have been exercising will not be exercised in cases in which otherwise it would, and that, if necessary, we will not let go free from the charge of responsibility for stirring up the destruction in which it is attempted to smother this country anyone who is either an instigator of individual acts or an instigator of the whole campaign, or an abettor or a helper in any way.  In doing that, and in taking the action that we will be taking, nothing will be done in a spirit of ferocity or in a spirit of brutality, but that does not mean that it will not be done with all the power that we have, and with all the strength that we can find in this country.  We are faced, no doubt, with doubts in the minds of the people, and faced, no doubt, with awkward questions and awkward statements made here in the Dáil.  We have very definite information that statements in the Dáil here have drawn the attention of the Irregulars to the fact that a particular type of destruction is a type of destruction which hits very hard at the country.  We cannot be wise in all our words, but we can be wise when we have our mouths shut at least.  We do expect of all the people and all the Deputies in this Dáil, however they may stray from the path of wisdom when they open their mouths, that they will be wise when their mouths are shut.  There is a large number of prisoners in our camps, of <Col N="1215" /> whom, perhaps, we cannot say definitely that they are associates in this destruction that is going on, and, therefore, that they may not be liable to receive any portion of the punishment, whether it is punitive or deterrent.  There is not very much difference in actual practice between the two.  Those people are given ample opportunity of saying whether they are supporters, silent or otherwise, of the present campaign.  If there are members of Mr. de Valera's Executive or Government, or whatever it is called, and if there are members on his Army Executive&mdash;and we must here regard as the mainspring and as the prime movers in the present campaign the members of those two bodies&mdash;if there are to-day any <Col N="1216" /> members of those bodies, or any general supporters of a Republican movement in this country, who do not stand up for a campaign, of which such a terrible example has been given within the last few days, now is the time for them to speak out.  If they do not speak out within, say, the next few days, then they give the wheel another turn and the country, and the Government which is responsible for the safety of the country and for its salvation, must be prepared to take and to face whatever the next turn of the wheel brings.</P>

    <P>Agreed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.40 p.m.</P>
