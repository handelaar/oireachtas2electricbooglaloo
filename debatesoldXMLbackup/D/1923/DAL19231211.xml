      <P>As the result of a Conference held at the Office of Public Works on the 4th instant, at which the representatives of the various companies and Public Departments interested attended, it was decided to proceed immediately with the erection of shelters to protect the tables at which luggage is usually examined. Protection from the weather will be secured by raising panels or partitions from the quay level to the station roof on the side next to the steamer from which the passengers disembark.  The other side will be left as at present since the station roof and the waiting train already afford protection.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that these shelters will be completed before the Christmas holidays.  If, after reasonable trial, they are found unsatisfactory, further steps will be taken to improve the accommodation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that in the proposed erection of an hospital at Skibbereen (Co.

      <P>The specification for this hospital was drawn up on the understanding that the roof was to be of asbestos.  A slated roof would require stronger walls and stronger timber in the roof.  I am advised that natural slates cost some 40 to 50 per cent more than the asbestos slates proposed. Furthermore, the hospital is urgently required, and the building of the stronger walls would take additional time.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance desires to make a statement with regard to the Loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hardly yet in a position to give the Dáil all the figures I would wish to give in connection with the Loan.  But I would like to state here publicly what we all know, that the success of the Loan has been greater than even the most sanguine of us expected.</P>
      <P>Although we found that the Loan was over-subscribed, so far as we could discover, on Thursday evening, and sent out notice to the Press to that effect, we received on Saturday £825,000, and on yesterday £125,000.  If the Loan had remained open until yesterday, which was the date fixed for closing, I have no doubt at all that we would have received between fourteen and fifteen millions.  As a matter of fact, even although notices were sent out on last Thursday night, we got in eleven and a half millions from the Bank of Ireland alone, in addition to other large sums that were returned direct by Banks and stockbrokers throughout the country&mdash;to their clients.  We got all that money from the public, although the banks, in case of necessity, were willing to put up a very large sum.  They agreed to do that in the public interest.  Not a penny of underwriting commission was paid to anyone in connection with the Loan. The amount that we wanted was more than subscribed by the public in response to the appeal, and the only expenses that we incurred, in connection with the Loan, were the few thousand pounds spent on advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the eleven and a half millions that came in through the Bank of Ireland, it was given by something over 22,000 subscribers, so that, in spite of the very large subscriptions which we received, the average subscription to the Loan was a little over £500.  We intend, so far as the subscriptions which we received in time are concerned, to allot in full to those who made application for sums of £5,000 <Col N="1620" /> and under.  When we exclude the further amounts received on Friday and Saturday, we will be able to allot to the other subscribers, without any very large deduction, probably something in the nature of ten per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amounts received for the Loan, there was a great increase in the amounts invested in Savings Certificates during the two weeks that the Loan was before the public.  One week we received £20,000, and last week we received £53,000.  This result was achieved by co-operation from all sections of the public.  I desire to thank members of the Dáil and of the Seanad for the help they gave in connection with the Loan.  Very many of them went to very great trouble to secure subscribers and to interest their friends in the Loan.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my sense of appreciation of the great services that the Press, both the daily and the weekly Press, rendered to us.  I have no hesitation at all in saying that the great success of the Loan has been one of the most important things that has occurred for a very long time.  It removes altogether, I think, the likelihood that we will have to go outside, to London or to New York, for any money that we require.  It is quite evident to me that there is such confidence in the country, and such a willingness amongst the people of all classes to supply what money is needed to carry on the administration of the country, as to make it certain that whatever further sums we may require will be got inside the country.  That, I think, is a very important thing, and places this country in a position that I think we would all desire.  It makes us independent of many manipulations and many considerations that might be detrimental to this country's interests in the future if we were faced with them.</P>
    <P>I believe that the stability of the country will be greatly strengthened by what has occurred.  There was a great deal of pessimism before the issue of the loan.  I might say that a number of people, not a very large number, whom one would regard as competent, advised us that the terms we were offering were not good enough, and that we would not secure the subscription.  A very large number of people told us <Col N="1621" /> that we would get two or three millions, but that we would be flogging a dead horse for the rest of it.  All these prophets of pessimism have been confounded. I think that when we started, faced with such an amount of pessimism in regard to the Loan and had such an extraordinary success, that we will undoubtedly be able in our future borrowings to get money on more favourable terms than we have got this money, and that, of course, will be of great importance to the country.</P>
    <P>When we have to undertake any works of construction or development, the question of whether a particular work will be economic or will not be economic, will depend very largely on the conditions and on the rate at which we can borrow money.  I believe that this country is now definitely on its legs, from the point of view of credit, and that in our future borrowings we will be able to borrow as well practically as any Government or nation can borrow.  I think that we have very great reason to congratulate ourselves, and to be congratulated on the way in which all classes have come in to help to do what was necessary at this particular juncture for the country.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that this Bill be now read a <Col N="1622" /> second time.  It presents no feature exceptional from that which was passed by the Dáil last year, save that a small number of Acts, included in the First Schedule, which had been renewed from year to year for a number of years, are now proposed to be made permanent.  The Acts set out in the other Schedule are Acts whose utility is considered still to exist.  If there is any question arising, with reference to any of them, I shall be happy to try and deal with them either on this stage or perhaps more properly on the next.</P>

      <P>I observe that among the Acts which it is proposed to continue in this manner, from year to year, is the Motor Car Act, 1903.  I am not going to raise any objection at this stage, or to comment much upon this Order, but I think it is intensely undesirable, now that the Motor Car has passed out of the experimental stage it was in in 1903, that it should be regulated, in the main, first by what one would look upon as an obsolete Act, and, secondly, by an Act renewed from year to year, even though that Act, was modified by an Act of the British Parliament about three years ago.  I put it to the Dáil that this year the Attorney-General should consider the question of the people interested in the motor business, and bring in an Act, not an annual Act, but some permanent Statute governing this industry and branch of our traffic.  I do not want, however, the matter thrown into chaos by not passing this Act, but it is a matter that the Government should interest themselves in and take some definite steps for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the leave of the Dáil to have printed and circulated a Bill entitled the Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Temporary Bill.  It is known to Deputies that the Public Safety Act will expire on the 1st of February next, and I have had to advise the Executive Council that, <Col N="1624" /> for order and security to life and property, in the coming year, it will be necessary that the Executive should have powers of arrest and to detain certain persons reasonably suspected of having committed certain offences which will be set out in the Schedule.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the situation should call for the introduction of a Bill of this kind; but it is the fact and our responsibility to the people obliges us to face the fact and to take measures to meet a situation of that kind. We have not, yet, in all areas of the country sufficiently normal or sufficiently peaceful conditions to ensure that a high standard of civic sense will prevail, and to ensure that evidence that would satisfy a Court will be always forthcoming against people who commit crimes.</P>
      <P>This Bill then is introduced to meet the situation as it exists, and as it is likely to continue to exist for some months.  It will be merely an Internment Bill.  It is not proposed now to bring before the Dáil all the Sections of the Public Safety Bill.  The idea rather is to break up that Bill into three distinct Bills, one dealing with the question of internment, another being a Firearms Bill, which will be permanent, and a Criminal Law Amendment Bill, which will be introduced early in the next Session.  This Bill that is now introduced deals merely with the question of having powers to arrest and detain certain persons on reasonable suspicion&mdash;on something short of legal proof, proof that would satisfy a Court. The Bill, I hope, will be in Deputies' hands to-morrow or next day, and it is proposed to take the Second Reading on Friday next.</P>

The term &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; in the common understanding rather suggests the Magistrate than the Judge, and I think it very desirable that in the Bill now passing from the Dáil we should give the title &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; so as to embody what was the declared intention of the Attorney-General on the earlier stages. I would hope that it is not necessary to pursue this argument, that it should be clear once attention is drawn to the matter, and that the Attorney-General will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The great objection to this alteration of the designation of these Judges is that they have now been established for a considerable time and operating through the country under this particular title, and we do not want to shake our own institutions.  Moreover, there is nothing derogatory in the word &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo; There is no Judge in the High Court who is not spoken of as &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; so-and-so. There is absolutely nothing derogatory in it, and I propose to insert here the word &ldquo;Iustis,&rdquo; which Deputy MacNeill tells me is to be found in the &ldquo;Leabhar Breac,&rdquo; and I believe it has quite an honourable tradition behind it.

Perhaps when the Bill was under contemplation and was being drafted, the drafters did not think that they were Judges, but <Col N="1630" /> now, knowing that they are Judges, in spite of the fact that there are certain attributes surrounding them which are not the same as those surrounding the High Court and the Circuit Court Judges, it seems to me that they are Judges, and I cannot see why the Attorney-General cannot recognise them as such, and call them by any equivalent Irish name that he likes.</P>

      <P>I did not know whether the Deputy for Waterford was rising to supply the curiosity of Deputy Figgis as to the difference between the words Breitheamhain and Iustis.  I am in this somewhat awkward position in the matter, that the Minister for Home Affairs, who, I understand, will later be known as the Minister for Justice, is not here, and these are his particular creations.  I should not like to assent to a change in their designation without conferring with him on the subject.  I think it would create a good deal of inconvenience by reason of the fact that this designation has so long existed, as some Deputy has mentioned.  Every Judge in the Court of Appeal is an L.J., which stands for Lord Justice.  There is no very great difference between that and D.J.&mdash;District Justice&mdash;except in degree.  I really do not think there is anything of substance in this proposal. If I thought there was anything derogatory to the District Justices I certainly would be inclined to press the matter with the Minister, who is more concerned in the creation of these Judges than I am, but I do not think there is anything of substance, having regard to the fact that every Judge in the High Court and Court of Appeal has always had the appellation of Justice. There is nothing derogatory in the term, and while I will ask him to consider the matter, from my own <Col N="1631" /> knowledge of the thing I think that there would be a large inconvenience, and but little gain&mdash;perhaps something lost.  I cannot myself assent to it at the present moment.  I would submit it to the Minister for Home Affairs.</P>

I do not know whether it is possible to meet the Minister for Justice, as he will be, before the final passing of this Bill, but I feel there is more than the Attorney-General suggests.  We have had, as a matter of fact, assurances given regarding the position of these Judges, and the point would be met, perhaps, if the same Irish title were given to Justices of the District Court as to Justices of the High Court. Where we have a distinction in title, both in the English and Irish, in regard to Justices of the District Court from the Judges of the Circuit Court and High Court, it helps to confirm the popular impression that the District Justices are inferior, and that they are not Judges under the Constitution.  That is quite wrong, we at least know, but I hope that in the passing of legislation we should endeavour to put into the Bills exactly what we mean, and that is my desire.  If, in the view of the Minister for Home Affairs, it will create so great a difficulty in his Department to alter the term &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; to &ldquo;District Judge,&rdquo; it certainly will not create that difficulty if we alter the Irish term proposed to be given to Judges of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I may mention that it is well known a number of the District Justices use the Irish language to a large extent, and I know, as a matter of fact, some of them do use the term Breitheamhain. Notwithstanding the somewhat challenging ring I generally notice in Deputy Johnson's voice when he refers to this status, there is no doubt that those of the District Justices who know the Irish language felt confident that their position was equivalent to that of Breitheamh or Judge.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The Attorney-General may be or become a member of Dáil Eireann, and if he is a member of Dáil Eireann at the time of his appointment he shall not be under any obligation to resign his seat or to submit himself for re-election.  He shall hold office so long only as the President of the Executive Council by whom he was appointed continues to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that this amendment is consequential upon the last.  Partly it is.  The case for this would be much stronger if the last amendment had been accepted and passed, but even without the last amendment, I think it is desirable that we should state specifically in the Bill that the Attorney-General may be, or may become, a member of the Dáil, and that he is not under any obligation to resign his seat in case of appointment, if he is already a member, and that he shall hold office only so long as the President, by whom he is appointed, is in receipt of the confidence of the majority of the Dáil. It does not necessitate that the Attorney-General <Col N="1634" /> shall be a member of the Dáil, and I can understand perhaps good reasons why an Attorney-General need not be a member of the Dáil.  I think it is a very good thing for the Dáil that the present Attorney-General is a member.  I do not want to make it obligatory that he shall be.  The Attorney-General, I think, last week pointed out that the best lawyers might not be the best publicists&mdash;though they very often are.  I think we should understand clearly, at least, whether it is the intention of the Dáil that the Attorney-General shall or shall not be a member of the Dáil, or whether it is intended to leave the matter optional. That is the reason I bring forward the amendment, notwithstanding the fact that the previous amendment touching upon this subject was defeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 27, which is to delete the section.  It was said here, at the outset, that this Bill is in the nature of a permanent measure, that it may be added to, from time to time, but that its main provisions will remain as they are.  That may or may not be.  At this particular moment, when national economy is being urged on every hand, and particularly from the Ministerial Bench, it is undesirable that we should make a departure from our present practice, when that departure involves certain extra expenditure, however small it may be.  It is unfortunate, as I said on the Second Reading, that this Bill should come forward immediately after these admonitions with regard to national economy.  The Dáil has managed without Parliamentary secretaries &mdash;that is, paid Parliamentary secretaries. I agree at once that it would be <Col N="1636" /> very undesirable that people should be asked to undertake national service&mdash; although they frequently are, and are happy to comply&mdash;without remuneration. There would be nothing to stop a provision of this kind being introduced at a later stage, if found necessary, without being brought into a Bill for the foundation of constitutional Ministerial positions.  I think it undesirable that we should set this headline at the present moment.</P>
      <P>The first reason why I think this Section should be deleted from the Bill is that it is not in consonance with the preaching of national economy.  My second reason is that the President, when recommending this Bill and supporting its principle, made it perfectly clear that it was not Parliamentary Secretaries at all he had in mind as being required.  Before I quote his words I should point out that he was referring to a period which we have passed through&mdash;the last twelve months &mdash;when there were no such persons recognised and paid as such, in the service either of the Ministry or of the Dáil.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>During the period that we have had experience of&mdash;that is the last two years&mdash;for something like twelve or eighteen months we have had three Parliamentary Secretaries.  Two were attached to me: one in my capacity as President, and the other in my capacity as Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the next remark of the President:</P>
      <P>The third was the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Parliamentary Secretary who was attached to the Ministry of Finance and the Assistant Minister for Commerce were approached by me in reference to one service, which was functioning under the Ministry of Finance, and in the course of their administration of that particular service they saved a sum per annum almost sufficient to discharge the entire estimate of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I ask particular attention to these words, too&mdash;that in reference to that one service they effected such an enormous saving.  The President went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not by nominal economies real results are to be effected, and if <Col N="1637" /> excellent service can be rendered by a large number of Ministers, we consider that power ought to be given in a measure of this sort to enable the Executive Council to have available for the service of the State such assistance as they consider is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to two sentences of the President, particularly, because the service to which he referred was not a Parliamentary service at all.  It was a service that could have been dealt with by any one of the Civil Servants in his employment.</P>
    <P>It was not any work in connection with the business here.  It was work in connection with what is known as the Contracts Committee.  Now, clearly work done in connection with any Department, any affiliation between that Department and the Contracts Committee, is work that calls for the administration of Departmental Civil Servants, not for the appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries.  I have drawn attention to these two sentences for another reason.  One of the persons to whom the President has referred was the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce was called in to serve in a certain capacity, to help in the work of a certain Department.  Unless I am much misinformed, he is still serving in that Department, and is still doing the work in that Department that he did in the previous Dáil, of which he was a member, although he is not a member of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect that I want to touch upon as lightly as I possibly can.  I realise that we are in a formative period, and many things are done that would not be done under normal experience.  But I do suggest, and I do think, that it is not altogether the very best possible practice that members of the Legislature should act as Ministers, and then, failing to be returned, in the next succeeding Legislature should continue to hold and discharge work that they did previously, having turned from being Assistant Minister to being Civil Servants on the staff.  I think that is not altogether the best practice.</P>

      <P>The main point is that that particular Assistant Minister is still doing that work that he was called upon to do in the last Dáil. Clearly, if he was called in to serve in a certain capacity, and he did good work in that capacity, and is still doing that work, then the reason for the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to discharge the work that he discharged is not apparent in this case.  I think the President's own explanation, in speaking here on the Second Reading, makes it quite clear that it was not Parliamentary Secretaries that he had in his mind.  A second reason, therefore, why I urge and why I think this Dáil should not pass or permit this Section to remain part of the Bill is that it is not Parliamentary Secretaries which the President made it clear that he wanted, but that it was a different function in the Civil Service.  Therefore, it is the Civil Servants that he should be thinking of.  The third reason hinges upon and follows from the other two.  It is this: In the previous Dáil there were three persons acting in different ways in connection with the Civil Service, and we managed successfully with three, although they were not Parliamentary Secretaries.  We were meeting very frequently.  We met week after week.  There was a lot of work to be done.  It was pressed through this Dáil almost as quickly as bullets through a machine gun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>As the President said, the work was all the greater because he exercised his generosity and never closured.  This pressure of work was not placed, and is not placed, upon this present Dáil, and it will not be placed upon this Dáil during the coming year.  We heard <Col N="1639" /> that there are arrangements to be made that there will be a lengthy recess during the summer months.  It is obvious that the same pressure is not going to be given to the work of this Dáil as to the work of the past Dáil.  If, therefore, we managed without paid persons whose whole time was occupied, then clearly, and <i>a fortiori</i>, these persons and these extra appointments will not be required in the present Dáil.  A clear case has not been made out for the inclusion of Parliamentary Secretaries. I think that unless the circumstances were such that the appointment of such persons was imperative and unavoidable, only under those conditions could such provisions be introduced at the present moment, in face of the demand for economy.  I know the expenditure is not much, but there is much in the force of example.  Such a case has not been made clear, and because it has not been made clear I think the amendment should pass.  If, eventually, such persons become necessary, in the present Dáil, let us at the present moment keep these conditions out of the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, and keep the question of Parliamentary Secretaries to be dealt with at a future day, when the financial pressure is not so much as at the present moment and when a clearer case is made out for their necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all listened for the past ten minutes to a very learned dissertation upon what one would imagine would be the reason why this Section should be deleted. But it is in essence quite another thing. I do not know whether the Deputy has his mind upon the Dáil or upon the &ldquo;London Sunday Times&rdquo;&mdash;I think that is the paper.  But, I do say that in considering a question of this sort the Dáil is entitled to much more substance than what we have just listened to.  Most of the statement made is a statement which, when carefully analysed, is a case for the appointment of those Secretaries.  He seeks to divide the Minister's responsibilities between attendance in the Dáil and the administration of his office.  He never paid the slightest attention to one while he concentrated on the other.  It is not here <Col N="1640" /> in the Dáil that most of the work is done, but in the preparation of the work and in the consideration that has to be given to the various measures to be put forward before they come here at all.  Then, there is the general administration of the Department.  The Deputy, I am sure, has had in his past life some experience of what the administration of business connotes, as well as the responsibility in connection with Parliamentary work.  He knows very well that it is utterly impossible for any man who means to discharge his business properly to come here at three o'clock in the day and sit until 8.30 p.m. dealing with one section of his business and during the intervals of time at its disposal to look after the administration of the work of a big Department.</P>
      <P>We got over two forms of Government here, one which was entirely and utterly disorganised, and the other which was in a sort of state of incubation; we got an amateur Government from one, and an utterly disorganised Government from the other.  I am not at all sure but that within the next few years persons who occupy Ministerial office in the State will find out, day after day, serious discrepancies in administration. To a man of the conscience of the Deputy, I am sure that would not afford any loss of sleep, but to men who have consciences like the Ministers, it is very different.  The Deputy has stated that we had an Assistant Minister.  I put it to those who were here during the last Session that you had got that Assistant Minister acting practically as the Minister in charge of Bills, introducing measures, and dealing with subjects raised on the adjournment and other matters.  The Deputy, perhaps, objects to the term Parliamentary Secretary. It is a much better term than Assistant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Assistant Minister is not known in the Constitution, and a Parliamentary Secretary is not mentioned in the Constitution.  It is known elsewhere, but Deputies, in considering this question and in comparing this State with other States, must remember that this State or this form of Government that we now have, really takes its date from the time when the administration of <Col N="1641" /> this country was handed over by the British.  There are various dates for that.  In some cases it occurred on the 15th January, 1922, and in other cases it did not take place until April 1st, 1923.  There were some other cases in which administration was handed over somewhere about December, 1922. Each Minister, in his capacity as head of a Department had got to accept responsibility for running his Department during that time.  During the last twelve or eighteen months the attention of the Ministry has been largely directed to the condition of disorder in the country that required some attention.  Now, when that stage is passed, gradually it is coming home that there may be economies and improvements, and much greater efficiency effected in the services of the State, by the appointment of those additional officers or assistants to the Ministers.  It is not by bustle and not by figurative economies that real economy is effected.  The economies which I stated here more than once when introducing this Bill, which I knew had been effected by reason of arrangements made by the Ministry, would not have been possible in some instances were it not for the appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries.  I consider the case that has been made in some instances by the Press, and in some instances by Deputies, is a faked case, faked to the knowledge of the Press making it, faked to the knowledge of the Deputies who are making it, and faked to the knowledge of the Deputy who has just spoken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote for this amendment in view of the unsatisfactory justification, or attempted justification, that the President has given. He suggests that the term &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; is used because it is a little more convenient and better perhaps than the term Assistant Minister. By that statement he intimates that what is really intended is to appoint Assistant Ministers.  The equivalent of Assistant Ministers in other Governments is an Under-Secretary of State. The Parliamentary Secretary does entirely different work.  We gather what is intended is not a Parliamentary Secretary which would be equivalent to <Col N="1642" /> a Parliamentary Secretary in the British House of Commons, but an Under-Secretary who will answer for the Minister, and, as I fear would happen, who will take all the responsibility for answering the Dáil on questions of administration, which would provide Ministers with an opportunity of evading their Parliamentary responsibility, apart from their general administrative duty.</P>
      <P>I am more impressed with the necessity for deleting this Section, because I can see that if we allow Assistant Ministers to do the work of Ministers in the Dáil, bear the brunt of criticism, and answer for a Minister with little less authority than the Minister&mdash;provided that he has the backing of a majority party, he would be able to carry off the honours in any circumstances quite apart from the merits of the case that may be made&mdash;that tendency will be to detract from the authority of the Dáil, and tend definitely towards more and more bureaucratic government and government by decree or semi-dictatorship.  That is likely to be the tendency if the suggestions of the President, in defending this section, work out in practice.  I believe it is very desirable that Ministers should have Parliamentary Secretaries, persons who will assist them in actual Parliamentary work.  They need not be paid, and if they are to be paid they may be paid a very small additional salary, because of their more constant attendance.  I would imagine that any Minister would be able to find active earnest members of his party who would be quite willing and capable to assist in the actual Parliamentary Secretarial work, but that is a very different thing from the appointment of Under-Secretaries or Assistant Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Assistant Ministers, as designed by the Bill, were to be Assistants to the Executive Council, or to the Executive Minister.  There has been an alteration made in the course of the discussion on that, and there may be Parliamentary Secretaries appointed, or Assistant Ministers to assist non Executive Ministers, but what is likely to happen with this as a foreshadowing is that Parliamentary <Col N="1643" /> Secretaries, or Assistant Ministers, would be appointed to the Executive Ministers, and in practice they would become more important than the non-Executive Ministers who are responsible to the Dáil.  That is how it would work out.  They would be Ministers to assist the Executive Ministers.  They would be called Secretaries but they would be Ministers, and they would be deputed to attend the Dáil to answer criticism and to deal with matters which the Minister proper might find it a little inconvenient to deal with.  They would tend to become more important than the External Ministers as they have been called.  I think that is a very undesirable development, and I think we ought to know the reason for that development.</P>
    <P>Under the Section as it stands, there would be possibly as many as 19 Ministers and Assistant Ministers, or, if you would prefer to call them Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, paid out of the funds voted by the Dáil.  That is rather too large a proportion, considerably more than is desirable in an assembly of this size.  I would just call attention to the last Sub-section of this Section.  They are to have such powers and to perform such duties as the Minister, with the consent of the Executive Council, may from time to time delegate to them.  The Dáil may say that the Minister shall be responsible for seeing the work done and of answering for the work of his Department to the Dáil.  Then we are asked to give the Minister power to delegate such powers as we have given to himself&mdash;to give that power to another person.  Now, I think that is altogether unwarranted and is inconsistent with the position of the Dáil and of the Executive.  I think that the requirements of the case will be well satisfied if Ministers were to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries who would act as Secretaries to Ministers in relation to Parliamentary duties and to that alone, men who could be got to do it because of the training in public service it would give, and as part of their Parliamentary duties, and that there is not required the appointment of Assistant Ministers under the name of Parliamentary Secretaries, as is conceived <Col N="1644" /> in this Section, and as has been explained by the President.  The fact that it is proposed to pay such Parliamentary Secretaries a sum of £1,200 a year places them in the position, not of Secretaries in the sense that that is generally understood, but of Assistant Ministers, and of having responsibilities for administrative work outside the Dáil and not necessarily connected with the Dáil.  There is another consideration that ought to be taken note of, and that is that within this Section the Parliamentary Secretaries that are to be appointed may be members of the Seanad. I submit it is not desirable that such should be the case if they are to be Assistant Ministers.  I could understand the appointment of an unpaid Secretary to a Minister who may have a seat in the Seanad, and who would assist in the conduct of a Bill through the Seanad, but I do not think it is desirable that we should appoint as Assistant Ministers men who would be, in fact, members of the Seanad.  For these reasons I am prepared to support the motion for the deletion of this Section.</P>

      <P>It is an extremely rash thing at any time to try and correct Deputy Johnson on a question of fact.  But I think there is a little defect in the information in his mind when he refers to Parliamentary Secretaries.  If he speaks of Parliamentary Secretaries, he speaks of a number of members who are Parliamentary Private Secretaries&mdash;young Members who attach themselves to Ministers, mainly for the purpose of getting experience of the official work, and for the purpose of seeing the papers and the files, and do an amount of routine work for the Minister.  They practically never speak at all&mdash;in fact there is an unwritten law that it is bad form for them to speak in the House. But besides them there are Parliamentary Secretaries in the British Parliament, and attached to Ministers in every Department of the Government. There is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, and there is the Civil Lord of the Admiralty.  There is the Financial Secretary to the War Office and the Under-Secretary for War. Recently additional Parliamentary Secretaries were appointed.  In the new Ministry for Pensions there is a <Col N="1645" /> Parliamentary Secretary who is paid, and in that Ministry of Pensions that same man had directly to answer in the House of Commons; and so it may be with other Ministries.  That provision is necessitated by the fact that the British Parliament consists of two water-tight chambers, and that if the Minister of one of the great services, or of the great Departments is in the House of Lords, then the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister represents the Department in the House of Commons, and he has most important work to do, and very often cuts a very much more important figure than the Minister himself.  That was certainly so in the case of Mr. Winston Churchill when he was Under Secretary for the Colonies.</P>

      <P>I think I am in order and may continue.  Generally speaking, I could not support the amendment, because if this power is given to the Ministry to appoint those Secretaries it may enable them to reduce the number of Ministers and decrease the number of salaries.  In that respect this Section may lead to real economy.  There is the further consideration that might sometimes arise. Suppose it was found necessary to appoint a Minister who sits in the Seanad it would be absolutely necessary for him to be represented by a Secretary here who could answer for him, because Members of the Seanad cannot speak here, and there should be someone to answer for the Department here; otherwise it would fall upon the shoulders of the President.  Then, again, in yet another Parliament&mdash;the Parliament of Northern Ireland, of which Deputy Milroy is a Member&mdash;it was found necessary to appoint one or two Secretaries, even though it is a comparatively small assembly dealing with six counties.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment, although I hope that the Section will be considerably modified before it becomes part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The supporters of this amendment have made a great plea for a distinction between Parliamentary Secretaries and Assistant Ministers.  In fact, most of their case, as far as I could follow it, has been in that direction.</P>
      <P>But I cannot say that they have made it in any way clearer to me what precise functions they expect Parliamentary Secretaries to fulfil, if they are changed from the description of Parliamentary Secretaries to that of Assistant Ministers in regard to their Parliamentary duties.  That does not carry us very far.  Occasionally it is acknowledged they must speak for the Minister, but the one thing that seems to emerge from the arguments of the supporters of this amendment is that they wish that these Assistant Ministers shall have no practical knowledge of the Departments of which the Minister to whom they are attached is head. In other words, as regards the one thing they are to speak on, they might as well be gramophones.  Gramophones would be quite cheap, but possibly not quite as dignified as Parliamentary Secretaries.  What is the good in asking a question of a Parliamentary Secretary if he is merely to repeat the answer left for him by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> The real advantage in appointing people of this kind is that they have some knowledge of the administration, and as far as I can gather from the mover and seconder of the amendment that is the one thing that they are determined they would not have.  I do not think that any Assistant to the Minister&mdash;even from the point of view of a Parliamentary Assistant&mdash;can be any good or of any use unless he has a knowledge of the Departmental work which the supporters of the amendment wish apparently to deprive him of.</P>

      <P>It would have been helpful, in this discussion, if the supporters of this amendment could have come to some agreement, or to some identity of argument.  I find the proposer of the amendment supporting it from a point of view which is an entire contradiction to that of the Deputy who seconded it.  Deputy Figgis said he considered that a clear case had not been made out for this section. Whether that is so or not, I certainly think there has been no clear case made out for this amendment.  The Deputy reminded us of the admonitions addressed to the Dáil, and to the country, by the Minister for Finance in regard to economy.  There is such a thing as economy at the expense of efficiency.  I have no doubt, if Deputy Figgis discovered that this Dáil came to the conclusion that his seat in the Dáil should be abolished on the ground of economy, that he would regard that as economy at the expense of efficiency. The trend of the argument of the Deputy who opposed this amendment, Deputy Bryan Cooper, seemed to me to be utterly misleading.  I take it that the framers of this Bill did not design its provisions on precedents in other institutions, so much as on the requirements that the Ministry have decided are essential for the proper carrying on of the administration.  It does not matter to us really what interpretation is placed upon the term &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; in the British House of Commons, or in the Parliament of Timbuctoo, if there is such an institution, as long as we understand what exactly it means to us here. <Col N="1648" /> Deputy Figgis urged the deletion of this Section on the grounds of efficiency and economy.  He urged that the Dáil should not be pinned to the expense which this would entail. Deputy Johnson supported him, but it seems to me his argument, if assented to, would lead to greater extravagance than is involved in this Section.  The Section, as it stands, proposes to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries, and gives them a large amount of work to do, both in the Dáil and outside the Dáil.  Deputy Johnson urges first, that the work they should discharge should not be nearly so comprehensive or so large as that outlined in the Section.  I take it that to a certain extent it has been found necessary by the Ministry that some one should act or discharge the functions of an Assistant Minister. That appears to be considered necessary, and that is the reason why these appointments are suggested, and are termed &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretaries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Johnson's point of view was carried into effect the function of Assistant Minister would still remain undischarged, and though there might be Parliamentary Secretaries appointed their labours would be confined to the Dáil.  Later on the Ministry might find it essential to come along and say that the duties of Parliamentary Secretaries have been confined to the Dáil itself and that Assistant Ministers being essential, they would have to ask the Dáil to make provision for them.  I think Deputy Johnson's suggestion would lead to greater extravagance than that outlined in this Bill. There are two more points I wish to make in regard to Deputy Figgis' amendment.  He says, first, that he objects to this as being in a permanent statute, but the Section itself does not say that these Secretaries shall be appointed to the number of seven, but that the Executive Council may from time to time appoint such, and also that such appointments can be discontinued when found necessary.  So that the danger of having what you would call a grotesque creature in a permanent statute need not unduly alarm the aesthetic sense of the Deputy.  As to pressure of work, if ever there was a time when this Assembly is likely to <Col N="1649" /> be confronted with hard, strenuous and continuous work, I think it is in the immediate future.  The work we have been doing so far was one of preventing the shipwreek of the State.  The work that we will be engaged on in the future will be work of reconstruction. I do not know to what extent these Assistant Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries may be appointed, but certainly the task of building up the State again upon sure, stable and efficient foundations is a task that I think will tax the energies, not only of Ministers, but of this Assembly, to a much greater extent than it has done while the main burden of the work was that of saving the State from destruction.</P>

      <P>I think a little too much has been made of the work the Assistant Ministers, as they are now called, did in the last Dáil.  It was only in the last days of the last Dáil&mdash;I think it would be correct to say in the last few weeks&mdash;that most of the members of this Assembly became aware of the fact that Assistant Ministers were in existence at all.  It was only when the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce had to answer questions here that most of the members became aware of the fact that such a Minister existed. The reason for his appointment, as everybody knows, was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself was engaged elsewhere, that he was not attending, or could not attend, to his Department, that all his time and energies were occupied outside of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  For that reason an Assistant Minister became known here in the Dáil.  The other Assistant Ministers that have been hinted at I do not think were known to this Dáil at all.  They were absolutely unknown except to a few people in the inner circle of the Government.</P>

      <P>One reason perhaps that might justify these contemplated appointments would be that we might have a better attendance on the Government Benches than we sometimes have during the discussion of important Bills.  The Government Benches might <Col N="1650" /> be somewhat better filled, and from that point of view it might be good.  The reason given for the appointment of these Assistant Ministers is pressure of work.  We all know that in the last Dáil there was considerable pressure of work.  We had to begin from the foundation and try to evolve a new machinery of State.  Will the Attorney-General tell us how long that process will take and when we shall have the full machinery constructed and working? When we have the normal machinery of the State constructed and working there will be no rush of Parliamentary business.  We will only require to have Sessions of three or four weeks' duration two or three times a year.  Then what will be the need for all these Secretaries and all this elaborate Government machinery?  It is folly to tell us that there will be pressure of work after twelve months' sitting of the present Dáil.  There will not be pressure of work.  We ought to have some little sense of proportion and try to realise the smallness of the country that we have to deal with.  I do not think that any case has been made out for these Assistant Ministers. We got on all right during the last Dáil when there was considerably more work to be done.  The protection of the State that Deputy Milroy referred to and the work of erecting a legal machinery of the State had to be carried out.  Still we did it, and I do not think there was any undue pressure.  Now when, practically speaking, all this has been done, what do we want of Assistant Ministers? I do not think that a case has been made out for them and the people of the country do not think that a case has been made out.  Of course the opinions of the people of the country do not carry very much weight, but I for one will vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret, I think, that the President, in dealing with the case that I tried to put as temperately as I possibly could, should have dealt with it so intemperately as he did.  When a man gets excited in his defence it is a fairly clear indication that his defence is none too good in his own judgment.  He did not only become intemperate, he proceeded to become point-blank discourteous. <Col N="1651" /> I desire here to make a very strong protest against the deliberate discourtesy of which the President was guilty in this Dáil.  He said that this case was faked to the knowledge of the newspapers who raised it and to the knowledge of the Deputy who had just spoken.  I venture to say in the most quiet and emphatic way that I am not in the habit of making either faked or excited statements in this Dáil.  They may be inaccurate, but they will not be inaccurate to my knowledge.  If any Deputy deliberately and to his knowledge made a statement that is not true that statement should be called to order. But it was not made merely from an ordinary Deputy, but from the President himself.  Yet what did he do? Having charged me with making a faked statement, he went on to say that everything I had stated was correct.  I had stated that he did not want Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;that he did not want persons who would act in connection with the service of this Dáil, and, therefore, that a case was not made out. What did he say?  What was his defence against this &ldquo;faked&rdquo; allegation? He said we had to remember that there was much greater work to be done than the work in this Dáil, and he led one to infer from his words that those persons whom he requires&mdash;who I said were not required because it would not be work in this Dáil but outside&mdash; would be required because of work somewhere in the Government buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, he takes up the very case I have made; he under-scores every statement that I made, and having done so he says it is a faked statement. I repeat that the President's own words have made it clear that Parliamentary Secretaries are not intended and are not wanted.  What is wanted&mdash; seeing that the word efficiency has been used I will use it, too&mdash;is a more efficient administration in the Civil Service, because the assistance that is certainly and clearly required is assistance required in connection with work in preparation for this Dáil.  Those are the President's words.  He wanted those persons in connection with work of preparation for this Dáil.  That work&mdash;I <Col N="1652" /> repeat his words&mdash;is not the work of Parliamentary Secretaries: that is the work of Civil Servants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper supported the desire for a decrease in the number of the so-called Under-Secretaries, but he said there was one advantage that occurred to him in having them, and that was that their appointment might tend to reduce the total number of Ministers.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cooper says that he states it because he sincerely believes it.  I am sorry, but he has not convinced me that the Ministers or the Ministerial party intend to reduce the Ministers by one.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan made a very strange and quaint allegation against myself as one of the supporters of this amendment, that I had not stated what precise functions these Parliamentary Secretaries were to fulfil.  The complaint I had made was that nobody else had stated what precise functions they were to fulfil, that nobody had discovered what precise functions they were to fulfil, but they were not to be Under-Secretaries.  Reference has been made to Under-Secretaries in another Parliament.  Everybody knows what caused the creation of such Under-Secretaries. It is that if a Minister is appointed in England from the House of Lords, he must be represented in the House of Commons.  Therefore another Minister, called an Under-Secretary, represents that Department in the House of Commons, or vice versa.  That is the cause of the creation of them.  But it is a principle of the Constitution that Ministers are responsible to this Dáil and will be appointed from this Dáil. It is in connection with the Parliamentary work of this Dáil that such persons are required, if they are required at all, and I say that in connection with the Parliamentary work of this Dáil there has been no case made out for the appointment of such Under-Secretaries.</P>
    <P>That statement I made when I first spoke, and I base it once again, not upon the arguments I might produce here, but upon the statement of the President himself.  The President stated to-day, as he stated on the Second Reading, that such persons were wanted in connection with work elsewhere than in the Dáil: in other words, Civil Servants. <Col N="1653" /> If we are going to have a Civil Service, let the Civil Servants do that work, and let the staffs be arranged for them to do it.  If Parliamentary Secretaries or Assistant Ministers are required, they should be required in connection with the work of the Dáil. The President has practically admitted the whole case I made in the first instance, and I intend, therefore, to press that there is no occasion, according to the case made by the President himself, whatever, at this time above any other time for the appointment of any additional highly-paid offices in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>At an earlier stage of the discussion on this Bill the President, in an attempt to justify the Bill to the people of the country, made the statement that in the last Dáil there were three Parliamentary Secretaries.  I asked him to name the individuals, but I did not get an answer.  I frankly admit, as far as I am personally concerned, that I have no knowledge whatever of the existence of Parliamentary Secretaries in the Third Dáil.  During the discussions on the Estimates we had a feeling that certain members of the Government Party were doing certain work.  We scanned the Estimates very closely to find out under which, or under what heading, these men were being paid for their work.  We were told, and Deputy Gorey has reminded the Dáil of it, that there was an Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce. I do not know, and I would like the Minister who replies to inform the Dáil, under what heading or Estimate the salary of that Minister was provided for in the Third Dáil.  If no provision was made for any salary in addition to the £360 yearly that the Deputy was in receipt of, then I say that makes the case for the amendment proposed by Deputy Figgis.  If men were found in the Third Dáil to perform these duties at the yearly salary of £360, I say it is an additional argument in favour of the abolition of this Section. I am personally inclined to think that if the Dáil assents to the passing of the Section, it will create such keen rivalry between supporters of the Government, who may be looking for these positions, that it will do the Government no good. <Col N="1654" /> I rose mainly for the purpose of making the point that if Parliamentary Secretaries did exist in the last Dáil, and were paid salaries, in addition to the salaries they received as Deputies, I think the Ministry is misleading the Dáil, unless it tells it under what Estimate the salaries were provided.  If no additional salaries were paid to these men, then I think that is the best argument we could put forward in support of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a great deal of criticism as to the necessity or otherwise for these extra Parliamentary Secretaries.  I have no experience of the last Dáil, nor do I know what the duties of the Ministers were then, but since I came to the present Dáil I have been impressed with one fact, and that, in my judgment, is that Ministers here are decidedly overworked. It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that a short time ago, owing to the other duties of Ministers the Front Bench happened to be empty on one occasion.  At the time the President was engaged in very intricate work in connection with industrial disputes and Ministers generally had great burdens placed on their shoulders, owing to their work outside the Dáil.  I think it was Deputy Byrne who immediately called attention to the fact that the Government Bench was empty and proceeded to move the adjournment of the Dáil.  As far as I understand, the appointment of these Secretaries will make for greater efficiency in the carrying on of the work of the Dáil and for this reason I am opposed to the deletion of this Section.  Deputy Hewat, I think, objected to the appointment of these Secretaries, and I think he took occasion to make an attempt to establish a sort of <i>entente cordiale</i> with Deputy Johnson on the head of it.  I sincerely hope the entente will develop with very great effects in other directions.  I think Deputy Hewat, as a prominent Dublin business man, will agree that no matter what else counts business efficiency should be the first consideration. I do not think it is possible, from the little I have seen of the work of the Dáil, that Ministers could conceivably carry on these duties efficiently <Col N="1655" /> without more help.  I do not think the country ought to be too critical in a matter of this kind.  After all the Ministry are carrying on the biggest business in the State, the running of the State itself, and for that reason I support the appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with Section 7, Deputy Egan has very rightly, I think, stated that efficiency in business is more important even than economy.  Agreed.  Deputy Egan has also stated that Ministers are overworked. I do not think any member of the Dáil is inclined to be too critical about affording any assistance Ministers require for carrying on their work efficiently.  But the Bill before us is not a Bill for the present time.  It is not a Bill to meet the urgencies or the needs of the present time.  It is a Bill for all time, and when I find the Government asking for authority to appoint seven Parliamentary Secretaries it immediately occurs to me that this is a very unsuitable time, when the Minister for Finance is calling for economy all round to put forward any such proposition.  More particularly is it an unsuitable time, and also unnecessary, as the President tells us he has no intention of appointing seven.  That seems to be very contradictory.  I do not see why it is necessary to put a Bill through the Dáil which is going to create for all time seven Parliamentary Secretaries, when the President says there is no intention of appointing more than three.  I am in disagreement with the Section.  On the other hand, as regards the claim that Ministers are overworked, I imagine that is a difficulty which, if Ministers come to the Dáil, will be sympathetically dealt with here, and that the Dáil will provide any assistance that may be required for the time being.  If this Section is going to go through in its present form I see no reason why I should be called upon, as a business man, to vote for something that is not shown to be necessary, and which is making provision for appointments that will be very awkward in the future in connection with the administration of the affairs of the State.</P>

      <P>May I <Col N="1656" /> point out that my amendment, No. 33, limits the number of paid Parliamentary Secretaries, in conjunction with Ministers, to a total of fifteen.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection that I have to this differs somewhat from that raised by Deputy Hewat, and perhaps Deputy Figgis to some extent.  I do not stress what is called economy in this matter.  I am doubtful whether the economy argument is very effective except on this ground, that a Parliamentary Secretary, who has to do the work of a civil servant, is less likely to be the most efficient man for that particular job than a duly appointed civil servant would be.  He is liable to be changed every four years at least and that does not usually conduce to efficiency in detailed work.  But I would draw attention to the Constitution respecting the limitation of the number of Ministers.  The number was deliberately limited to twelve, and it was not for the purpose of limiting the number of Departments but for limiting the number of paid members of the Dáil in office.  There was a deliberation in limiting the number to twelve, the desire to limit the number of Deputies who would be appointed to paid office. The effect of this Section is to cancel that section of the Constitution.  A more straightforward way of arriving at the end, if it is necessary to have a larger number of Ministers, is to introduce a change in the Constitution.  The Section, as presented, would allow of nineteen Deputies, and as things are, apparently those nineteen Deputies would necessarily be of the Party which was in the majority for the time being. In the case of the present Dáil that would be very nearly equivalent to one out of three paid out of State funds, and even with a limitation to fifteen it would be round about one out of four. I imagine that the number twelve is the maximum that we should concede as members of the Ministry paid out of the Central Fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&mdash;political appointments. The services to be rendered by these Parliamentary Secretaries, <Col N="1657" /> as has already been pointed out, are the services of a higher civil servant attached to the Ministry, for the purpose of his parliamentary work, if you like, but certainly the work of higher civil servants, and not members of the political majority for the time being.  I imagine that the work would be more efficiently done by such servants, but I do not think there will be a large saving from the £1,200 suggested here.  Therefore it is not from the point of view of saving.  You may appoint as Parliamentary Secretary a cantankerous or a persistent member of your party who is likely to be a thorn in your side unless he gets an appointment&mdash;that is the experience in other Parliaments and we may not be free from similar characteristics&mdash;but the buying off of opposition by an appointment of this kind ought not to be possible. Bear in mind that the Constitution has laid it down that the President, in nominating his Executive Council, shall lay their names before the Dáil and get its assent, and that the Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council shall be appointed by the Dáil.  But this proposition, so far from securing or requiring the endorsement of the Dáil, is to give authority either to these Ministers or the Executive Council to appoint a Deputy as Parliamentary Secretary or Assistant Minister to administrative office, though a political appointment, irrespective of the sanction of the Dáil.  In the other case the sanction of the Dáil has to be secured.  In this case there is no suggestion that such sanction will be required, and you will find yourselves in this position, that you may appoint a Deputy to be in charge of Local Government, or Agriculture, or Education, and that a defeated man, if there has been a contest, could be appointed over your heads by the Minister.  True it is, of course, that the Minister is liable to the condemnation of the Dáil, but again you will be faced with the choice either of agreeing to the Minister's nomination or forcing his resignation, and that is not the kind of choice that should be put forward too often. You may say that for administrative purposes the Minister would be too valuable, and you would allow the undesirable <Col N="1658" /> thing to be passed rather than force a resignation.  I submit that the constitutional intention is being evaded by the introduction of this Section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I was absent during part of the debate, and some of the points that I may make may have been made already.  There would be no use in a Parliamentary Secretary in the sense of a person who was not going to make himself familiar with the working of a Department and take his share in the work, with authority to take some definite departmental responsibility off the Minister's shoulders.  There would be no use in a Parliamentary Secretary whose duties were confined to the Dáil.  There was some confusion about that point when the Bill was introduced.  I myself happen to have had experience of the working of two or three Departments. I am quite satisfied that there can be no justification for having eleven or twelve Ministers and seven Parliamentary Secretaries.  I believe that the appointment of as many as seven Parliamentary Secretaries could only be justified if we were appointing under the charge of one Minister two or more of the Departments of State.  In these circumstances it was suggested by one Deputy that it might be as well to say: &ldquo;Have only seven Ministers and three Parliamentary Secretaries.&rdquo;  I agree that I could conceive circumstances when that would be the best arrangement that could be made, and I think that it would be well to be able to make that arrangement.  On the other hand, there are Departments, even as matters stand, which, I think, require, and will continue to require, the services of somebody in addition to the Ministers. You have matters that can only be decided by somebody who is not a Civil Servant.  I think that it would be bad to have Parliamentary Secretaries for work that should properly be done by Civil Servants, and I say that the Civil Servant who spends his whole life at the work, who is not likely to be removed at the end of four years, can do work much better than a Parliamentary Secretary; but there are matters continually arising where the Civil Servant cannot go ahead without guidance, <Col N="1659" /> without the laying down of a policy by somebody who is not a Civil Servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even some of the matters into which policy enters are in some respect matters of detail.  They create precedents which involve the decision of somebody who is either a Minister, or, if you like to call him so, an Assistant Minister. In the Department of Finance, for instance, I believe there will always be need for a Parliamentary Secretary. Even allowing for the conditions of the present time, and the extra work that arises out of these conditions, I believe that it will be impossible almost at any time for any Minister for Finance to give attention to the matters that require what I call Ministerial decisions I know, so far as I have been in office, that there are many matters, whole sections of work, to which I have not been able to give any attention whatever, sections which would repay Ministerial attention.  Then, apart from Ministries that would require, I think, at all times a Parliamentary Secretary, there are other Ministries that would require them in the present circumstances.  Take the Ministry of Defence.  Whether a Parliamentary Secretary would be permanently required there or not is a matter that would depend on the future army organisation, on the type of army you had, whether you had an army of the present or a territorial type.  It would depend on a variety of circumstances, and I am certainly aware that at present, in view of the financial matters surrounding army administration, and the financial matters requiring a clearance of things that arose in times of stress and difficulty, the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary would be economy in the present circumstances.  I have no doubt that the appointment of somebody with, as it were, Parliamentary authority, and with the status that would come from being a Parliamentary Secretary, as apart from being a Civil Servant, would result in efficiency and improvement in financial administration that would repay his salary very many times, and would be a source of great satisfaction to those concerned with the financial administration of the <Col N="1660" /> army.  The matter is simply one of facing our own problems.  We have been told about the number of Ministers elsewhere, and we have had comparisons drawn between this country and Australia and other places.  We have our own difficulties; we have problems of order, finance, and land of our own particular type.  If we escape some of the problems of new countries, we have our own.  It is not always a wise thing to go too far in the way of relying entirely upon the Civil Service. The fewer Ministries you have, the fewer Ministers you have, the more you depend on the Civil Service.  The wider the scope of the Minister's Department, the less he can go into any matter in it, and the more he has to rely on his staff, not merely for integrity and fair dealing, but for the formation and execution of policy, and for the actual framing of measures to carry the policy into effect.  You could have unnecessary duplication, but you have to learn to some extent by experience here.  We might find it possible when we get normal times, and Civil Servants accustomed to the new conditions and the responsibilities that are thrown on Civil Servants by self-government, a Civil Service recruited and trained in the new school, and with its mind fixed on the problems of work and of government as it exists, to do with very little more than the seven Ministers, without speaking of Parliamentary Secretaries at all, but that time is certainly a very considerable way ahead.  My own opinion is that for some time we could not go on very well with a lesser number of Ministers, and without, at any rate, two or three Parliamentary Secretaries.  If circumstances change there will be opportunities of reducing the number, but we are providing machinery not for all time, but for some reasonable length of time.  We are providing not simply what may be necessary for this year or next year. We should at least anticipate that what we are providing here will serve the needs of a reasonable number of years. I am convinced that we will need two or three Parliamentary Secretaries for a very considerable time, even apart from any reduction in the number of <Col N="1661" /> Ministers.  So far as we can judge as to how business will go from the experience we have had, we certainly will require to put in a number of Parliamentary Secretaries who will take some section of the work from the Ministers, and give that guidance in policy and make those decisions that Civil Servants cannot make in a satisfactory way.  Everyone knows that when in the rush of business, and the position was very difficult, all of us were giving attention to matters largely concerned with the preservation of the State and the defeat of the Irregulars, when there was a certain amount of neglect of Departments, and when Ministers could not give their minds to the work of the Departments, it was impossible for the Departments to go along under our present system of control.</P>
    <P>Until we have settled down, until the Civil Service here, which was not created as a Civil Service for an Irish State, has grown accustomed to the new responsibility, until the ordinary routine machinery is working well and smoothly, until we have had some experience of its efficiency, it would be false economy to cut down the provision made in this Bill.  I never heard it stated that it was intended to provide that no more than 12 members of the Dáil should hold political office.  I think it was intended to provide that there should not be an unnecessary sub-division of the Departments of State, that there should be a limited number of people actually, primarily and, if I may say so, personally responsible to the Dáil for the carrying on of the work of the State.  I did not hear the other suggestion made at all.</P>

      <P>I would like to make acknowledgment, if I may, of the candour and&mdash;I say, by way of contrast&mdash;the courtesy with which the Minister for Finance made the case for this Section.  He has admitted that there is, at least, some argument on the side of those who wish to have the provision for Parliamentary Secretaries removed.  I am perfectly willing to admit that there is a great deal to be said for the case that is urged, but I think the great consideration at the moment is that it is unwise to proceed with this Section now.  I desire to draw <Col N="1662" /> attention to one argument the Minister brought forward, which is certain to have effect on the future of the State. He said, as well as I recollect, that he hoped to see the day that there would be seven Ministries and seven Parliamentary Secretaries.  The Minister will recall that about a year ago, in the Dáil, there was a certain very mordant critic of the Executive provisions of the draft Constitution, who said that that would be the exact result that would be ultimately achieved.  I agree with that critic that it will be achieved; it is being achieved.  If that were to come about&mdash;as it could come about and can come about despite the provisions of the subsequent amendment in the name of the Attorney-General, to which he has referred&mdash;it would mean that the provisions of the Constitution, providing for the existence of Ministers who should not be members of the Executive Council would have been automatically and quite neatly and deftly dodged.</P>
      <P>The Minister, replying to my argument that this was work fundamentally for civil servants, said that while a great deal of the work could be done by civil servants, there comes a moment when a decision is necessary which cannot be taken by a civil servant, but must be taken by someone in charge of policy.  I appreciate that fully, but I do say that that decision will have to be taken, not by the Parliamentary Secretary, but by the Minister, and that the Parliamentary Secretary himself will be running to the Minister for a decision in exactly the same way as the civil servant would.  Therefore, I hold that the case has not been made, and that this Section should be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I put down this amendment in order to try and discover why seven was selected as the number of Parliamentary Secretaries. There was no explanation given on the Second Reading.  I do not know whether the Government look upon the number as a lucky one, or whether they visualised the Parliamentary Secretaries gathering together and reading Wordsworth.  The amendment, No. 33, which is in the name of the Attorney-General meets my point, which is that there shall not be more than three Secretaries. I think it is more flexible as it does not tie the Government down. <Col N="1665" /> I do not propose to move my amendment, but, of course, I cannot bind the Deputies on my left.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section 1, line 34, to delete the word `seven,' and substitute therefor the word `three.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do so for the reason that we have already passed the incipient stage in the functions of Government. The Ministers are no longer with the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other.  I notice that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance have put down at the end of Section 31 &ldquo;provided the total number of persons who shall at any one time be in receipt of salaries as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries shall not exceed 15.&rdquo;  Superficially that is very fair, but while we listened to the Minister he pointed out it was the probable intention of the Executive Council, sooner or later, that each Minister would assume more than one Department, possibly two or three; in other words, the Executive Council would concentrate all power and authority in their hands, and they would work through subordinate Parliamentary Secretaries.  I hold that violates the spirit of the Constitution, which expressly provides for Extern Ministries. I think when that was adopted here twelve months ago it was pointed out that some certain Departments might see their work and functions were more of an official rather than a political character, and would realise it would be wrong and contrary to public policy to have those come within party scope. The function of the Dáil, in those circumstances, was to control those by having Ministers directly responsible to the Dáil.  For that reason I move my amendment.</P>

      <P>The phrase in the Section &ldquo;Executive Ministers,&rdquo; as a description of the Ministers who are members of the Executive Council, seems to suggest that the other Ministers are not Executive Officers but are merely administrative or some other sort of inferior Ministers.  I think it is important that the dignity and status of these Ministers should be maintained and they should be protected from even inferential slight.  If a short description is needed the phrase &ldquo;Executive Councillor&rdquo; suggests itself.  In England or Canada you have the term &ldquo;Privy Councillor,&rdquo; and turning to more honourable bodies, you have the &ldquo;Executive Councillors&rdquo; of Trade Unions.</P>

I take it a Minister has Executive responsibility even though he is not responsible with the Council.  To say that a man is an Executive Minister, and to suggest that only he is an Executive Minister and that non-Executive Council Ministers have no Executive responsibility, is an interpretation of the term that is very foreign to me.  I imagine at least the Minister for Fisheries, for instance, <Col N="1667" /> has Executive responsibility for the work of his Department.

Whether the term suggested in the amendment, &ldquo;Executive Councillors,&rdquo; is the best, I am not going to say, but I believe it is very much better than Executive Ministers, and it is a surprising interpretation of Constitutional requirements for the President to say that we are bound to call them Executive Ministers.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat the question that I put and that seems to have aroused a certain amount of derision from Deputy Magennis.  Every Minister is an Executive Minister, but these words suggest that certain Ministers only are Executive Ministers.  I do urge that the better form of words could be devised. I admit I do not like the word &ldquo;Councillors&rdquo;; it has not gathered round it either very excellent traditions or procedure; but I do sugges you might use the word &ldquo;Secretaries&rdquo; to the Executive Council, or to Ministers being members of the Executive Council.  That, I think, would meet the case with persons who had been appointed as Ministers by the Dáil and not as members of the Executive Council, but who were nevertheless Executive Ministers.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy Figgis merely illustrates the remark that I made in an aside, and which, of course, was unparliamentary and not meant for the general hearing.  It may be out of order to repeat it.  What I said was that when Deputy Figgis is ignorant he is fearfully ignorant.  He might have <Col N="1668" /> noticed, when he was furnished with a copy of the Standing Orders, which includes, among other documents, for the enlightenment of the members of the Dáil, a copy of the Constitution, there is an index to the Constitution beneficently provided to make it easy for Deputies to consult, at moments of stress and difficulty, the original version. On page 196, under the head of Executive Authorities, we get the number of Ministers.  That is, the number of Ministers with Executive Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is merely a small dictionary point, and Deputy Johnson is quite correct in saying that a Minister, in so far as he is at the head of a department, has Executive duties, but that is commonly called administrative work, and is exercised in the administration of the law and the carrying out of public administration.  The term &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; has a specific meaning in our Constitution, and from Articles 50 to 56 what that specific meaning is, is stated in the most unmistakable fashion. Executive authority is to be exercised through the Executive Council, and the number of Ministers constituting the Executive Council is laid down to be not less than five and not more than seven.  Then there are to be other Ministers, and these Ministers are not to be members of the Executive Council.  At the time of the setting up of these arrangements, it was declared that it was for the better administration of their departments that they were not to be charged with the joint Executive responsibility which pertains to each member of the Executive Council, and to all of them.  Those outside Ministers, by the way, are not necessarily to be appointed, but may be appointed &mdash;the clause is permissive.  They have no Executive responsibility, no share in the Executive responsibility within the meaning of &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; in the Constitution. They are responsible for the administration of their departments, if, and when they exist, direct to the Dáil. There would be no room for mistake, it is true.  So far, Deputy Johnson is right.  &ldquo;Executive Ministers&rdquo; can only mean one thing for those familiar with the Constitution, and who will read the legislation of this Dáil with particular reference to the Constitution. But for people who have not any <Col N="1669" /> acquaintance with the Constitution it would be simpler undoubtedly if it read &ldquo;Ministers who are members of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  There is no question of policy or loss of principle in the matter.  It is merely a question of what is or what is not a more desirable form of words.  I would have assumed&mdash;and I would be surprised if it was an undue assumption&mdash;that every member of the Dáil is perfectly familiar with the terms of the Constitution.  Constitutionally the Executive is a Council.  I have not to look at these matters, but I am accustomed to document statements, no matter how sure I am of the facts.  It is exactly what the Attorney-General would do in court.  No matter how well he knows the law, he would make sure that he would cite for the Judge the particular case which is his authority. The fact of consulting a copy of the Constitution, before declaring what is in the Constitution, is in no sense an admission of being familiar with its contents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just suggest that Deputy Magennis, while giving very excellent advice very shortly before told the Dáil that to understand what was in the Constitution the only thing they had to do was to consult the index.  I agree that the matter is not a matter of principle at all.  It is a matter of terminology and convenience. I would suggest that if we take from this Bill the term &ldquo;Executive Minister,&rdquo; then it becomes fixed in everybody's mind that the Ministers who are members of the Executive Council are members of the Executive Authority, and that those without the Executive Council are the Ministers with Executive Authority for the work of their Departments.  The implication will be in the minds of those not familiar with the Constitution&mdash;even Deputies of the Dáil are not familiar with the Constitution&mdash;that the Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council are not in the same position of having Executive control over their own department.  That is the kind of inference that will inevitably grow out of the adoption of this phrase. I suggest that without pinning great faith to the phrase &ldquo;Executive Councillors&rdquo; that it is better than <Col N="1670" />&ldquo;Executive Ministers&rdquo; to describe the members of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>The term Executive Minister seems to suggest that it is an exclusive one and that the other Ministers are not Executive in the same respect.  Now we have been referred, not for the first time, to the Constitution.  On looking at the Constitution, I discover under Article 55 that these Ministers are described in a very simple way.  The total number of Ministers, including Ministers of the Executive Council, shall not exceed twelve.  Well, I do not see why the Government could not adopt the wording of the Constitution and I think it would put out of our minds and the minds of the general public this misconception. It is only a verbal alteration.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Dáil, without referring to the index, that this phrase has already been used in a number of Acts passed by the Dáil, perhaps in its less critical moods.  In some of the more recent Acts it has become practically an established term and so it seems a very convenient term, to define the Ministers who are responsible primarily for the general Executive Government. We have no Privy Council, and I would suggest to the Party opposite that it would not be well to introduce the savour of that institution as we did know it in the past.  We have escaped certain consequences perhaps that might accrue from such an institution. We do not want, on the other hand, to introduce the other analogy, and I suggest that the term &ldquo;Councillor,&rdquo; from whatever angle you look at it, is not the best epithet to apply to a Minister, at any rate when you are describing him with good will.  I suggest that the expression which has already received the legislative sanction of the Dáil should now be adhered to as the most convenient phrase.</P>

      <Col N="1671" /> Although this has been dealt with, as a matter of fact, on other occasions, it is really only a drafting amendment to the new sub-section proposed to be inserted before sub-section 3, so as to admit of the appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries to Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council. It can, therefore, be deferred if An Ceann Comhairle gives leave until those later amendments are disposed of, since it would become necessary in the event of their defeat.

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 31.  Before sub-section (3) to insert two new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) A Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council may, with the approval of Dáil Eireann expressed by resolution, appoint a person being a member of the Oireachtas to be his Parliamentary Secretary, and may at any time remove a Parliamentary Secretary so appointed.</P>
      <P>(4) Every person appointed under the next preceding sub-section shall continue to hold office only so long as he continues to be a member of the Oireachtas, and the Minister by whom he was appointed continues to hold his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to be allowed to alter the term &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; in both sub-sections to the word &ldquo;Dáil.&rdquo;  The intention here is clear enough.  It is intended to allow Ministers who are not in the Executive Council the same privilege, shall I call it, as members of the Executive Council who shall hold office, and the Secretaries shall hold office only so long as the Minister who appointed them continues to hold office. The possibilities are that if there is a case made for Secretaries to Ministers who are members of the Executive Council because of the pressure of work, the Department in charge of Extern Ministers may also be overworked <Col N="1672" /> and Secretaries appointed.  It is even more important for non-Executive Ministers to have a right to appoint a Secretary, inasmuch as he may not be a member of the Dáil.  It is possible for a Minister not a member of the Executive Council to be appointed from outside the Dáil.  Therefore, in such a case it would be convenient for that Minister to have a right to nominate a Parliamentary Secretary.  I move these sub-sections 3 and 4.</P>

      <P>By the courtesy of the Dáil, I am in a position to continue the remarks I was expressing on the Bill on the last occasion that the Bill was before the Dáil.  I then put forward, as a business man representing business men, that the proposition contained in this Bill for nationalisation of the railways was not acceptable to them, and as this is the foundation of the Bill, I was speaking against its acceptance by the Dáil.  If we turn to the financial Sections of the Bill, they are, of course, of a confiscatory nature, and I rather gather from Deputy Johnson that they have been embodied owing to the example set by the Minister for Agriculture in his Land Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Dáil has the right, subject to public opinion, of confiscation, but in cases of this sort, where there is a very definite value placed on securities of a commercial nature, I do not think this Dáil would agree that the people holding these securities, in the event of their being required for national purposes, should get less, but rather more, than their market value. I will not dwell on this, because I think the Leader of the Opposition would be the first to admit that principle, and, therefore, I do not think it is necessary, at this stage, to go beyond saying that the Bill proposes to acquire certain things from individuals at less than their value.  I think that is a bad principle on which to start the question of the nationalisation of the railways or the nationalisation of anything else.  When we turn to the administration that is proposed to be set up in connection with the Bill, we find that it is proposed to put the railways under the management of a Board of Control. At the head of that Board is to be a Director, and his qualifications are to be qualifications in administering railways, and generally of being in the position to be able to manage them.  I rather think that if this Bill was passed, this Dáil would be on the look out for a super-man, and as well as being a super-man in connection with railway administration, he would also have to be a man of a very philosophic temperament, because he is supposed to manage the railways, and after all, the management of the railways would not be, if left in his own hands, a task beyond his powers.  But, coupled with that, he is to have a Board.  Now, this Board is set up, and I take no exception to it, nor do I cavil at it, but it is set up from a political standpoint.  It is a purely political Board.  In the first place, pride of place, if I may say so, is given to business men.  You have a business man representing manufacturers, and another business man representing commerce as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt, in the selection of these men by the Ministry and the Executive Council, due regard will be paid to their qualifications as good citizens and as worthy representatives of trade and commerce.  But, they would be sitting <Col N="1674" /> on this Board with a very definite interest in securing for trade and commerce certain facilities and certain rates.  After that, the Bill provides for labour representation.  It will not trouble any member of the Dáil to come to the conclusion that labour would be sitting on this Board with a very definite object, too.  Then there are two representatives of agriculture.  In connection with that, we have heard the Farmers' Party say that they had arrived at a point at which they cannot pay rents, rates or taxes.  It would not be a far stretching of the imagination to say that their position on this Board of Control would lead them to say that they could not pay transport charges either, and possibly they might claim, in addition to free transport by the railways that they should also be provided with steamships to transport their goods to other countries, and make the case that owing to the rate of exchange, or some other cause, they were unable to compete with these countries.  In addition to these representatives of trade and commerce and labour, you have got a representative of the Ministry of Finance, whose business, I suppose, it would be to see that there was no money spent on anything.</P>
    <P>This Board that is to be set up may be good from a political standpoint, but from a commercial standpoint I fancy that no one will accept it as a Board that any body of business men would put over any concern to be managed in the interests of shareholders.  After all, you in this case would be the shareholders, so that the hope of any dividend accruing from such an organisation and arrangement would be very slight indeed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very ambitious.  It is not satisfied with the arrangement of, or the control of, the railways, but it also provides for the management of telegraphs, roads and transport.  One thing it does not provide anything for, and that is the unfortunate travelling public. It seems to me that the man in the street, or the ordinary travelling member of the community, or the man that uses the railways in a small way, would be in the position of having to pay the piper without being able to call the tune, or even without any effect on the <Col N="1675" /> tune, and for fear that this unfortunate man might escape the nets set out to trap him in his ordinary daily life, there is a provision in the Bill giving control of the roads, posts and everything else.  It would seem to me to be setting up a kind of State nationalisation which would very effectively interfere with the liberty of the subject.  For instance, if this national school teacher that we heard of, with his motor car, thought that he would make use of it in preference to the railway, I suppose we might conceive the possibility of his being told that he had no right to use his motor car, that he must use the railway because it is State owned, and incidentally he might be refused the right to use the roads.  Speaking as a business man, I say that we want as little interference as possible by the State in connection with the carrying on of our business.</P>
    <P>We do not approve of State interference more than is necessary.  This Bill is the essence of State interference.  If the Dáil were disposed to accept this Bill as it stands, or to pass the Second Reading of it, I feel sure that it would do an immense amount of harm in connection with enterprises as a whole.  In other words, business can be better carried on in an atmosphere of confidence and initiative and enterprise by business men, who will not be affected by undue interference by the State.  In the particular case of the railways, I said on the last occasion I saw no reason why that they should be put in any preferential position to other businesses that are carried on in the ordinary way.  It may be that they are larger than the ordinary businesses and that their ramifications are greater, but there is nothing wrong with the railways, and this Dáil cannot put right what has to be put right under private ownership.  I venture to think that under private ownership a certain amount of control always exists in connection with the railways of the country.  I see Deputy Johnson smiles, but from their start there was that control, because when they were built, in exchange for the facilities given to them, they were required to do certain things.  Under the conditions they <Col N="1676" /> work, and under the control which this Dáil has the power of putting into operation, the development of the railways will satisfy, in my opinion, all the reasonable demands of trade and of the public to be supplied with the best service that can be supplied and the best facilities that can be afforded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson in introducing this Bill told the Dáil that we are not going to get anything out of State control. That was very honest considering he is bringing in this Bill, but that is the fact.  Under no conceivable circumstances can either the public, or anybody else, except perhaps the people who are going to get salaries out of it, acquire any benefits that private enterprise will not give them, if private enterprise is surrounded with security so as to carry on its business and develop itself in a peaceful and favourable atmosphere. The fostering of that spirit in connection with industry will do far more for the country than interference by the State in matters which, I submit, it is not capable of handling in a way that private enterprise will handle any business concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOULFE Mr. WOULFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOULFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil owes more or less a debt of gratitude to Deputy Johnson for bringing forward this matter for consideration, because, as everybody knows, this question of the regulation of the railways has been before the public for a very long time. As far back as I can remember, there has been talk of this, but the circumstances were different.  About 30 or 40 years ago it was discussed, but it was then discussed from a different standpoint. It was discussed from what you might call the top downwards.  The reasons were quite different for proposing nationalisation then as compared with to-day.  At that time there was more or less dissatisfaction with the management&mdash;with the top parts of the railways.  There was complaint that some of the Chairmen and others were too old and past their work; that they were not enterprising enough, and did not push things forward sufficiently. Some people had the idea that if there was nationalisation all these things could be set right, and that a new state of affairs could be brought about.  It was more or less an academic <Col N="1677" /> sort of discussion; there was no reality in it.  From that day to this is quite a long time.  We are up against it in reality now.  During the war we had experience of what nationalisation might be under Government control. The Government took over the railways in Ireland as solvent concerns working well.  There were people then who grumbled about the railways, more or less, but there were no extraordinary complaints about inefficiency.  What is the result?  When the war was at an end the Government handed back the railways in an utterly insolvent condition, so that it would be impossible for the management of any of the railways to carry on, unless the high wages they were compelled to pay were lowered, and this does not seem hitherto to have been possible.  Therefore, the railways were in an insolvent state.  Deputy Johnson proposes as a remedy that these insolvent railways should be presented to the nation in order to guarantee the high wages which the railways under normal conditions cannot possibly pay&mdash;that the nation should, for the honour and glory of maintaining the railways, pay these exorbitant and uneconomic wages.  I do not think that is a proposition that the nation as a whole would agree to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three great classes concerned in this: the workers, the owners and those who use the railways.  The workers at present are in a very good position.  They are taking a large proportion of the receipts.  So much so that if it were not for the money that was given by the English Government when the railways were handed back there would be no attempt to pay a dividend at all.  That has been the result of nationalisation so far.  Have the railways here done so badly for us that we should wish the State to take them over?  It is due to the Boards of Directors to say that throughout their systems they have established in many places the only decent hotels in these places.  If it were not for these hotels in large districts of the country probably there would be no tourist traffic at all.  In a great many wild districts particularly there is nothing approaching a hotel where anything of the commonest order can be decently cooked. The railways have done that much for <Col N="1678" /> us.  Moreover, if you travel through the world&mdash;as for my sins, perhaps, I have done&mdash;and travel on State Railways in Central Europe, India and other places, you will come to the conclusion that our poor railways here at home are not so bad after all&mdash;that they are not badly laid and that the comfort of the travelling public is not disregarded to such an extent as people would have you think.  Many years ago, when at school in a town in Germany, I used to amuse myself watching the trains passing on a certain line and seeing all the travellers with their heads out of the windows.  It occurred to me to ask what the reason for that was and I was informed that on this line there was a fourth class in which there were no seats, so that you had to sit on boxes or anything that was available, and if you wanted to be extremely comfortable you had to keep your head out of the window.  That is a state of affairs we would not stand here very long.  I suppose when people go abroad they are so glad at the change that they are content with anything and think everything is perfect.  A great many people think that everything is good but what they have themselves.  So it may be with people who go abroad and come back and report that something was delightful when as a matter of fact it would not bear looking at.  In India I travelled for five or six days on the State Railways and the degree of comfort which they afford is of the smallest.  There their idea of managing certain things which we consider essential in this country is very primitive. As regards the income from State Railways I cannot say anything as I have not the latest returns.</P>
    <P>I think we would be well advised to consider, not once or twice, but a great many times before we alter the system we know.  As Deputy Hewat stated the other day.  &ldquo;The devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.&rdquo; There is a good deal of truth in that. This is a leap in the dark that you cannot see the end of.  The question of State railways would need very careful examination.  I do not think, in view of the circumstances that are likely to come upon us, the growing competition with railways owing to increased motor traffic, and the development of air <Col N="1679" /> traffic, which the railways have got to meet, that the public would have much to get by taking over the railways in the insolvent state they are.  There is also the prospect of having the traffic diverted in other ways.  I am aware that in these days small concerns cannot stand by themselves.  There is need for amalgamation.  We see that by the banks, how even private banks have joined together for self-protection and development.  That move has been a great success.  Something of that kind could be done with the railways.  I am not propounding a Bill.  I leave that to the higher authorities who understand it.  I think this country would be downright mad to accept any of the responsibility that is likely, if the State took over the management of the railways, without exhausting every other avenue by which the prosperity of the railways and the country could be promoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Deputy stated that the Government would be downright mad if they took over the railways.  I think it would be an act of courage and wisdom on the part of the Government to take over complete control of transport.  After all, the Bill is really an act of faith in what we hear so much about, Irish democracy.  I believe that if we take a wrong turning now in this matter of national transport, we will slow down the pace of the future development of the country.  We have nationalisation already in essential services, such as law, education, the civil service, and so forth, which has worked very well.  Now that we have real Irish State control, I have no doubt these services will work much better.  I do not see why the Government should hesitate to apply the same principle to national transport.  As I say, if it worked well in the other services, I believe the same principle should be applied to national transport, which is the roadway to commerce and industry. We know that capitalists have made that a very slow, a very costly, and a very difficult road.  If we are to have merely a system of dual control, if we are to retain the capitalists, and still actively interfere with them, then we will find them putting all the blame for their own shortcomings on the State. <Col N="1680" /> We, on these Benches, offer the Government and the country what we think is a solution of the problem and what is fair to every interest.  I am sure it will not be contended that those who control the State are inferior in ability to the people who presently control the transport system.  One might ask why, then, delegate to others what the State should do itself?  I am quite sure if the Government would take over the Bill and put their trust in the State, the country will respond and will justify that trust.  I appeal to the Dáil to accept this Bill, which is a constructive effort on the part of the Labour Party and the workers to try and help the nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey describes this Bill as an act of faith in Irish democracy.  I am not quite sure about the act of faith, but it is certainly an act of courage on the part of the Labour Party, and I am sure that the urgency of the problem with which it deals, is their justification for the bringing forward of such an unusual measure of responsibility by private members.  I think that Deputy Morrissey has possibly erred in declaring that democracy was exactly the same thing as nationalisation, because the United States is a democracy&mdash;at least they very frequently tell you so&mdash;but there is no country in the world more hostile to nationalisation and more favourable to private enterprise than the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be converted in time, but presently they are not.  Therefore, I think democracy cannot be said to be synonymous with nationalisation. I wish that we had the question of nationalisation and the desirability of nationalisation discussed at greater length.  Deputy Johnson, I think, swept it away with a wave of the hand when he said that nationalisation of railways was not Bolshevist.  It certainly is not.  I agree.  Prussia, before the war, nationalised the railways, and before the war she was not Bolshevist. Really, Deputy Johnson is letting his natural conservatism carry him too far when he suggests that because a thing is not Bolshevist therefore it must be good.  This is a subject of which I <Col N="1681" /> have not made a close study, and I apologise to the Dáil.  Any remarks that I have to make on nationalisation are based mainly on my own experience. There is a function for State railways, but I think where State railways are needed are in Eastern countries where the work, in the main, is done by coloured labour.  The Egyptian State railways are good and efficient, and I believe the Indian State railways are good.  As far as Western Europe is concerned, all my experience has gone to show that the State railways are not as good and are not as efficient, or as comfortable, and do not treat the traveller as well as the private owned railways.  In France there is one State owned railway, the Western Railway, which is not only more unpunctual than the others, but is more difficult to deal with, and the traveller is treated as a unit and not as a person whose custom is desired.  On that railway there is a very much higher percentage of accidents than any other railway in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Italian State railways have improved enormously since the advent to power of Signor Mussolini, but I take it the Labour Party does not intend permanently installing a Signor Mussolini on the Irish railways; and before Signor Mussolini took charge they were grossly over-staffed, with a railway official travelling in every compartment. There was extraordinary unpunctuality &mdash;it was nothing unusual to arrive at Rome four hours late on a twenty-four hours' journey&mdash;and they were exceedingly dirty.  Things are better now. But even now you can travel more comfortably and more quickly in a second-class on other lines than you do in a first-class carriage on the Italian State railways.  I cannot say that this is exhaustive, as I do not know the railways of Eastern Europe well.  Deputies may very well be able to bring forward arguments that will confute me, but my personal experience goes to show me that nationalisation does not mean greater efficiency, and certainly does not mean greater contentment among the employés of the railways.  Nor do we observe in the State-owned services of this country, to which Deputy Morrissey <Col N="1682" /> referred, that officials, such as postal servants, are contented.  Did they never strike?  I have heard of a good deal of discontent amongst them. Are the teachers, who are employed by the State, in a condition of contentment with their lot?  I think not.  State ownership does not remove the ordinary grievances that are felt by people working for their living from day to day, but turns them against the State as an employer instead of against the private employer.  Where the State itself is concerned in a matter of this kind you get a situation which at once becomes difficult and not infrequently dangerous.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to one or two points in the Bill.  I do not intend criticising the proposed method of working.  Deputy Hewat did that, and I have no intimate knowledge of it.  I only say that, judging by my general experience, these Committees and Panels that are to be set up will probably cause a good deal of criticism, or else they will become entirely defective.  To go from that to one or two specific points in the Bill&mdash;it might be submitted that specific points should be left over to the Committee Stage&mdash;but I submit that there is some justification for anticipating the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The first is the question of finance.  Deputy Johnson said he had adopted the precedent of the Minister for Agriculture in dealing with land, and that that was generally accepted by all parties as fair and right.  I assure Deputy Johnson that if I had been in the last Dáil the Minister for Agriculture would have heard a good deal on the subject of fifteen years' purchase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not; and I think the Minister for Agriculture would have met with very much more determined opposition within and outside the Dáil than he did had it not been for the position in which the Government were placed at the time. They were faced with enormous difficulties, and the landlords were very reluctant <Col N="1683" /> to increase and augment their difficulties by pressing for their inherent rights.  They did not consider that fifteen years' purchase was right, and I do not think that Deputy Gorey considers that fifteen years' purchase of railway shares is right, whatever he might apply to the land.  In this case I prefer to speak on the principle that two wrongs do not make a right, that if the landlord sold at fifteen years' purchase and put the proceeds into railway stock, sacrificing a considerable portion of his income, he should then be again paid under this Bill at fifteen years' purchase.  That he should be placed in that position, does not seem to me fair or reasonable.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points of finance in the Bill that puzzle me.  Deputy Johnson said, with regard to the Terminable Annuities, that after seventy-two years the debt would be discharged.  He did not quite say the debt to whom, to the owner of the shares or to the State.  It would be discharged by paying 4¾ per cent. for seventy-two years, and then there is nothing.  Is that a form of investment that is likely to commend itself to an investor&mdash;a terminable investment?  Is a man who wishes to make provision for his children likely to buy stock of that kind, that will steadily fall year after year?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>He has an option, exactly; and as every sane man will exercise his option, why the proposal was put into the Bill beats me.

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Because nobody in his senses will accept these Terminable Annuities, redeemable stock for seventy-two years to be paid off at par.  Is that a reasonable form of investment? If it is going to be paid off at par it would mean a Sinking Fund.  I am a <Col N="1684" /> child in matters of finance, but I do not think that if you have such a Sinking Fund you could possibly pay off any investment at par in less than four hundred years, or some time like that, if you were to combine interest and Sinking Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <P>But, even so, it is contemplating something very much more drastic, and unlike the reassuring statements made by Deputy Johnson when he moved the Second Reading.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot bind a tribunal.  The tribunal may take a very different point of view, and this point of view ought to be recognised by the Dáil before they give this Bill a Second Reading.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Johnson, or whoever drafted the Bill, has taken pains to see that the tribunal cannot do more than a certain <Col N="1685" /> amount of justice, because he has fixed the maximum price at which stock is to be redeemed, and he has not fixed the minimum price.  He said the maximum price would probably turn out to be the minimum.  Deputy Johnson very often reminds me of the late Mr. Gladstone. This reminds me of an assurance &mdash;I was not born at the time&mdash;that was given by Mr. Gladstone, on the introduction of the Land Bill of 1881.  He then promised the Irish landlords that only in very exceptional cases would rents be reduced, and that in most cases they would be increased.  I take Deputy Johnson's assurance, that the maximum in this case will probably also be the minimum, as having about as much value as that other assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he wanted a minimum, why did he not put in a minimum?  It was open to him to put in a minimum as well as a maximum if he wanted to reassure the shareholders, but he did not do so. Deputy Johnson is thoroughly consistent. He will have no minimum penalty for poachers or railway shareholders, whom he probably regards as offenders on a somewhat larger scale, but while there is no minimum whatever to protect the shareholder the tribunal can under this Bill deprive him of his rights.  There is plenty of protection in the Second Schedule for every existing railway servant, who shall not be transferred without his own consent, or placed in any worse position whatever. I now come to another Section, which, I think, has not been noticed, and has not been referred to by Deputy Johnson or anyone else; that is, Section 41: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for any person employed under the Minister to become a member of Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann&rdquo;&mdash;well, they can become so now&mdash;&ldquo;or to participate in any civil or political action in like manner as if such person were not employed under the Minister.&rdquo;  That is, he has full civil rights, and can become an election agent, or sub-agent, or personation agent, and he can take an active part in politics.  Up to the present the railways have very carefully kept their employees out of politics.  They have been so careful that they have even refused to display political bills on the hoardings at the stations, but this gives every servant employed on the Irish <Col N="1686" /> railways the right to full political action. When you take your ticket at the booking office you may have a political leaflet shoved out to you with it, and every railway station would probably become a committee room in the service of one party.  What is more, by a later Section, Deputy Johnson proposes to extend this power and this immunity to all postal servants as well.  You will find yourself being canvassed by the postman when he delivers your letters in the morning.  I venture to think that it is not desirable we should have a vast army of servants employed by the State, and at the same time endowed with absolutely full political and civil rights, which civil servants are not allowed. At present postal servants are not allowed it.  I think the political right that is sought to be conferred by the Bill is, on the whole, a dangerous one, and should not be given.  I turn to my last point, and that is the position under this Bill of those railways which are not in the Saorstát at all.  I was astonished when I read the Schedule and saw there the Belfast and County Down Railway, the Northern Counties Committee of the Midland Railway, the Giant's Causeway and Bush Valley Tramway, and one or two others which are not under our control.  No one dislikes partition more than I do, and no one is more anxious to see partition put to an end than I am, but you do not put an end to partition by pretending it does not exist, and most certainly you do not make it easier to bring about union by assuming powers to legislate for those over whom you have no control.  How can you compel a man in Belfast to give up his shares in the Belfast and County Down Railway? We have no power to do that, and that power shall be conferred on the Executive Council who can fix any appointed day they think fit for railways which are not entirely in the Saorstát.  If you wish to exercise that power you will have to go to war, and I hardly think that can be seriously contemplated even by the Labour Party.  If there was nothing else in the Bill that I objected to but the inclusion of those railways over which we have no control, and making it possible for them to be taken over on the appointed day fixed by the Executive Council, <Col N="1687" /> that alone, I think, would be sufficient to condemn the Bill.  Also you leave out the railways that are partly in the Saorstát and partly out of it, such as the Great Northern Railway.  It shows the unreality of the Bill, and it proves that it is only window-dressing. You might as well have said that for this second class of railways the appointed day should be Tibb's Eve.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson prefaced his remarks in moving the Second Reading by stating that the Bill was not presented in the expectation of its passing, making any revolutionary change or adding to any great extent to the well-being of the masses of the people.  To my mind there is a very grave necessity for some decided change in the present system of administration or management of the railways with a view to developing the country in the interests of the masses.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the Second Reading.  In the first instance, I think it will be generally admitted, in spite of some remarks passed by Deputy Hewat and Deputy Cooper, that the railways of Ireland are not satisfactory.  As a matter of fact most of the Commissions that have considered the question of railways during recent years have stated definitely that they are unsatisfactory and that they have not been worked efficiently.  All these Commissions reported that in their opinion some system of unification was needed, and the only thing on which the members of the Commission differed was as to whether it should be unification under private ownership and control, or unification under State ownership.  Personally, I think that unification under private ownership would be giving too great a monopoly to private interests, which they could use for their benefit at the expense of the people generally.  Deputy Hewat, <Col N="1688" /> after having mentioned some of the interests that would be catered for by the Bill, wanted to know would it cater for the travelling public, and he suggested that it would not.  I ask Deputy Hewat, and people who think like him, does the present system of railway ownership in Ireland cater for the travelling public?  I know in a good many cases it does not.  Anyone who has travelled from South Wexford to Waterford on the Dublin South Eastern Railway knows that when you get into Waterford from, say Ballycullane, on the Great Southern you will find that the train going North by way of New Ross has left about 10 minutes before your arrival at Waterford, and the result is if you are in a hurry it is necessary to get a motor car, and if you are not in a hurry you can wait 7 or 8 hours for the next train.  I do not know whether it is the fault of the Great Southern and Western Railway or of the Dublin and South Eastern, but I certainly think that if these railway companies were studying the comfort of the travelling public they would at least arrange their time table so that one train would arrive 15 minutes earlier or the other leave 15 minutes later, so as to allow five minutes for the passengers to change.  That is an instance which anyone who has been in that part of the country will call to mind.  It happened to myself on a number of occasions, and according to the time tables, which I have consulted, the discrepancy still exists.  The farming section, I think, should also give a good deal of attention to the Bill. Recently when we were discussing the cost of living and the necessity for a better method of marketing goods, the Minister for Agriculture complimented the Secretary of the Cork Farmers' Association on having got his members to market foodstuffs, and the like, cattle, sheep and pigs from Co. Cork, during the time of the dock strike, directly to England instead of waiting on the shipping merchants.  On that occasion Bantry was used for the purpose of shipping the various kinds of agricultural goods to England.  I would like to mention that from the Macroom area during the time railways were controlled by the British <Col N="1689" /> Government it was quite possible to put goods on the railway at Macroom and send them direct to Bantry.</P>
      <P>Simply because the Cork and Macroom Railway is under different management from the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway, when control was removed in 1921, the points connecting the two lines were lifted at the orders of the management of the Macroom line.  The result was that during the recent dockers' strike, farmers who tried to get their goods away were compelled to send them by road to Bantry, instead of direct by train from Macroom.  I also remember about six weeks ago a deputation came from Macroom to wait on the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to ask him to use his power to compel the Cork and Macroom Company to connect their line with that of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Company.  They pointed out that to bring coal to Macroom, by way of Cork, it was necessary to cart it from the quay-side, a distance of about half a mile, to Capwell station. Although there was a connection from the quay-side with the Cork and Macroom Railway the management would not allow it to be used.  In some discussions which we had on the matter, the manager of the Cork and Macroom Railway asked, in the event of this connection being made again as it was during the war, what would become of Capwell station?  We find this peculiar state of affairs under the present system&mdash;that instead of the Cork and Macroom Railway, about twenty-three miles in length, existing for the benefit of the people, it exists solely for the benefit of Capwell station.  That is a thing that would not exist if there was unified control or State control of the railways.  They would be used in the interests of the people.  In Berlin I believe there is a railway museum housed in a station that became derelict after the nationalisation of the railways in Germany.  There they did not hesitate to scrap a station or any other part of a system that was of use no longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hewat pointed out that the railways were mostly a failure when promoted or subsidised by the Government. I would like to point out that subsidising a railway and leaving it <Col N="1690" /> under the control of private interests is different from State ownership and State control.  During the war, and for a number of years prior to it, I believe the railways of Ireland were subsidised to the extent of over ten millions, which was paid by the taxpayers of this country into the pockets of the private owners of the railways without the people of the country having one pennyworth of control in the running of those railways.  We merely want to get away from that.  All the Commissions which dealt with the railway problem realised that the railways are inefficient when run and controlled privately, and that they will never prove paying concerns for the present owners.  We claim, if there is to be any subsidy, we should go the whole hog, and if we have to pay the difference between the amount necessary to run the railways and the amount the railways can make, we should get full control, and if there are any profits, we should get the profits that are made. I should like to point out, for Deputy Hewat's benefit, that in Prussia the State railways earned sufficient money to pay the interest on capital and yielded a surplus which increased from one million in 1882 to twenty-three millions in 1907.  In 1907-8 the amount yielded by the railways in profit to the State was three times as much as the amount of money got from income tax, and more than double that got from the income and property taxes combined. The total surplus from 1882 to 1907 was two hundred and sixty millions. I would like to read from a book called &ldquo;The Nationalisation of Railways.&rdquo;  It is a bit out of date, but the arguments apply at any time.  Here is a quotation contained in it from the &ldquo;Sunday Times.&rdquo;  I see that Deputy Gorey laughs, but I do not mind that. I am rather pleased that he is in such good health as to enjoy a laugh.  I would like to point out that writers in a paper like the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; cannot be accused of being favourable to State ownership or nationalisation.  On the contrary, the people who control the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; and papers of that class-always shout the loudest for hands off on the part of the State from interference with private interests.  In <Col N="1691" /> spite of that, the writers in the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; can recognise facts when they see them, and state them in a way that can be understood by common people.  I mention that to show that there is some justification for treating you to this quotation.  There was a discussion in the different papers at this time on the question of the nationalisation of railways, and this is what the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under these circumstances, it is of interest to see how Prussia, the cradle of nationalisation, has fared by its policy.  If we summarise the budget of that kingdom we find that its administration costs six hundred and eighty-seven million marks, of which three hundred and fifty-nine millions are covered by taxes.  There is thus a shortage of three hundred and twenty-eight millions balanced by the surplus from the working of State properties.  Forests and demesnes supply 68 millions, mines 18 millions, lotteries 9 millions, the State bank four and a half millions, and the mint half a million, while no less than two hundred and twenty-eight millions come from the railways&mdash;the latter after providing two hundred and ninety-three millions for interest on debt created for purchasing the property.  In other words, one-third of the State's expenditure is provided by the surplus profits of the railways, whose total receipts amounted to 2,052½ million marks.  The financial position of Prussia has, of late, been subjected to criticism, but, as a matter of fact, it remains sound, thanks mainly to the revenue derived from Bismarck's acquisitions.  Indeed, if we capitalise the goodwill of Prussia's industrial surplus of 328 millions on a 4 per cent. basis, we arrive at a capital of 8,250 million marks.  Deducting therefrom the net Government debt, not represented by assets, 500 millions, there remains an asset of 7,750 millions, or £387,500,000 as national wealth.  Not an unfavourable balance, and mainly due to the timely nationalisation of the railways.  No doubt, the railway problem presents itself in different forms in the various <Col N="1692" /> countries.  But a study of the results of State railway administration in its classic home is not without teaching some useful lessons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat asked as to why we should specify railways, and he wanted to know what was the difference between railways and other concerns.  In my opinion, all other private businesses in the country depend to a large extent on railways and the other transport facilities.  He also pointed out that, through the operation of political forces, a preferential and peculiar position for rail servants was established, a position which, he said, would never have applied in this country under ordinary conditions.  He suggested by that, that the railway workers in this country used their political power, such as it was, to obtain conditions that were not warranted, and that would never have been obtained in the ordinary way if the railways had remained under private control.  He implied by that that the wages of railway men were something extraordinary; his exact words are: &ldquo;preferential and peculiar.&rdquo;  I would like to point out that if they got increases in their wages during the days when the railways were controlled by the British Government, the wages they got then certainly did not bring them to a great state of prosperity, and that the wages they had in pre-war days, prior to Government control, were not such that either Deputy Hewat, or any railway shareholder or business man, or employer of labour, might cry about them. Mr. Keogh, representing the railway companies at the late Railway Commission which sat here, said that the average wages of all grades&mdash;many of them including skilled men&mdash;in 1913 was 20s. 8d., while the average paid to Scottish workers was 27s. 4d.  On that showing, the average wage here was 6s. 8d. less than in Scotland and in England in pre-war days.  If that is the case, I certainly think the railway workers here were entitled to some increased remuneration, in view of the fact that they had been so badly paid, comparatively, in pre-war days, and also in view of the fact that the cost of living had been considerably increased.  I would like to point out to Deputy Hewat&mdash;he admitted <Col N="1693" /> it towards the end of his remarks&mdash;that this is not altogether a Rail Bill, but that it is a Transport and Communications Bill, and that it proposes to control the waterways as well as the road transport of the country.</P>
    <P>As things are at present, there is no connection between road transport and rail transport, but if the whole transport work of the country were put under one Ministry, with power of improvement in the general interest, it is very likely that arrangements would be made between the different railway companies and the boats to Cork which Deputy Hewat mentioned, as well as with those who control the roads at the present time.  He also pointed out that the law of increasing wages will not apply in this country in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bryan Cooper mentioned an incident in his experience to show that privately-owned railways were worked more efficiently and gave a better service to the travelling public than publicly-owned railways.  He said that he saw some passengers in a German railway train looking out through the windows while passing through a station&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, it was Deputy Woulfe said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  Deputy Woulfe explained that, on inquiry, he found that the reason the passengers were looking through the window was that there were no seats.  He instanced that to prove that State-owned railways gave worse facilities than privately-owned railways, either in Great Britain or Ireland.  I would like to go a little bit further and to point out that these passengers were in fourth class carriages, and that there never have been any fourth class carriages in these countries on railways under private management.  I would also like to point out that the fare that was paid for travelling fourth class on German railways was a fare that has never been touched in these countries.  As a matter of fact, you could travel a little more than five miles for twopence in pre-war days, when the charge here was a penny a mile.  I think that altogether negatives the claim of the Deputy regarding the people who had to stand <Col N="1694" /> up.  In this country you would not be allowed to stand, even in a cattle truck, for any distance, for the fare charged there.  I am not cognisant of the conditions that exist at the present time, but I believe that the rates on the Continental State-owned railways are much lower than the rates charged on the privately-owned railways in these countries, either for passenger or goods traffic.  In some cases you can go as far on the Belgian railways as three thousand miles for the same amount that you would pay for a journey of fifty-one miles, between two points, in England or Ireland.  In some cases the Austrian State Railways gave a journey of six miles for 2d., pre-war, twelve miles for 4d., and four hundred miles for 16/3.  These prices have never been approached in these countries.  If the matter were seriously considered, it would be found that there was a better case made for nationalisation of the railways than ever has been made for the continuance of the present system. Before I finish, I would like to mention the views of a couple of people who are very interested in this problem, and in other problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In any case, he said that there was a great necessity for a go-ahead and vitalising system of transportation, and that the House&mdash;that was the British House of Commons&mdash; as a whole was committed to that system. I would like to point out that, if Sir Eric Geddes considered, and the British House of Commons was convinced, there was a great necessity for <Col N="1695" /> a change in the system of railway control in England, the necessity exists to a greater extent in this country, because the railways in this country, it will be admitted by every Farmer Deputy in this Dáil and every farmer in the country who talks about the rates for transportation, are even worse than the railways of England. If it is necessary to make a change on the railways of England, in the interests of economy, the interests of better administration, and in the interests of the people of the country as a whole, it seems more necessary to do so in this country.  Therefore, I desire to support the Second Reading of this Transport and Communications Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, in the remarks he made on the Second Reading of this Bill, stated that it was not going to make any revolutionary changes, and he did not presume that it was going to result in any substantial saving to the community. Thereby he gave away his whole case.  If no material change for the benefit of the community could be anticipated, why does he embark upon a dangerous experiment of this kind? State and corporate control of undertakings do not encourage us to embark upon a sea in which there have been so many wrecks.  If&mdash;and it has not been suggested so far; it was not suggested by Deputy Johnson&mdash;the position of Irish railways, taking all the associated circumstances into account, was in any degree much worse than the conditions where railways are under control of private ownership in other countries, why should we here embark upon a policy of what I look upon as a capital levy in a disguised form?</P>

      <P>The writing may be on the wall but is it going to materialise? I am not at all in agreement with the optimistic view expressed by Deputy Johnson, when he stated &ldquo;when this Bill is passed&rdquo; for, though I am ignorant of the Government proposals with respect to railway control in this country, I think I can confidently commit myself to this, that <Col N="1696" /> with the Government the policy of commonsense is going to prevail and we are not going to pass this Bill.  The doctrine has been laid down by Deputy Johnson that pre-war conditions are impossible conditions for the workers. Is the stockholder in a Railway Company in a different position with regard to increased expenditure to the worker?  Has the stockholder of the Railway Company ever received out of the company in which he invested his money anything more than a reasonable return, and, in very, very many cases, much less than the return he might reasonably expect, taking into account the capital invested and the risks that he undertook?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plea has been made that the finance of this Bill is fashioned on the finance of the Land Bill.  But the two parties whom you propose to buy out will never be put upon the same plane as regards the moral right they have&mdash; the one to the land and the other as a stockholder in a railway company.  It has never been admitted here that the landlords of Ireland had a moral right to the land.  Their ownership was the result of confiscation.  The stockholder in the railway company created the property; the landlord of Ireland did not.  In dealing with these two people we were dealing on the one side with one who acquired his property as a result of a policy that sought to make the Celt as rare on the banks of the Shannon as the Red Indian on the shores of the Manhattan, and on the other side with the Irish investor who had the courage, when the Government would not do it, to put his money into railway development and make modern transit possible in Ireland.  Under those conditions you cannot deal with these two people, it is not an equitable proposition to deal with these two people on the same basis of settlement. What would be the net result to the stockholder in the railway companies if effect were given to the proposals of Deputy Johnson?  Take the case of the company in which the average earnings for the five years ending 1913 would be 4 per cent.  The Deputy proposes that the maximum capital of stock payment in that case would be 15 years' purchase, or £60.  He does not guarantee the figure at 15 years' purchase.  There <Col N="1697" /> is not the same fixity as in the case of the Bill promoted by the Minister for Agriculture, but it is clearly stated that the maximum cannot be more than fifteen years' purchase.  Now, £60 would be three-fifths of the par value of that stock, and three-fifths of the four per cent. stock will give the stockholder an income over a limited number of years, as was pointed out by Deputy Cooper, of something like £2 14s. or £2 15s. per cent. per annum, so that the stockholder not alone is not to have the income that he had before the war, but he has to face the world and all the increased cost of living, entailed as a result of the war, with a considerably reduced income.</P>
    <P>The Deputy does not recognise such a suggestion as being in any way possible when he deals with labour.  What is the stock held by the stockholders in this country?  It is the fund provided as the result of labour and activities in some form or another, and provided in many cases by people who, through penuriousness and through denying themselves the ordinary little luxuries and enjoyments that they may have in this life, were enabled to make some provision for the future, and I look upon the proposal to conscript, and to conscript substantially, the miserable income that they enjoyed previous to the war, as an absolutely immoral thing.  No case has been made or presented so far for an alteration such as is suggested in the Deputy's Bill.  It may come in time.</P>

      <P>At any rate, we have not yet reached that time.  When it does come, and when conditions would warrant such a substantial change as the Bill suggests, then the good sense of the Dáil would, in the altered conditions, make the change. Why is it desirable to make this change?  Why is this change in any degree necessary?  It is a change which, if at all necessary or at all desirable, is a change following upon State management, or rather State mismanagement, of railways during the period of the war.  Associated with the railways of Ireland was expenditure in labour and expenditure in other <Col N="1698" /> details that the circumstances of the time, to a certain extent, possibly may be an excuse for, but that the conditions of the Irish railways and Irish traffic by no means warranted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy further on in his speech absolutely gives away any pretence of making a case in favour of his proposal when he says: &ldquo;I am very doubtful whether an efficient railway system can, in this country, be provided without some form of public assistance,&rdquo; so that even under the new conditions that he proposes, the conditions that are supposed to end all difficulty with respect to an effective, an efficient and an economic railway service in Ireland, he admits that this Bill is not going to provide for all that efficiency and particularly for that economy.  He still anticipated that a State subsidy will be necessary to enable the railways to continue to function.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nagle quoted some Scotch case.  I will quote particulars from a Scottish railway as compared with Irish railways, and they will show that where there is not a material difference in the capital, the Irish railways, for a much smaller revenue and a much smaller transit of merchandise, have to travel considerably longer distances with, I need hardly say, less satisfactory results for the shareholders.  If, as the Deputy surmised, and as we all hope and believe, things in the near future are going materially to improve in this country, do we not think that the people who built the railways and who put their monies into railway concerns, and who had the courage to do that which the Government of the time had failed to do, should receive some consideration? If that improvement is going to result, do we not think that before it takes place it would be absolutely unfair that their ownership in the railways should be conscripted, and that if we are going to purchase, that they should at least get the benefit they are legitimately entitled to from the improvement that would result in the State in which we are all common citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the case of all Irish railways. The capital expenditure on all Irish railways up to the end of 1913 was £43,364,255.  The Caledonian Railway <Col N="1699" /> in Scotland had a capital expenditure of a little over £56,000,000.  For their smaller capital the Irish railway system ran 3,410 miles, and the Scottish railways ran only one-third of that, or 1,111 miles.  The revenue receipts were Ireland were £4,782,000, and in Scotland the revenue receipts were £5,467,000.  The receipts per mile in Ireland amounted to £1,402, and in Scotland £4,920.  The revenue expenditure in Ireland was a little over £3,000,000, and on the Caledonian railway about £3,250,000.</P>
    <P>The tonnage carried, merchandise, coal and minerals, in Ireland was six and two-thirds millions, and twenty-eight and a-quarter millions in Scotland. Passengers in Ireland were thirty-one millions, as against fortyseven millions in Scotland.  Now that goes to show that when we are dealing with the railway system in Ireland we must remember the circumscribed opportunities that it has as compared with other countries.  We must also remember that hitherto the shareholders in Ireland have had a very inadequate all round return on the capital invested in the companies.  Some Deputies will remember that some seven weeks ago the Great Southern and Western Railway published a schedule showing the rates of wages paid to their employees, as compared with the cross-Channel rates of wages, and while, in the instances I have quoted, the earning power of the cross-Channel railways was considerably more than the earning power per mile of the Irish railways, the wages paid to the Irish employees were considerably more than the wages paid across the water.</P>

      <P>I will give one of the figures, and the Deputy may not be so pleased when he gets the information. In this particular case the Great Southern Railway pointed out that the cost of producing a carriage at their <Col N="1700" /> Inchicore works under the favourable conditions existing at the time when they made the statements, that is, after a reduction of six shillings a week had taken place in the wages of their employees, the cost of producing the carriage even under the new conditions would be £300 more than it would cost them to import it from across the water.  And they stated that prior to the reduction which had taken place&mdash;this statement did not appear in the papers, but I got it myself&mdash;the difference in the cost of the production of the carriage for the same specification, landed at North Wall, and produced at Inchicore works was £527.  Is it to bolster up a condition like that that this Bill is introduced?  If that is the policy we are adopting, whether Deputy Johnson denies it or no, the principle of Nationalisation is associated with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate the principle does apply to this, and I think the Deputy in the last twelve months made a statement in this Dáil that shareholders in railway companies, having had the shares in their possession for a certain number of years and having got a return equivalent to their capital under private ownership have no moral ownership any longer as their <Col N="1701" /> money was returned to them.  That is a most dangerous doctrine to enunciate because it could be applied to the farmers in a few years time.  If a man having purchased his land in a couple of years received in produce from that a return equal to his capital it might be argued that then his ownership was at an end.  It would apply to the ordinary trader.  Any business having had a certain amount of capital put into it, and having had a return equivalent to that capital it might be argued that the owner was no longer entitled to the ownership of the business.  If that is the doctrine the Deputy stands behind, and if that doctrine was pressed successfully Ireland would be a very unhealthy place for the ordinary citizen to live in.</P>
      <P>Everyone admits that the pre-war wages of the railway workers were too low, but we have to consider if the present wages are warranted by the earning powers of the railways in Ireland, because it is not a good enough policy to suggest that if the State takes over the railways the taxpayers can again be approached to make good any deficit on their earnings; that is not a good enough national policy.  We have to consider whether the existing conditions in Ireland warrant the payment of the present rates of wages.  If they do we must continue to pay them, and if they do not, wages must be fitted in as one unit in the economic machine, because if the factors are against us it is only by increasing the rates that the wages can be continued at their present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Labour members that the existing railway charges are, in a sense, prohibitive.  Railway fares and railway rates are too high to make progress in the country.  If we are going to have substantial industrial or agricultural progress, railway rates must come down.  It is a question that ought to be considered in conference. The conference should be representative of the Government, of the railway employees and of Labour generally, and of the industrial and farming elements of the community, and an effort should be made to see to what extent conditions might be altered so as to enable more favourable terms to prevail in the country as regards the transit <Col N="1702" /> of goods.  There is no doubt but that the present rates are a stranglehold upon development, but at the same time we realise that the railway returns go to show that any material interferences with these charges will result, if not in actual loss, at least in a miserable return to those whose capital is invested in the different companies. Deputy Johnson quoted the capital figures involved in the case of seven railways.  In the case of the seven principal railways in the country there is a sum of something like £40,400,000 invested.  In the five years included by the Deputy in his Bill, the net distributive earnings of these Companies was £1,558,570.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am dealing with the seven principal railway companies in the country.  The amount of money invested in these represents 85 per cent. of the railway capital in Ireland. The loss in revenue, if effect were given to this Bill, would be £506,535.  In addition, since the year 1913, a sum of £466,000 of additional capital has been put into the Irish railway companies.  The Deputy makes no provision as regards the discharge of liability on this, except that I assume he intends that it should water down the return on the others.  He is only going to pay apparently from his Bill on the figures as we find them at the end of 1913, and, therefore, the additional capital of nearly £500,000 will be a further watering down of the return to the shareholders.</P>

He addressed himself particularly to the policy of unification, and, to my mind, at any rate, I do not know whether it commends itself to other Deputies or to the Government, but I believe that unification is the immediate solution of the question.  Let us, I say, proceed by easy stages.  If unification is a success&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat suggested that State control or nationalisation is the big point of unification. Unification, as we look upon it in this country, will represent two controlling bodies, the two big companies, and bring them into one.  At any rate I am going to be very short on that point with which Deputy Nagle dealt with at some length.  I think it would be a safe step to adopt in railway policy, and that it would mean more effective and more efficient control. You could, I believe, embody with the principle of unification representation of different interests on the new controlling bodies, if the Government so desires, and I think it would be desirable. You have an instance of that in the control of the Port of London, a very big project in which various interests, labour and other, are incorporated in the controlling body, with most effective results as regards the working of that body and as regards a satisfactory revenue and a satisfactory <Col N="1704" /> profit.  We all have community of interest, whether we be employers or employees. We have a common country, and in the success of that common country we ought to take a common interest and take occasion to sink all prejudices and all the differences that are sometimes unwisely associated with us as individuals.  I am sure that if the voice of labour gives expression through men of moderate views and of individual capacity, such as the Deputy at the head of the Labour Party and of others associated with him, that not alone should we agree to sink our differences, but that in the sinking of them we would undoubtedly put the country, as regard labour disputes and the settlement of undertakings of this kind, on the high road to progress.</P>
      <P>There is just one matter in connection with unity of control which I did not refer to.  In Ireland, at the end of 1921, we had 170 railway directors. On the Caledonian Railway in Scotland, with its larger capital and its bigger operations, they had 11.  Let us all join forces to get rid of a condition of things such as that, and I believe we can then, without resorting to this Bill &mdash;which I think is premature&mdash;evolve a new and more effective system of railway control, administration and operation, which will result in much greater benefits from every point of view to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would call attention to the conditions of the Customs examinations at Saorstát ports, because I was not entirely satisfied with the reply I got from the Minister for Finance as to the arrangements that are to be adopted at Dun <Col N="1705" /> Laoghaire.  The problem is not an easy one, because the pier at Dun Laoghaire was not intended for the purpose of Customs examination, and there is, consequently, a very considerable shortage of space.  The proposals of the Minister, or rather of his subordinates, and the railway companies concerned, will not, I think, remedy that shortage of space in anyway whatever.  The congestion that exists at present is due to the fact that the arrival platform has been cut in two by a fence, and that in half of the space of the ordinary platform, there is established a counter at which the lighter goods are examined. Then there is barely room for the truck-loads of heavy luggage that are brought off the boats and wheeled up to await examination, once the hand luggage has been disposed of.  At a time, for instance, like Christmas and when the schools break up, the congestion is immense.  There is hardly room to move.  I do not know if the Minister has been down there at such a time. With the crowd of people and porters who have luggage to be examined and the people who have had luggage examined trying to get to the platform, there is a great congestion, and old people and children find it very difficult to get through.  The congestion is such that it is necessary to shut everybody off the pier who wishes to meet people. If a child is travelling over alone and relatives wish to meet the child, they have either to go to Westland Row or meet the child at the exit from the pier.  That is not due to any fault of the Minister or to any fault of any Department, but to the fact that the pier is very small.  The one redeeming feature is the great efficiency of those whose duty it is to search luggage. They do their work thoroughly, quickly and courteously, and if they were not extremely competent, the situation would be very much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister got together, last week, representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, the Board of Works, who are responsible for the pier, and the two railway companies concerned.  He got them round a table to consider what should be done.  That was a very sound first step, but if I might suggest it, the Minister should have done one other <Col N="1706" /> thing.  He should have locked the door and said that they could not come out until they had propounded a scheme for dealing with the whole question, and not merely the palliative which is suggested, which is to put up some form of shelter which will keep the rain and wind off the people whose luggage is being examined and those whose duty it is to examine it.  That would be a good thing, but I am afraid it will have the effect of making the congestion even worse.  The Minister, in his reply last week, told me that some inconvenience was inseparable from Customs examination.  That is undoubtedly the case, but if he consults the more travelled members of the Ministry, who went to Bobbio and other places, he will find that neither at Dover, Calais, Boulogne, or other places, is the congestion so great or the conditions so uncomfortable as at Dun Laoghaire. That is partly, no doubt, because the thing is improvised.  It gives, however, a bad impression to those coming to Ireland for the first time.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions might be made. One is that all the heavy luggage labelled for Westland Row should go through and be examined there.  Another suggestion is that the hand-baggage should be examined on the boat, as is done on some of the steamers from Dover and Folkestone to Calais and Boulogne.  That might be possible. No doubt if you add the risk of seasickness to their other duties you would probably have to pay a slightly higher salary to officers.  Taking the situation as it stands and assuming that you are going to examine the luggage at Dun Laoghaire, there are two suggestions. One is that the space at the seaward end of the pier should be used and that all the baggage should go down there. There is a space there occupied by a turn-table which the railway company do not use.  A shed could be built there and permanent counters installed. The luggage could pass through there and be examined, and the people could then come from that to the train.  The other alternative is that the whole of what I may call the arrival platform&mdash; the platform against which the steamer berths&mdash;should be used for Customs examination instead of only half.  This <Col N="1707" /> fence, which cuts the place in half, should be done away with and the train should be loaded on the other side.  I have been told that the railway companies object to this because the boats arrive and leave about the same time.  That is the sort of argument that has been accepted by Government Departments. In point of fact there are three hours between the arrival of the boat and the departure of the boat, and I imagine, even in time of pressure, that there will be ample margin.  This is a question which can be solved if there is a real intention to solve it.  It is one of the occasions on which the Minister would wish he had a Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this problem.  If he could depute somebody, or if he had time to take the matter in hands himself, and got the representatives of the railway companies and the public departments concerned round a table I believe it could be solved in less than three hours, and a real solution found, not merely a palliative like putting up shelters.  In any case I hope the Minister realises that the Christmas traffic is upon us and is likely to be heavy, and that the conditions are bound to be uncomfortable.  The conditions should be minimised by putting on as many searchers as possible, so that the people would get through quickly instead of being held up, as sometimes happens, for one and a half hours.  It was tolerable in the summer time with daylight.  Now it is dark and stormy.  I hope the Minister will see his way to make some concession in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to associate myself, not with all Deputy Cooper has said, but certainly with the causes of complaint he has mentioned.  Those who have any practical knowledge of the working of passenger and mail traffic at this pier know that the accommodation on the west side is entirely unsuitable.  At the west side of the pier, to which Deputy Cooper referred, the covered shed is only about 400 feet long, and the width, before the Customs regulations came into operation, 34 feet. That has been reduced to 20 feet, and after the conference held the other day &mdash;I do not know if it is responsible for <Col N="1708" /> what has been done&mdash;it has been further reduced by 3 feet 6 inches.  It is within the knowledge of travellers and others who use the pier that under the old arrangement, when passengers in excess of 400 had to be dealt with, accommodation on the west side of the pier was absolutely unsuitable and resulted in confusion, inconvenience and delay.  I suggest to the Minister that the whole question is an engineering one.  If there is any means by which the platform space on the west side of the pier can be extended or improved, there, I think, lies the real solution of the difficulty.  Deputy Cooper suggests that hand luggage should be searched on the passage between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire.  That suggestion was put forward before, and if the Minister is prepared to meet the necessary expenses involved, it is for him to say so.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, it would not meet the difficulty that exists.  I suggest that the engineer to the Board of Works and engineers of the companies interested in the development of traffic and the proper working of the pier, should be brought together and asked to try and devise a permanent solution of what is a very real difficulty.  There is another aspect of this case, and it is a very serious one.  This harbour was looked upon as the natural entrance to the Irish Free State for tourist traffic from England and elsewhere.  The reception afforded passengers, especially when there is a big crowd at the pier, is one that they would not like to undergo a second time.  People with hotels and boarding houses in Bray and Dun Laoghaire have suffered for the past five years for lack of tourist traffic. Any improvement in the arrangements for dealing with passengers would be welcome.  It would also help to remove the confusion that undoubtedly has occurred for the past two years, and particularly since the Customs regulations were enforced on the 1st April.  Apart from the Customs regulations, there are many things to be taken into consideration when dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press this point, not only in regard to the inconvenience to passengers at Dun Laoghaire, which is very great and liable to deflect passenger traffic to other places, <Col N="1709" /> perhaps to other countries, but also to the delays in the examination of parcels and the delay in examination of dutiable traffic of all kinds at the various ports.  From the information in my hands, that is especially so at Greenore. That is due to the insufficiency of the staff of the Customs.  Deputy Mahony or Deputy Good might be surprised if I were to say a word on behalf of the railway company, but in respect of Greenore, of which I have some information, it seems that the railway company, as a matter of fact, have gone to considerable expense in providing assistance, in the way of railway servants, to deal with this parcels traffic, to the extent, up to a month ago, of paying £150 a week in wages for this service. An insufficiency of Customs officers practically compelled the railway company to look for a reduction of that staff, leaving the commercial community at a loss because of still further delays in dealing with Customs traffic. There were bad arrangements there up to a month ago, and I do not think there has been any change for the better since.  I hope the Minister will be able to say definitely that the complaints that were made three weeks or a month ago no longer exist.  Up to that time the practice was that the Customs officials who did ordinary work in the day time entered upon the special work of examining consignments after hours, that work being paid for by the traders at overtime rates.  One week, for instance, on a Monday, there were 25 consignments cleared before 4 o'clock, and 16 after 4 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday 20 consignments were cleared before 4 o'clock, and 73 after 4 o'clock.  On Wednesday 14 consignments were cleared before 4 o'clock and 15 after 4 o'clock.  On Thursday 13 were cleared before 4 o'clock, and 7 after 4 o'clock.  On Friday 4 consignments were cleared before 4 o'clock, and 22 after 4 o'clock.  The railway companies have to pay the Customs people 4/- an hour overtime to examine dutiable goods after 4 o'clock.  That charge is thrown upon the companies and the public solely, because the staff for dealing with Customs matters is insufficient.  The consequence is very <Col N="1710" /> considerable delay in forwarding the traffic.  On a day in the early part of November, which is not the latest information that I have, there were 477 consignments, and some of them were waiting since last May to be dealt with. They were lying at Greenore uncleared, and the whole of the responsibility for that lay with the Customs.  It is quite evident that there is an accumulation of consignments, and that there is general dissatisfaction with the manner of dealing with them.  It is clear from facts placed before me that the service is being transferred in other directions and is going by other routes, and is coming by rail from Northern ports. The complaint in regard to Greenore may not be typical.  I hope it is not; but there have been complaints from Waterford, Cork and Dublin in regard to the delays to consignments and in the transportation of goods.  If it can be shown, as I am led to believe it can, that much of the delay is caused by the shortage of Customs officers then some improvement should be made by the appointment of a larger number of examiners.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE: (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Cooper gave in his notice in the form he did. He simply stated that he would draw attention to the Customs arrangements at Free State ports.  I was not sure if he meant to speak about Dun Laoghaire or on some question he had not raised before.,His form of notice amounts practically to no notice at all. It will be obvious that I could not, with such notice given me that a matter would be raised on the adjournment, have any details about Greenore or other places.  A Minister can only give satisfactory answers on any matter raised on the adjournment if he is given reasonable notice, and if something fairly specific is mentioned so that if it is a matter about which facts can be brought forward, he can have some opportunity of getting them.  I answered a question in regard to Greenore, and I know there was a serious failure on the part of the rail way company in giving us the facilities we were entitled to at Greenore. The only weapon we would have would be to refuse to recognise the <Col N="1711" /> place at all, and so shut down the traffic, and we could in that way get the facilities which up to this we have not had.  We have not got the facilities from the railway company at Greenore that we should have got. Further than that I cannot say at the moment, without having some notice of the matter.  The Dun Laoghaire case is really a matter for engineers.  There are remedies that could be applied there, but they would cost very considerable sums indeed.  Some remedy that would be cheap, and still quite a sufficient remedy, is a matter that is being looked into.  I certainly desire to do everything possible to facilitate the work there, and everything I can do will be done; but I will not be rushed into any costly scheme until I see that it cannot be done more cheaply.  I have taken all the steps that I consider necessary at the moment.  I have had a conference of people interested, and I have given instructions to have the matter examined. It has been examined to some extent and is still under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that an important aspect of the situation has been lost sight of.  Owing to the congestion on the pier arising from the examination of luggage, it is very difficult for persons meeting children to get on to the pier.  That is a very important matter, particularly coming to the Christmas season, when a number of youngsters are coming home.  I understand that the existing arrangement is that if one wants to get on to the pier one has to apply to the Harbour Master's office for permission, and in that way get a ticket.  I am told that such applications have been refused on account of congestion on the pier, so that, from that point of view, I think it is <Col N="1712" /> absolutely essential that the examination of luggage should be removed altogether, if possible, in order that accommodation might be given to those other people, for whom I think it will be generally agreed some form of accommodation should be provided.  This matter has been engaging the attention of some of the commercial bodies in the city, and I think they came to the conclusion that the practical solution of the difficulty would be to do away with the examination at Dun Laoghaire altogether, and let a similar method to that which Deputy Cooper has referred to be adopted at Dún Laoghaire as in the case of passengers arriving at Dover and going through to London.  The examination of luggage should be done away with at Dun Laoghaire and should take place at Westland Row.</P>
      <P>Accommodation could be easily provided there, and the work done in a much more expeditious way than at the moment.  It is quite obvious that a certain amount of examination of luggage would still be necessary at Dun Laoghaire, for a number of people leave the pier there and go to places in the South, but that would be only a small portion of the amount of luggage going through.  If the other method were adopted the greater part of the difficulty could be got over.  I hope this matter will be kept before the Minister, and some solution provided.</P>

      <P>The question of examination at Westland Row is one of the suggestions that has been considered. That would involve expense and delay.  A number of people might be going from Westland Row to different parts of the country, and it would involve difficulties for people who wanted to get down to Wicklow and Wexford.  All the suggestions put up here have been examined.  I do not see that better arrangements could be made, but the matter is under examination. It is impossible to find a way that would satisfy everybody.  In fact it is impossible to find a way that does not create some new inconvenience.  I believe it is impossible to allow people on he pier in any numbers without making congestion very much worse.  There could be arrangements such as having an examination in Dun Laoghaire somewhere <Col N="1713" /> away from the pier.  I do not know whether there is space there or not.  I think the examination that is done at Dover is done at some considerable distance away from where the boat comes in.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is some hundreds of yards away.  Perhaps some arrangement could be made that would do away with the bringing of trains on to the pier.  I assure the Deputies that they are not full of new suggestions that nobody else ever thought of, and that the various suggestions that have been put forward <Col N="1714" /> raised their own difficulties.  I can only promise that the matter will be kept under consideration.</P>

      <P>I will take that into consideration, but I believe it would be difficult to allow any considerable number of people on the pier.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he has received a report from the Carlow Military Authorities concerning the case of John Donnelly, of Castle Hill, Carlow, who was brought out at night and threatened to be shot by National Troops and Officers in uniform for a remark alleged to have been made by him to another, and which both denied; whether, seeing that this incident has ruined the chance of this man earning a livelihood in Carlow, in which he has been resident for over 16 years, that he has now been idle for over 15 months, the case will be re-considered with a view to granting adequate compensation for his losses?</P>

      <P>I have received a report of the incident referred to. Donnelly was taken out at night-time and cautioned in connection with statements alleged to have been made by him regarding the death of General Collins.  I am not aware that the incident has ruined his chance of earning a livelihood in Carlow.  He left his employment of his own free will.  The case is not one in which compensation can be awarded.</P>
