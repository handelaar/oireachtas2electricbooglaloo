      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance what arrangements, if any, are made to provide that persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts who join the Army are kept in full credit in respect of their period of service so that they will be entitled to receive sickness and disablement benefit on their discharge, and their wives to receive maternity benefit during and after their husband's Army service; and what is the position of an insured person as regards payment of sickness or disablement benefit in respect of sickness or disability arising during Army service.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether his attention has been called to the request of the Navan Rural District Council, made in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Resolved:</i>&mdash;&ldquo;That the Local Government Department be asked to issue the balance of the loan for building the fourteen labourers' cottages remaining unbuilt under the Labourers' Order of 1911, as there is very urgent need for providing houses in the district.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution of the Navan Rural District Council has been brought to my notice.  The resumption of State aid for rural housing is receiving the attention of the Government.  In cases where loans had been sanctioned under the Labourers' Acts during the British Administration, but had not been fully issued, owing to the financial stringency arising out of the European War, representations have been made to the British Treasury with the object of securing that the unissued balances may be made available.  An early settlement of this question is expected, and the application of the Navan Rural District Council will then receive full consideration.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Fisheries whether it is his intention to estimate the amount of money required for loans to make the Irish fishing fleet efficient, and also what grants would be required for the immediate necessary improvements of the harbours used for fishing purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Fionan Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making provision in my estimate for the granting of small supplementary loans, in approved cases, for the refitting of fishing vessels, the owners of which, owing to the period of depression through which the industry has been passing, have been unable to maintain their craft in an efficient condition. I wish it, however, to be understood that such special loans will only be granted where the applicant can satisfy the Ministry that he is prepared to make special efforts to reduce the arrears in respect of former loans.  When I state that these arrears on fishery loans total to something like £40,000, I think the Deputy will agree that, until we have done something to improve marketing conditions, it would not be wise to embark upon heavy expenditure in the improvement of the existing fishing fleet, or the provision of additional tonnage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards fishery harbours, schemes for the improvement of certain harbours <Col N="1301" /> which urgently need attention are under consideration.  It is, however, to be borne in mind that any expenditure by Government, through this Ministry, in such a case would be dependent upon the measure of financial support which the local authorities were prepared to give to any approved scheme.  I feel that there would be no object served by preparing an estimate of the total sum required for the improvement of fishery harbours, as it would run to a very large amount; and this is really not a matter that can be dealt with <i>in globo.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>POSTMASTER-GENERAL (Mr. J.J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that prior to the year 1912 two regular boy messengers were employed in the delivery of telegrams at Oldcastle, but in that year the positions were abolished, and the delivery provided for by casual messengers.  In 1917 the Sub-Postmaster was granted an allowance for providing for the work, and this is the present arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Sub-Postmaster states that he employs two messengers and two bicycles on the delivery, and that telegrams are not delayed through lack of bicycles.</P>
      <P>The messengers being in the employment of the Sub-Postmaster are not supplied with uniform, and they are not eligible for appointment as postmen. Regular boy messengers in the service of the Department are, if qualified, provided with established appointments as postmen or in other capacities when they reach the age of 19 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> Similar arrangements for telegraph delivery obtain at some other offices.  I am having renewed inquiry made in the case of Oldcastle, and if any improvement in the present delivery system at that office is warranted it will be effected.</P>

    <P>The following stood in the name of Mr. Darrell Figgis: To ask the Minister for Fisheries if he is aware that the Irish fishing industry is at the present moment in a perilous state; if one of the contributory causes to this is that the railway freights for fish are very high; if, in most countries that have a fishing industry to nurture and cultivate, special freights and facilities are arranged for the cheap and rapid transit of fish; and if he will undertake to call a Conference representative of the industry and of Railway Boards to inquire into the possibility of such similar action being taken in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the fishing industry is in a bad state, and that one of the contributory causes is that the railway charges for transit of fish are very high.  The average increase on freights over Irish lines above the pre-war rates is about 50 per cent. for fresh fish, and 150 per cent. for cured fish, while the present through rates to Cross-Channel stations represent an average increase of about 62 per cent. on the pre-war figures.  It is the case that in some other countries special facilities <Col N="1310" /> for the rapid transit of fish are provided, and I believe I can arrange for a Conference on the subject as suggested by the Deputy.  I may say that within the past twelve months two meetings have taken place between railway representatives and officials concerned with fishery administration, and as a result certain reductions in rates have been secured.  It is obvious, however, that the present is hardly a favourable time to demand an increase in transit facilities from the companies.  The maintenance of the normal service is as much as we can hope for at present.</P>

      <P>I beg to ask leave of the Dáil to introduce this Bill, to have it printed, and read the first time.  It is &ldquo;a Bill to authorise certain Statutory Undertakings in Saorstát Eireann, to continue temporarily the increases authorised under recent Statutes in the Statutory Charges made <Col N="1311" /> by such undertakings respectively, and for other purposes connected therewith.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill applies to Tramways, Harbours, Docks and Port undertakings, and also Canals and Inland Navigation.  It was found, after the European War, that the maximum charges these undertakings were authorised to make were not sufficient to carry on, owing to the high cost of material and labour, and, accordingly, Acts were passed in the British Parliament that enabled the then British Ministry of Transport to authorise temporary increases in the charges then made.  The Orders made at that time by the Ministry of Transport will expire on the 15th of this month, and, having regard to the present conditions, it is proposed by this Bill to enable them to carry on as at present.  It may properly be described as a purely emergency measure to get over the next twelve months.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the first amendment.  The first three amendments on the Order paper stand or fall together, the second and third being consequential on the first.  The object of the first amendment is to impose some check upon the liability of abuse by the Sheriff of the new power he is acquiring, of taking the goods in execution for sale beyond the seas. Upon the last reading I tried to induce the Minister to leave out of the Bill the power to remove goods to England or elsewhere.  He gave his reasons for refusing, and I am free to admit that in the case of certain classes of chattels these reasons would be cogent ones under certain circumstances.  That does not, however, alter the fact that by putting an indiscriminate, unchecked power into the hands of the Sheriff to remove goods out of Ireland you are liable to inflict very great hardship on the debtor, I was trying to find the simplest way of getting some sort of control or check, and the method here proposed is an attempt to put down in writing what seems to be to be the simplest way, while I am willing to agree to any other method, so long as there is a check.  The object of this amendment is to prevent an execution creditor from sending goods outside of Ireland, cattle or other chattels, without first going to the local Justice and explaining to him the circumstances under which he thinks that this unusual step is necessary.  The proposal is that the creditor should do this in the simplest possible way by going, without any legal formalities or notice to the other side, to the Justice, and stating his case and satisfying the Justice that he could not get a proper sale of the goods in question in Ireland.  One could easily conceive the possibility of valuable goods being taken away on the ground that a better sale could be got elsewhere, and all this being done in haste and without <Col N="1313" /> proper consideration.  I desire to see some check imposed on arbitrary power which may become a danger.</P>

      <P>I do not think that if the amendment were accepted it would appreciably improve the position. An Under-Sheriff is the officer not of the District Justice's Court, but of the Higher Court, and to say that he, with his full knowledge of the circumstances and the discretion which he must be assumed to possess, by reason of his qualifications for the office, being an officer of a Higher Court, must go before a District Justice and show cause why he should take certain action, I do not think is a good proposal.  It is not in keeping with the dignity of the Higher Court to send an officer to explain or defend his action before a Lower Court.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the amendment is useful or necessary. We must assume certain discretion and certain probity on the part of the officers of our Administration, for if we do not, and if we are to simply set to work to legislate on the basis that these officers must be assumed to be either rogues or tyrants, then we would find our programme of legislation very crowded indeed.  Why will an Under-Sheriff attempt to take goods out of the country if he can get a reasonable sale within the country?  People do not go to these rounds or to that trouble, and if the answer is that he would do it for the purposes of fraud, then why not let him be prosecuted?  There is always a remedy against fraud or malicious action of this kind.  This amendment is not a practical one, and I do not recommend it to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the fourth amendment, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add in line 24, after the words &lsquo;breaking in&rsquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that before breaking into any dwelling house or other building the Under-Sheriff shall have made reasonable efforts to enter peaceably and without violence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to which I attach considerable importance, because on the last reading this Dáil gave the Sheriff&mdash;I think very wrongly&mdash;power to break into any dwelling house, be it that of a debtor or that of a third party, and gave him a complete indemnity for doing so.  I do not think that it is unreasonable to suggest that we must have in this Bill a clause insisting that before the Sheriff can break into anybody's house, be it debtor or third party, he must, like every other person, take the ordinary steps of knocking at the door and of ringing the bell.  I may be told that it is unnecessary, but we are living in strange times, and I should not like to give the Under-Sheriff the extraordinary power of going to a man's house and breaking in without further ado.  I press this amendment on the Dáil as being essential to prevent the risk of serious trouble in cases where you may have, not necessarily a bad Under-Sheriff, but an unsatisfactory substitute bailiff.  It is not the Under-Sheriff himself, but these bailiffs, these new gentlemen who are to be the substitutes for the hitherto qualified bailiffs, who can be sent to such and such a house, and these inexperienced gentlemen in certain cases may be tempted, and certainly are liable to take the law literally as they find it and break into the house.  I want to stop that.</P>

My suggestion would be to combine the object of that amendment with the object of the amendment of Deputy Gavan Duffy.  I would suggest this amendment in these or in similar terms:&mdash;&ldquo;To add at the end of Section 10: &lsquo;Provided, however, that (a) in any case where the Under-Sheriff shall break and enter the premises of a person other than the person against whom he has been called upon to enforce a judgment order or decree, he shall either have found any goods, animals, or other chattels of such last mentioned person therein or thereon or shall have reasonable grounds for believing that there were some such goods, animals, or chattels therein or thereon, and also (b) in every case he shall have made reasonable efforts to enter peacefully and without violence.&rdquo; If both the Deputies would consent to that interpretation of their wishes and accept that amendment as sufficiently embodying what they wish to secure, possibly the Dáil would allow that to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I move the following Amendment: At the end of Clause 10, to add:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided nevertheless that any Under-Sheriff who shall break and enter the premises of any person other than the person against whom he is called upon to enforce a judgment order or decree, and shall fail to find any goods, animals, or other chattels of the debtor thereon shall, notwithstanding any provision of this Act, be liable to an action for such breaking and entry, and for any injury occasioned thereby or in consequence thereof, unless he shall satisfy the Court or jury before whom such action shall be tried, that he had reasonable <Col N="1317" /> grounds for believing that there were goods, animals, or other chattels of the debtor upon the said premises.&rdquo; I had no intention when drafting this amendment of inviting or provoking actions against the Sub-Sheriffs or their officers. I think that the criticism is not unfair until you read the clause itself, and when you do so it appears to me that the wording of it makes the amendment in the form I have drafted it necessary, and prevents the suggestion of the Minister from having any effect at all, except the clause beginning &ldquo;that no action for damages or trespass shall lie against the Under-Sheriff.&rdquo; You start by taking away any right of action whatever, and the suggestion of the Minister does not give back the right of action that is taken away in the first clause.  It is necessary to provide that in certain events he should get that right back.  The suggestion of the Minister gave him back no right at all.  It was simply a provison, but it did not give the right back.  I do not think, in view of the wording of the clause, that the amendment can be read as inviting actions against the Sub-Sheriff.  You started by taking that right away.  The proviso is that if he breaks into the premises of a person other than the judgment debtor he shall be liable to an action, unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds for doing it.  It was stated by a well-known Sub-Sheriff so long ago now that he may not be very well known to all the members of this Dáil, because I am afraid I am amongst the very highest class in ranks of age here, that Sheriffs' bailiffs were not recruited from the ranks of the Archangels.  I make no charge against Sheriffs' bailiffs as a class or as individuals, but we all know that from the earliest times Sheriffs' bailiffs have been held up in literature and elsewhere as people who are not overflowing with the milk of human kindness.  The trade they follow makes it essential that they should be hard men, because they have to deal with every kind of fraudulent debtor, and the people with whom they have to deal are in the main people evading the payment of just debts, who have to be compelled in some way or other.  Of course, there are cases of hardship. The Sheriffs' bailiffs are up against a very hard lot, and it is not to be wondered that they are a very hard lot themselves. I desire to provide against any <Col N="1318" /> possibility of the Sheriffs' bailiffs, not through their own inherent vice, but through the nature of circumstances, and particularly to the possibility of their being used, without fault of their own, to satisfy private spite to the detriment of unfortunate people who are wholly innocent. Now, there would be nothing easier for a person who had a grudge against a next door neighbour when he saw the bailiff levelling distress in the street, than to say &ldquo;You will find goods in such and such a place,&rdquo; and off he goes, and the Sheriff's bailiffs break in the door on that information, maliciously given by that person, and that person whose door was broken in is left without any remedy whatsoever, although there may never have been any goods on his premises. Now, I think it ought to be up to the Sheriff's bailiff, when he breaks into a person's premises and finds nothing there, if the person whose premises were broken in chooses to have a shot at him, that he should be in a position to satisfy the Court, or whoever he goes before, that he had reasonable grounds for believing he would find something on the premises.  I do not think that is an invitation to bring bogus actions.  If such actions are brought, and if those who bring them are beaten, the costs will have to be paid any way.  People will not bring actions and run the risk of being involved in costs.  I do not think it is unfair to say that a man who has reasonable ground for action against a Sheriff should be precluded from bringing it.  And unless you put in a proviso such as I have here the first lines of the section take away that right of action, and nothing gives it back.  I do press you not to reject this amendment, and if the Ministry do not accept it, though I do not like going to divisions, I will ask this Dáil to say that this is not an unfair protection to give to an innocent man, because remember he must be innocent if the Sheriff finds no goods in his place.  It is only in the case of breaking and entering in which nothing is found, and the Sheriff is unable to give reasonable grounds for breaking and entering, that any action can succeed.  I know there is a party in this Dáil who think that this section is so water-tight that it cannot be amended at all, but surely if any amendment can be produced to mitigate the <Col N="1319" /> hardships of which they complain they ought not to vote against it, and I think any person here who contemplates the possibility of a Sheriff coming down and breaking into his premises for the purpose of levying a distress for a debt due by somebody else ought to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>The section, no doubt, takes away a right.  The amendment which I suggested provides an exception to that it provides that in certain circumstances the right shall not be taken away.  Whether it is better to take away a right and then proceed by an amendment definitely to give it back, or, taking away a right, to proceed to say that in certain definite circumstances that provision shall not have effect, is, of course, an abstruse question which we need not delay on.  My suggestion was to add to Section 10 an amendment in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided, however, that in any case where the Under-Sheriff shall break and enter the premises of a person other than a person against whom he has been called upon to enforce a judgement order or decree, he shall either have found any goods, animals, or such other chattels of such last mentioned person therein or thereon, or shall have had reasonable grounds for believing that there were some such goods, animals, or chattels therein or thereon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, that the provisions of Section 10 should not apply unless there was a fulfilment of the terms set out in that amendment.  I do think that that is a better angle to approach the matter from than the angle set out in the Deputy's amendment.  It is necessary that even the most timid Under-Sheriff should not be deterred from the performance of his duty, or the performance of his full duty.  To the timid man the language of the Deputy's amendment is menacing.  It is simply a matter of the effect on his mind of the two.  I submit that an Under-Sheriff who simply sees set out a positive statement that he shall be liable to an action might be very much impressed, but if he sees it is set in a negative way, that no action shall lie provided that so and so&mdash;in other <Col N="1320" /> words, that there is good faith on his part, reasonable grounds for believing that the goods of the judgment debtor are in fact in those premises, that is something he understands, something that will not have the same menacing or terrifying effect on his mind.  I do not feel impelled by my light of reason to accept the Deputy's amendment.  I much prefer my own suggestion.</P>

There is no cause of action in the words just read by the Minister, and, even if there were, there is still this substantial difference between the two amendments, that Deputy Fitzgibbon puts upon the Sheriff, who alone knows what is in his mind, the proof of whether he had reasonable cause or not, whereas the Minister puts it upon the debtor, who cannot know what is in the Sheriff's mind&mdash;to prove positively whether the Sheriff had reasonable cause or not.  Obviously the reasonable thing is to make the Sheriff prove whether he had reasonable grounds or not.</P>

The Minister read the words of his amendment, and I listened to them very carefully. I could find no words in his amendment giving back anything whatsoever. His amendment provides for certain cases.  He does not say what is going to happen when those cases arise.  He does not say that when the Under-Sheriff acts without reasonable ground an action shall lie.

      <P>My amendment is to insert a new Section before Section 15.  It has nothing to do with Section 14 or 15.  It is simply the introduction of new matter into the Bill.  It is to enable a County Court Judge before whom an action is tried, where he is satisfied that a defendant is honestly unable to pay the full amount of his debts without any default on his own part, to put a stay on the execution, either upon the decree or upon the levying of the amount of the decree.  It was agreed on all sides, both on the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage, that it gave Sheriff officers very new and terrible powers, and particularly that of levying immediate execution after a decree.  Now it seems not unreasonable that where some unfortunate judgment debtor against whom a decree is passed is unable to satisfy judgment by immediate payment, and his inability is due to no act or fault of his own, that some stay might be placed by a judicial authority on judicial grounds against the immediate execution of that decree.  At the present time, whether through oversight or not I do not know, the County Court Judge has no power to give a stay of execution on his decree, with the one exception of an ejectment order for non-payment of rent. High Court Judges have that power. There the County Court Judge has, under an Act passed in 1887, power to give a stay, and enable a tenant to pay his rent by instalments if he thinks fit, and prevent him being put out of his holding  In no other case can the County Court Judge put on any stay. They have been avoiding that in some cases, but not always by what is contrary to Magna Charta by delaying justice, and the County Court Judge who thinks it might not be proper to grant an immediate execution takes the drastic and, I venture to suggest, illegal course of refusal to hear a case at all, and of throwing it over to the next sessions. <Col N="1326" /> That may be attaining the ends of justice&mdash;but it brings justice into contempt when you have to attain its ends by illegality, and it is not conducive to respect for judicial tribunals when you have to try and find an excuse for injustice by another injustice, and by refusing to hear a litigant who comes before you. Now, another case in which it operates unfairly is this: two people may have claims against some man.  One goes into the High Courts and gets a decree with a stay of execution.  The other goes into the County Court, but the County Court Judge adjourns the case to the next Sessions.  It is not tried, because if the Judge had tried it he could not give a stay of execution.  Now, suppose the debtor becomes bankrupt, one man has a perfectly good decree, but the other has not, and the principle in bankruptcy is that as decrees are given they rank, and therefore one man who has obtained his decree will be able to get judgment over the other man, who took the more suitable and more economic course of going through the County Court.  It does not seem unreasonable that County Court Judges should have the same power as High Court Judges in granting a stay of execution, and I think it is quite reasonable that they should have power to grant an order for payment by instalments.  That is a power they do not possess, but is a power that is possessed by the High Court.  I have framed this clause not entirely out of my own head, nor is it my own invention.  I went to the Act of Parliament which already gives power to stay executions&mdash;that is, the Land Act, which deals with cases of ejectments&mdash;and I have modified the provisions so as to deal with any case that may arise.  The clause has three divisions:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Upon the hearing of any civil bill for debt or damages, if the County Court Judge before whom the proceedings are pending is satisfied that the defendant is unable to satisfy by an immediate payment in full the judgement and costs, and that such inability does not arise from his own conduct, act, or default, and that there is reasonable ground for granting an extension of time to pay, the County Court Judge may put a stay upon the execution of the judgment or decree of the Court, or upon the execution of the writ of <i>fieri facias</i> for such time as the County Court Judge <Col N="1327" /> thinks reasonable, and the County Court Judge may, if he thinks fit, order that the amount of such judgment or decree and the costs shall be paid by such instalments as the County Court Judge may appoint.</P>
    <P>(2)  If the County Court Judge is of opinion that the defendant can pay the first of such instalments forthwith, he shall so order.  If default is made in complying with the order of the Court for the payment of the first or any subsequent instalment, the stay upon the execution of the judgment or decree, or upon the execution of the writ of <i>fieri facias</i>, shall be removed, and it may thereupon be executed forthwith.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall not apply to any judgment or decree given or pronounced before the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;County Court Judge&rdquo; includes a Recorder and the Judge of a borough.</P>
    <P>Sub-Clause (3) provides against going back and raking up decrees that have been given some years ago.  I understand the Government do not desire that this legislation should be retrospective. I have an objection myself to retrospective legislation, which is generally unfair, and which, I think, ought only to be resorted to in extreme cases.  I do not think this is an extreme case, and I do not think that where decrees are already given it would be reasonable, after a period, to come into Court and secure a stay in order to have an instalment order made.  The last part of the section provides that the County Court Judge should include a Recorder.</P>

      <P>I only wish to express my regret that sub-section 3 is in this amendment.  From what the Deputy has told us it is clear that County Court Judges have been unable, even when they wished, to prevent the granting of judgments to people who might execute them at once.  There might be cases of injustice in the past few years where the judge would have been very glad to stay execution if he could, but the Deputy has told us that he could not do it.  I fail to see why, now that you <Col N="1328" /> are making discrimination, you should not extend the benefit of the right to claim the stay of execution to the man against whom judgment was given before this Act came into force.  In the case of higher court judgments there was no question of the judge's right but in the case of County Court judgments the Judge himself could not prevent the creditors from executing.  Surely that is not fair.  Why not put the two things on a level now?  If it is right to do it now in respect of future judgments, it it is right to do it for past judgments where a judge could not help himself and stay execution.  I am against this sub-section and hope that the Deputy will not insist upon it.</P>

      <P>I think that if Deputy Fitzgibbon had not added sub-section 3 it would not appear that he was definitely in favour of its insertion.  I am astonished and gratified at hearing the Minister accept this amendment because I gathered from the earlier stages of the discussion that this was not a Bill to interfere with or enlarge the powers of the Court.  It had to do with the execution of the decrees of the Courts, and I want to suggest that it would have been very much wiser if the object sought for had been obtained by legislation enlarging the powers of the Courts and giving them this privilege to make discrimination between the classes of cases than to give special powers to a special executive authority which would enforce the decrees of these Courts in these special cases.  The effect of paragraph 3 is going to limit very greatly the value of the new section. Since we met last I have received a communication indicating very clearly the kind of case which I fear may <Col N="1329" /> arise very frequently and, given the right or wrong kind as the case may be of a sub-sheriff, the effect of such cases would be very bad indeed.  There are four small traders in a town in Co. Longford. Their premises were looted and their business destroyed by Crown forces in November, 1920.  Their claims were heard but they have received no money. Decrees were granted but they have no money and no recompense of any kind has yet been paid.  Against one of these four traders there are three writs and one civil bill served on him for goods, the greater portion of which were looted by 29 Black and Tans in November, 1920. To show the particular kind of man, and his desire to meet the legitimate claims, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I sold a field in May for £200, and divided it among my creditors. Judgement marked for so and so and costs in the Sheriff's hands at present.&rdquo; He wants to know if it would be possible to stay proceedings against him, and men like him, until their compensation claims are paid, when they would be glad to pay what they owe.  In this case there is compensation coming to them some day.  We are now telling the Sub-Sheriffs to go ahead and execute the decrees by any means they wish, and dispose of the proceeds in any manner they choose.  If this section had been inserted without Sub-section 3 it might be possible for these men to go to the courts and ask for some kind of a review of their case and for a stay of execution, but now they are in danger of a decree being enforced, their goods being sold and the men being driven into bankruptcy, and there is nothing to prevent it as things are at present.  That is just an illustration regarding traders.  I have reason to believe that there is a very large number of farmers in the country entirely unaffected by the stress and strife, who are in a somewhat similar position because of certain circumstances economical, political and military, but we are going to leave them at the mercy of creditors who, enabled in this case to use the instruments set up with greatly increased powers are going to drive these debtors into bankruptcy.  The acceptance of the new section is a very valuable improvement to the Bill, but a great part of its value is, as I have already stated, lost by the insertion of Sub-section 3, and I hope that before this Bill becomes an <Col N="1330" /> Act, some way will be found to delete that Sub-section.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section 2, line 63, to insert after the word &lsquo;and,&rsquo; and before the word &lsquo;shall,&rdquo; the words &lsquo;its provisions, except Sections 5 and 6 thereof.&rsquo;&rdquo; As printed here, 5 and 6 should read 4 and 5.  These two Clauses of the Bill I wish to propose shall not be limited to six months, but shall form part of the ordinary law.  These sections are wrongly numbered as they appear on the Order Paper, and should be 4 and 5. The Dáil will remember that when this Bill was in Committee a clause was accepted directing the Sheriff to give an inventory of the goods seized to the debtor; another clause was accepted increasing from £5 to £10 the amount of bedding, tools of trade, and wearing apparel which the debtor might keep immune from the creditor.  I ask that these two sections become part of the general law.  They are not particularly appropriate to the Bill, and everyone realises that they ought to be part of the ordinary law of the land.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses authorised to be incurred under any Act of the present Session for the salaries and allowances of District Justices, and for making good any deficiency in the Petty Sessions Clerks' Fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is authorisation from the Governor-General for this.  This resolution is rendered necessary, as the Dáil understands, to give authorisation for the funds required for this Act.  I suppose there is no necessity for discussing it at any length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this is put I would like to raise a question as to why we should consider this formality necessary. It was passed over on the last <Col N="1332" /> occasion, and I have no doubt a case could be made out for it by quoting the example of the British House of Commons, and British practice, but it seems to me we ought not automatically to fall into this procedure unless there are substantial grounds for doing so.  I tried to understand why such a procedure is necessary in England, and so far as I could understand it, it is only necessary because of practice having its roots in a bad past, and there is absolutely no necessity for it here.  We have a Constitution which very clearly says that the Governor-General is going to act on the advice of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That provision does not apply in England, and it is because of the old relationships between the Crown and the Parliament that some such provision of this kind was found in practice to be desirable to prevent evils, abuses, on the part of the Crown.  That practice has persisted over there, because of the unwritten Constitution.  I think it is not desirable, in any respect, that we should simply fall automatically into the practices of the House of Commons at Westminster, but if we are going to adopt its forms, and many of them are desirable, we should only do so when we are convinced that there is reason for it.  In this case, so far as I can see, there is no reason for it, and while I do not want to press the matter very strongly at present, I would urge upon the President the desirability of making a case, satisfying himself and satisfying the Dáil that it is essential to the proper conduct of affairs that such a resolution must be passed, before the Committee stage of a Bill is entered on.  Think what it means ! We are supposed to give authorisation for the expenditure of certain moneys&mdash; amount not stated&mdash;which may be necessary to be spent, if a certain thing happens in the future, to wit the passing of an Act of Parliament.  Surely, it is clear that the passing of the Act is an indication of the intention of the Dáil that the money shall be provided.  To fall, as I said, automatically into this procedure which requires a resolution containing a promise that we will vote certain moneys for certain purposes, undefined, seems to me to be without any warrant or justification.  If it is necessary that such resolution of Ways and Means should be passed&mdash;if it is not considered enough that the passing of an Act <Col N="1333" /> by the Dáil is automatically an assurance that we are prepared to vote the money&mdash;then such a resolution ought only to come before us when the Act has gone through, or when it is at its final stage.  There is nothing in our Constitution that requires this procedure, and unless there is good justification, that is not explainable in anything I have been able to read, I think we ought not to follow this procedure in the future, and I would hope if such resolution has to be moved at any time in the future that the President would explain the reasons for it and satisfy the Dáil that these reasons are good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in accordance with Article 37 of the Constitution that this particular procedure that has been put into operation here has had to be put forward.  The article says:&mdash;&ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a message from the representative of the Crown, acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, in this case this particular Bill is to that extent, so far as the money is concerned, a Money Bill.  Members here have on various occasions exhibited some jealousy with regard to the rights of the Dáil.  I think the rights of the Dáil are even recognised in the Constitution, as far as Money Bills are concerned. This particular Bill that is under consideration would conflict with Article 37 of the Constitution, because by law money would be expended which had not been the subject of a message from the representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>You have the message, but in addition to the message you require the authorisation.  I do not know where the Comptroller and Auditor-General would find his justification for making the payments in respect to this if he had not got that justification by the resolution that we have to pass.  It may be that I am not, perhaps, interpreting the point that has been made by the Deputy correctly; but, as I see the situation, first of all money&mdash; and this Bill contemplates the expenditure of money&mdash;shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution, or law <Col N="1334" /> which has not been recommended by a message.  It would amount to this in essence that you have to put the responsibility on the Executive Council for bringing forward finance matters in the Dáil.  The Constitution reserves to the Executive Council that right.  If the Executive Council, in the exercise of its wisdom, were not to bring forward here for approval by the Dáil money resolutions, it would be a very serious infringement on the rights of the Dáil.  I do not know what proposals are embodied in the Standing Orders with regard to money votes or resolutions, or other things of that sort.  I think that matter is under consideration.  There is, as far as I am aware, no express provision in the Standing Orders at the moment for matters of this kind, and in the absence of any other procedure adopted by the Dáil for dealing with matters of this kind, I do not know that there is any other course open than the one we have adopted&mdash;the message, the resolution, and so on.</P>

      <P>(1)  It shall be lawful for the Governor-General of the Irish Free State on the advice of the Executive Council, from time to time to appoint fit and proper persons, being Barristers-at-Law in Saorstát Eireann or Solicitors of the Supreme Court in Saorstát Eireann, to be magistrates, with the title of &ldquo;District Justices,&rdquo; and to perform the duties and have the powers prescribed by this Act.</P>

As it reads in the sub-section proposed, it allows varying salaries for different Justices. I do not know whether that is the intention of the Minister, but if it is not, I suggest that it is better to provide for a scale of salaries and allowances rather than have a mere chance decision of the Minister.</P>

      <P>It seems to <Col N="1340" /> me that while it is expedient to create this sort of subordinate official, and to give him these powers&mdash;it will be a great relief to the District Justice&mdash;that the title &ldquo;Parish Commissioner,&rdquo; though of its nature a descriptive term, fails utterly to describe the character of the office. He is the Justice of the Peace of former days with the very important exception that he does not adjudicate upon the bench.  He is &ldquo;Commissioner of the Peace,&rdquo; but if you style him &ldquo;Parish Commissioner&rdquo; it does suggest, I think, a parallel with Urban Commissioner, Commissioner of Trade, and so on.  In other words Commissioner is a title associated in our minds with functions of a far higher grade, and of a much greater importance than those.  When you study what his main duties are in relation to the Justice you find he is a sort of coadjutor&mdash;I am borrowing a term from the Church&mdash;to the District Justice. He remits to the District Justice and in England there is the title used of &ldquo;Committing Magistrate,&rdquo; and in a sense this officer is to be a remitting magistrate, but the whole position is so subordinate that I once more beg the Minister to give the office a less ambitious title.</P>

      <P>I am not particularly bigotted in favour of the term &ldquo;Parish Commissioner,&rdquo; but it is a question of the lack of any better suggestion. It must be remembered that this is an honorary position, and it might be no harm seeing that the position is honorary that the title should be somewhat high-sounding in the complete absence of anything else to commend it.  We thought of Local Commissioner and so on, but if you call him Commissioner there are so many Commissioners, Commissioner for Oaths, Land Commissioner, etc.  Commissioner is in a way a fairly accurate description, because he deals largely with the taking of affidavits, signing of warrants, the administering of Oaths, committing dangerous lunatics, signing certificates for the admission of pauper lunatics, etc.  What we wanted to emphasise was the refusal to go back to the honorary magistrates of the past where people subject to local prejudice had the task of administering the law. I think while I would welcome any <Col N="1341" /> other suggestion that my own view would be to adhere to the present title.</P>

As the clause stands it would be lawful for the District Justice to remand such persons until the next District Court to be held at some place, notwithstanding that eight days will have elapsed before the holding of such next District Court.  It might be that a month will elapse.  There is no limit, as the clause stands, to the time that the person may be kept in prison without being brought before a Court.  It has been considered for many generations desirable that there should be some public proof that the prisoner who is arrested and not tried still lives, and that even if the prosecution is not ready to pursue the case against him, still the prisoner shall be presented and a remand granted.  Now we are removing that according to the Bill, and leaving it to the Justices to decide when the prisoner shall be brought forward without any limit of time.  The limit of eight days hitherto prevailing is being removed.  I think the objection to that is the difficulty which will arise by virtue of the fact that the District Justice will not be sitting in Court in these particular places <Col N="1342" /> more than twice a month.  He will be sitting in his district, and the object of the amendment is to ensure that the prisoner shall be brought forward to some Court in some part of the district within a reasonable period.

      <P>I was rather precipitate in accepting Deputy Johnson's amendment just now.  It would be very difficult to draw up a scale of payment on the question of clerks' remuneration. It is not the same thing as District Justices. It will depend very much upon a variety of circumstances, such as the number of districts assigned to each clerk and the distance between these places and so on.  There will be considerations affecting the clerks which would make it very difficult to arrive at anything like uniformity in the matter of remuneration, and from my own experience of the thing up to the present I should say it is very much a matter simply of dealing with each particular case.  You cannot say the remuneration would be so many pounds.  Clerks having three areas and three courts in their charge, might have them clustered quite close together in the case of one man, in a certain area, while in the case of another man in another area, for instance, in the West of Ireland, they may be very far distant from one another.  There are a variety of circumstances like that, that would make the adoption of a definite scale a difficult matter.</P>

      <P>Very good.  The first part deals with a matter which provides against any misunderstanding on the part of the Dáil.  The continual insertion of the Office of the Ministry of Finance is not an overdose of that. It is the Dáil's security for the control of funds and having a particular person responsible rather than having the responsibility distributed over a number of Ministers.  For example, in connection with Dáil funds, although a particular Minister may have a fund under his control, the details and the distribution is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, and it is for that purpose I am <Col N="1345" /> moving these amendments, and accordingly, therefore, I move the first part now.</P>

It appears that there is power under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1881, to supplement the Petty Sessions Fund by transferring money out of the fund made up of the proceeds of the Dog Tax, and it is conceivable that this particular clause as it stands would prejudice that right.

      <P>The intention of this amendment is to ensure that the temporary nature of this Bill will be quite definite.  It is called &ldquo;The Temporary Provisions Bill,&rdquo; and the suggestion is that in the ordinary course of events it should expire in twelve months.  The period is immaterial as far as I am concerned, but I want to make sure that this is a temporary Bill and I am rather more concerned with that aspect of it, because I do not want to prejudice the decision of the Judiciary Committee regarding the relations of the Judiciary with the Executive Council.  I was rather alarmed with the view taken by the Minister in discussing this matter before, and his conception of the proper relations between the Executive Council and the Judiciary, even subordinate Judiciary. While it may be quite acceptable for a temporary Bill to allow a Justice to be removable at the discretion of the political Executive for the time being, I think it would be very undesirable to have that a permanent provision, hence the desire to make it quite clear that it is a temporary Bill.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment, although I do not think that the words &ldquo;for one year&rdquo; are quite what the Deputy intended. We were assured that this measure was to fill a void pending the results to ensue upon the findings of the Judiciary Committee. What I spoke on Section 2 of the Bill on the Second Reading I spoke with the full intention of evoking an <Col N="1350" /> opinion from this Dáil as to what ought to be the tenure of office arranged for District Justices.  I may have been so bent upon emphasising what ought to be as to have forgotten for the moment that this was a temporary measure.  It is most desirable in view of our having passed, without any qualification whatever, Sub-section 2 of Section 1 that no opportunity should be missed for emphasising the purely temporary character of the measure.  It seems to me that unless that is done and unless what Deputy Johnson has just done be done by the Dáil our action may be interpreted as favouring a doctrine that because a District Justice is only a superior type of Justice of the Peace he might hold without any detriment to the public advantage this minor office at the discretion of the Ministry.  With a great deal that the Minister for Home Affairs said on this point I throughly agree.  It is eminently desirable that there should be some check upon the exercise of their functions vested in the Ministry that they should be subject to review and criticism in this Dáil, but I suggested and would again suggest that this Dáil ought to record the view that while ample provision is made for such consideration for the discharge of their duties as may be rendered necessary still that the absolutely final dismissal from office should not vest in the Ministry because of the political possibilities that I outlined on a former occasion, but that a rota of judges should be set up.  I thought of indicating that rota in a Schedule, so I support the amendment to keep this emphatically a temporary measure&mdash;preferably a measure functioning only until the Judiciary Committee has finally settled the matter&mdash;so that our meaning here be not misconstrued.  I think it would be a hardship if the gentlemen whose names are set out in the Third Schedule were to be left under the impression that this Dáil was wholly satisfied to make them tenants at will of that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEAN MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very reluctant at all times to prolong discussion here unnecessarily, but this morning's Press relates an incident in my constituency of a serious and, I think, most appalling nature, and I think that I would be neglecting my duty as representative <Col N="1354" /> of that constituency, if I did not take the first opportunity that presented itself in this Assembly to concentrate, in so far as it is possible, the attention of the Dáil and public opinion upon that incident.  We have been accustomed for some time past to strange and startling events.  We have gradually become habituated to occurrences that a few years ago we considered foreign to the temperament of this country, and foreign to conceptions (f how to resolve our political differences. Many things have occurred that have surprised and pained us, but I do not think anything has occurred since anarchy challenged authority in this country so appalling as that which is related in to-day's Press.  Appalling, I think, is no term of exaggeration by which to refer to this event.  I do not know how far the daily Press has stated the exact truth of this occurence.  I should be very glad indeed to read that it was wholly untrue, or that it had been largely exaggerated, but it stated that yesterday morning about 8 a.m. a gang of 80 armed men swept down upon a little town in County Cavan and proceeded to engage in one of those exploits which horrify not only this country, but humanity, or at least the civilised world when it becomes aware of them&mdash;one of those exploits which was rather a common occurrence during the Black and Tan regime in Ireland, before the Treaty of peace between Ireland and Great Britain put an end to their regime of terrorism.  &ldquo;Two civilians were shot dead and one injured in such a way that his life may be jeopardised; houses and business premises were fired and destroyed, and a wild panic followed amongst the inhabitants, as the murderers proceeded with their work. Women and children ran hither and thither seeking refuge from the flying bullets and bomb splinters.&rdquo; Now the reason I have raised this question is mainly to give the Government an opportunity of stating if these particulars, as related in the columns of the Press, are actual facts or are wild exaggerations. I do not know if there is any element in this country prepared to stand over such hideous proceedings as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have drifted a long, long way in Ireland from that standard of judgment which was supposed to be in existence <Col N="1355" /> when a prominent personage in this country stated there was a Constitutional way of resolving our differences; let us not depart from it.  I want to know&mdash;I would be glad to know, but no one in this Dáil can inform me&mdash;if the personage who gave utterance to that sentiment believes that what happened at Ballyconnell is a constitutional way of resolving our differences.  But this episode&mdash;at least the particulars as set forth&mdash;if true &mdash;are a startling revelation upon the vital need of standing by the authority that means&mdash;is determined&mdash;to bring back the nation from these frightful excesses to the constitutional ways of settling differences of opinion.  I have said nothing in this Dáil, I think, up to the present, that could be construed as harsh criticism of the Government.  I do not intend to say anything now.  Their task has been one which no man need envy.  It has been a task that would have taxed to a supreme degree the calibre, qualities and the resources of any set of men, for they have had not only to take over the machinery of Government, but also to utilise it in a certain sense through improvised methods, and that, too, at a time when not merely their authority, but the whole principle of representative Government was challenged by men, or by persons, who regarded the ballot box as a very, very inferior apparatus to that of the bomb or the bullet.  Therefore, I say, they have had a task of supreme difficulty, and no word of mine shall add to their difficulty.  But I do think that it requires some explanation&mdash;some information&mdash;as to why the town&mdash;not a very large town, in the sense, say, of a large metropolis like Dublin, or of a city like Cork, but a town of considerable importance in the values of county towns, a very considerable centre of county life &mdash;as to why eighty marauders could sweep down, take human life, bomb and fire certain buildings and create general panic and consternation amongst the people.  I have no wish, by asking these questions, to say or do anything that would create embarrassment of a Government that is already beset with embarrassments that would try the heart and the brain of any set of men.  But I do say that incidents like these make us realise this, that if turbulence is to be quelled, that if these elements that are prepared to destroy human life, property <Col N="1356" /> and civilisation, are to be combatted, then the Government must call to their aid, and must have at their disposal, all the resources that this nation can provide, and the one thing that will stand out as a moral from this incident is this, that if the resources already at the disposal of the Government are not adequate to meet the dangers with which the people are confronted then the people will not stand to be shot down like dogs by gangs of marauders, but will have to take ways and means of providing for their own protection from the assaults of these assassins.  This incident, I say, is an appalling one.  I hope it is not an indication that this is the next stage of the campaign to intimidate this nation from asserting its rights.  At least, I think it would be well if we here in this Assembly regarded it as such, and if the Goverment regarded it as such, and took steps to meet such an attack upon life from the ranks of the nation, and made these assassins, and all that they stand for, realise that this nation has endured too much to be beaten now, and that the people who stood up before the resources of a great Empire are not going to quail or cower before the blows of a gang of assassins.  I have raised this question, first, because I consider it my duty to the people I represent that their wrongs should be voiced here, and that they should realise that the Parliament of the nation is taking cognisance of the injury that has been inflicted upon them; and, secondly, because I want to ask the Government to inform us whether or not this report is the result of the diseased imaginings of some fantastic journalist, or whether it is a statement of the actual facts of a very tragic episode, and, if so, what is the reason why such things can be done with impunity.  I am sorry that the occasion should have come about to raise this question; but this having happened, I do think that it is due to this Assembly, and due to the people who have suffered this appalling atrocity, that the Government responsible for the welfare of the Irish nation should let us know what they have to say about it.</P>

      <P>It would not be very easy to give notice, because it only appeared in to-day's Press.  I asked after questions were finished to-day if it would be advisable to raise this matter for the purpose of obtaining information. There were other Ministers here, and the Ceann Comhairle said it would be better to raise the matter on the adjournment. I took it that the President would be informed by his colleagues that the matter would be raised.  I certainly have no wish to take the Minister at a disadvantage or to do anything that would be discourteous.</P>

      <P>I regret that I did not hear until two or three moments ago, when coming into the Dáil, that this matter was going to be raised.  I have no information on the matter at all.  I understand one of the Ministers has gone to get in touch with the Minister for Defence. That is what he told me when leaving the Dáil.  I much regret not having information of the fact that the matter was going to be raised.  I have only got to say that some recent reports that have been circulated and that have appeared in the Press have been, I think, more than exaggerations.  I am not in a position to say anything at all about this matter, but if the Deputy will agree I would undertake to get whatever information is available for the Dáil here to-morrow at 3 o'clock and we could take it up after questions if the Dáil agrees. I have been taken by surprise, and I regret I had not heard of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I think Deputy Milroy has done a service in raising this question.  The occurence is, as he said, an appalling one&mdash;appalling for the people who have suffered, but without minimising that in any way it is perhaps more appalling for the country as a whole and surely calls for a statement from the Minister for Defence in explanation of this particular incident, following upon so many other incidents of a very disquieting character. Several occasions have arisen when Ministers were invited openly or by suggestion to make a statement in regard to the Army, the position of the defence <Col N="1358" /> forces of the country, and their relation to the function of defence.  The last two or three weeks have shown the country that there are very many defects somewhere, and this is surely the crowning defect.  I think the President would be well advised if he would prevail upon the Minister for Defence to make a full and frank statement to the Dáil and to the country on the question, militarily and politically, because as he suggested the other day there was a political side to this question.</P>
      <P>There should be a full and frank statement made to-morrow to the Dáil and to the country of the position and reasons why it should be possible for an attack to be made by 80 men upon a small town in Co. Cavan following upon attacks by smaller numbers but over very large areas indeed and in so many different forms.  As I said I think Deputy Milroy has deserved well of the Dáil in raising this matter in the way he has done, and as he stated in the early stages of these proceedings he desired to give an opportunity to the Ministers to make an explanation that I think should be availed of to-morrow, and it should not be an explanation merely of the Ballyconnell calamity but of the whole military position with which the country is faced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence I gather has not at the moment authentic information which he could usefully disclose to the Dáil with reference to this particular incident.  No doubt he will make a statement to-morrow bearing on that matter.  But I want to combat the view that it was a natural thing to expect that a body of Irishmen would descend upon this little town and proceed to murder their fellow-citizens. It was not a natural thing.  It is perhaps the most unnatural thing that has happened since this unnatural strife began.  And many unnatural things have happened, but in the absence of reliable authentic information beyond what was disclosed in the Press one can only surmise that this was the act of Mr. Frank Aiken and his band&mdash; that mad dog who has been rushing in and out across the Border for many months&mdash;not that he is quite a mad dog when he is on the Six County side of the Border line.  Because Mr. Frank Aiken in the Six Counties is a very good <Col N="1359" /> boy indeed.  Mr. Frank Aiken presumably is a Republican.  He would like to be called so.  I have no doubt that it is in the name of the Republic that he murders his unarmed fellow-citizens. I do not know whether he is a Republican for 32 or 26 Counties, but what I do know is that he is very glad of the benevolent protection of the Border and of this Government in the North East which presumably he does not recognise. We can all sympathise with the relatives of the men who have been murdered, and we can sympathise with the townspeople as a whole.  We can sympathise too with the many others throughout the country who have suffered at the hands of those people who are endeavouring to loose anarchy in the country, with the mothers of the babes that were wantonly burned, with the widow of the I.R.A. officer (killed in Easter week) who was burned out some time ago in Mountjoy Square.  Her husband was killed in Easter week and she was burned out in Mountjoy Square by those ruffians who never, nine-tenths of them, never handled a gun until the British evacuated the country.  That lady contracted a cold on the night she was burned out of her little flat and she has been ordered out of the country by her physician.  These are the things that have to be faced.  There are individual tragedies and there is the national tragedy.  Anarchy was loosed in this country&mdash;wantonly loosed, callously loosed, deliberately loosed&mdash;and the men that loosed this saw it coming and knew it was coming, and had ample opportunity to measure the guilt of him who would press the button to set it loose. But the button was pressed, and hundreds of young men through the country, young fellows in their teens, are being made the dupes of one man's vanity. He calls them out in the name of the Republic.  Some of us know the irony of that.  Some of us know that he taught us the necessity for compromise, and taught us the immorality, so to speak, of persisting when there was no hope of success, and of keeping the country under the harrow of British oppression <Col N="1360" /> simply for a formula.  There is only one way to deal with anarchy, and that is the way of force.  If there was another way, you can take it that this Government and the Army Council which serves it would take the other way.  But there is no other way.  We will take that way of force, and we will take it very thoroughly indeed; but we expect from the people in whose name and on whose behalf it will be taken, understanding and support&mdash;understanding that you have here a problem of men who have long since ceased to think, of men who are not open to reason, who do not argue or think by the standards along which you and I and rational men think, but who reply to you with cliches, &ldquo;The people have no right to do wrong.&rdquo; Consequently men are murdered in Ballyconnell, women are burned out in Mountjoy Square, and babies are burned elsewhere. Now, we are living in a world of facts, and there are times when it takes more courage to face facts than to face machine guns.  But facts are stubborn things and have to be faced, and men were big enough to face them on the 6th December, 1921, and other men were small enough to stab them when they came home, having done their best for the Irish nation.  We, at any rate, are looking this situation in the eye.  It may be that some people even now will review the situation, and will ask themselves what it is all about.  Some people may do that.  Some people almost certainly will not.  Those who will not pause and think now can expect nothing from the hands of those who have a mandate to safeguard the lives and property and the interests of the people of Ireland&mdash;of the people of Ireland living to-day and of the people who will be born into Ireland in the future&mdash;they can expect nothing at their hands but the treatment that one would mete out to so many wild beasts if they were loosed within your territory.</P>
