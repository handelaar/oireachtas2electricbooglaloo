      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance what Department is responsible for providing medical treatment for soldiers discharged from the British Army, who served in the European War, and who are residents of the Irish Free State; from what fund the cost of such treatment is defrayed; whether any alteration in the existing arrangements is rendered necessary by the Irish Free State Act, and if so, whether he will ensure that the citizens concerned will not be placed in a less favourable position as regards treatment than ex-soldiers in Great Britain, and that no part of the cost will fall upon them or upon the Free State Exchequer.</P>

I am not aware that any alteration of the existing circumstances is rendered necessary by the Irish Free State Act, and I have no reason for thinking that ex-soldiers who are citizens of the Irish Free State will be placed in any less favourable position for treatment than soldier citizens of Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some farmers in the neighbourhood of Athlone make a speciality of growing potatoes for seed purposes, and that where these potatoes are grown on bog soil their value as seed is thereby enhanced.  The difficulty of finding a market for these potatoes this year is, no doubt, due to the fact that the yield of the potato crop of last season, not only in Ireland, but also in Great Britain and Continental countries, has been above the average, with the result that there is a considerable surplus of potatoes in the principal potato growing districts.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Agriculture have no legal powers to prohibit the importation of seed potatoes, except in so far as is necessary to prevent the introduction of disease.</P>

      <P>In consequence of certain information which came to the knowledge of the Department, and from which it would appear that the applicant was not unemployed for part of the time he represented himself as unemployed, it was necessary to institute inquiries in regard to the payment of further benefit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like something in the way of clarification of this. <Col N="1539" /> An amendment was accepted on the last stage which, subject to a verbal alteration, was intended to ensure that the prisoner would be brought before a Court within a reasonable time.  Under the present law I understand a man must be brought before a Court within 7 days. The amendment accepted on the last occasion was to make it possible for such prisoner to be brought before another Court in the same area, or at least in the same county or the next county.  As I read the amendment now proposed it may postpone the bringing before the Court of that prisoner for quite a long time, to such a time as would be limited only by the period of time between one Court in a particular district and the next Court in that district, which may be a month or two months.  So far as I can see I do not think there is any limit to the period; it certainly may be four weeks, and I think the intention of the Dáil in Committee was to ensure that the prisoner should be brought before the Court, either the Court before which he was first tried, or a neighbouring Court, so as to prove to the public that the man is still alive, or that he is still in custody. I think the amendment does not ensure that, and I would like the Minister to explain the effect of this amendment, and to say what was the intention.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment previous to this was to ensure that a prisoner could be brought before a Justice without waiting for the date of the next District Court.  It was introduced in order that the prisoner might not be kept in custody awaiting the sitting of the next District Court.</P>

      <P>It might be a month hence, but it does not ensure that the prisoner will be brought before the Court before that next Court is held.</P>

      <P>That matter was before the Dáil, and the point was raised that the Justice might not sit again in that particular district for a considerable time, but he may be sitting in an adjoining district, and to facilitate and expedite dealing with the man in custody he shall be bound, if necessary, to take up that case the next time he sits, either in his own or in an adjoining district. The clause as passed does give effect to that.  It does seem to me that if the amendment now proposed is carried out you get all the possibility of bringing the prisoner up in the Court in an adjoining county or district, and confining him to some Court, which may be a special Court, but one that must be held in the same district.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment as proposed certainly was, that notwithstanding if a man was arrested in one district, if a Court was being held within two or three days in an adjoining district, the prisoner might be brought up there. Whether that was a wise amendment or not I express no opinion.  Undoubtedly that was the sense of the Dáil when they passed the new amendment, and the new proposal seems to me to give the benefit to the prisoner.</P>

      <P>I propose the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To insert immediately before Section 6 the following new Section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Any District Justice, if and whenever he thinks it just and reasonable so to do, may, subject to the limitations imposed by this section, extend the time limited by any statute, rule or regulation for the institution of any proceedings at Petty Sessions or in a District Court, or for giving any notice, serving any document, or doing any act, matter or thing, in relation or as a condition precedent to any such proceedings.</P>
      <P>(2)  The power of extension of time conferred by this section may be exercised, whether such time has or has not expired at the date of the exercise of such power, but such power shall only be exercised in respect of a time which has expired or will expire after the 31st day of December, 1920, and before the 1st day of July, 1923.</P>
      <P>(3)  No time shall be extended under this Section to any date after the 31st day of December, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of that amendment is to afford facilities to litigants to initiate proceedings which in the ordinary course should have been taken within a certain period of time limited by statute.  In view of the fact that in many cases during the last few years there were no Courts functioning it gives litigants an opportunity of exercising their rights.</P>

      <P>(1)  From and after the passing of this Act the relief of the poor in a County to which an existing County Scheme relates shall be administered under and in accordance with such existing County Scheme and the law relating to the relief of the poor in that County shall be deemed to be and is hereby altered or modified in such manner and to such extent as is necessary to give full force and effect to such existing County Scheme.</P>
      <P>(2)  The existing County Scheme relating to a County named in the First Column of the Second Schedule to this Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the date specified in the Second Column of the said Second Schedule opposite the name of such County and the several amendments (if any) made in such existing County Scheme shall be deemed to have come into operation on the respective dates specified in the Third Column of the said Second Schedule opposite the name of such County.</P>

      <P>My name also stands to this amendment, and I support it with a little more substance than the original mover.  I have read all these County Schemes with some care, and it is not easy to say whether they do or do not affect rights that at the present moment exist.  In fact, it is not very easy to say what some of these schemes are, even after one has read them on several occasions.  Some of the <Col N="1546" /> schemes are well considered schemes, whether they are right or wrong I do not say, but several of them seem to be very little more than prize essays, such as might be carried out at school, and it is not easy to say, in regard to some of them, exactly what is meant by them. It is perfectly clear that their tendency might be markedly to upset the legal position of people who now have certain statutory rights, and it is but right, in bringing these schemes into operation, that there should be a provision that those statutory rights be not interfered with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this amendment will serve any purpose. If it would serve a purpose, and if it were shown to be necessary, I would be quite prepared to consider it.  But I do not think it is well to put such a general clause as is proposed without being pretty clear as to what it would entail.  If the Deputy or if any person who thinks he may be affected would indicate what things he wanted to be safeguarded against I would be quite willing to consider some section that might prevent legitimate rights being interfered with, as it were inadvertently by this Act. But it seems to me to pass a thing in this form might have the effect of giving ground for a great deal of litigation and might really have results far wider than I presume are those intended by the proposers of the Clause.  I think it certainly should be justified on some specific grounds and not merely on general grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the mover or the movers of this motion will accept me as an interpreter of their minds I think I might be able to enlighten the Minister. They probably have in mind&mdash;if they have any mind on the subject&mdash;that one of the Schemes, at least, makes a condition that superannuation moneys will be stopped if the recipient resides outside Ireland and the contention is that they have a statutory right to reside anywhere and draw superannuation money, and they do not want that to be taken away from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is probably sufficiently provided for in Clause 10 of the Bill, which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer of a local authority <Col N="1547" /> whose office is abolished under or in pursuance of any County Scheme shall, notwithstanding anything contained in such County Scheme, but subject to the provisions of this section, have the same rights in relation to supperannuation as if he had been removed from his office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity prior to the passing of this Act, and any provision in any County Scheme purporting to increase or diminish such rights shall be void and of no effect.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very charming to have Deputy Johnson expounding one's mind so clearly and so lucidly.  But that particular instance he has mentioned had been put before me. I agree that I think a reading of the Bill will show that that has been sufficiently guarded, and for that reason I did not mention that particular instance.  What I did feel is that you have a number of schemes put forward here, and I think the Minister might in a candid moment acknowledge that some of them are not exactly as lucid as they could be, and they might interfere very considerably with statutory rights.  If they do interfere there ought to be a general proviso by which those statutory rights are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 2.  To add at end a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The powers of a Board of Guardians under this section to send destitute poor persons to institutions for the deaf and dumb, or blind, shall extend to any case where the local authority administering the scheme considers the persons would be benefited by such institutional treatment, subject to the sanction of the Minister. And such authority shall have the right to determine the amount to be contributed <Col N="1548" /> by the person responsible for the maintenance of such persons, and to recover same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is practically an extension of the Section to cases dealing with the deaf and dumb or blind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this section is unnecessary, that the powers exist and will be transferred with the other powers of the Guardians to the County Home Committee.  Then there are powers under the Public Health Act of 1878, which reside in the District Council.  For instance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any Sanitary Authority may (with the sanction of the Local Government Board) provide for the use of the inhabitants of its district hospitals or temporary places for the reception of the sick (or convalescent), and for that purpose may itself build such hospitals, or places of reception, or contract for the use of any existing hospital, or part of a hospital, or place for the reception of the sick (or convalescent), or may enter into an agreement with any person, or body of persons, having the management of any hospital for the reception of the sick (or convalescent), inhabitants of the district, on payment of such annual or other sum as may be agreed upon.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in front of me an amendment almost similar to this that I intended putting down.  The reason that I had for this amendment, which is almost the same as the one now being moved, is that a clerk of a County Board of Health quite recently refused to allow that body to send a child to one of the institutions for mutes or blind.  The father was a very poor man, and the Board was prepared to give a contribution of £5 a year towards the child's maintenance, but he would not allow the Board to send the blind child into the institution, although they were prepared to subscribe to its upkeep outside.  This power was vested in the old Board of Guardians, but the Local Government Department have abrogated it now.  The Minister nods dissent.  I would be glad if he would say that it is not so.  If by nodding dissent he suggests that it is not <Col N="1549" /> so, I would be glad if he would say that. I have an official note from a party who is interested.</P>

That arises in several cases&mdash; in Waterford, Dublin and Cork, for instance. Dublin and Cork are very special cases, indeed, and a special type of scheme will be certainly required for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the deletion of the section.  At the previous Reading some of us stated that we thought it would not be right or proper that the new scheme should be adopted or approved under the present circumstances. We had no objection to those provisions of the Bill which would legalise and regularise schemes that had already been in operation but we have objections at this stage to new schemes. We do not think this is a suitable or proper time for adoption of new schemes. Unless a good deal of our information is incorrect, some of the schemes already in operation were rather reluctantly accepted by the people in the counties in which they are in operation&mdash;they were more or less imposed upon the people, and there does not seem, at least there is little evidence of it, any particular desire in these counties in which schemes have not been in operation to have the schemes put into operation now.  The intention of the amendment is to have no new scheme now.  If there is to be reform it should be reform of the whole system, and that is what we would desire.  No doubt there are one or two schemes under way.  The Minister on a previous occasion said that it was not the intention to oblige the counties that had not got schemes to adopt schemes, but that there were some under way, and that if we were able, he thought it would be possible to approve of them, and to let them <Col N="1552" /> come into effect.  We think that that should not be provided for in the Bill, and that it should not be allowed until the whole system has been thoroughly examined, and all the schemes and portions of the schemes even adopted by the present Boards are not the best for the operation of the new schemes, and that applies much more now than when the schemes already in operation were put into operation, because there is such division of opinion on the matter not properly affecting the administration of the Poor Law system.  Such differences are very acute now, and later on probably different boards and different kinds of public representatives will be elected to the various bodies in the counties, and we would rather there were some delay.  The delay would not be great, only a few months, and we do not see any necessity to rush through now.  It will only be a matter of three months before the local Government elections come on, and only four or five months between this and the General Election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The clause as it stands in the Bill is not mandatory.  It is permissive.  If the local authorities cannot agree upon a scheme or are unwilling to make schemes, no scheme will be made.  On the other hand, if the local authorities who have been dealing with these matters for some time, and who are fairly conversant with them, make up their minds and agree to go ahead, I think it is undesirable that they should be prevented from coming into line with other parts of the country.  In some cases the savings have been very big indeed, in other cases not so big, but in Kerry and Galway and Roscommon you have £40,000 and £60,000 of saving effected by closing the numerous workhouses where very often there were more of a staff than inmates. In these cases there were, as I have said, very large savings.  If other counties who have not yet, through various local difficulties, succeeded in arriving at an arrangement, and showing a desire to do so.  I think they should not be prevented and that the movement which has been going on with regard to this matter should be allowed to continue, and if the local bodies, because of other disagreements cannot arrive at any sort of settlement of their <Col N="1553" /> disputes, then nothing will be done under the section, but the dispute that existed will interfere merely with the formation of a proper scheme.  As a matter of fact the difficulties in the way of the formation of schemes are very localised, very often the interests of a parish almost, and if one were to wait until after the Election to get a scheme by agreement the new bodies will have to arrive and the ground will have to be gone over time and time again and there might be further delay.  Whatever form of organisation we have in the future is bound to be based upon the type of organisation the schemes have brought about.  The Poor Law in the state in which the scheme is brought out is bound to be the basis on which we start in future, and it would be really easier to put the whole system into a proper order if we could start off from something like the same point in every district rather than come in with legislation in which some districts would have all their amalgamation schemes carried out and others would have nothing done, so that if districts can be persuaded to make schemes they should be permitted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think to some extent the Minister has himself assented to the criticisms which have been made. It is admitted by him that the schemes that have been adopted were very considerable and he proposes to take powers under this to modify, to amend and to alter these schemes and to arrive now at some kind of a rough standard to which they shall all more or less conform, and he hopes, no doubt, that that standard which he has extracted by these amendments and these alterations will be the basis of any new Poor Law System.  But he admitted that the schemes are all experiments, and the Dáil has no indication of what is to be the line adopted, of what is the test of the good or the bad of these schemes.  We were told on the Second Reading that the main purpose of this Bill was to be to confirm and make legal schemes that had been put into operation and acts that had been committed&mdash;to legalise illegalities.  But I think it will be admitted that the impulse to promote schemes has come from the centre and certainly did come from the centre 2 or 3 years ago.  There are 6 or 7 counties that have not yet presented <Col N="1554" /> schemes or have not had schemes adopted.  The object of the amendment is to fulfill the main purpose of the Bill, to legalise the existing schemes but to prevent the formulation and approval of any new schemes until we have had a chance of discussing the principle on which poor law reform shall be enacted. Therefore we say it is not right to enact a new scheme or to approve a new scheme until these principles have been generally agreed upon by the Oireachtas, or particularly until we have some indication from the Minister of what is going to be his test of good and bad.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident that the bodies that have not yet submitted schemes have not been very eager to do so.  They have not, however, agreed to do so yet; they have been acting on the original impulse, and they have been slow to move.  Certain elements have been pressing for the adoption of these schemes for the purposes of economy, while others oppose, and there is disagreement because of inability to agree upon details, but we have not even in the Bill itself, or in any extension of the Bill any hint as to what are the good parts of the existing scheme, and what are the bad parts.  We think it ought not to be enacted that Boards of Guardians or County Councils or the Ministry, or any two combined, should have the power to practically make individual enactments of the Poor Law without having the matter thoroughly discussed.  We, as I said, are prepared to assist in making regular the irregularities, and to sanction by act of the Oireachtas the schemes that have been passed and adopted under the old Board, but we think it is inadvisable to proceed in that direction until there is more thorough discussion of the principles that are to determine the course of Poor Law reform.  Therefore, we would urge that anything in the Bill that is understood to go beyond the legalisation of the existing schemes should not be proceeded with, and if that view is accepted then the amendment to delete Section (3) should be adopted.  I ask the Minister to take that view of this and the succeeding amendment for the same purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept the statement&mdash;and, in fact, I have made it myself&mdash;that the essential purpose of the Bill is the legalisation of what has <Col N="1555" /> been already done, but, of course, it is not possible to just leave it there.  It is necessary that there should be further provision, and, I think, it will be admitted that even provision that may not be absolutely necessary may be very expedient. Now, a great deal of work has been done in certain other counties.  As a matter of fact, in one of them a scheme was submitted in its final form by the County Council at the time that this Bill went to the printers, and it was actually approved, and could, by way of amendment be included in the Bill.  There is no reason for drawing a line sharply because a Council has not arrived at that exact stage.  A great deal of the work is done, and several schemes under consideration are now at a scale almost as advanced as those in the Bill, and it does seem quite unnecessary to exclude them. Nothing at all would be gained from any point of view of facilitating the adoption of any future policy by refusing to allow these counties to fall into line with the others, or by bringing down the guillotine at the present moment.  I think it would be highly undesirable and unjustifiable to cut off a county where a great deal of the work is done, and where a great deal of attention has been given to the matter, simply because it was a few weeks or a month or so later than several other counties.  As I say, no possible harm could occur from that point of view from the making of schemes in the counties that have not already made them, and a great deal of harm may be done by refusing these counties permission to complete the work that they have brought practically to the point of completion.</P>

I know myself there are places where the scheme has been considered and laid aside and people are now looking to resurrect these schemes again and are trying <Col N="1556" /> to bring themselves into conformity with the views of some other people who were against them at the time.  I do not see for the life of me why they should not be allowed to do that especially as they are not being forced to do it.  I remember a scheme that was being considered for one particular area, and if the County Council desire now to go ahead with that scheme why should they not be allowed to do so?</P>

      <P>If the counties desire a certain thing to be put in force why prevent them.  Whether the area is a large or a small area it is left to the County Council to decide for themselves. The big counties can form a scheme to suit themselves.  I have considerable experience in Kilkenny of a scheme, and a very successful scheme, which has been the means of saving a good deal of money to the ratepayers.  We had a lot of small unions, some 6 or 8 of them, in the county, whereas now we are working with one and the thing is very satisfactory and has been the means of saving several thousands a year, while at the same time the people concerned are much better served.</P>

In the county that I represent <Col N="1557" /> the majority of the people do not want these amalgamation schemes brought into operation at all, believing that the time is not ripe for them.  The scheme, as it has been presented, even now, after three years, does not meet with the approval of the majority of the people in the constituency, but the Co. Council and the different boards were rushed into this scheme by the Department. I remember being at a meeting of the Co. Council in Tipperary twelve months ago, to which two inspectors came down and said it was not a question of what the Co. Council wanted, but a question of what the Department would make them do; that it was not a question of having the County Home or the County Hospital in a town in the county that the Co. Council wanted, but that they would have to have the County Home and the County Hospital where the Department selected.</P>

Of course, you will always meet with opposition from some people, no matter what scheme is put forward, but in this case I think the clause should stand in the Bill.  As Deputy Hughes remarked it is not mandatory. It is open to the Council to reject this scheme if they do not want it, so that I do not see why the clause should not be let stand.  Moreover, many counties may be forward in those schemes, and to stop them now, after formulating them, would be hard lines on such counties.</P>

      <P>The argument is, that if a county can agree to a scheme, then why should anyone prevent them. But we have interfered with that right by setting up the Local Government Department.  It is the intention of the Local Government Minister to prevent counties formulating schemes as they desire.  He brings his influence to bear to bring them into conformity with some ideal, as nearly as possible to conform with his own, but he has not told us what is his ideal, and the Dáil, which is responsible for the formulation of the Poor Law, ought at least to know what is the intention behind the Ministry in approving or disapproving of particular suggestions in any county scheme. Things were done up to date and schemes were approved of, and it is obvious that the Poor Law authorities to whom the counties responded were not acting upon a general plan, because if we read these schemes we know they vary very considerably indeed.  We argue that there ought to be a plan in the mind of the legislature, and that the Minister ought to be modifying schemes, and using his influence with counties in such a way as to interpret the mind of the legislature in regard to Poor Law.  The legislature has not yet given any indication of what its mind is in this matter.  The Minister may know his own mind, but he has not told the Dáil.  We do not know what his mind <Col N="1559" /> is or what his ideal may be with regard to Poor Law reform.  He may say that the County Kilkenny scheme is a perfect scheme, and he may agree with Deputy Gorey, and it may be all serene if all counties follow the example of County Kilkenny.  Then you might have a perfect Poor Law, but fortunately or unfortunately 20 other counties have different views from County Kilkenny. There are 7 other schemes, possibly, to be brought forward.  What we would like to know before passing the clause is, are they all going to conform to the County Kilkenny scheme or how are they going to diverge from the County Kilkenny <Col N="1560" /> scheme?  It is all in the air.  It is a matter entirely for the Minister and the County Councils and we are to be left without any determining voice until the scheme has been decided upon and put upon the Table.  We contend, inasmuch as these counties have proceeded up to date, during the period of revolution without a scheme, they can now, in view of the establishment of a formal regular legislature, delay the revision of their Poor Law arrangements, until the legislature has decided what form the future Poor Law shall take.</P>

As the whole object has been agreement with the Local Authorities, schemes would not be modified, except in very minor details, or for the purpose of removing accidental inconsistencies or something of that nature.  Modifications would not be of a very serious character, but would rather be for the purpose of expedition, other than affecting any great change in what is proposed.  The power given in <i>(b)</i> is rather for the purpose of expedition and convenience rather than of shifting the authority and giving any power to over-ride the Local Authorities.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 6.&mdash;To delete from the beginning of the section down to the word &ldquo;confirmed,&rdquo; line 17, and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may by Order confirm a scheme submitted to him under this Act, and a scheme so confirmed shall come into operation on the day prescribed in the Order confirming it;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and to add the following new sub-section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (i.)  Before the Minister makes any Order under this section, he shall publish in such manner as he may think best adapted for informing persons affected, notice of the proposal to make the Order, and of the place where copies of the draft Order may be obtained, and of the time (which shall not be less than twenty-one days) within which any objection made with repect to the draft Order, by or on behalf of persons affected, must be sent to the Minister.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  Every objection must be in writing, and state:</P>
      <P>(a)  the draft Order or portions of the draft Order objected to;</P>
      <P>(b)  the specific grounds of objection; and</P>
      <P>(c)  the omissions, additions, or modifications asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(iii)  The Minister shall consider any objection made by or on behalf of any persons appearing to him to be affected which is sent to him within the required time, and he may, if he <Col N="1562" /> think fit, amend the draft Order, and shall then cause the amended draft to be dealt with in like manner as an original draft.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(iv.)  Where the Minister does not amend or withdraw any draft Order, the draft Order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and unless within the next twenty-one days upon which each House of the Oireachtas has sat, a resolution is passed by either House annulling or amending the Order, the Minister may then make the Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The chief object is to ensure that the scheme that is to be proposed to the Minister or confirmed by the Minister, with or without alteration, shall be laid before the Oireachtas before finally becoming operative, and the form of the amendment is taken out of existing Acts &mdash;the Factory and Workshops Act and the National Insurance Act&mdash;in so far as they relate to procedure dealing with provisional Orders.  The object, of course, of the amendment is to ensure that such schemes are brought before the Oireachtas, and confirmed, either tacitly or positively by the Oireachtas&mdash;that we shall obviate the purely bureaucratic method of legislation on matters affecting a particular county without relation to the legislature.  I think it ought to appeal to the Dáil that in a matter of such moment they ought to be consulted.  At least they ought to have an opportunity of rejecting any specific scheme.  The Minister has told us that the object of paragraph (b) of the first sub-section is only to modify schemes that have been agreed&mdash;presumably agreed by the county, which means by the majority of the Co. Council. We hear of schemes which have been passed by the county which will mean, for instance, the travelling of a hundred miles of road for patients to get from one part of the county to the County Hospital. Whether that is one of the schemes which have been approved of by the Minister we do not know, and we shall not know unless this amendment, or some other amendment of the same kind is passed.  I submit that it is part of our duty, at any rate, to protect citizens from the possible disaster of being under a hard-hearted over-economical Co. Council, whose object mainly is to save rates, even at the cost of the patient's health. Therefore, I beg to move the amendment <Col N="1563" /> with the purpose I have indicated of ensuring that any new schemes shall be laid upon the table of the Oireachtas before they become operative.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I cannot, I think, accept Deputy Johnson's amendment in the form in which it is put forward, but I do agree that future schemes, before coming into operation, ought to be laid before the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas is legalising the existing schemes.  And in the case of a number of them, at least, their being in operation makes it difficult for the Oireachtas to amend them.  Still they should be laid before the Oireachtas before they are given legality.  I agree that the same thing should apply to future schemes, that a scheme should not be made merely between the local authorities and the Minister, and if the effect is that it would alter existing statutes without coming before the Oireachtas, I will be prepared at a later stage to introduce an amendment that any scheme confirmed by the Minister should be laid on the table of the Dáil, and that, at least, the order of the Minister confirming may be annulled.  I am not prepared to indicate the exact form in which I will bring forward the clause, but I certainly think it would be proper to have such a provision in the Bill.  I may say, of course, that new schemes would not have in them any features not in some existing scheme, but, nevertheless, I believe that the Dáil should have an opportunity of preventing the scheme from being carried out.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I missed the form in which this amendment is proposed.  I had in mind that it was in two parts, and I only dealt with Part 1. Part 2 of the amendment deals with the necessity for publishing and giving an opportunity for objections to be raised against the order or the scheme.  We know, for instance, that schemes have been discussed in certain counties almost behind closed doors, and we know that the County Councils recently have really not been representative of the people living in the counties to-day, that they have been denuded of members, that members <Col N="1564" /> have not been able to attend, or have not been willing to attend, and that, as a matter of fact, local opinion has not been brought to bear upon these schemes. The amendments propose that opportunities should be given by the publication of such a scheme to local people who are interested to put forward their objections to any such scheme.  That, I think, is obviously the need of the day&mdash;that if, say, the Cork County Council is proposing a scheme, or the South Tipperary Council is proposing a scheme, to close a particular hospital, or to amend the present regulations, that the people in the different areas should have an opportunity to express their opinion upon the proposal.  As I say, County Councils have, in fact, not been really representative of the people during, say, the last year, and it is not right that such a County Council should be empowered to draw up a scheme only awaiting the approval of a Minister, without the interests concerned having a right to make their objections known, and to influence the final approval by the Oireachtas of any such scheme.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate thing about these schemes is that the opposition undoubtedly is very frequently in the nature of venial opposition.  The carrying out of these schemes engenders a tremendous amount of heat.  People frequently do regard the local Workhouse as the last remaining industry of their town, as Deputy Gorey has said, and they take good care to see that their opposition is heard.  There is no objection at all to publication; in fact, there is every reason why the full details of any scheme should be published, and I have not known of any case in which they were not known to people who took any interest at all in the matter.  Of course, people who do not interest themselves may not have been aware of the details but in general they have been very fully thrashed out, and any schemes which may be made in future will certainly have to be very fully thrashed out.  I would not like to adopt a procedure that would be cumbersome and cause a great deal of delay, but I would consider for a future stage what we can do in the way of making sure that full publicity had been given to every scheme and I would agree that <Col N="1565" /> schemes should be laid before the Oireachtas along with the order confirming them, so that the Oireachtas might have an opportunity of vetoing those schemes.  As I said, they will be in line and in accord with the schemes already existing.</P>

      <P>I will say to this extent, that they will be built up from the expedients devised for existing schemes; that is, they will not contain revolutionary provisions or provisions that have not already been embodied in schemes.  As it is a matter of the will of the locality, I could not say which particular existing scheme, any future scheme may resemble or follow, but certainly it will be along the lines of some one or more existing schemes.  They will be to that extent in line with the general principle of the existing schemes and it will not be necessary that the Dáil should consider them in the same way as if they were to contain provisions that have not already been put into operation elsewhere.  At the same time I do not think we should actually invite the not very sound or not very public-spirited local opposition which always exists.  I do not think that we should invite such opposition to transfer its operations here or that we should invite all the people who want to maintain the Workhouse as their last remaining industry in their town to come along and bombard the Dáil and generally to make use of this Assembly for the purpose of supporting or trying to have preserved certain almost corrupt vested interests.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, there is always a certain measure of venial opposition to amalgamation schemes.  No doubt as the Minister says there are interests, whether interests of officials or local interests in certain small areas&mdash;Union areas&mdash;which have shown opposition to anything in the way of an amalgamation scheme, which would take a certain amount of money or some equivalent from them.  We, who are opposing, or have been opposing some of the other measures, and want this amendment carried, are not thinking of those people.  We are thinking rather of the general body of people, and amongst the general people served by the system there is very often real, <Col N="1566" /> sound, genuine opposition.  We have instances of it particularly where the question of hospital accommodation and provision is concerned.  We would desire the greatest publicity that could be given not for the encouragement of venial opposition or interested opposition of a venial kind but in order that the people who will either benefit or suffer by the operation of these schemes should have an early opportunity of seeing what they contain.  Now, in Ireland there has not been either in National Government or Local Government that general interest which all of us would like, because of the circumstances of the past.  It should be, we consider, the duty of the new Legislature to do everything to encourage a real, active and sound interest in local administration as as well as in the National Administration.  We want the people of districts which may be far removed from a proposed new County Home or a proposed new County Hospital to get an opportunity of expressing their opinions and their objections&mdash;if they have objections&mdash;to such institutions. There are cases, for instance, of people who will have to go a very long distance indeed&mdash;sick people, infirm people, medical or surgical cases of one kind or another&mdash;and a good deal of genuine opposition to certain schemes has been based on that.  That is a genuine objection because the scheme may remove people very long distances &mdash;in some cases it is said as far as 50 to 100 miles from their people or people who would be interested in them; it cuts them off altogether so to speak from their old associations and the outside world.  Now, it is in order to give the general body of the people, and not a venially-interested opposition, an opportunity of considering the schemes in detail that this amendment is moved. What has happened in the past has been that all the schemes&mdash;or at least most of them&mdash;because of the circumstances and of the manner in which they were put through and the lack of publicity, formed the subject of discussion only between the officials and representatives of the Boards concerned.  And that gave room for a good deal of what has been properly described as opposition. We would want to extend the area of discussion and examination so that opposition, suggestion, improvement or <Col N="1567" /> amendment might come from quarters which would be seriously affected by the operation of this scheme.</P>

      <P>We got very little notice of the scheme coming in, and it was passed through very hurriedly, and, in fact, the scheme is practically unworkable as it stands in its present state.  Just fancy a scheme which provides one hospital for the County of Cork.  Under that scheme you would have to bring patients from Bantry Bay to Cork City.  Imagine bringing a fever patient 100 miles in a motor car.  What chance is there for the recovery of that patient?  If the patient dies in Cork Hospital the relatives will have to go 100 miles to bring the body back again.  Again, the County Home is situated where the Midieton workhouse was, about 13 miles from the city, and then the old and infirm are removed to Midleton, 13 or 14 miles from Cork, and any of their relatives who want to see them have to bear the expenses of coming there.  There are many provisions like that, and I am sure that the people of the county in which those schemes and other schemes are to be formulated should get an opportunity of putting their views before the Ministry and the Dáil.  Some means should be provided to make the schemes acceptable for the people of the county in which they will be put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGH COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second this.  I think it is necessary.  A complaint has been made to me by the Athy Urban District Council.  I shall read their suggested amendment.  &ldquo;In 1850 the people of Athy subscribed a sum wherewith to build a fever hospital, and did so, and handed same to the Athy Town Commissioners in 1854, to work it in the interests of the health of the town. The Commissioners managed this hospital until 1874, when they gave it to the Athy Poor Law Guardians, on condition that it be used as a fever hospital for the town. The Guardians maintained the hospital until March, 1922, when owing to the <Col N="1568" /> amalgamation scheme for Co. Kildare they transferred it to the Athy Urban Council from whom they received it, stipulating that the Urban Council should receive into the hospital for treatment all infectious and contagious cases from Athy (No. 1) and Athy (No. 2) Rural Districts.  The hospital was transferred according to law, and is now the lawful property of the Athy Urban Council who hold it in trust for the people who built it.  The Council have let the hospital to the former matron of the hospital to be used as an hospital for infectious cases, and this lady is now the lawful tenant of the place.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the provisions of the above Bill the Local Government Department seek by means of an <i>ex post facto</i> law to deprive the people of Athy of their own property, and have it transferred to the Kildare Co. Council, Clause 7, (2) (a).</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Amalgamation Scheme did not come into operation until May 1st, 1922, but the Bill enacts that the scheme for this County shall be deemed to have come into operation on February 14th, 1922.  In other words, the Bill ante dates the time by over two months when the scheme came into operation, in order to transfer the Fever Hospital to the County Council and render nugatory the action of the Poor Law Guardians.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Athy-Urban Council beg to point out that the Amalgamation Scheme closed the Workhouse Hospital, where Athy cases were always treated, that the population of Athy is over 3,500, and that Athy cases have now to be sent 21 miles to Naas; that, in consequence of the long journey, the people have now to be, with a few exceptions, treated in their own homes, and that if an epidemic of infectious cases break out, the result will be disastrous for the town if the Fever Hospital is interfered with.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should take into consideration the particular circumstances of the Athy district, and see that that hospital is maintained for the people of the district.  We have another case, where Celbridge Hospital has been closed and where there has been great dissatisfaction among people who are catered for in this hospital.  It is necessary, therefore, that when any scheme is formulated, time should be given for all interests to put forward their objections.  I do not think the Poor Law system should <Col N="1569" /> be devised by County Councils, people who have very little interest in the poor. I think it should be devised in the interests of the poor and the sick.</P>

      <P>As regards the Athy Hospital, I thought this matter would be more definitely dealt with when the scheme for Kildare would be under consideration, and therefore I think it would be the proper time then to bring forward the point made by Deputy Houlihan. Fancy a town of 3,500 people being compelled to send sick people 21 miles to the town of Naas.  Is that a scheme this Dáil should sanction.  It shows that this amendment is one that should be accepted by the Ministry in justice.</P>

      <P>My objection to the amendment is one I will have to stand by.  I believe the amendment would make it very difficult to get the scheme through.  The opposition that is genuine is opposition that will be heeded and will be given every attention.  The only effect of this clause would be to allow the interested opposition to make itself heard, to give an opportunity to make a big row in the hope that the schemes might not be put through at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that I would be quite willing to accept amendments in this clause giving the Oireachtas an opportunity which is not given by the clause in the Bill as it stands but which I agree ought to be given&mdash;an opportunity of vetoing the schemes in the same way as it would have an opportunity of vetoing the schedules in the scheme, but I would not agree to a procedure which would tend to evoke interested and cumbersome opposition and which would really be of no benefit to the people who feared they would have some real grievance under the scheme because those people will <Col N="1570" /> certainly be listened to.  Everything that can possibly be done will be done to meet them but these schemes involving as they do the changing and closing of institutions and the altering of old established things provoke a great deal of opposition, opposition which though not interested is often merely thoughtless and sentimental.  Any scheme that will be adopted in the future is bound to be criticised from every possible angle.  I think it could not happen in future that any scheme could go through without ample publicity. I do not think in addition to that we should have machinery adopted which would enable people interested to prevent it from coming into operation, which would invite them to carry the warfare out of their own locality into the Dáil.  They would simply be enabled to obstruct the working of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move Section 8:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may sell, lease or otherwise alienate all or any lands or buildings which are or shall at any time be vested in him in trust for any body abolished by any County Scheme, and the proceeds of every such sale, lease or alienation shall be held by the Minister in trust for any purpose for which such land or buildings could have been used or applied by law under the said County Scheme or otherwise.&rdquo; At present the workhouses are vested in the Minister. It appears they were originally built out of loans which were to be repaid by the different Unions.  After a very small number of instalments had been paid, the loans were remitted, or at any rate the payment of instalments ceased, but the workhouses were vested in the Commissioners of Poor Law, or whatever body existed at that time rather than the local authorities.  At present they are vested in the Minister, but the Guardians of the area have the right to use them for the purposes of Poor Law. This is simply to enable the Ministers to dispose of them, and, as a matter of fact, like some of the other main provisions of this Bill, it is necessary, not only because it is a good thing, but because, in connection with these schemes, it has already, to some extent, been acted upon.</P>

As the law stands at present the Guardians have to move first by getting a vaccination order.  If that is not complied with the Rural District Council can prosecute under the Public Health Acts.  I have no opinion myself in particular on the matter of the vaccination law.  It might be well that it should be altered to come into conformity with the law in Great Britain.  There is a good deal of demand for it, but however I think that should be dealt with later.

      <P>Before saying anything concerning this Bill, which I have the honour to introduce, permit me, on behalf of the Dublin Hospitals Committee, to return their thanks in permitting me to bring forward this Bill.  No doubt, a few points may be raised against this Bill, but I am confident that so many good points will be raised in its favour that they will easily overcome whatever minor objections may be raised.  It may be urged that the time is not suitable, owing to the unstable conditions of the country at present, but, I submit, with all due respect that it is because of the unstable conditions that the necessity <Col N="1576" /> for the introduction of this Bill arises. The matter is a very urgent one, and brooks of no delay.  I am not going to weary the Dáil in endeavouring to point out to it what the hospitals in Ireland have done in the National cause during the last few years.  It is well known to you all that the hospitals of Ireland, and particularly the metropolitan hospitals have, like many of our public institutions, suffered grievously in many respects, especially from a financial standpoint. Now, I, for one, would not support this Bill, and would not ask any member of the Dáil to give it his support unless I was satisfied that the matter was a very pressing and a very grave one, and, furthermore I would not ask anybody's support unless I was sure that the objects of this Bill were going to be carried out in a businesslike and able manner.  It may be a matter of historical interest to the Dáil to learn that this question of public sweepstakes is not unknown to Ireland.  In pre-Union days I understand that large undertakings were carried out, and public buildings were erected out of funds raised by this means. We crave then the indulgence of this Dáil, and I think it will be admitted that we intend in some manner, if we are fortunate enough in getting this Bill through, to take a weight off the shoulders of the Minister for Finance.  As I have said, owing to the unstable conditions at present we cannot hope for any large amount of money for the hospitals, and it will considerably lighten the burden of the various Departments if this Bill goes through.  There is no doubt the Bill is urgently required.  Another objection to this Bill may be raised, and it may be said that legislation has been enacted already.  That may be.  We are not asking you to pull down any legislation; we are simply asking you to open the legislative door, so to speak, very slightly, and if at any time the Executive are not satisfied with the way in which things are carried on, they can lock and bolt the legislative door at once, and that settles the matter.  I will not bore you by reiterating any other points of this Bill, but I earnestly appeal to members of the Dáil to support it, and I am sure when the matter has been discussed and looked at from every angle members will realise that there is an urgency and a grave necessity for the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am going to second the proposal of Dr. White in introducing this Bill, but I am not going to do more than suggest this&mdash;that what we are seeking now is merely permission to have the Bill printed and circulated, in order that members can become conversant with its terms.  What Deputy White has said must be obvious to everyone.  The truth of it must be obvious. These establishments, which do so much for humanity, must get financial support.  In the main, I understand, their sources of such support have been voluntary, and the conditions that have come about&mdash;unhappy conditions of turmoil&mdash;have almost dried up the sources of that financial support at a time when the strain on these institutions was becoming more severe than ever.  It is undoubtedly a fact that large revenues can be collected by the means suggested in this Bill, and that these means are going to help suffering humanity and place these institutions in a position to carry on their work for the noble purposes for which they have been erected, and for which they have done so much. This cannot be a party measure.  It cannot even be a question of controversy. In view of the necessity of securing adequate financial assistance for these institutions we ask the Dáil for permission for a first reading of the Bill, in order that it may be printed and circulated, and that at a later stage the details and arguments for and against it may be enlarged upon.</P>

I have given enough examination and investigation to the question of sweepstakes to realise that it would be almost impossible to close all the loopholes of corruption and fraud, and if this Bill comes along and says that the sweep shall be run under conditions and regulations to be approved of by the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs will have much satisfaction in opposing the Bill, and saying that he does not propose to put on his Department the work of trying to devise conditions and regulations which would do, or attempt to do, a thing which he regards as well-nigh impossible.</P>

      <P>The matter to which I gave notice earlier refers to certain questions arising out of a dispute of agricultural labourers which has been in progress in South Kildare for the past four months or so.  The local Secretary of the Union&mdash;the Transport Union&mdash;in Athy was arrested in January, and this letter was sent by me on the 30th January to the Minister for Defence.  It gives the facts of the case:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We were informed by telephone yesterday that Mr. C.J. Supple, the Secretary of our Athy Branch, was arrested yesterday about 12 o'clock, at the rooms of the Union in Athy, by military, and was subsequently taken to Carlow Military Barracks.  As you are no doubt aware, a number of members of this Union in the Athy area are at present on strike, fighting against a threatened reduction of their wages by the local farmers to 25s. per week, and as all the men on strike belong to Supple's branch of the Union he naturally has been compelled to take an active part in connection with the matter.  We understand that up to the present no charge whatever has been made against Supple, and we wish to protest vigorously against the action of the military in arresting a Trades Union official in the midst of a strike of this nature, and lodging him in custody without any charge being made against him.  Surely if Supple had exceeded the law in any way in connection with this strike a civil summons could have been issued against him, and the matter tried in the ordinary way.  We make this statement because we are assured on the best authority that Supple was in no way concerned with any military or anti-Government organisation, <Col N="1581" /> and, consequently, his arrest could only have arisen out of his position as Branch Secretary.  We think the military have acted in a most illegal manner in this case, and probably the action was taken locally without your authority, and we would be glad, accordingly, if you would telegraph immediate instructions for the release of this man pending a charge being made against him in the usual way.  We may mention that Supple is a rather delicate youth, and is at present, we understand, under medical care, and the effect of his arrest may have very serious results to him.  We may also mention that we understand that negotiations were in progress which might have resulted in the termination of this long-drawn out strike, and that the arrest of Supple will probably prevent these negotiations coming to a head.  We would be glad if you would give this matter your personal attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply from the Minister is dated the 2nd February, and was received on the 5th of February.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;With reference to your G/L of the 30th January, regarding the arrest of Mr. C.J. Supple, the Secretary of your Athy Branch, I am directed by the Minister for Defence to say that Mr. Supple was arrested and will be charged on a charge framed on the fact that he issued a letter as per the attached copy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The enclosed copy is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;I am directed by the Committee to inform you that they had your case of refusal to strike against a reduction of wages before them last night.  After careful consideration, I was directed to write to you to inform you to strike work on Monday next and report to me.  Failing to do this we will be compelled to take drastic action both against you and your employer, and to do all in our power against him.  Hoping that after this notice you will cease work.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;C.J. SUPPLE,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara&mdash;I am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., enclosing copy letter in which you state a charge has been framed against above.  I can hardly <Col N="1582" /> imagine that the Ministry is serious in stating that a charge will be made on the basis of this letter, as it appears to me that it is quite clear that what was intended by this letter was that the usual trade union action, which is perfectly legitimate, would be taken in this case. I fail to see how anything more can be read into the letter.  In any event, if a charge is to be made, I take it that such a charge will be heard by a Civil Court, and, accordingly, I fail to see the reason why Supple was arrested by the military, and why he is still detained.  I think a mistake has been made in this case, and I am sure on your re-considering the whole case you will immediately direct the release of this man, and if it is intended to proceed with the charge a summons can be issued against him in the ordinary way, and we will be quite prepared to meet the case when it comes off.  In my previous letter I mentioned that Supple was in a delicate condition of health, and I understand that he was to have undergone an operation this week.  Having regard to all the circumstances I trust you will see your way to order the immediate release of this man, and, as stated above, if the Department is serious in proceeding against him you can do so by the ordinary legal procedure. If you still find it impossible to release this man, I would thank you to arrange to have the charge against him tried without delay, and I would be glad to hear from you by return as to the date and place of hearing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply from the Ministry is dated 9th February, and states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara&mdash;<i>Re</i> C.J. Supple, Athy. I am directed by the Minister for Defence to acknowledge receipt of your G/L of the 5th inst., relative to the above, and to inform you that the matter is having attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we contend this is a very serious matter that a Trade Union official acting for men on strike should be arrested on a charge of that kind and kept in custody indefinitely.  He is now in custody for three or four weeks and if there is a genuine charge against him, let him be tried and in the meantime until he is tried let him be released on bail.  We can give very substantial bail, and he is prepared to meet whatever charges the authorities have against him.  But a <Col N="1583" /> very serious development of the case has arisen since.  While he has been in custody members of the Farmers' Union have been admitted to see him.  They have had facilities given to see him and these gentlemen have importuned him to agree to a settlement of this dispute and his release would immediately follow. But the members of our Union were not thought good enough to visit him.  One of these is Senator Duffy, who is present as a visitor here this evening. When they were in Athy to see if anything could be done to end the dispute they decided that Mr. Supple should be visited in Carlow Barracks.  They went to see him and they found there the Secretary of the Farmers' Union.  A long discussion took place as to the terms of settlement and in the course of the discussion the Farmers' representative said if Mr. Supple agrees to sign a settlement now he will be released immediately, and the local Military Officer present confirmed that and said &ldquo;Yes, immediately he signs this document he will be released.&rdquo; That is a very serious allegation, and I put it to the Minister that a full and searching enquiry should be made into that allegation.  Now, there is a further point&mdash;a very pathetic matter that occurred.  It was rumoured at one time that Mr. Supple was to be released.  His mother travelled to Carlow to meet him on learning the report. It turned out to be false, and she was taken suddenly ill and died within an hour.  That is only an incident, but the facts that I have outlined are very serious and show that there is collusion between the Military Authorities and the local farmers.  I do not, of course, say that the Minister for Defence approves of that, but the local officer may not be aware of the Minister's attitude. Mr. Supple has been refused parole to attend and try to effect a settlement, but he was promised parole if he would effect a settlement and, further, he was promised his release if he would bring about a settlement of the dispute.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say much in this case, for the very good reason that it is <i>sub judice.</i>  None of us&mdash;I am sure I speak for the Minister for Defence and for every member of the Ministry and of the Government&mdash;cares whether the Athy farmers are members of the Farmers' Union or not, and we are not concerned as to whether Mr. Supple is Secretary of a trade union or not. Both the Farmers' Union officials and the Trade Union officials are citizens as far as we are concerned.  I hope that is perfectly clear.  But while I do not want to say much about the case, I think it would be no harm, as Deputy O'Brien has gone into it, that the Dáil should know the circumstances.  A strike occurred some four months ago.  It was an ordinary dispute as to wages.  We need not go into the merits of the dispute now.  As the strike developed and things got a little bit confused, the employer got a letter signed by Mr. Supple.  I think I am wrong in saying it was the employer, it was a workman, and the letter informed him that if he did not leave the employment of Mr. Melrose drastic steps would be taken against his employer. That was followed by a strike, which was going on for the last 4 months, and the history of the last 4 months is that the matter was followed up first by a shooting at the employer or agent.</P>

      <P>Yes.  After that letter was received threatening drastic action and since then, in the period of over 4 months, nine or ten haggards have been burned.  All the produce of the farmers in this dispute has been burned.  Now, as I say, we are not looking at this from the <Col N="1585" /> point of view of the Farmers' Union or the Transport Workers' Union.  We do not care what the cause is.  The fact is that as a consequence of this dispute a man is shot at, and 7 or 8 haggards are burned.</P>

      <P>I am merely giving the facts.  Four months ago this dispute began, and during that time the supporter of one of the employers was wounded and 7 or 8 haggards were burned down.  That is not trade unionism, and I hope it has nothing to do with trade unionism.  All this followed a letter coming from Mr. Supple threatening drastic action, and is it seriously contended that the people responsible for law and order in that county should not have arrested Mr. Supple?  I will say no more about the case because it is <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <P>The facts of the matter from my point of view are those as stated in the correspondence with the Deputy. Mr. Supple is being detained on a charge framed on the fact that that letter is supposed to be issued by him.  He is to be tried by Military Court.  With regard to the main point, which I realise is the main point, I regret that, owing to the short notice, I have not very definite information on the matter, but I certainly will promise very full inquiry into it. With regard to that particular point it did come to our notice that Mr. Supple, who is in prison in Carlow, was receiving visits.  As a matter of fact on one occasion when the matter came very much to light, he was holding a kind of levee. The officer responsible for seeing that prisoners should not get visits was at once suspended, and is at the present moment under suspension.  Prisoners in military custody are not allowed to be visited by anybody except by a solicitor in certain circumstances, and they are not allowed parole, and when these types of visits or parole are allowed they are not allowed without express authority from Headquarters or from the officer responsible, so that the officer who is responsible for this irregular procedure is under suspension, and any statement made here this evening will be the subject of inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>This is a matter that raises a very important question to the trade union movement.  A prisoner is going to be charged with an offence before Military Courts, an offence presumably under those regulations.  The language of the threat&mdash;shall I call it a threat?&mdash; is language which can be easily justified and easily understood.  It has a certain definite meaning&mdash;a meaning which is quite regular and lawful.  A Military Court, which has in mind certain preconceived notions as to what that language implies, unless there are the fullest particulars given to prove the innocuous nature of the language, that Military Court will, I was almost going to say likely, do an injustice.  It certainly will do an injustice if the fullest opportunity for bringing evidence to bear as to the nature of the threat is not granted. The Minister suggests that in his mind, the likelihood was that the case was to be tried to-day.  From what we know of Mr. Supple it is certain that if an opportunity had been granted to him to defend the case he would have communicated with solicitors, and the Union would have been informed of the matter. I want to ask the Minister to make sure <Col N="1588" /> that every opportunity is given to the prisoner in this case to have a proper legal defence, and to call witnesses on his behalf, and not allow any trial to take place until that full opportunity has been granted.</P>

      <P>I did not mean to intervene in this debate, but as I was responsible for putting a question before the Minister for Defence some months ago about this particular case, I think it well to state that what Deputy Johnson considers common language, and the common meaning of the words &ldquo;drastic action&rdquo; as applied to these cases of wages disputes, is interpreted by farmers, from past experience, as similar to what has taken place in Athy.  The first time these words &ldquo;drastic action&rdquo; were used to my knowledge was by a lady, who was Minister of Labour in another Parliament in this country&mdash;the second Dáil.  They were used by her in reference to a dispute in Wexford, and &ldquo;drastic action&rdquo; was threatened unless farmers paid certain wages to labourers, and the week following this &ldquo;drastic action&rdquo; was followed by the burning of fifteen farms in Wexford.  Waterford followed, then Cork, so that the words are interpreted by farmers, whether rightly or wrongly, to mean burnings.</P>
