      <P>asked the President if his attention had been drawn to a resolution, passed by one House of the Oireachtas, that no action should be taken by the Executive Council to commit this State to membership of the League of Nations without the sanction of the Oireachtas, and whether, after the adoption of this resolution, the Minister for External Affairs presented a note applying for membership of the League without the sanction of, or previous consultation, with, the Oireachtas? And whether in such matters, it is the policy of the Executive Council to act <i>motu proprio.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>replied: Our application for admission to the League of Nations was sent in prior to the discussion in the Seanad (<i>i.e.</i>, on the 17th instant).  This action was in compliance with the expressed wishes of the Legislature, seeing that by resolution of the 18th of September, 1922, the Dail, ... then the sole Legislature,... directed the Executive Council to apply for membership as and when they found it advantageous to do so.</P>
      <P>Further delay in sending the application would have been calculated to prevent the matter of Ireland's admission being considered at this year's meeting of the Assembly of the League, thus delaying the matter for another twelve months.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas will have ample opportunity to decide on the matter, as having regard to the Covenant of the League of Nations a bill will be introduced to support the application by the necessary guarantees.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the answer, I beg to ask the Minister if, in his opinion, a resolution passed in general terms seven months before the application, and at a time when all the nations constituting the Council of the League of Nations were in a state of peace, should, although adopted by the First House of the Oireachtas, have been proceeded upon in face of a resolution passed and adopted in direct and specific terms by the Second House on the very day before the application, and at a time when certain of the nations constituting the Council are in a state of covert and potential war?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; there are certain figures circulated respecting the estimated receipts from Income tax.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will put down a question on that I will see what can be done to supply him with the information, but I put it to the Deputy that that would not exhaust the information; it would be very incomplete, because, in a very large number of cases, the dividends are paid without Income tax, that is free of Income tax, and in some of these cases in which it would be so paid relief would be given.  If a person is interested in several companies in England and in Ireland, these are mixed in an application for re-payment. They are not all segregated&mdash;they would be in another two years&mdash;and the information, if I understand the question correctly, that the Deputy would get, would not be any more than an approximate estimate, and even faulty at that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government how soon he expects to be in a position to issue a Provisional Order respecting the Ballaly Water Scheme submitted by the Rathdown Rural District Council, and, whether, pending the passing of Standing Orders dealing with the Private Bills and Provisional Orders, he will submit a Resolution to the Dáil in respect of the proposed scheme, so that work may be pushed forward as quickly as possible.</P>

I understand that the preparation of the Standing Orders dealing with Private Bills and Provisional Orders is nearing completion and that it will be possible to have the Provisional Order confirmed under these Orders without undue delay.  If, however, the adoption of the Standing Orders should be delayed for any considerable time, in view of the fact that the necessary local inquiry into the Scheme has been held, I shall consider whether the Provisional Order may not be confirmed by ordinary Public Bill. It will be understood that the latter course can be adopted only if I am satisfied that the Bill is likely to go through without opposition.</P>

      <P>I desire to give notice that on the motion for the adjournment I will draw attention to the attitude of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company and other Irish railway companies and their failure to open up sections of the lines that have been closed for six or nine months.  I wish to refer to the effect of such action upon trade and industry in the areas concerned, and also the effect as regards unemployment. I will also deal generally with the attitude and policy of the Government towards the Great Southern and other companies affected.</P>

That was referred to the Committee on Procedure.  That Committee met the Standing Orders Committee of the Seanad.  Until the Committee on Procedure has decided its own attitude in the matter, and has made a report to the Dáil, the printing of the amended Standing Orders has been delayed. That is the reason.

    <P>Resolution No. 8 (General Taxes and Duties) read a second time.</P>
    <Col N="379" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As an amendment to that resolution I wish to move:&mdash;To insert after the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; in clause (a) the words, &ldquo;save that the rates of Customs duty upon sugar shall be reduced by four shillings and eight pence per hundredweight.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment I have moved is an endeavour to persuade the Dáil that the duty on sugar should be reduced by a sum which will be quite insufficient to meet the arguments I intend to adduce, but will, at least, give the Dáil an opportunity of indicating its intention in regard to taxation of the poor.  The intention of the amendment is to secure that the duty on sugar shall be reduced by a ½d. per lb. of sugar.  I have already said that one can find no great fault with the Government in not making any attempt at a wholesale radical change in fiscal policy at this stage.  I do not withdraw from that.  Nevertheless, I believe that the taking over of the whole scheme of taxation, as has prevailed during the last year, is not going to fit in with the requirements of the country.</P>
      <P>I draw attention again to the fact that the duty on sugar of 25s. 8d. per cwt. is too great a burden upon the poor people of the country.  It will be news to many to learn that the duty on sugar has multiplied fourteen times since the year 1914, from 1s. 10d. per cwt. to 25s. 8d. per cwt. 2¾d. per lb. on sugar is, in my view, altogether unwarranted, because of the fact that it is an imposition upon the very poorest of the population, leading to a taxation upon the earnings of those poor that is quite indefensible.  The Minister for Finance, when we were discussing the incidence of the tea tax, made light of the amount by pointing out the small effect it had on the annual expenditure of a family.  I think he said about 1d. per week per person, and he reckoned that was not a weight that could not be borne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in the case of the sugar tax an expenditure of probably 1s. 6d. to 2s. per week per average family.  I want to draw attention to the results of this kind of taxation upon the necessary food of the people, and the unfair incidence of that tax.  I suppose it would not be an exaggeration to say that half the population of the Saorstát is living on a standard <Col N="380" /> of, say, about 30s., or less than 30s. per week.</P>
    <P>When we recollect that amongst the agricultural population we have 56 per cent. of all the holdings under 20 acres, I think I am not exaggerating when I say that the standard of life is only 30s. per week.  Adding to that very large portion of the population, the large sections which are not holders of agricultural land, but are labourers working on small wages, intermittent wages, it is no exaggeration to say that half the population is living on a family wage of probably not more than 30s. a week.  The effect of this imposition of 2¾d. per lb. on sugar is to tax those families, as I said, quite out of all proportion to their ability to pay.  I reckon that the tax upon what may be called necessaries&mdash; food, tea, sugar, tobacco, and other foods, which are involved in that taxation&mdash;roughly runs, in the case of the 30s. per week family, to 3s., or one-tenth of their income.</P>
    <P>I lay down that the principle we should follow in respect of taxation is that it should not leave the taxpayer in a position of destitution.  It should be so modulated as to leave the citizen with a sufficiency to lead a reasonable life according to civilised standards.  When by the imposition of a tax on food, such as this, and other food taxes, we are taking from the population of poor people so large a proportion of the total tax, we are depriving many of those of a reasonable standard of life.  I find that of the total taxation that is proposed to be imposed upon the citizens of the Saorstat for the coming year, one-ninth of the whole of the taxation that is to be imposed upon the population is to be derived from sugar.  The equivalent proportion in Britain this year is one-twentieth. I find that the proportion of the taxation imposed by Customs and Excise, and drawn from food and drink of non-alcoholic nature is rather slightly less than one-fourth, and I say that the effect of that is to throw too great a burden upon the very poor.  We are not leaving those who live upon the margin of subsistence a sufficient amount to enable them to carry on life reasonably.  I submit that our purpose in imposing taxation is to enable the State, the community in its organised capacity, to protect and assist and serve the general body of citizens, but that if we impose taxation of such a <Col N="381" /> nature as to deprive the citizens of the possibility of decency, then we are reducing the strength of the State, reducing the power of the State, because of the fact that we are cutting away the strength of the individual who constitutes the unit of the State.</P>
    <P>I have heard that it is useless to make any suggestion of reduction in taxation unless one is prepared to put forward a counter proposition.  I do not accept the view that that is the business of a critic who has no means of knowledge available.  It is not a duty imposed upon the critic to provide a counter policy, but I am going to venture to suggest that it would be worth while the time of the Minister for Finance to examine what is done in other countries, and to realise that such an exorbitant charge as he proposes to impose upon the poor of this country is out of all reason as compared with similar charges in other countries.  We have taken over the scheme of taxation that has hitherto been operating, and in this resolution we are proposing to continue all the duties except those which the Dáil has already agreed to allow to be re-imposed.  I submit, again repeating what I have said before, that the proportion of the total taxation which is placed upon the poor through the tax upon necessary foods, is unfair and over-burdening.</P>
    <P>I have had an opportunity of making some comparisons with a country which is somewhat similar in many respects to the Saorstát&mdash;I mean New Zealand&mdash;a country with only one-third of our population, but dependent, as Ireland is, very largely for its trade and income on the export of agricultural produce to Great Britain.  True, it is a new country, and has advantages, perhaps, of a soil which has not been overworked, but it is depending upon agriculture and upon pasture and the export of dairy produce. The total taxation of New Zealand for the year 1921 was very nearly the same as the proposed taxation of the Saorstát in the coming year.  The total was £22,000,000, but out of that £22,000,000 only 39 per cent., or £8,750,000, was raised by Customs and Excise duties.  We propose to raise 75 per cent. by Customs and Excise duties, but we are making the mistake, I suggest, of making these Customs and Excise duties fall to too great an extent upon necessary foods.  In New Zealand, out of their £8,750,000 derived <Col N="382" /> from Customs and Excise, only one-twentieth is so derived from food and non-alcoholic drink.  We propose to take one-fifth.  They took as a proportion of Customs and Excise duties one-tenth from tobacco and alcoholic drinks.  We propose to take one-half.  They took £2,500,000 out of £8,750,000 by taxes upon manufactured clothing, textiles; as much as they take from alcohol and tobacco. I want to draw particular attention to these facts: that out of the £22,000,000 derived from taxation of all kinds in New Zealand 50 per cent. of it was derived from duties upon incomes, death duties and unimproved land tax, only 39 per cent. coming from Customs and Excise and the remainder coming from taxes upon the wealthy and the better off.  Our proportions are 75 per cent of the total taxation coming from Customs and Excise and 25 per cent. only taxes upon incomes and property. A very interesting suggestion might be made, I think, to the Minister, which will perhaps forestall his reply, when he will challenge where we are going to get the £400,000 that would be lost, or shall I say saved by the people, but lost to the Exchequer by the adoption of the amendment. I think, without prejudice to the main question of tariffs for protective purposes, the Minister might well think over the proposition, between now and say October, that he should adopt a primage duty which the New Zealand Government has imposed upon all imports&mdash; a primage duty of one per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  Supposing the Minister decided that a primage duty upon all imports, including raw materials, flour and wheat, would be too large an order, though it would bring in £1,000,000 or more, he might say a one per cent. duty upon manufactured goods in the nature of a toll&mdash;not a protective tax&mdash;that would bring in the amount I propose should be remitted from the sugar tax.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have got to face this question of the incidence of taxation and to make up our minds that the policy of levying so great a proportion of the taxation of the country upon food stuffs&mdash; breakfast table duties, as they are called &mdash;and upon alcohol and tobacco, which is much more defensible, but that the policy of levying all the revenue and taxation upon these three or four items is fraught with great danger.  The taxation upon beer in the proportion we have <Col N="383" /> it practically compels the Finance Minister to say, &ldquo;You must slow down any temperance movement, you must not encourage or proceed with a demand for a smaller consumption of alcoholic drink, because it will hurt the Exchequer.&rdquo;  If that proposition is agreed to, then it is necessary for the Minister in charge of Finances to look around for other means of raising revenue.  I believe that we will be forced by the circumstances of the country to raise revenue by taxes on imports.  We might also be compelled &mdash;but this is not exactly a revenue proposition&mdash;to utilise that same machinery for assisting the development of industries of one kind or another at home.  I am dealing at the moment with the collection of revenue, and I suggest it is worth the Minister's while to examine the proposition that revenue could be derived without imposing any considerable charge upon the consuming public by a toll upon imports, particularly imports of manufactured articles, and thus relieve the direct tax which food duties impose upon the poorest of the population.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I am moving is to reduce the tax upon sugar by a ½d. per lb., and I suppose we may reckon that that would cost the Exchequer something like £400,000 in the year.  I suggest, as a means of retrieving that loss, that for six months of the year we could raise the amount by means of such a toll upon imports as I have suggested, and for the remaining six months the Minister would be able to pursue his enquiries as to the general question of all taxation for protective purposes upon imports or upon manufactured articles of one kind and another.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this ½d. per lb. is quite too small to meet the case that could be put up for a reduction on the sugar duty, but at least it will be an indication that the Dáil has some consideration for the very poor, and does not desire to retain over-taxation upon that section of the population which is living on the minimum standard of subsistence.</P>

      <P>I represent mostly the class that Deputy Johnson has spoken about.  He has spoken about the farming class and the labourers, and has said that this tax would fall on the poor.  Well, certainly, <Col N="384" /> qualitatively he is probably right, but quantatively the value to the poor would be almost infinitesimal.  A small or a poor family in the country uses only about a quarter of a stone of sugar in the week, or 3½ lbs., and the relief in that case would be only three halfpence to the family.  That amount is very little to any family.  We know that the great percentage of sugar is not used by the people Deputy Johnson speaks about.  It is used by factories and by large distilleries, and I do not think that this would be much of a relief to the poor.  What I do believe is that a tax has to be put on something.</P>

      <P>I voted against Deputy Johnson's motion to reduce the tea tax on the last occasion that we sat, and I find myself compelled to vote against this present proposal, in both cases for the same reason.  I have every sympathy with the argument that the Deputy put forward in connection with getting away from a system of taking too much of our taxes out of the poor, but I think the Deputy's way of doing it is not a good one.  Many of us hope that this time next year a Budget will be introduced of a totally different character, based upon a thorough examination of the advantages to be gained by changes in very many directions from the English system which has been taken over holus bolus.  I ask the Deputy to think what will happen next year when we have, shall we say, Deputy Gorey as Minister for Finance and President, or some conservative element represented in the person of the Minister for Finance, if proper investigation has not been made into the possibilities of a complete change in our fiscal system; and if the Deputy is pressing this time next year for the complete change which many of us want, he will be told that the necessary improvements can be obtained by a little amendment here and a little amendment there.  He will be told so much was taken off the sugar tax, so much was taken off tea and that should go a long way to meet him.  I think that it would be a very telling argument, and in the interests of those upon whom these taxes do press it is much better to insist that the radical change shall be made on the first really Irish Budget next year, instead of helping those who would prevent such a change by making small alterations now.  The <Col N="385" /> Ministry has not been in a position to examine the fiscal field in a way that would be necessary to make such a change as we would like to see.  I quite admit that they have not been able to do it.  But between this and next year it will be possible to do that, and I think that to pass small amendments now for the sake of a halfpenny off this or a penny off that is only helping those who would like us to stick to the very unsatisfactory system which we have at present.</P>

      <P>Personally, I must vote against this proposal, because it is the very poor we are speaking about, and not the people who are the very large consumers of sugar.  As a matter of fact, since the war we have developed a taste for drinking our tea, practically speaking, without any sugar.  The poor have developed that taste, and they have developed it from necessity, and, as a matter of actual fact, it is the people who indulge in luxuries who are the large consumers of sugar&mdash;people who use sweets of every description, who have sweets after dinner, and which are not found on the tables of the poor.  This will not be any relief whatsoever to the poor, or it will be so small as to be scarcely noticeable.  I think all those foreign stuffs, whether they are tea or sugar, whether they are food or not, should be taxed.  What Deputy Johnson aims at will not have the effect of lessening the poor man's bill at all, because the poor are not large consumers of sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. R. WILSON Mr. R. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the time is not ripe for tinkering with the fiscal measures.  The matter is too deep to be considered or dealt with in a motion such as is before the Dáil.  It will require quite a long sitting, many long sittings of experts to determine in what way we can best safeguard the interests of this country, and while we are in the present state I think it foolish for us to interfere with regulations in connection with the Revenue, especially as we are behind to the extent of about £5,000,000.  Therefore, while I am in great sympathy with Deputy Johnson's idea I believe that the food of the people ought to come in free.  Unlike Deputy Gorey, I believe that sugar and tea are necessities and they ought to come in free, but while we are in our present state the fiscal arrangements require very mature consideration.  We also expect <Col N="386" /> that the farming interest will be looked after, in the shape of taxes on barley and wheat.  I believe that this tinkering by the taking off of one halfpenny in the pound off sugar is useless.  Last year 4d. was taken off tea, and immediately instead of passing it on to the consumer we were told that the price of tea had gone up. Already you will notice in the papers that the price of sugar is going up, and if you take one halfpenny off sugar you will be told that the price of sugar has gone up, and it will not be passed on to the consumer. Consequently, we would be decreasing the Revenue and the consumer will not be benefited, but the opposite, and we will be upsetting the Minister's scheme of taxation for this year.  For these reasons I have to oppose Deputy Johnson's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, sir, that the general impression of the Dáil is that the purpose Deputy Johnson has in mind would not be met by reducing the tax on this particular commodity by one halfpenny in the pound.  It is questionable that it would give any relief to the people he has in mind, and it must also be remembered that, I am sure, to some extent at any rate, the cost of sugar and the cost of tea have been weighed in considering the necessary increases in wages which have been made within the last few years.  A reconsideration now of the tax on one or two commodities would certainly not give the relief which the speech of the Deputy would indicate. It would not give the relief to these people he has in mind.  The actual purpose of the resolution, as I see it, would be that in order to relieve the poorer classes of, say, £50,000 in the year, he would relieve a much richer order in the community by £350,000 in the year.  If you pass along some of the principal shops in this city you see occasionally wedding cakes and other expensive sweets of one sort or another, confectionery, etc.  I do not know that any of the people who purchase these articles really mind whether a particular commodity is one halfpenny a pound dearer or not, and they are to be relieved, I suppose, of seven or eight times as much of these taxes as the poorer class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it comes to this, that we want this £400,000.  This is not the time nor the opportunity for seeking to impose an import duty on every class of goods <Col N="387" /> that enter the country.  It would be almost an impossibility to arrange this particular imposition on imports right off, and it would not be possible to estimate what real damage might be done, not alone to the business of the country, but to employment, etc., by seeking to get this from another source.  I do not know whether the Deputy has considered if other countries are paying as heavy a rate of Income Tax as is paid here.  I am sure the Deputy will admit that Income Tax will not admit of any further extension; that is to say, we have certainly struck the maximum amount we can possibly collect, that it is a damper on business to have an Income Tax at such a price, and if we do not get from that section of the community as large a proportion of our entire revenue as is collected from that particular order in New Zealand, it is evidently because that order is not here in such numbers or proportions as in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it would be any inducement to that order to remain here, if it were known that in this, its first year, Saorstát Eireann introduced a Budget as an act of grace to the community which would benefit it to the extent of 12½, or possibly 10, per cent. in order to popularise the Dáil and the Government <Col N="388" /> with that particular section of the community.  You are going to relieve one section of the community from taxation which must be extracted from some other portion of the community.  I do not think that it was altogether a good parallel to introduce the case of New Zealand, and I would suggest to the Deputy to consider some country nearer home.  I think if he will examine the case of Scotland, he will find that the Revenue there is much heavier than that collected here.  The question we have to consider is that although our taxation of the population is higher per head than most of the countries on the continent if the rate of expenditure be kept at its present level a still greater imposition must be placed, not alone on one order but on every section of the community.  It is not good business without an examination of the problem, and without seeing how far it is possible for any order to bear any additional taxation, to reduce now at a moment one particular commodity to such an extent that it benefits nobody, but does serious damage to the Exchequer.  I do not think that we could even consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Orders, the Dáil now goes into Committee on the Seanad Amendments, to which certain Amendments have been proposed.  I take it these amendments are in the hands of Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The first amendment is to add at the end of sub-section 3, after the word &ldquo;application,&rdquo; the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And may in such notice state the grounds on which the application for a re-hearing is made, and whether the fact that the applicant suffered an injury in respect of which he would be entitled to compensation on the re-hearing is or is not disputed, and if such fact is not disputed, the notice aforesaid may also contain an offer of such compensation (either subject to or free from a re-instatement condition) as the Minister shall deem proper, and in case such offer or any amended offer is accepted within fourteen days after service of the notice aforesaid, or such further time as the Minister for Finance may allow, a decree shall, subject to the provisions of subsections (5) and (6) of this section and to the provisions of this Act relating to re-instatement conditions, be made for the amount of the compensation mentioned in the offer or amended offer so accepted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move to agree with this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister advance any reason why we should accept this amendment, or is he formally moving it as a practical indication to us to refuse to accept the Seanad amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a motion to agree with the Seanad amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made in the Seanad was that they were entitled to know the reason why the Minister for Finance would object to a decree that has been already given and which it is proposed to have reheard.  Now, considering that, we came to the conclusion that it was reasonable that grounds should be stated for the application by the Minister for Finance for rehearing in these cases, and further it appeared also reasonable that if an offer to settle were made and accepted, that the case might be closed.  It would, perhaps, save the State a considerable amount of money in expenses, and the fact that there was finality in the case, might suggest to all the persons affected the advisability of coming to terms at once.  Anything which has a character of finality about it appeals to people.  I do not say that there are a large number of cases that require to be heard&mdash;but, at any rate it will give <Col N="391" /> us an opportunity of getting them out of the way, and the case put in the Seanad appeared to be perfectly reasonable and one which we could scarcely resist, and for that reason we accept it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to agree with the next amendment also which is to insert after the word &ldquo;charge,&rdquo; Sub-section (5) (<i>d</i>) the words &ldquo;to the building to be erected pursuant to such re-instatement condition, so that such assignment, mortgage, or charge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is essential; it was left out of the Bill through some error, and we got it inserted by the Seanad. There was no objection, and I take it there will be no objection here.</P>

      <P>The Bill as passed by the Dáil contained these words, but, by a printers' error, the copies sent to the Seanad did not contain these words, and they were inserted in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to agree with Amendment No. 3 which is to delete Sub-section 8, and to insert in lieu thereof a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On any rehearing under this section the judge may, in addition to the costs of such rehearing, award to the applicant the whole or such part as the judge shall consider reasonable, of the costs incurred by the applicant of or incidental to the previous application, and the costs so awarded shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the costs of the rehearing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in connection with the costs in the previous case.  The individual who has a claim for compensation may have paid out the whole of the cost of the previous hearing.  In that case he is, to some extent, a doubly aggrieved person, because he has lost his property, and he has lost also the costs, and the provision here is that the cost so awarded shall be paid in <Col N="392" /> the same time and manner as the costs of the rehearing.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment is to add at the end of Section (8) a new Sub-section as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This section shall not apply to any decree made in respect of an injury to which this part of this Act applies, where such decree has been varied or affirmed upon an appeal, at the hearing of which the local authority or authorities concerned were represented and <i>bonâ fide</i> opposed the decree.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment for which there was some case made here, and it deals with cases which had to be dealt with in the Appeal Courts, and which went before the courts and where a <i>bonâ fide</i> opposition was offered.  I think Deputy Fitzgibbon made a strong plea here for these costs.  We objected at the time, but the case put in the Seanad was a strong one, and we found it hard to resist it.  I move to agree with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I would like, if we could, to accept all the amendments the Seanad put up, but it is not possible.  There is only one to which a modified amendment is being put forward.  We are really only putting forward two amendments to all the amendments that the Seanad put up. One amendment that we are putting up makes it clear what the mover of it in the Seanad had in his mind, and which, we are advised, might not in its present form meet the view that he had in mind. It is not necessary to say that the Seanad represents an Order which has suffered very considerably within the last twelve or eighteen months, and as such their attitude reflects more clearly the mind of the persons affected.  All the amendments that they have put down are, generally, having regard to the circumstances of the cases, accepted by us except the one I have mentioned. In this particular instance a person has, in the first case, to go to the ordinary County Court to have the case heard, and then to go to the Court of Appeal.  The case is heard there and the Judge either varies or affirms the decree, and it is asked that we should accept this decree.  At first we were inclined to object, but after the case that was put up for it by the mover <Col N="393" /> in the Seanad we have decided to accept it, and in that spirit we put it forward here.  It is a concession, and as we have given a concession we give it to them graciously, and I move the amendment accordingly.</P>

      <P>In the last line of the amendment, as it appears on the Paper before me, there is an obvious misprint.  The word I refer to ought to be &ldquo;opposed,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;opposite,&rdquo; as it appears in the printed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to agree with Amendment No. 5, to delete Sub-section (1), in Section 9, and to insert in Sub-section (2), line 20, after the word &ldquo;Acts,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Judge that the applicant connived at, assisted in, or actively facilitated the committal of the injury or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was felt that the Judge might possibly object to any decree being given unless it were shown that people gave active opposition to the commission of an injury.  I do not exactly remember whether Deputy Johnson thought that we were a bit severe in this particular Section at the time.  We are agreeable now to accept this amendment, and I accordingly move it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment (No. 6) from the Seanad is:&mdash;To add at the end of the Sub-section (1) (ii.) the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided always that, when a partial re-instatement condition has been attached to the decree, an applicant may, within three months of the making of the decree, submit to the judge a scheme setting out an alternative proposal for rebuilding anywhere in the Free State&mdash; up to not less than the amount of compensation to which the reinstatement condition is attached&mdash;a building or buildings; and if the judge is satisfied such scheme, with or without modification (hereinafter called the scheme) serves a housing need, he may substitute a condition approving the scheme for the partial reinstatement condition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> We agree with the sense of this amendment, which, I think, would be acceptable to Deputy Johnson also.  There is certainly a doubt as to the expression in the last two lines of the amendment to &ldquo;substitute a condition approving the scheme for the partial reinstatement condition.&rdquo; It is open to question whether the amendment would give effect to the purpose that the Senator moving it had in mind.  He had in mind that the judge would be entitled to vary the decree, but that is not clear from it.  We propose to amend this amendment to make it read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided always that whenever a partial reinstatement condition is attached to a decree, the person by whom such condition is to be performed may, at any time within three months after the date of the decree, submit to the judge a scheme for the application of the compensation to which the condition is attached in or towards the erection of a building or buildings of a residential character at any specified place in Saorstât Eireann in lieu of the substituted buildings specified in the decree, and if the judge is satisfied that the building or buildings specified in such scheme will be suitable to the neighbourhood in which it is proposed to erect the same, and that there is a demand in that neighbourhood for buildings of that character the judge shall amend the partial reinstatement condition attached to his decree by substituting therein the building or buildings specified in such scheme for the substituted building originally specified in the decree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In essence the amendment we propose amounts to this, that a man who has a claim for property, that is in the nature of a white elephant, proposes a housing scheme for some other part of the country. It is sought by this amendment to get the judge to award, in respect of the substituted buildings, the amount that he would have decreed for the property that was in the nature of a white elephant.  To that extent it is an advantage, because it gives you something practical and something useful, and it gives some advantage to the community.  Any relief in connection with housing just now is certainly an advantage to the State.  I accordingly move the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In every case in which it is lawful for the judge under this section to attach a full reinstatement condition to his decree, the judge shall observe the following rules:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  If the injured building was situate in Upper Sackville Street, in the City of Dublin, or was before the injury ordinarily used for the purpose of any trade or business, the judge shall attach a full reinstatement condition to his decree;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  If, in any case not coming within the foregoing rule, the judge is of opinion that the injury to the building has not materially prejudiced the economic welfare of the district, and the applicant does not show reasonable cause why a full reinstatement condition should be attached to the decree, the judge shall not attach a full reinstatement condition to his decree.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(c)</i>  In any case not coming within either of the foregoing rules, the judge may attach a full reinstatement condition to his decree if, in all the circumstances of the case, he thinks it reasonable so to do;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(d)</i>  In considering whether it is reasonable to attach a full reinstatement condition to his decree, the judge shall have regard to the use ordinarily made of the building before the injury, and shall not have regard to any proposal for a different future use of the building if reinstated.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I understand that the words &ldquo;Upper Sackville Street&rdquo; have been used because that is still the legal name, but inasmuch as the majority of the people do not know where &ldquo;Upper Sackville Street&rdquo; is, we had better define it as &ldquo;commonly known as Upper O'Connell Street.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 8.  I think really that we should take Amendments No. 8 and 9 together. They are:&mdash;To insert after the word &ldquo;but,&rdquo; Sub-section (8), line 51, the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Nevertheless so that</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  in any case in which the injured building was at or about the time of the injury ordinarily maintained as a residence for the applicant or his family, the total amount of the compensation shall not be less than the probable cost of the erection of the substituted building; and</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  in every other case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (9).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 8 is an amendment which has been settled by agreement for the purpose of replacing Sub-section 9.  I think the Dáil should take these two together.  I think it was rather a pity that No. 9 was taken out, because it gave a certain security to persons affected, which they will not possess now.  However, that view did not appeal to the members of the Seanad, and these two amendments have been put in.  There is a slight objection to it.  It is not, however, very material.  It deals with partial reinstatement, and, from that point of view, it might be open to question whether the probable cost of the erection of the substituted building <Col N="397" /> might be criticised.  As everybody who has had to repair, or who has gone in for partial reinstatement knows, the estimate never really amounts to the cost. The actual cost always exceeds it.  When that particular work is done one never has got as good a house as where there would be total reinstatement.  For that reason there is a case for the acceptance of the amendment.  I am accepting it in the spirit in which we agreed to the whole.  The two amendments hang together.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 10.</P>
    <P>To insert immediately after Sub-section (17) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a full reinstatement condition is attached to a decree under this section, and such condition requires the erection of a new building, and the site of the injured building is not situated in a city, town or urban district, then, and in any such case, the condition may provide for the erection of the new building near to, instead of on, the site of the injured building.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 is a case in which one would prefer another situation for the reconstruction of a new house, and the note that I have on this is &ldquo;that there is no financial objection.&rdquo; It really gives a little latitude that was not clear before.  As there is no objection I move to agree with it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 11 is to delete Sub-section (3) of Section 11, which now reads, &ldquo;this Section applies to the documents aforesaid, whether the same were in the possession of the applicant as being the person legally entitled to the custody thereof, or as being Solicitor for such person or as holding such documents for such persons for safe custody only.&rdquo;  It specified as we thought certain matters in connection with the possession of the documents.  It was held that there might be other persons than those, and that possibly a person might not get compensation accordingly. It does not weaken the Section, and it does not give them any advantage which it was not desired to give them.  Accordingly <Col N="398" /> we have no objection to urge against it and I move to agree with it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 12 is an amendment by the Seanad to Section 13 It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of Sub-section (3), line 35, the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that where compensation is payable partly in securities and partly in money, securities shall be taken at their nominal face value in discharge of such debts or other sums of money as aforesaid, and no deduction shall be made from any money payable as compensation until the total amount of securities payable as compensation shall have been exhausted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a case in which it is provided that where there is deduction for debts &ldquo;or other sums of money as aforesaid no deduction shall be made from any money payable as compensation until the total amount of securities payable as compensation shall have been exhausted.&rdquo;  I think that is an unreasonable amendment.  It ought not to have been put up.  It discloses some misgivings with regard to the securities that we are going to issue, and I think it is scarcely fair that these securities should be discounted in advance.  It was not our intention to issue securities which under normal circumstances would be at a discount at the start.  They are not set out in this Bill unfairly I think to persons who will get the decrees.  The whole of the amount of the reinstatement cost of a building will be paid in cash; securities will be issued in respect to damage to furniture in certain proportions which have been already explained. To pay Income tax, land annuities and even rates by means of these securities is, I think, scarcely accepting in good faith all the protestations and the attempts we have made in this Bill to deal fairly with the persons affected.  These persons had legal claims and legal rights against the local authorities.  Everybody knows what the value of those legal rights were.  We have not put in legal rights here to penalise local bodies, but we put in what was wanted to help those people claiming compensation.  I think it was unreasonable to put up this amendment <Col N="399" /> to it.  But as it has been put up we accept it.  We accept it to this extent that we will take other means to get in cash in connection with those things.  I have no hesitation in telling them that.  I accordingly move to agree with it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 13.</P>
    <P>To add at the end of Sub-section (6) the words:&mdash;&ldquo;and such security so issued shall be accepted at par of exchange in payment of death duties payable to the late Provisional Government of Ireland or the Government of Saorstát Eireann, or any department or authority of either of these Governments.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular amendment has been sent down from the Seanad.  I was prepared to accept it, but I find on consideration that it might involve the entire discharge of Death Duties by means of these securities.  It was our intention that these securities would be redeemed within five years.  We moved in connection with the financial arrangements about the securities that redemption would take place within five years. Now, it is proposed in the amendment by the Seanad, that any person, or, at least, the representatives of any person could discharge all the duties to the State under what is called Death Duties by means of these securities.  It might mean that within the next twelve months we would get back all these securities.  Deputies know that we have estimated upon a certain amount of money coming into the Exchequer during the next twelve months, and that we estimated hard cash. At the time that we produced the estimated receipts and expenditure for the coming year we certainly had in mind hard cash.  Now, the securities coming in even at a nominal discount, and there ought not be even a nominal discount on these securities, is scarcely fair.  It is possible that people would put them all on the market within the first twelve months.  In that case there would almost inevitably be a discount, and it would be open to interested persons to buy those at a considerable discount and discharge obligations to the State at a considerable profit to the particular estate they are dealing with.  We estimated on receiving something in the nature of £1,000,000 next year.  That means when we have <Col N="400" /> compensated certain persons with securities which we intended to redeem within five years, it is open to every person who is in debt to the State to go into the market and buy these securities, probably at a discount, and then go to the State and say this is in full discharge.</P>
      <P>The amendment we are putting up suggests that the Minister for Finance will prescribe certain conditions and that these securities would be accepted in respect of the estate of the original holder or in respect of any subsequent holder who was a registered holder of such security for not less than 12 months previous to his death.  That shows that they will be held for some time and that one cannot go out into the market and buy them.  I thought at first the amount was not so considerable, but finding it was a million pounds I was advised by the responsible officers that they could not stand over the amendment as it came from the Seanad.  I regret that, but it cannot be helped.  I think we are meeting them as fairly as we can in any promise or undertaking given, if there were any such.  It must be understood that one has not got the power to give more than one can afford.  If we could afford it we would agree to that amendment. We cannot afford it.  It would mean raising money at a time when we must get in twenty millions on loan within the next twelve months.  This would mean an additional million.  We are giving all we can afford to give.  No more is given in the case of the British Government in connection with Victory Bonds, and even the British Government did not give that particular concession until after they had raised a very considerable amount of money by other means.  It was not on their first loan or even their second, it was much later. Members who were at large during the time these loans were being raised would be, perhaps, more at ease discussing this matter.  However, we ought not to be asked in our very first year, when we have not as yet raised a penny, to give a concession that the British Government did not give.  I think we are meeting the Seanad fairly in that.  I hope it will be accepted in the same spirit in the Seanad.  I accordingly move to amend No. 13 to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;And such security shall subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed <Col N="401" /> by the Minister for Finance be accepted at its nominal face value in payment of all duties payable to the Revenue Commissioners of Saorstát Eireann by or in respect of the death of the person to whom such security was issued or in respect of the death of any subsequent holder who had been the registered holder of such security for not less than twelve months previous to his death.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The only part about this amendment to the Seanad amendment that I suggest requires rather fuller explanation from the Minister than he has already afforded the Dáil is in reference to the expression &ldquo;subject to such condition as shall be prescribed by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; That is a very wide latitude to give in advance.  It could have been hoped that an expression so wide as that would be more fully defined in advance.  The conditions might be such, in effect, as to delimit what the Seanad has claimed out of all existence.  I am perfectly sure that is not the intention, but though it may not be the intention at the moment, it is a temptation left open to any future consideration by the Ministry.  The main matter as it appears to my mind is that either this issue is going to stand at par value or it is not going to stand at par value.  If it is going to stand at a discount, then there is some fault with regard to the original issuances.  If there is no fault in the original issuances then the Ministry responsible for that issue should be responsible for that default. If there is no discount then it merely means that the Ministry has to accept one form of loan in preference to another. The Ministry has stated if it should be the case that Death Duties are in default to the sum of £1,000,000 because that entire million that has been estimated for is going to be put forward in the shape of these issues rather than in the shape of cash, a certain debt will have to be incurred and a certain loan made in respect of that debt.  After all what are those bonds, or whatever they will be called in future, but a form of debt?  It merely means that if in respect of death duties certain bonds are going to be tendered rather than cash, the Minister is put to the necessity of raising a loan in respect of them; he has to change the category of the loan <Col N="402" /> from A to B, but the loan remains the same.  That is a further consideration that I put before the Minister.  The main consideration is, however, that it is unwise in moving an amendment to the Seanad amendment not to make it more specific.  The Seanad amendment is at least very specific and precise, and if a further amendment is put forward it should at least be equally specific and precise.  Nobody can say that the phrase I have referred to is either specific or precise.</P>

      <P>I think that the reason given by the Minister for Finance will go a long way to justify it in the eyes of most people, subject to the Clause to which the last speaker referred. That, I think, raises a considerable difficulty.  It is obviously undesirable in the first place to give wide and unlimited powers to the Minister, and in the second place the successor, for the time being, of the Minister will not bind himself by anything that is not definitely in the Statute&mdash;by any undertaking given, for instance, by the present Minister for Finance.  I suggest the difficulty might be got over by inserting instead of the words &ldquo;Minister for Finance,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;Oireachtas.&rdquo;  The document as drawn up is undoubtedly open to very serious objections.  The present Minister cannot answer for what may be done hereafter. If you leave the imposing of conditions in the hands of the Oireachtas it would, in my opinion, rectify the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance who laid down the regulations being replaced by another Minister would not really change the conditions.  It would be very unreasonable.  He issues them under certain conditions.  One reason why it is objected to is that supposing redemption in five years was agreed to, and one-fifth were taken up each year either by drawings or by certain numbers&mdash;say fives one year, fours the next year, threes the next year, twos the next year, and ones the last year, and so on, this amendment ment of the Seanad cuts right across such an arrangement as that, and it would be impossible, when you would not have any idea or estimate of the securities that were to come in in the coming year, or the second year, or the third year.  It would be impossible to arrange for the redemption of an exact amount in each particular year.  Deputy Figgis may be <Col N="403" /> all right in his own way about his suggestions, but I have yet to learn that it is as easy to raise £21,000,000 as £20,000,000.  I have always found, if I wanted to borrow £20 that it was easier than to borrow £21.  Deputy Figgis may have greater facilities.  Certainly that is the experience of most men, and even with a State like this that £1,000,000 is a considerable amount.  The length of time that we are prescribing for these particular securities is not an unreasonable time.  That was in our minds from the very commencement.  I do not know that it will be what we will do eventually, but that has been all the time before us, that five years' redemption. I cannot guarantee it, but that was certainly in our minds, and redemption at that period should certainly not leave them at a discount.  But they could be at a discount, a big discount, the very moment that they would be issued, particularly if Deputies were to speak like Deputy Figgis, or that you were to take as Gospel what appears in some respectable journals published in this city.  I think Deputies know what I mean when I say that.</P>

      <P>Whatever my support is worth I would like to give it to this amendment.  There is one thing we must be very careful about and that is that we do not issue securities with which the enemy can play.  I need not specifically say who are the enemy in this case.  In all societies certain financiers are natural sharks, and if, as in this case, certain people who have suffered injury are compensated and are paid part of the compensation in terms of scrip, there will be naturally a desire on their part to realise their securities if there is anyone to take them up.  Under these special circumstances there would be an inducement to have them on the market and to have them bought, and I can easily conceive a syndicate being formed to depreciate these securities by the re-sale and re-sale again of them at a very considerable discount.  We might be put to considerable trouble as regards our financial securities by people playing with these securities.  It is, therefore, very desirable that in whatever <Col N="404" /> form they are issued the greatest measure of precaution that is possible should be taken to keep them as near par as they have been originally issued.  We all know the practice of the British Government, which is a very old hand in this game.  The Victory Bonds, to which the Minister alluded, are at the present moment at a price which gives the advantage to present purchasers of having an opportunity of their Bonds being drawn and winning what is an effective premium, namely, being redeemed at a higher price than the market price.  The difference between the market price at the present hour and redemption is so slight that there is very little inducement to speculate.  It was originally proposed, I remember, that holders of these Bonds should be permitted to pay off their indebtedness to the State in terms of them.  You can see how pleasant it would be to buy from a needy compensated holder of property that has been injured and pay my arrears of Income Tax with them at par. It is a most delightful process, but not for the Finance Minister.  So that it seems to me the most objectionable feature in the amendment of the Seanad is the proposal that they should be accepted by the Minister for Finance at par, and the important element in the amendment proposed here is that they should be at their nominal face value, whatever that may be.  If it is at par so much the better both for the holder and for the reputation of our scrip in the market.</P>

      <P>May I say with regard to the criticism suggested by the Minister that I had suggested it was just as easy to borrow £21,000,000 as £20,000,000, that the real criticism is that we have undertaken, or that the necessity has been imposed upon us of undertaking a loan of £20,000,000.  If this amendment were to be passed the Minister suggests that an additional £1,000,000 would be imposed upon us making a loan of £21,000,000 instead of £20,000,000.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that there will be £21,000,000 whether the amendment be or be not passed.  It is simply that the extra £1,000,000 is a loan under quite a different category.  It is under a compulsory category rather than a voluntary category, and I do urge that it is very <Col N="405" /> much better for us to anticipate loans under a voluntary category rather than loans under a compulsory category.</P>

      <P>Is not the Deputy deluding himself into the idea that because of the favourable terms to the State these Bonds can be issued by way of part payment of compensation and that they should be, by the manipulative jugglery that he suggests, put into the same category as stock for which the public would bid or subscribe in a free market?  They are quite different.  The President has already explained the necessity in the infant State of our meeting those obligations now, not by the ready money which we have not got, but by Bonds the issue of which is to be under conditions to be determined by him.  The two things are not merely two categories, but two categories devised for two wholly different purposes.  When you issue stock in the market you make it as attractive as you can.  In this other case we are making it as economical in the interest of the State as we can.</P>

Certain County Councils immediately or during the intervening periods repaired these roads and bridges out of funds levied by them or in their possession. To some extent, if we were to consider the position of the roads and bridges now, some of these bodies that made the repairs might be prejudiced.  This amendment was moved by a member of a County Council, and I think also by a member of an Urban Council, and its object is to give an opportunity of considering the claims of such Councils.

I suggest that much of the argument used in favour of this provision in the Dáil is going to be nullified if we accept the amendment.  I would like some assistance in this matter as to whether, in the view of the Minister, the acceptance of this amendment of the Seanad is going to reduce to any considerable degree the amount likely to be spent on the repair or remaking of roads during the twelve months.</P>

      <P>In the first part of the Act there was an amendment during, I think, the Report Stage, that it should not prejudice any person presenting a claim before the Compensation Commission, usually described as the Shaw Commission.  That wiped out any person's right under the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Act in respect of claims up to the 21st July, 1921, the date of the Truce, and all these cases are being reviewed by the Shaw Commission. Now we wipe out in this Act claims in respect of personal injuries, and this particular section is simply a parallel to the amendment that was subsequently moved in connection with Part 1, and says: &ldquo;This section shall not prevent the presentation or prosecution of a claim to or before any Commission of Inquiry in respect of an injury to which the Acts hereby repealed apply.&rdquo;  It does not weaken it, but, on the other hand, I think strengthens it.

      <P>The circumstances under which the introduction of this Bill is necessitated are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The present Scheme of Unemployment Benefit, which is an Emergency Scheme, provides that in the period from 2nd November, 1922, to 1st July, 1923, not more than 22 weeks' benefit could be drawn.  At the end of the period namely, 1st July, the normal Unemployment Insurance Scheme would come into operation.  It will be appreciated that those who began to draw benefit on or about 2nd November last exhaust the 22 weeks on or about April 4th, and will have no provision made for them during the three months thereafter to 1st July. When 1st July comes, a large number of them would have so few contributions to their credit as to entitle them only to a few weeks' benefit under the normal Insurance Scheme.  The Bill, accordingly, proposes to make provision for the gap between April 4th and the 1st July, and while terminating what is known as Uncovenanted Benefit, that is to say, Benefit not supported by contributions, to give a temporarily enhanced value to the contributions which unemployed workers have to their credit, and thus enable them to draw more benefit than if the normal relation of contributions to benefit was in operation.  The Bill covers only the period to 17th October next, and is, therefore, in the nature of an emergency measure.  I beg to move accordingly.</P>

The only purpose of this amendment is to ensure that annually the Dáil shall be reminded specifically of the fact that we have bound ourselves to pay, and are paying annually, a sum of £10,000 as salary to the Governor-General.  There is a possibility, I think, if the Clause passes as it is printed, that we may forget that this luxury has to be paid for, and while we are bound by enactment to continue paying it, I think it should be brought to our notice periodically for our soul's sake, as you put a text in a bedroom, so that we may have a reminder that we are paying for the office of Governor-General. Otherwise we might be apt to think that the yearly salary is to be a charge on the funds of the British Exchequer, in the same way as we are told <Col N="410" /> his pension will necessarily be a charge on the British Exchequer.  I do not want future Parliaments to be in that ignorant state, but that we shall realise year by year that we are paying for the Governor-General's salary, and that the amount shall be brought to the notice of the Dáil when the Dáil is asked to vote annual sums of money.

It reported a question that was put in the legislature of some other country, not very far away, which may seem a strange place for putting questions with regard to matters which really concern ourselves, and concern nobody else.  Nevertheless, the question was put as to whether the Governor-General, in addition to getting these quarterly payments that are referred to in the amendment amounting to the yearly sum of £10,000, was to receive a certain pension; that it was a pensionable office.  That does not exactly appear in any part of the Constitution and it is not expounded in the text of the Constitution.  I do not believe that it was within the intention of those who passed the Constitution.  I mean that he receives £10,000 a year, and that he signs certain necessary documents before participating in his punch at night, and sleeps thereafter, and that that is the end of the liability.</P>

      <P>Nobody is better informed on this point than Deputy Figgis, who is aware that the reason why this salary has to be paid is because it is a part of the Treaty, and it is embodied in the Constitution.  We pay the salary to the Governor-General of the Free State which is paid to the Governor-General of one of the Dominions which is specified.  The amount paid there is £10,000, and the piece of information which Deputy Figgis, who knows all concerning these questions, pretends to have learned only a few days ago from a newspaper, is that the office of Governor-General, according to practice, is pensionable, not out of the funds of the Dominion to which he belongs, but out of Imperial Funds, so that, whether the pension is much or little, or whether it has to be paid this wise or otherwise, it does not affect this question at all.  It is wholly a question, as regards the present amendment, of whether the money is to be paid out of the Central Fund or in precisely the same fashion as the upkeep of the Governor-General's Establishment is to be paid for according to this Bill.  I wonder will there be anyone hereafter in the Free State who will be under the impression that only the upkeep of the Governor-General's Establishment is being paid for out of our taxes?  Surely the future citizens of the Free State will not be so devoid of interest in its origin <Col N="412" /> and the circumstances under which Deputy Figgis and other eminent citizens framed the Constitution, for it to be wholly forgotten.  I do not believe that it will be really necessary to have this writing on the wall, this text in the bedroom which Deputy Johnson describes. It is a grievance that we should have to pay it, no matter out of what fund it comes, and grievances have never been forgotten by the Irish people.  I prefer to have the two sums provided differently in order to conform to what is the actual situation.  The one in accordance with the Treaty is a fixed sum which we undertook to pay, and the other is a variable sum which will differ according as the cost of living may differ, and will differ according as the equipment and upkeep will differ, and it is to be determined by the Minister for Finance, who will keep a very watchful eye, no doubt, on that expenditure but no scrutiny or supervision of the Minister for Finance can make the £10,000 less.  £10,000 is the sum fixed by Treaty to be paid, and, consequently, it is a very poor consolation for those who have to pay it, if the form has to be gone through each year of voting it. I really submit to you, sir, with all respect to Deputy Johnson, that to bring it in as an annual vote is rather to force upon it the character of a voluntary subscription.  If it has to be paid as a Treaty obligation, why not pay it as a Treaty obligation instead of giving it another character?</P>

It is, I suggest, pertinent to enquire if these are the entire and total sums that shall be paid quarterly in respect of Governors-General, because if the statement made, which I hope will be corrected, that this State is liable for certain pensions, then the sums set down in the amendment will be requisite not for the particular Governor-General at that time in existence, but for Governors-General, because there will be superannuated Governors-General in respect of whom certain moneys will have to be paid.  I believe it is fair, as Deputy Professor Magennis has stated, that this charge of pensions, if it is made at all, <Col N="413" /> will have to be made as an Imperial charge, and not by this State.  I believe that is correct, but I also believe that an endeavour will be made to mulct this State with it unless a specific statement to the contrary is made, and unless that specific statement to the contrary is made here when we are considering this Bill.</P>

      <P>Is it not generally understood, whether it is a fact or not I am not sure, that certain deductions are made from the salaries of Civil Servants which are used for the payment of superannuations? Are we to take it that the total salary of £10,000 is subject to certain deductions or that the £10,000 is the sum after these deductions have been made?</P>

      <P>I am asking, sir, for a sum of £10,000, commencing on the 6th day of December, 1922, to be charged on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof, and to be paid to the Governor-General by way of salary so long as ever such Governor-General shall continue to hold that office.  That is what I am asking.  If you ask me does that £10,000 include the payment of the next Governor-General, and the one after him, if there should be three in the year, I say that it is the salary of the Governor-General. That is all I am asking for.  It is that particular amount, not a penny more and not a penny less, and it is by reason of the agreement we came to in London, which agreement was for a fixed charge for salary.  It is not to come up here every year.  It is on the Central Fund as such, and a judge is in the same position.  That is the agreement we made and that is the agreement we are carrying out, and I think we are entitled to carry it out.  As I said before, if there was anything objectionable on the one side there was also something objectionable on the other side, and it is right to say that, as far as the other side are concerned, they have not, as often as we have, made objection to the parts of the bargain that were objectionable, and they have accepted it in good faith.  Now, this Section is necessary for making things clear for the Comptroller and <Col N="414" /> Auditor-General.  It carries out Article 60 of the Constitution, and it carries it out in good faith, in the same good faith in which that Article was passed. It states in that that the Governor-General's salary shall be of the like amount as that now paid to the Governor-General of Australia, and shall be chargeable to the public funds of the Free State. That is exactly what we are doing, carrying it out according to the spirit and the letter of the Article.  It is not unreasonable that within four or five months after the passing of that Constitution that we should seek to carry out the terms of it, and it is scarcely fair that we should seek to amend it.</P>

The provision made that the Minister for Finance shall determine &ldquo;to be suitable&rdquo; gives the Dáil a check upon unreasonable expenditure, because the Minister must explain, and must be in a position to defend, any charge.  If there be an unreasonable charge it would be open to the Dáil so to determine and to limit, if necessary, or alter the amount that would be asked for by the Minister for Finance.  Any such sums will have to come before the Dáil, and will have to be sanctioned and passed by the Dáil.  That also carries out the Article of the Constitution which deals with this.</P>

The proposition is to put into words what the Minister himself has given expression to a few moments ago.  The Constitution has been agreed to.  It was more or less of a bargain, and by virtue of that bargain we are providing this salary.  That is what I want to say in the Preamble.  I submit it is an important point in regard to the draft as presented to us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's form of the Preamble has the great <Col N="416" /> merit of being correct history.  This is a historical matter.  It is not by volition of the Dáil that this is done; it is through the operation of the Treaty.  I suggested already on the Second Reading that first the Preamble should recite that &ldquo;Whereas by the Treaty this office is created,&rdquo; and then read &ldquo;Whereas by Article 60 of the Constitution,&rdquo; etc.  I think in the interests of historical accuracy that Deputy Johnson's amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's amendment does not seem to me to have any merit of historical accuracy which the Preamble as it stands has not.  The Dáil did resolve and did provide that the salary of the Governor-General should be so much.  It is not laid down in the Treaty what the salary of the Governor-General should be.  That was done by resolution of the Dáil following negotiations. Deputy Johnson's amendment seems to me to be a counsel that wherever a thing may be done with bad grace instead of good grace it should be done with bad grace.  I believe, when it is something we agreed on, that it should be done with good grace.  It seems to me there is a certain amount of Rip Van Winkleism in connection with the attitude of some of us towards the position of the Governor-General.  The fears that Miss Mary MacSwiney conjured up on a certain occasion seem not yet, in some minds, to have been allayed.</P>

As the President has said, in everything in connection with this particular matter the British have dealt with us in the most friendly and reasonable way, and they have behaved with the best of good grace in the entire matter.  Even apart from that, I do not think that it is a dignified attitude to be doing things with a bad grace when we might do them with good grace.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Johnson on bringing this and the other amendments forward, because in this Preamble it is desirable we should emphasize the fact that Article 60 of the <Col N="417" /> Constitution stands as it is.  Deputies who were here will recollect a very strange phenomenon, and that is, that despite efforts on the part of certain Deputies, the Ministry absolutely refused to consent to make that Article tally with a similar one in the Dominion Constitution.  My recollection is that it was pointed out that in the three Constitutions express provision was made to the effect that the salary of the Governor-General should be changeable as to amount whenever the Dominion thought proper.  For reasons that I have not yet been able to fathom, that was omitted. Therefore, this amendment is to be encouraged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another consideration that ought to be given to this amendment.  The proposition is in the draft as presented, &ldquo;whereas Dáil Eireann has resolved and by Article 60 of the Constitution provided.&rdquo;  This is a Bill of the Oireachtas, and the resolution which preceded the Constitution was a decision of what we called Dáil Eireann, but what was called officially the Provisional Parliament.  As this is to be an Act of the Oireachtas, a mere resolution of this Dáil or of a succeeding Dáil, as it might appear in the future reading of the Bill, will not bind the Parliament itself to pass the Bill.  So that, apart from any other consideration, it seems to me to be inadvisable to insert in the Preamble that &ldquo;Dáil Eireann has resolved,&rdquo; to be followed by the words, &ldquo;and by Article 60 of the Constitution provided.&rdquo;  After all, Article 60, speaking strictly and legally, was decided before there was a Dáil Eireann according to the Constitution.  The Constitution that we have drafted was drafted by Dáil Eireann as we knew it, but by the Provisional Parliament as they across the water knew it, and to anybody reading the Act it would appear that it is the decision of Dáil Eireann, as now existing, to resolve that the salary shall be so and so.  To put in a Bill which has to go before the Seanad a statement that this Dáil has resolved, and that Article 60 of the Constitution provides for so and so, is not very respectful even to the Seanad.  We are asking the Seanad to agree to a Bill, and we say &ldquo;You are to agree to it because we passed a resolution in favour of it.&rdquo; I submit that that contention adds to the argument in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is rather interesting and surprising to hear Deputy Johnson trying to argue away the continuity of Dáil Eireann.  Article 35 of the Constitution provides &ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall, in relation to the subject matter of Money Bills as hereinafter defined, have legislative authority exclusive of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  This thing that was resolved and provided by the Constitution is a money matter, so that I think there is absolutely no bottom in the last argument of Deputy Johnson.</P>

I cannot share any fear expressed at any time in any assembly by Miss Mary MacSwiney because I am wholly unaware of what those fears might have been, and I am convinced <i>a priori</i> that even if I were aware of them, I should not share them.  What is really at issue here is, an obligation to pay this salary to the Officer of the Dominions known as Governor-General is an obligation imposed upon us by Treaty, and by subsequent legislation. The Provisional Parliament to which Deputy Johnson refers, and with which we have continuity unmistakeable, was to implement the Treaty.  In the course of implementing the Treaty by framing a Constitution, we provided in this Article 60 for payment of the Governor-General's <Col N="419" /> salary.  The determination of the salary was already arranged.  It was to be that payable to the Governor-General of Australia.  Now, at the time when this was being framed as an Article of the Constitution, a few of us debated the matter, and we tried to make an alteration in the terminology which would be favourable to the Free State, and we failed.  It will be said that we are trying to do now in some oblique fashion what we failed to do then.  That is not so.  We are trying to recite in the Preamble what exactly did occur, to wit, that whereas the Governor-Generalship was created in accordance with the Treaty, and in accordance with such provisions which are quite within the scope of anyone's research to find, that the salary was to be so and so, and whereas in accordance with those arrangements Article 60 was framed.  That, I submit, is a correct account, and to substitute in the name of better grace something more polite and more aesthetically commendable, a statement that it was within the resolution of this House is pure irony.  Only a slip was made here the Minister for Local Government would not defend it so tenaciously.</P>

      <P>I have to suggest that to say that &ldquo;it is not by virtue of the resolution of this Dáil,&rdquo; is to suggest that this Dáil had no option but to pass the resolution.  Now that might be said about every line and letter of the Constitution. It was made perfectly clear here that anything that was put up in that Constitution was put up for consideration of the Dáil, and the Dáil was perfectly free to do what it liked in the matter.  It did certain things, and amongst other things it passed this resolution. If it had not passed this resolution the money could not have been paid.  I merely put it that it is not calculated to increase the dignity of this Parliament to suggest that it was not a deliberative assembly, and had not a choice.  It had the choice with regard to the Constitution, and with regard to every clause of it, the choice that it had further back last December in the matter of the Treaty.  But we here in this building discussed the matter.  We were free to consider all the consequences, and we were free to come to our own decision both with regard to the Treaty <Col N="420" /> and with regard to the Constitution.  To those who were putting forward the Constitution, and were standing for it, it was urged that in this particular matter you might very well by standing on small points, by showing a difficult thorny disposition, lose something that was more than a point of wording, more than a point of phraseology, more than a point of abstract, of academic aesthetics, and that you might lose the selection that would be approved by the majority of the people of the country for that particular position.</P>
      <P>Now there was a disposition on the other side, when the late Mr. Griffith and myself were across negotiating, to be thorny on this matter on the grounds that it was the one thing they had left, that they had abandoned everything else, and that for them this was a valuable point, as for us it was the objectionable point of the Treaty.  That was the view they were entitled to take up, and we merely advised the Dáil that not giving way to their inclination with regard to those particular Clauses, and showing a rather truculent outlook on that matter, might not be the height of political wisdom.  The Dáil considered the representations that were made, and decided on a particular thing.  It is not true that they were not free to decide otherwise.  They were free, but they had decided this way, and it is by virtue of their resolutions that those things are set out now, they having considered representations made to them by those standing for the Constitution.</P>

I really feel that the argument he uses, that we were quite free to accept or reject his proposition, is very amusing when he tells us at the same time that it would be refused at a certain price, a certain cost.  We weighed the cost, and the Dáil decided that the price to be paid was not worth it, that we may as well accept it as pay the price of not accepting it.  The Minister may say that is freedom, but I do not think the Dáil believes it.  In any case, once the Minister speaks of a bargain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is their suggestion that this was a free choice, an act of our own volition. That is behind the Preamble; that makes him consider that it is better to pretend that it was a free choice, when we are all aware that it was not.  It is on record in the debates on the Constitution, and now in the statement made by the Minister himself, that it was not a free choice, in the sense that it was a formal voluntary act of the preceding Dáil.  I suggest that the Bill would not lose any of its value if the whole Preamble were struck out.  The purpose of the Preamble is to create an atmosphere <Col N="422" /> before you enter on the serious business to be discussed; at the same time the Minister himself tries to create that atmosphere, that here we have an act of grace, a free-will offering from the Dáil to the Governor-General.

      <P>No, unfortunately that is not so.  The discussions on the Financial Resolutions occupied even longer than I anticipated.  As I explained to the Deputies before, we have in hands quite a number of important Bills which embrace a very wide field, and which require very careful consideration. They have been approved of in principle, but the interpretations of them are not yet to hand.  Some of them will, I think, surprise Deputies when they come before them.  Others of them are almost in a state to be brought forward, but just require a few finishing touches, and although Deputies may not realise it, the amount of time taken here interferes a good deal with us in this initial stage.  If we were once well started I should say that it would not interfere, but in the midst of the work of the setting up of the Saorstát, <Col N="424" /> new departments had to be fixed up, and in some cases, as in the case of the Ministry of Finance, as is known, an almost new Department had to be reconstructed since this time last year. There is only one person on the staff now that was there at this time last year.  All that absorbs a good deal of time, and although there is cause for complaint on the part of Deputies, serious cause for complaint, I do say that we have not neglected our duty in any way that I know of.  We have done the best that is in us to provide business and to keep the Dáil going; but it would be unfair to the Dáil to put down business without having given it consideration beforehand.</P>

      <P>In that event I wish to say that I felt a certain regret, I am bound to say, when this motion was moved the other day.  I felt that regret because, in my opinion, for what it is worth, the intention that the mover had in mind might perhaps not best be achieved by such a motion as this. One realises, I think every Deputy in this Dáil must realise, the embarrassing difficulty with which the Government in this case was faced.  As the debate proceeded I felt, speaking for myself, that that difficulty and embarrassment had not been met in the least by the speeches from the Government side that such a motion as this brought forth.  I think, as a general principle, it must be agreed that if prisoners be taken by any Government, and those prisoners be rightfully and lawfully held by that Government, if such prisoners should undertake to hunger-strike to evade what is the natural and rightful function of Government, they should be prepared to endure to the finish whatever their actions might involve I have never believed&mdash;I say it now, and I said it before&mdash;in the policy of hunger-striking. I say now, as I said it before, when a certain hunger-strike rivetted the attention and drew the admiration of the whole world&mdash;and that was in the case of our friend and comrade Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork&mdash;I did not agree with it then.  I do not agree with that course of action now.  But we have to face the fact that it was then undertaken, and it is now being undertaken, and the charge and task before any Government that is worth the name of a Government, if it rightfully and lawfully <Col N="426" /> holds prisoners in its care, and those prisoners seek to evade the consequences of their unlawful and wrongful acts, might be very painful, but they must be prosecuted.  It will be perceived, as I have said, that such acts on behalf of Government must be lawful acts, and there must be rightful detention.  The Minister for Home Affairs, in speaking in this Chamber last Friday, desired that a general case should be stated, and that particular cases should not be given unfortunate and undue importance.  It is unfortunate, but I fear it is necessary, to examine the particular cases.  On the general position I agree with the point of view that he then stated.  I have agreed with it, and I have stated my agreement with it here to-day.  But when one descends from a general case to a particular case I think one moves on a ground that is altogether different.  We are not here, in the matter that is before our attention at the moment, faced by prisoners who have been held and charged and found guilty of certain offences, and have had sentence passed upon them in respect of proved offences, seeking to evade the natural consequences and the rightful and lawful consequences of their acts, seeking to escape from goal, where they should rightly be.  That may be proved to be the case in respect of the particular people who are actually at the present moment in fear of death.  But we do not know that it is so.  We do know that there are four or five women at the present moment who have undertaken this responsibility of abstaining from all food, and who, we believe, will keep their resolution to the very finish, to the tragic and terrible finish, because they hold that they are not rightfully in gaol.  Since these women went on hunger-strike&mdash;after they had undertaken the decision that to me cannot be regarded otherwise than with abhorrence&mdash;certain of them have had charges brought against them.  I have a copy of the charge sheet in respect of one of them in my hand at the moment, and that is Miss Costello.  The charge against her is this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Without proper authority having in her control documents calculated to be prejudicial to the safety of the State, in that she at No. 15 St. Joseph's Road, aforesaid, on the 27th March, 1923, had in her control Nos. <Col N="427" /> 87, 108, 84, 80, 121, 157, 129, 77, 79, and 148 of a publication called &lsquo;Poblacht na hEireann,&rsquo; which issues of said publication contained articles calculated to be prejudicial to the safety of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter in this particular case it is true that a certain file has been found.  I have made examination into this instance, and I learned that in the house in which she lived a certain file of &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann&rdquo; was discovered. That file was a complete file. Being a complete file it contained these numbers.  Now, she is not charged with having the file, but she is charged with the fact that in the file there were certain numbers and she is further charged with the fact that in those numbers a certain person who examined the file discovered articles that were prejudicial to the safety of the State.  In the first place it is known that this publication, &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann,&rdquo; has been on sale in Dublin for a good many months. Within the past few weeks I have had copies offered me for sale in O'Connell Street.  It was being sold publicly in the open day.  Any citizen was at liberty to purchase those copies as they were offered.  There was no statement made that it was an illegal publication.  There was no proclamation that it was a forbidden publication or that if anybody possessed it, he or she would be open to be charged.  Not at all.  These numbers were sold amongst them, and they contained articles that are alleged to be prejudicial to the safety of the State.</P>
    <P>I think is is perfectly fair and only right to the public at large that if a publication is offensive or seditious, that publication should be prohibited if it is calculated to be of a sort that does not contain fair and constitutional argument such as would be permitted in any State. If that can be proved against the paper, that paper should be, and under the Constitution could be, refused publication. That has not been done.  I raised the case at an earlier stage of a newsboy who was arrested for selling &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann.&rdquo; The newsboy had not the faintest glimmering of the politics of the country; he was merely selling the paper because it was provided for him to sell, and he undertook not to sell it again.  The case of Miss Costello might be the case of any other <Col N="428" /> citizen.  The house was raided, a file was found there complete, and those numbers referred to were discovered in the file.  That is the charge against her. It is against the insufficiency of that charge, and against the wrong reasons for her arrest as seen in the charge, that she is hunger striking.  I will clearly and frankly say that she is undertaking what I consider to be a wrongful method of protest, the wrongfulness of which did not occur yesterday but long before, when it was advocated by a political party and stood up for by a political party of which I was then a member, and I undertook responsibility at that time and kept silent.  Nevertheless, it is a wrong method.  She has adopted that method as a protest against what she considers to be a wrongful arrest. This paper was sold in the public streets within the sight of military patrols, and those copies that were found in her house&mdash;not in her possession&mdash;contained numbers in which were articles prejudicial to the safety of the State.  That is no reason why any person should be imprisoned. The general principle is the principle asserted by the Minister for Home Affairs, with which I have said I am in entire agreement.  The general case is not one that fits in with this particular case.  The house was raided and the file was found in the house in which she happened to live.  It was not said that the file was her file.</P>
    <P>It is far from me even to appear to attribute any unworthy motives to anybody, but it must now be apparent to the Minister that the file was not her file.  We know whose file it is.  We, who have taken part in political affairs in respect of a certain political party, and who have known its personages and personalities, know very well whose file that was.  It was the file of her brother, Father Costello, who is at the present moment, and has been for some time, prominently connected with the Irregulars. It is his file.  It is not quite so easy to proceed against people of that kind, and I do not touch upon that because it is not easy for me to touch upon such a matter.  What I do know is this: Miss Costello has stated, and to people in a position of responsibility, that that file was not her file.  In any case, if she were to be publicly charged, it would be exceedingly difficult to prove under the circumstances that the file was her file. <Col N="429" /> Yet, at the present moment, she is in the fourth week of her hunger strike because she was found in the house in which this file happened to be.  That is not a sufficient reason, I urge, why Miss Costello should be held in conditions that might lead to her death. There are other cases.  I believe that one of the other ladies who is at the present moment on hunger strike, has been charged with being resident in a certain house that she never saw in her life.  I believe the facts in that case have been laid before the Minister.  I merely put it to the Dáil at the moment that it would be possible for her to argue with extreme cogency and effect that there was a case of mistaken identity.  Apart from the general principle that I have asserted and agreed with the Minister for Home Affairs upon, I will go further and say that I agreed with the principle when those who at that time were the enemies of our country enunciated it, and I said so.  That principle, however, does not hold good in cases of this kind, where certain persons have been arrested for reasons that are not sufficient in law. In any case, although I am not primarily concerned with the resolution that is before the Dáil, I know there are people who would regard any withdrawal of a motion of this kind as pusillanimous. It would be pusillanimous to desire that this motion should be withdrawn, but I am perfectly content to be charged with being pusillanimous under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>My concern in this matter is that we are faced with a very grave issue.  The gravity of the issue is as clearly apparent to members of the Ministry as to any member of this Dáil, and the consequences are as clearly apparent to them as to any member.  It is unnecessary to urge them.  We are all at one in that matter.  It would be a terrible thing if seeds of vengeance were to be left behind as the consequence of any unfortunate death of this kind.  I began by saying that I felt when this motion was urged that, perhaps with the best intention in the world, the best methods were not taken to achieve what is in my mind as equally in the mind of the mover of the motion.  That is not a question of parties. That is not a question in the least of scoring any advantage on one side or the other.  There is only one thought present in the mind of every person present <Col N="430" /> in this Dáil, and, I venture to say, it is as present in the mind of every one of the Ministers as it is present in the mind of any person who is not a member of the Ministry, and that is that no lives should be lost.  Whatever is done, whether by withdrawal of the motion or by prosecution of the motion, this is not a matter of politics.  It is a question of saving life that is valuable, and not only of saving life that is valuable, but by way of and as a result of that salvation of life, to save this country from any further bitterness and revenge that might follow, and unfortunately that will certainly follow if lives are lost in this way. I do not see how any person could vote against a motion of this kind.  If the motion be pressed I shall vote for it.  I shall vote for it for this reason, that as the result of such inquiries as my poor scope of opportunity has given me the chance of making, I believe the particular prisoners who are now being held are prisoners who should not be held in jail.  I may be wrong in that, but that is my opinion.  I have had it stated to me that the women who have taken part in the hostilities of the past seven months have not participated in hunger strikes of this kind.  I agree entirely with the Minister for Home Affairs that if a woman undertakes any part in hostilities that in other countries fall to the part of men, I do not wish to say anything harsh, but I will say this, that she should take the penalties that would be borne by the man and not ask for any preferential treatment. If any man were found having participated in the hostilities, the criminal hostilities, of the past seven months. and such participation could or would have been proved against such a man, and if that man were to hunger strike, I think I am saying what a large number of people in this country would agree with, that we would face the death from such a hunger strike of that man with peacefulness of mind&mdash;at least I would, whether the person be either a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>The particular women who are on hunger strike at the present moment are claiming that their action has either been constitutional action or that they were arrested when they should not have been arrested, and that offences have been charged against them subsequent to their having gone upon hunger strike, such <Col N="431" /> offences being of the nature I have read out from this charge sheet of Miss Costello. In their particular cases I believe, and urge upon the Government, that it would not betoken any weakness with regard to cases where an essential principle is involved if the Government were to decide to liberate rather than to allow any deaths from starvation to occur in jail.  There would be no weakness.  I believe it would be strength.  I believe it would be ultimately necessary, and, if ultimately necessary, the sooner it is done the better.  In these cases, where no proven offences of a serious nature can be brought against the women in question, I urge, on the one hand, that a division be not pressed, that might be challenged on party lines, compelling an unhappy and tragic conclusion, and in response to that, without any implied bargain or contract such as might be quite unfair to ask, that on the other hand it should be taken into consideration that these particular four or five women &mdash;I am not aware what the number is exactly&mdash;be not allowed to incur the consequences of their wrongful act in going on hunger strike, and that they should be liberated.</P>

      <P>There is one matter that has escaped the notice of Deputies who have spoken on this motion already, and, I fear, may have escaped the notice of the Government. I draw attention to it in the hope that it may possibly have some bearing upon the present cases, and may prevent this arising again in the future.  There are three classes of people who are rightfully under restraint.  No question arises as to convicted criminals. They are there, and nothing they do, as Deputy Figgis pointed out at the beginning of his remarks, can prevent their continued detention.  There is another class which has always been interned&mdash; which cannot properly be described as prisoners, because they are not interned for punishment by countries that are either at public or at civil war&mdash;persons under suspicion, but who, because they are not charged with any offence, and are not going to be tried for any offence, cannot be treated as prisoners who are either about to be tried, or who have been tried and convicted.  Power to arrest and detain persons under suspicion <Col N="432" /> was given in this Dáil to the Government because the Government said it was necessary, and we believed it.  I believe it still, and I have never doubted it.  The third class are those people who have been charged with a definite offence, and who are going or who ought to be tried for it.  It is to that class that I understand these people, who are now very foolishly and wrongfully, I believe, on hunger strike, belong.  You suspend <i>habeas corpus,</i> which is the right of anybody who is under detention in normal times, because it is necessary to intern suspects. But <i>habeas corpus</i> was originally granted to prevent a person being arrested upon a charge and detained indefinitely upon that charge without trial.  When you have charged a person with an offence, the fact that you have suspended <i>habeas corpus</i> to enable you to deal with suspects, clearly ought not to delay the trial of a person against whom a specific charge has been formulated, and who ought either to be acquitted and discharged, or convicted and punished. Now I think that at the time this hunger strike commenced, if these prisoners had not been charged, these internees, as in a sense they were not prisoners, who were under suspicion, I think the Government had full power to detain, not for any punitive purposes, but for preventive purposes, or for the protection of the State.  Once they have been termed prospective criminals by a charge being formulated against them, then, in my view, it is the duty of the Government not to detain them longer than is necessary for the purpose of having the charges investigated, and the prisoners either acquitted, or convicted, and a proper term of punishment imposed. I think, as I said, the time these people commenced their hunger strike they were probably justly detained as suspects, but if there had been charges formulated against them, then I think these charges ought to have been indicated to them at an early date, and they ought to have been tried accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the view expressed by Deputy Figgis, that any person has a right to go on hunger strike, and protest in any other way against the sufficiency of the charge.  It does seem to me that the charge of being in possession of seditious documents is an amply <Col N="433" /> sufficient charge to justify trial and conviction, if it be proved within the regulations, but I think the Government, when they charge a person with crime, ought to try that person, and either get that person acquitted or convicted. That does not affect the quesion of the present motion because I do not feel at liberty to decide the guilt or innocence of these people on the charge formulated against them upon any statements made here.  I agree that the form of protest they have taken is foolish and wicked, and no one can have anything but the most profound sympathy&mdash;whatever one may think of the people themselves&mdash;with those who belong to them, and on whom they threaten to bring the sorrow of domestic loss by their own act.  One cannot help that, but one must give one's vote on a question like this without regarding one's personal feelings or the feelings of others.  It seems to me that the case made by the Government is conclusive against letting anybody out, otherwise than as an act of grace, who chose to protest against their imprisonment.  I trust that whatever may be done in the present case, that from this time on, anybody who has been imprisoned on a definite charge, and is, therefore, a prospective criminal awaiting trial, will be brought to trial at the earliest possible moment, consistent with the proper administration of justice and the due investigation of the charges, and that they may not be compelled or incited to protest against their continued indefinite imprisonment without trial, though charged, in the way these unfortunate women have been protesting.</P>

      <P>I disagree very much with Deputy Figgis when he says that this motion if pressed to a division will be on Party lines.  This is a question of justice and Party should not enter into it at all.  These ladies are on hunger strike as they say they want a trial.  We can understand that in some cases persons do not want a trial.  I have the charge sheet that Deputy Figgis has read out for you.  As he pointed out, &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann&rdquo; was sold through the streets of Dublin, and on passing Nelson's Pillar if they did not exactly strike you in the face with it, if you had any hearing they hit you in the ears with shouts of &ldquo;Stop Press Republic.&rdquo;  Since it was first published <Col N="434" /> I have got it regularly by post, free gratis and for nothing, through the Postmaster-General's Post Office.  Am I going to be put into jail and tried if a copy of it is found in my house?  I say it is a ridiculous charge to bring against anybody.  It would be all right if the sale was stopped, or if the circulation through the post was stopped, if the Government were able to do it.  They did not do it, but they allowed this thing to go on and then put a girl into jail and let her go to death's door before furnishing the charge.  Up to the present the Government has been responsible for the detention of these ladies, and when I say the Government I want to explain that there seems to be altogether different ideas in this country as to what Government means, even Government Departments.  I can produce a document issued from a Government Department which describes all members of Parliament as members of the Government. They do not include the members of the Seanad.  My idea of the Government is that it consists of the Ministers.  Up to this the Government has been responsible.  This motion casts the responsibility on the Dáil, and I say the vote should not be taken on Party lines, as it is up to every man's conscience to vote as he thinks fit.  It is a question of justice.  Are members prepared to let Kitty Costello die because a charge of this kind is brought against her?  There may be something more, but the charge is not made.  I say this motion should be pressed to a division, and I certainly shall vote that these ladies be released.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Staines that these young ladies were as innocent as he tries to make out.  I believe they were all people mixed in the conspiracy to smash the country, and I believe, too, that in that work they were not guided by any National aspirations, but that they were only trying to put forward their own small petty personal views.  These women appealed to the Government, and they expected the Government to give all and that they will take all.</P>
      <P>They are not able to do anything big or generous.  Their small-mindedness has carried them into this fight against the country.  They did things in the fight that were a disgrace to the name of all Irish womanhood, and a disgrace to the name of Ireland.  They carried guns round to shoot you and me and to assist in the blowing up of the houses of their fellow countrymen and women.  They are guilty of all these things.  It is easy to throw stones at the Government; it is easy to find fault with them, but the country has a right to be for ever grateful to the men who stepped into the breach and saved it from destruction.  Those men cannot be perfect, but I have confidence that if we leave this question in their hands they will not meet these misguided women in their own small, petty spirit, but that they will deal with them purely and solely from the point of view of what is good for Ireland.  I would request Dr. McCartan to leave this question in the hands of the Government, and I feel that the object he has in view will be better served if he does so.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that I support the Motion, and I support it on the grounds, and solely on the grounds, put forward by the Deputy in moving it on the last occasion, that is, very largely on the grounds of expediency.  No doubt the Government may make a good case, using cold logic, for holding these prisoners, but I think the argument that we should get away altogether from sentiment in this matter, while a good and perhaps a logical argument, is not an argument <Col N="436" /> that at this stage of our evolution appeals entirely to the people in whose name the Government are acting. We are no doubt, getting away from sentiment, but we cannot fail to remember that sentiment ruled and guided our minds very largely during the last four or five years, and that it may not be possible to get away from it in a hurry.  Now, the Government, no doubt, claim to represent the views of the people in acting as they are, but they should have regard to the expressed views of representative bodies on this matter.  I have seen some expressions of views from representative bodies in favour of the release of these prisoners, but I have seen none urging the Government to continue holding them.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Figgis that we cannot judge this matter entirely on the general principle. We must consider the individual cases, and that has been impressed still more strongly on me by the speech of Deputy Padraic O Maille.  Undoubtedly we must have regard to the gravity of the offences which were committed, or supposed to have been committed, by the individuals who are being held.  It is not charged against any of these that they carried guns.  It is not charged against any of these that they took an active part, as we understand what is meant by an active part, in the warfare that is being carried on against the Government.  They maintain that their action has been constitutional. We do not know, we have no means of knowing, whether or not that has been the case, because the particular charges against them have not been investigated, and, so far as we have been able to discover what the charges are, no charge of such gravity as that mentioned by the Deputy who has last spoken has been made against them.  If any of these prisoners did happen to die, no doubt the country will look at it from the point of view of the seriousness of the charge on which they were arrested and detained.  I submit that the question which the Government, if it were wise, should ask itself is whether it is better that in the interests of peace, ultimate peace, these prisoners should be released, or that they should be detained and allowed to die.  That is the position <Col N="437" /> that the Government are up against, and I have no hesitation in saying that the wiser course would be to use what I understand is at the Government's disposal, that is, the law which was introduced in England some years ago, popularly known as the Cat and Mouse Act.  If that Act is in operation the Government are within their right in putting that law into operation and making use of it. While saying that, I think I agree largely with Deputy Figgis that it is not in the best interests of the object which the Government have at heart that Deputy McCartan would press this Motion to a division.  I would make that suggestion as my firm belief.  I voted for the adjournment on the last occasion when moved by Deputy Johnson, and I thought then, as I still think, that it would, in the interests of these individuals concerned, be best that the matter would not be pressed to a division, but if it is pressed to a division I shall vote in support of the motion.</P>

      <P>After Deputy Figgis had spoken I attempted to catch your eye and failed.  Deputy Figgis misrepresented seriously the position which I took up in speaking on this matter on the last occasion.  He said that I laid down a general principle and he proceeded to state what that general principle was, and rather skilfully misinterpreted what I said.  He said that the principle was that if a person was rightly and lawfully in custody he should be held regardless of any devices that he might resort to in order to secure his release.  Now, that word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; was not used by me.  I recognise that in conditions of war, when the existence of a State is menaced, that words such as &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; go to the wall and that the niceties of legal proof disappear, as a matter of necessity.  I recognise that, of the 10,000 or 12,000 prisoners that we hold, it would have been impossible to try these people, that no legal system that could be devised would suffice to try these 12,000 prisoners, that as a matter of necessity we arrested and detained within the last ten months, and I recognise further that were they to be tried, no State Solicitor, no Civic Guard Superintendent, no representative of the people would be in a position to prove charges against them, one by one.  I recognise that perfectly.  Let us take, for instance, one specific case, the case of Mr. Austin Stack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Mr. Austin Stack had taken the precaution to destroy the document which was found on him what could be proved against him except one thing, that is definite knowledge, and that is his membership of a certain body?  But let us for a moment not advert to that. Let us also assume that he had destroyed this document found on him; what could be proved against him but that he was found in a field in the Knockmealdown Mountains.  That is not a charge upon which you could lawfully hold a prisoner.  We must stand sheer on the State's right when its existence is menaced to arrest and detain any citizen or citizeness.  That is a right that is challenged, and challenged by the women's weapon of the hunger <Col N="439" /> strike, and it is, no matter what anyone says, not a case of definite women prisoners, but the case of any casual hunger striker that you are deciding, for you cannot release these hunger strikers and turn round to-morrow to some sorrowing mother and say, &ldquo;we cannot see our way to do the same with your daughter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You are faced with this question, whether or not you are prepared to release any woman prisoner who hunger strikes for a fortnight or 18 or 21 days, as the case may be.  Already we have been taunted with a previous release. Deputy Miss Mary MacSwiney was given back her life once, and it may be felt that in a way that was due to her family, that a life was owed and she was given back her life, and she has simply proceeded to exhort young people of both sexes throughout the country to continue to fling themselves at the new born State, to drag it down, and to continue to wage a campaign of criminal methods, and now she is in jail again. On one thing let us be clear.  Let us not deliberately muddle our minds.  Let us realise that it is not the case of Miss O'Neill, or Miss Costello, or any person, you are to decide, but the general principle of whether you are going to release people who hunger strike.  The question of a charge is absurd.  When they hunger struck and demanded a trial and release, then to save their faces this particular batch of papers found in her house was used, and a charge, formulated on that, to enable them to get off the hunger strike, but it was the knowledge we had that they were participants in the conspiracy which has gone on against this State for ten months that caused their arrest.  When you are dealing with the question of the equality of guilt it is an accident that one person was found in an overt act and the other was not.  It is an accident that one fellow is found with a revolver, and that another jerks it over the wall.  But there is equality of guilt.  A conspiracy has existed against this State for ten months.  Its methods are open and apparent&mdash;arson, assassination, general sabotage, war on the economic life of the country, the burning of commercial vans, the mining of picture-houses, and attempting to blow up business establishments. I submit that where it is <Col N="440" /> within the knowledge of the State, within the knowledge of this Executive, or of the responsible army officers, that people are participants in that conspiracy, that there is an equality of guilt. Now, let us be clear.  To release any woman hunger-striker, or release any hunger-striker&mdash;let us draw a line, let us at least see what we mean.  If these women are to be released, does it mean that any woman who hunger-strikes in the future is to be released, or that any hunger-striker is to be released regardless of sex?  I do contend that you have not much right to refer to sex; I do contend the women who have taken part in this conspiracy have unsexed themselves. If they are to be released, is it to be that any hunger-striker, man or woman, in the future is to be released? We release Misses A, B, C, and D. Then to-morrow we do not release Misses E, F, and G, because we are in a different humour.  Every Deputy here knows that there is no woman in custody that is not well known to responsible people to be a participator in this conspiracy.  Every Deputy knows it, whatever he might, prompted by humanitarian feelings, profess to believe. They all know that.  I ask you to have some consideration for the responsibilities of the Executive.  I do not ask you to act in any irresponsible way.  It would be better you laid down here a hard and fast line, and say that every woman hunger-striker is to be released, than to come in in a casual way and say, release Miss so-and-so.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this discussion if it had not been for the first speech delivered in the debate to-night.  I must say that I have heard many debates and listened to many discussions, but I never listened to a more dexterous attempt to face both ways at the same time than the speech of the opener of the debate. Now, it is time to finish facing both ways in Ireland.  There are a few things in Ireland that mean everything.  There is the sanctity of life and property and the recognition of legitimate authority.  If legitimate authority is flouted with impunity, if it goes down into chaos and anarchy, everything that we hold dear goes down along with it.  The Deputy who opened the discussion to-night made great play upon the case of Miss Costello, and I take it that he wished to impress <Col N="441" /> upon us the idea that Miss Costello went on hunger strike as a protest against the flimsiness of the charge against her and as a protest against not being brought to trial on that charge. Now, I have been informed, and I am sure the Government will be able to correct me if I am wrong, that Miss Costello went on hunger strike immediately after she was brought to the place of imprisonment.  If that was so one can only conclude that she hunger struck not against the flimsiness of the charge nor against the delay in being brought to trial on that charge, but as a denial of the right or authority of this Government to arrest any person within the territory of the State.  Is that a position that is going to evoke sympathy?  I will not use the word &ldquo;sympathy,&rdquo; as it is a much-abused word, a word that is sometimes used to try to undermine the reasoning and logical faculties of members of As semblies like this&mdash;but if the hunger strike is going to be used as a weapon to deny and destroy the fundamental basis not only of political but of moral authority within the country, then it is a weapon that will have to be met and resisted. I do not want to bolt or bar the doors of the cells of these ladies.  I wish every one of them could go free from their cells to-night, and I believe the Minister for Home Affairs will confirm what I say, namely, that each and every one of them could walk free from their cells to-night if they would give the necessary undertaking that they would not be participants against the security of the State.</P>

      <P>The Minister says yes. Is that too much to ask of anyone who is regarded as an agency for the destruction of the State?  Hunger strike has not been imposed upon these prisoners as a penalty by the Government It is a self-inflicted penalty which can cease the moment they give that recognition to the right of the State which every self-respecting citizen should not think it too much to be asked from him. Let us know where we stand.  Is there any Deputy here in this assembly who is not prepared to sign the undertaking which each of these prisoners is asked to sign, and if each and every member <Col N="442" /> of this assembly is prepared to sign that document, how can this assembly come to the conclusion that in asking that much in the case of each of these prisoners the Executive Government is asking too much?  I do hope that this motion will not be pressed to a division. I am doubtful if the cause which the mover of the amendment pleads&mdash;and I know that he pleads the cause which he has embodied in that motion with the deepest sincerity and the greatest honesty of conviction&mdash;is best served by a discussion like this.  In the first place you have this possible result&mdash;that there is conjured up in the minds of sympathisers with those who have tried to wreck the State, the hope that there would go out from this assembly a decision that would weaken the hands of the Government in its attempt to maintain order and security in Ireland.  On the other hand, there is the grave danger that a decision that would be hostile to the sentiments of that motion might possibly harden the hearts&mdash;for after all they are only human, and God knows they have enough to try the best temper of the best human being&mdash;of members of the Executive in dealing with this matter.  Therefore I say that I doubt if the cause of the prisoners in their dire distress is served by such a motion.  All I have to say is this, that all through this crisis there is one thing I stand for, that is the security of the State and recognition of legitimate authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that it is not too much to ask these prisoners, in exchange for their release from prison, that they would give that undertaking which will be some guarantee that they would not, if released, utilise their renewed liberty to assist those who have deliberately attempted to destroy the foundations of this infant State.  I have no doubt whatever that the members of the Government have given every consideration to this case.  I have no doubt that every argument that has been urged for the release of these prisoners has been weighed already by them, and I have no doubt that if they could get even a decent excuse for releasing these people it would be done.  But there must be a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  There must be something in return if those who have been known to assail the State and who have been arrested are released; those who have the responsibility of the <Col N="443" /> security of society in this country must have an assurance that there will be no repetition of those assaults on the security of the State and the people of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty about that which no one appreciates better than Deputy Figgis.  The attitude taken up on the matter by us is that the State must insist upon and defend its right to intern citizens when a situation exists in the country so grave that it is correct to say the existence of the State is challenged.  Perhaps the strongest argument urged against the resolution was that it would engender hopes in the minds of prisoners and internees to have recourse to that method to secure their release, and it was pointed out that after each release, the attitude of taking a stand and not releasing becomes more and more difficult, and perhaps less and less justifiable.</P>
      <P>And we felt that while we were being urged in the name of humanity, and a lot of other high-sounding things, to release these particular prisoners that, in fact, the question that was being discussed, and the question really involved, was whether any person who resorted to that particular method was to be released after an interval of a fortnight or three weeks. We cannot give away the right of the State to intern citizens in its own defence. We cannot and do not mean to; but in conversation with Deputy McCartan it is stated we would be prepared to re-consider this matter if the Dáil gave a very solemn and very emphatic expression of opinion that future hunger strikers, prisoners or internees, should not have the question of their release considered. Now, if such a resolution were passed everyone would know just where they stood.</P>

      <P>And any hope that would be otherwise engendered in the <Col N="445" /> minds of persons in custody would be removed, and removed by a very explicit and specific declaration from the Dáil. Therefore, it is of value, and of great value, to the Executive that Deputy McCartan's alternative resolution be passed, and only conditional upon that would I, as one member of the Executive Council, be prepared to re-consider my attitude about the question of the release or the detention of these prisoners.</P>

      <P>What is ignored is the case made by Deputy O'Connell and by me on a previous occasion. We spoke in favour of this resolution, not as a demand for the release of any hunger-striker&mdash;not for their release&mdash;but to save us from the unpleasantness, I will not say odium, of permitting them to die.  I subscribe to every principle that has been enunciated this evening by Deputy Milroy.  The doctrine is undoubtedly sound that we cannot carry on the Government of the Free State if everyone who chooses to challenge its authority can do so, and not merely to challenge it, but to defy it.</P>

      <P>I am now attempting to do what the Minister for Home Affairs was permitted to do, and what Deputy Johnson was permitted to do, to wit, to express an opinion on the advisability or otherwise of allowing this motion to be substituted for the other.  I submit with all respect that, notwithstanding the unwillingness of Deputy McCarthy to hear me on any subject, I am perfectly in order.  The question before us is: are we to permit the substitution of this motion?  I say it is derogatory to the dignity of the Dáil, apart altogether from the question of order.  Before this we solemnly debated a rule of procedure in regard to the Government of this country in dealing with prisoners; now we are asked to enter into a sort of bargain which amounts to saying that for the sake of certain prisoners we are willing to lay down a doctrine which will sacrifice all who would in the same spirit attempt to do likewise.  To propose, without notice of any kind, a thing of this sort is not really to consider this as a legislative Assembly to which an Executive Ministry is responsible, but to act as if we were a business chamber arranging some deal.</P>

      <P>I seriously suggest to Deputy McCartan that as a result of a conversation which he had with the Executive Council on the front bench, a conversation of which we are not aware, but during which some kind of understanding was arrived at, that he would be more considerate in the prisoners' interests, which he seems to have at heart, if he would withdraw the motion standing in his name.  If he does so that would not prevent the Executive Council, which has the authority and responsibility, from reconsidering the whole matter in the meantime, and he could take the ordinary course of re-submitting the amended motion to the Dáil when <Col N="449" /> the matter will be discussed in all its aspects.</P>

Now it is urged that there will be further hunger-strikes.  I submit it is only just to the prisoners to tell them that they need have no hope.  The people on hunger-strike have some hope in the Dáil.  It would perhaps be better if my original motion had gone on and if we had decided against them rather than have them still hoping.  If we decide against them they know where they are. If we pass the resolution future prisoners will know that they need have no hope in the Dáil and that they must take the consequences of their acts.  I think the proposal is just and honourable and we are not dictating to, but supporting the Government in the action they are taking.</P>

      <P>In supporting the point of view put forward by Deputy Magennis, I wish to say as to the suggestion made by Deputy McCartan, that those who advised that the original motion should be withdrawn are not at all afraid to face the consequences. Quite the contrary.  I dare say that both those who intended to vote against Deputy McCartan's resolution, and those who, like myself, intended to vote for it were quite prepared to take the consequences. I agree with the Deputy who said that this is no time, and this is not the occasion, for any hugger-mugger of any kind; that in considering the whole question it is not a matter at all of certain persons, certain particular individuals, who are on hunger-strike.  It is a matter of far greater concern than the life of any particular hunger-striker.  I would ask Deputy McCartan to withdraw his second motion, because I believe that it commits the Dáil to a course of action, which I think the Dáil would regret.  It agrees to the release of certain individuals at the expense of the whole independence and the whole dignity of the Dáil from this particular date, the 25th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I would ask him to withdraw.  If he puts his amended motion or is allowed to put his amended motion to a vote, I shall certainly, and with no regard at all for the consequences, <Col N="450" /> vote against it.  But I do not wish to do so.  I do not wish that anything that should happen in the Dáil this evening should make it appear to anybody inside or outside that I did not desire the release of those hunger-strikers.  I do desire their release, but when I was approached by certain people on behalf of certain individuals amongst the hunger-strikers, I said that it was a matter of dealing with them all together.  I thought that the merits of one particular case and the merits of another particular case, could not be taken into consideration at all. It seems to me that in persisting in the course he apparently desires to persist in now, Deputy McCartan wishes to sacrifice the independence of the Dáil in order to effect the release of particular individuals. So far as I myself am concerned I am not afraid of the consequences, and I speak also for others with whom I am generally associated.  If he puts his original motion we will vote with him freely and heartily.  If he puts the other I certainly shall vote against it.</P>

      <P>I have refrained for some time past from taking up the time of this Dáil regarding matters which I will briefly refer to here now.  I was aware that negotiations on the matter to which I briefly refer were going on between the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the company or companies concerned.  In bringing this question to the notice of the Government I want it to be clearly <Col N="451" /> understood by everyone that I fully realise the difficulties that have been created for the Irish Railway Companies, and particularly the companies that operate within the Free State, by the troubles which arose and have been going on since last June.  I have no desire to introduce into this discussion any aspect of the case dealing with the people who are responsible for this destruction of railways, and who, consequently, are the cause of the loss of a good deal of trade and revenue in the Free State area, and, what is far more serious to me, the cause of a lot of misery and starvation to thousands of railway workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in communication with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce arising out of complaints that have been sent to me concerning particularly the failure of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company and some other railway companies, to open up sections of the lines that have been closed down since last July.  The sections that were closed down last July, and which still remain closed, are as follow:&mdash;Dungarvan to Castletownroche, Fermoy to Mitchelstown, Rathmore to Headford Junction, Headford Junction to Kenmare, Caragh to Valentia Harbour, Bagenalstown to Palace East, Kiltimagh to Collooney, Campile to Killinick and Rosslare, Cobh Goods Station, Killaloe Station; also Lisduff Quarry Works and the Sligo and Claremorris section of the Great Southern and Western Railway. I have had some correspondence with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the failure of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company to respond to the repeated applications of traders in the areas, and also their failure to respond to representations from the Ministry to open up the Borris and Bagenalstown branch, and this is the reply which I received on the 13th April:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to the question of the service provided on the Borris and Bagenalstown branch of the Great Southern and Western Railway to which you referred on April 9th, and to say that the company is disinclined to extend the present service for <Col N="452" /> the time being on the ground that it is necessarily worked at a loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the mentality of the directors of that company in judging the loss or profit of the company as a whole by any loss that may be involved or incurred on the working of a section. On a recent occasion I spoke to Mr. Neale, and put it to him that it was not fair to keep this section closed down because it was anticipated, but could not be proved, that a loss would be incurred if he agreed to the opening up of the line.  He said it was not looked at from that standpoint.  That is why I have read this reply that I received from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I have also been in communication with the Ministry regarding the closing down of the Lisduff Quarries, whereby two hundred railway men have been unemployed since last June.  In the first instance, the company stated, and rightly stated, that the quarries could not be kept going, because of the lack of protection to carry on the work.  That was a position which could not be disputed. Suggestions were made that the military authorities in Templemore could provide protection for the carrying of the explosives and the supervision of the discharge of the explosives in Lisduff, and it was asked would the company then open up.  The Minister (Mr. McGrath) made representations, I understand, to Portobello, and the military authorities agreed to carry out the suggestion.  The company then came along and took up the attitude that is detailed in this letter which I received on the 12th April:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your visit to this Department on the 9th inst., in connection with the possible re-opening of Lisduff Quarries by the Great Southern and Western Railway Co., and to say that this Department has been in communication with the company on the matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The company states that the quarry can only be worked in an economical manner when the line is being relaid in the normal way.  This the company, owing to its financial condition, states that it is not at present doing, and it, therefore, does not require the quarry, and does not contemplate its re-opening.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand, the financial aspect of the company's position <Col N="453" /> at the moment is considered simply as to how it can maintain the present value of its Stocks in the market and can possibly increase them in view of any contemplated re-organisation of the railways that may take place arising out of the suggestions that have been put before them by the Government.  I suggest that that is not a reason that should guide the company in considering a question of this kind, especially in the opening up of a quarry where 300 tons of stone were put out daily in pre-June days, and from which 200 men have been pushed out of employment, and are being kept out. Some time ago the men in this particular area who were suffering from extreme hardships&mdash;and most of whom are not in receipt of any unemployment pay&mdash; offered to protect the quarry themselves if they were supplied with 20 rifles.  That suggestion was conveyed to, but naturally ignored, by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>Now, the company that takes up that attitude and that states everything is being done to open up the trade and commerce of the country, especially now when we are coming to normal conditions, has voted away on several occasions bonuses ranging from fifty to two hundred guineas to some of the higher officials who have had to do increased work as a result of the political troubles. I will give you one or two cases in point. On the 3rd January last the stationmaster at Belmont had to leave owing to the threats of armed men on the grounds that he was a Free State agent and made undue efforts to save the property of the company when the station, cabin, and offices were set on fire.  The company were asked to follow the example of other Irish railway companies, and to allow him his pay until such time as another position was found for him.  This request was definitely refused, although the company were communicated with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The refusal was justified on the grounds of the financial position of the company. Just at this time substantial bonuses of from fifty to two hundred guineas were paid to some of the chief officials on the grounds of increased duties.  The company demonstrated their feelings towards the man whose family was homeless and penniless by waiting six weeks before giving him another position, although all that was necessary was a slight readjustment of positions.  I have personal <Col N="454" /> knowledge of a particular case, and I have also official knowledge of similar cases that occurred during the period of the Anglo-Irish war, where stationmasters were pushed out by the I.R.A. after being suspected of assisting the British Government.  The G. S. &amp; W. Railway Company, without any representations, found them suitable positions at once, or at least made quite certain that they did not suffer any financial loss as a result of their alleged unauthorised removal.  I merely quote you those cases to show that the reasons put forward by the railway companies are not the genuine reasons for keeping those various sections of the line closed down, the trade and industry of the Free State area held up and paralysed, and thousands of men kept out of employment.  I am quite fair, I believe, to some of the higher officials of this company when I say they suffered very much in mind from the assistance given by their employees to the men who were carrying on the Anglo-Irish war, and that they are now taking the opportunity to hit them back for what they did not consider they had a right to at that time.  I also believe that the heads of this company are influenced by the consideration that by their conditions they will bring the men to the point and the time when they think they will be starved out, that they will call them back again to work at their own beck and call, and then presumably make a wages attack at a time when they think it would be suitable to do so.  I have no doubt, speaking as I can for the men working for that company, that they will get a rude awakening if that is what is at the back of their minds.</P>
    <P>A statement was made here on the 3rd of January last by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, while dealing with the railway position generally and the future policy of the Government regarding railway organisation.  He said: &ldquo;The Government has come to the conclusion that it is necessary to maintain such railway services as are essential to the economic life of the community.&rdquo; I suggest, and seriously suggest, that all the sections that have been closed down for six or nine months are essential to the economic life of the country, and it is essential that, after the troubled period through which we have passed, they should be re-opened to try to recover <Col N="455" /> the trade lost through the destruction of these particular lines.  There seems to be no reason why they should not, as the necessary protection will be given in every instance where it is required.  I understand the military authorities have been, and are still, willing to afford whatever protection is necessary to see that the railways of the country are carried on in a proper manner.  I had intended raising many other aspects of the railway question under the terms of the leave which I received this afternoon, but I do not propose to go into these now.  I think, however, that seeing that there is no particular buiness to be put before the Dáil, which is now being adjourned for another week, that the time has arrived when the Dáil might take into consideration the whole question of the future organisation of the railways.  The three months have passed, and another month has been allowed in addition to the railway companies to try and agree upon a scheme of grouping, or unification, or some scheme that they might agree upon themselves, which may not necessarily be accepted by the Government.  I suggest that the time has arrived, if the Government is anxious to utilise the services of Deputies who are willing to come here for one day, when they might, at a very early date, give full and ample time for the consideration of this very serious and important question.  I am personally in possession of information which I will disclose at a later date to show that many railway magnates in this country have their hands actually around the necks of the Free State to try to grapple with and take away its trade and traffic and to divert it to Belfast out of its natural course.  I think we cannot deal in a discussion with very serious matters such as that, and I seriously suggest to the Ministry that they should give an early date and a suitable opportunity to go into that, and to every other aspect of railway administration that has a bearing upon the trade and commerce of the country.  I would have liked to go into other aspects of this case had I been in possession of the agreement that has been arrived at between the Executive Council and the railway companies regarding the question of compensation. I think that if any money is to be paid away out of State funds to railway companies, such as the Great <Col N="456" /> Southern and Western Railway Co., it should be on the condition that the lines that they have allowed to remain idle and closed for six or nine months should be re-opened in the interests of the State. I think that there is nothing unreasonable in laying down a condition of that kind, and I put it to the Government that they should use all the influence that they possibly can to have all these sections re-opened to recover the trade that has been lost, and that the thousands of men who have been starving for the last six or nine months should be given an opportunity of earning a livelihood in a State that we believe and think is a Free State.</P>

      <P>In supporting Deputy Davin, I do not think that these railways should be allowed to remain idle.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce should do what he can to get the companies to restart work in repairing these lines.  I would like to point out that the workers have their rights no less than the railway companies and just as much as the directors and shareholders, and we are not going to see these rights filched from us.  I sent a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about some railway men in my area who have been dismissed, men who had 7 to 10 years' service on the permanent way.  These men will be thrown out of employment and their dependents will naturally come on the County Board of Health.  I do not think that is fair, because at present they could be reconstructing the lines.  There is nothing to prevent that being done, I dare say, down as far as Lisduff.  The Great Southern and Western Co. have been at no time, in my opinion, very favourable to the establishment of the Free State.  I have heard on good authority that a number of notices are about to be sent out, and possibly have been sent out already, and I would ask the Minister to see that those notices are withdrawn.  Surely the workers that live down along where those lines run have their rights as well as the railway company. This is a time of the year that no more men ought to be thrown out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take advantage of the opportunity secured by Deputy Davin to call the special attention of the Ministry to the southern portion of Co. Wexford, that is the portion <Col N="457" /> on the Great Southern line between Wexford town and Waterford, which has been closed down, as he pointed out, practically since July.  Anybody who read the evidence submitted to the Agricultural Commission yesterday will see that the dead meat industry which was being fostered in Wexford is in a bad way, and the immediate cause of that, to my mind, is that the Great Southern and Western Railway Co. have neglected their interests and the interests of the community in Southern Wexford by allowing the railway line damaged last July to remain unrepaired all that time. Since that line was damaged in July the Great Southern and Western Railway Co. have withdrawn the boats which plied between Fishguard and Rosslare, and the result is that the very large trade that the Wexford Meat Supply Co. was doing up to that time has been stopped completely.  These people have had no outlet for their dead meat trade since last July, and the result is the they are working now with about half the staff.  This also affects the farmers.  I notice that the Farmers' benches are now empty, and, to my mind, this is a most important matter for the farmers, and more important for them than for any other section of the community.  I think they ought to be here taking part in this discussion, especially in view of the evidence that was submitted at the Commission yesterday.  I would ask the Minister to draw the attention of the Great Southern and Western Co. to the situation existing in Wexford, by which this industry, one of the most important in Ireland, is suffering, and suffering badly, as a result of their laxity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.B. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply first to Deputy Corish.  With regard to the policy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce it is our aim and desire to have every perch of railway line within the Saorstát opened up at the earliest possible date, and it has been our endeavour for months past to try and have the lines opened up.  Quite recently when approaching certain railway companies we were met with the reply, &ldquo;If you give us protection we shall open up the line.&rdquo;  In one case the reply was: &ldquo;You give us money, and we will build the bridges.&rdquo;  On the 21st of April the Ministry received from the Minister for Defence this communication:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Defence <Col N="458" /> to refer to your letter of the 14th inst., on the subject of military protection needed in order that damaged railway lines might be repaired and traffic resumed.  I am to inform you that the Army is in a position to provide adequate protection as and when required in any part of the country.  I am to add that if you will be so good as to indicate the sections of lines that it is particularly desired should be reopened, instructions will be given to have the matter adequately dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Immediately on receipt of that letter from the Ministry of Defence the Ministry of Commerce took steps to have the communication sent to the various railway companies, and asked them to indicate any particular sections of the line which they were prepared immediately to open up when protection would be accorded.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking there has been a great improvement within the week in the re-opening of lines of railway.  I may just briefly refer to the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway:&mdash;</i> The section between Dundalk and Greenore is closed owing to three bridges being broken thereon.  The Company has been instructed to apply to the local Military Authorities for protection, and will institute temporary repairs and open the line immediately the protection is afforded.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cork and Macroom Direct Railway:</i>&mdash; The Ministry is advised that the line will be open in three days from the 23rd inst.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Schull and Skibbereen Light Railway:</i>&mdash;Entirely closed.  The Ministry is advising the Company to apply for protection, and understands that the damage on this line is not extensive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tralee and Dingle Light Railway:</i>&mdash; Entirely closed.  The Government Consulting Engineer has the question of protection in hands and the Ministry is today advising the Company that they should also apply to the Military Authorities.  The Ministry is informed that the damage to this line can be repaired by the Company.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cork and Muskerry Light Railway:</i>&mdash; This line is open for passenger traffic only as Leemount Bridge, over which the line runs, is broken.  The County Council are repairing this bridge and the Ministry is informed by the General <Col N="459" /> Manager that he expects that the line will ready for Goods Traffic in about four weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway:</i>&mdash; Has just been opened for Passengers and Parcels Traffic.  Goods Service is being maintained by the Company's boats on Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway:</i>&mdash;This line is now open as far as Bantry, and General Russell has informed the Ministry that repairs to the Skibbereen Branch are in hands.</P>
    <P>In all the above cases the Companies are anxious to resume the Services, and no difficulty will, it is thought, arise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Great Southern and Western Railway:</i>&mdash;The following Sections of this are closed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Durrow and Mallow (a).</P>
    <P>Banteer and Killarney (a).</P>
    <P>Headford Jct and Kenmare (a).</P>
    <P>Killorglin and Valentia (a).</P>
    <P>Fermoy and Mitchelstown (a).</P>
    <P>Waterford, Wellington Bridge and Rosslare Strand (a).</P>
    <P>Claremorris and Sligo (a).</P>
    <P>Borris and Palace East (a).</P>
    <P>In connection with the Sections marked (a) the Ministry has received requests for an early resumption of the Service from Local Authorities and others.</P>
    <P>The Ministry is in communication with the Company regarding protection for these lines, but it understands that there are some of them which are still badly damaged, and there are others on which the Company are not anxious to resume a Service.  The Ministry is, however, pressing them in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Listowel and Ballybunion Railway:</i>&mdash; Is also entirely closed, and the Ministry has communicated with the General Manager requesting him to seek the necessary protection.  It is understood that the damage to the Permanent Way has been repaired by the Company.</P>
    <P>With regard to the G. S. &amp; W. Railway, in reply to Deputy Colohan, the Ministry received his letter relating to certain men unemployed in Kildare, and I am sorry he did not give the Dáil the substance of the reply he received.  I realise none of the Deputies who spoke made a case against the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but rather made a case against the railway companies, and <Col N="460" /> it is none of the Ministry's business to defend the railway companies.</P>

      <P>The question is what pressure the Ministry can bring to bear on the companies.  In every case you are up against the legal difficulties in the matter.  With regard to repair of overhead bridges, the Ministry has suggested to Deputy Davin that the County Councils should take legal advice in the matter, and it will be glad of information on the result of that advice.</P>
      <P>With regard to large bridges, there are large bridges for the repair of which satisfactory arrangements could not be made with the G. S. &amp; W. Railway, and which consequently are being repaired by the Government:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taylorstown</i>&mdash;Contract let to Hearne's, of Waterford.  Spans and material arriving on site now.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Belvelly</i>&mdash;Railway Maintenance Corps erecting a temporary bridge.  Contract to be let at once for the provision of a new span.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Monard and Carrick</i>&mdash;Contracts let in both cases to T.J. Moran &amp; Co., Cork. Work in progress.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Dundrum</i>&mdash;Work well under way. Being carried out by Government direct.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Ballyvoile</i>&mdash;Design submitted by Consulting Engineer approved by Railway Company.  Tenders being invited at the moment.  Contract expected to be placed within a week.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mallow</i>&mdash;Work in connection with removal of debris nearing completion. Work in connection with new bridge in full swing in contractor's shop.  Men will be on site any day now.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway: Chetwynde Viaduct</i>&mdash; Repairs nearly completed.  Practically whole line now open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to road bridges over railways, all Railway Companies are doing repairs except Great Southern and Western.  It is understood that under the Railway Clauses Act, the statutory liability for repair rests on the Railway Company unless excluded by Special <Col N="461" /> Act. G. S. W. Railway, however, states that it has agreements with the County Councils under which the cost of repair is to be borne by the Councils.</P>
    <P>I may say the Ministry of Industry and Commerce does bring some compulsion on the railway companies as far as it can, and I should like to say that in the great majority of cases with the exception of the G. S. &amp; W. Rly. Company, we were met half-way in our endeavours to bring about normal traffic.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I may state that we hope to have the whole section between Millstreet, Killarney, and Kenmare open by the middle of next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> To-day I have made such arrangements that there will be no excuse for not having the railway running between Wexford and Wellington Bridge.  That might not perhaps affect the Rosslare situation, but will at all events bring considerable relief to the local people.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the Sligo and Claremorris section of the railway had a trial train running over it yesterday, and sufficient protection will be provided in that area to ensure that there will be no excuse for not having a regular service in future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until Wednesday, 2nd May, at 3 p.m.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will state the number of applications made and granted, and the amount of the loans granted, under the Landed Property Improvement Acts and other Acts relating to the same subject, in respect of each of the following purposes, for the financial year, 1922-23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Erection and improvement of Farm Buildings.</P>
      <P>(2)  Erection and improvement of Labourers' Cottages.</P>

      <P>(8)  Clearing of rocks, furze, and reclamation from waste.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state on what terms loans for these purposes may be obtained, and whether any steps have been, or will be taken, by the Minister, to impress upon farmers the desirability of applying for such loans, with a view to increasing the productive capacity of their land and providing employment at suitable seasons for a large number of agricultural workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Ninety-four memorials for loans under these Acts were presented during the year 1922-23&mdash;most of them towards the end of the year.  Six of these were refused, 8 postponed by the memorialists, and 72 are still under consideration.</P>
      <P>Ten loans, amounting to £2,060, were sanctioned during the year, including two applied for during the previous year. All these loans were granted in respect of the erection and improvement of farm buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of repayment, the rent charges (which cover both principal and interest) at present are £7 17s. 10d. and £6 13s. 4d. per cent. <Col N="375" /> per annum for loans repayable in 22 years and 35 years, respectively.</P>
    <P>I regret that in the present state of the public finances it is possible only to make very limited provision for the granting of local loans and I cannot, therefore, encourage the making of applications for such loans.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether civilian workers in the Military Barracks at Athlone and elsewhere have been required to join the Army and wear military uniform; whether the effect of this has been to throw into the ranks of the unemployed a large number of men, and whether the Minister will reconsider the policy in regard to the employment of civilian labour in military barracks.</P>

William Finn (No. 10,537), Union Barracks, Westport, and Pte.

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The claims of Mr. Finn were disallowed after due investigation, on the ground that the extent of dependence as ascertained in each case, namely, about 5s. per week, was less than the minimum specified by the regulations, that is, 12s. per week, before an allowance may be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be stated that the regulations governing the matter are based on <Col N="376" /> the recognition of an obligation on the part of an unmarried soldier to contribute to the support of his dependents a reasonable portion of his Army pay, this portion being calculated as 8s. per week in the case of a soldier receiving ordinary rate of pay.</P>
