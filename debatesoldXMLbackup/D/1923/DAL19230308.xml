      <P>The first matter on the Order Paper to-day is the Report of Committee on Procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GERALD FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the best way this Report could be dealt with would be that some member of the Committee would move that it be received, and then that the Dáil should consider it in Committee with a view to adopting it with or without amendments.  That was the procedure we adopted in the case of former Standing Orders, and as you, A Chinn Chomhairle, were Chairman of the Committee and are precluded by your present office from making a motion of that kind, I beg to move now &ldquo;That the Report be received, and that the Dáil will proceed to consider same in Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether you consider, if the motion is carried, that it would be necessary to move each Standing Order separately. I suggest that that would be scarcely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think <Col N="2140" /> it would not be necessary to move each separately.  The motion now is that the Report be received, and that we go into Committee on the Standing Orders and consider them with a view to amendment, if necessary.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Orders are in three schedules&mdash;one dealing with Financial Procedure; one dealing with the communication between Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann; and the other, proposed amendments to our existing Standing Orders.  The Financial Procedure is put first, as it is understood it is urgent that we should have Standing Orders to deal with Financial Procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to move these by schedules, and then that any matter that might arise on any particular schedule should be discussed under that schedule rather than on each separate Standing Order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think it would be better to take each individual Standing Order as moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion was that it should not be necessary formally for some Deputy to move each Standing Order and someone else to second, but that on each being put from the Chair such suggestions or alterations that might be made could be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to take advantage of the fact that an Order is proposed to suggest that we ought to have a statement from you, A Chinn Chomhairle, or from the Minister for Finance on what is, after all, a mere question of wording, but yet not unimportant.  That is the question of nomenclature.  I see the words estimates and also financial resolutions.  I <Col N="2141" /> believe the word Budget was used here in the Dáil last night.  I would like to have the statement, because I am not quite clear on the matter.  One knows exactly the kind of nomenclature that is used in other Assemblies in regard to these matters.  It is clear that our titles are not exactly coincident with theirs, or rather it seems so to me.  I think it would serve a useful purpose if we were to have that point dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking Orders 1 and 2, what is the precise explanation asked for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. FIGGIS Mr. FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arises on Order No. 2, which deals with resolutions voting money for public services. Am I to regard that as being such a resolution as was introduced prior to the Criminal Injuries (Amendment) Bill; or is it definitely that a series of resolutions which, budgetted together, are generally to be referred to as the Budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is meant by any resolution or series of resolutions here in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe):</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Order No. 3, I think some difficulty might arise in this particular year, when we will be presenting our first set of ordinary yearly Estimates.  I understand it will not be possible to have them in the hands of Deputies 14 days before the 1st April, so that, if this particular Standing Order were adopted in the form in which it is here it would be necessary to have some agreement that the amount of time might be less in this particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was considered very carefully by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to explain that, A Chinn Comhairle.  It is not 14 days before the 1st April; it is 14 days before they are considered, and not later than the 1st April.  They have not to be taken into consideration on the 1st April, but that is the latest date on which the Order provides they should be in the hands of Teachtai.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2142" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is not that they must be introduced 14 days before the 1st April, but that they must be introduced 14 days before they are considered, which need not be the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would be necessary, for the purpose of providing finances for carrying on the public services, that the Estimates should be considered, and should be introduced, in fact, on the 1st April at least, and that certain resolutions should be passed.  I do not know whether or not it will be necessary to have a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual practice, if this Order were to be adopted the Estimates would have to be in the hands of Deputies on the 17th, or so, of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Minister could get a Vote on Account without bringing in all the Estimates before the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree that the Minister's interpretation is the correct one.  I have not a copy of the Constitution with me, but, as well as I recollect, his interpretation coincides with my memory on it, that the accounts must be presented to the Dáil, and not merely be in the hands of Deputies, before the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 36 of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall, as soon as possible after the commencement of each financial year, consider the Estimates of receipts and expenditure of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) for that year, and, save in so far as may be provided by specific enactment in each case, the legislation required to give effect to the Financial Resolutions of each year shall be enacted within that year.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  That happens constantly, because Estimates are being considered up to August, and a Vote on Account needs to be taken in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as I recollect, there is some Article in the Constitution which states that they must be presented before the end of the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 54 says: &ldquo;The Executive Council shall prepare Estimates of the receipts and expenditure of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) for each financial year, and shall present them to Dáil Eireann before the close of the previous financial year.&rdquo;  It is because of that Article that the Standing Order states that they must be presented not later than the 1st April.  The purpose of the Standing Order is to fulfil that particular provision in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they must be presented to Dáil Eireann before the 1st April, and the Standing Order continues to say &ldquo;be in the hands of members 14 days prior to their consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all.  The Committee considered these Standing Orders very carefully in connection with the Constitution, and if they were read as carefully as the Committee considered them I think they would be quite clear to everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just read them again, and I think the difficulty I anticipated does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, say that Standing Orders 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are concerned with procedure in Committee on the Estimates&mdash;called Committee of Supply sometimes.  We already had an experience of them in the Dáil, and these Standing Orders are <Col N="2144" /> the Orders which the Committee considered would suit our circumstances.</P>

      <P>Order agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">ORDER No. 6.</P>
      <P>(1)  When it is intended to move more than one reduction in any Vote or Item of a Vote, the question shall first be proposed from the Chair on the largest reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the word &ldquo;offered&rdquo; in 6 (2), first line, is the best word that could be used.  I do not think one uses the expression &ldquo;to offer a motion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is another difficulty&mdash;you can only propose one motion at a time.  Several motions have not been proposed.  &ldquo;When it is intended to propose more than one motion&rdquo; would be more in accordance with accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>If we worded 6 (2) in the same way as 6 (1) and say &ldquo;when it is intended to move several motions,&rdquo; would that meet the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>

      <P>It reads now: &ldquo;When it is proposed to move several reductions they shall be taken in the order in which the items to which they relate appear in the printed Estimates.&rdquo; Would that suffice?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P Just="Center">ORDER No. 7.</P>
      <P>After a question for omitting or reducing any Item of a Vote has been put from the Chair and voted upon, no motion or debate shall be allowed upon any preceding Item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT:</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears redundant. If a motion were put from the Chair the words &ldquo;and voted upon&rdquo; do not seem to be necessary.  If a motion were put from the Chair surely you would not allow a debate on the preceding item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee considered the form of the Estimates, and they rather thought that the words &ldquo;and voted upon&rdquo; should be left in.  If you had items for, say, the National Museum, the National Library and the School of Art, all appearing under one Vote, and somebody moved to reduce the third item, the School of Art, it would be impossible to go back once that had been voted upon. The Chair might allow someone to go back before the vote had been taken if it seemed reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be necessary to move to reduce Item <Col N="2146" /> No. 1 after having moved about No. 3. The insertion of the words &ldquo;voted upon&rdquo; leaves considerable liberty to Deputies.  It leaves to the discretion of the Chair to allow a motion on the previous item.

      <P>There shall be appointed at the beginning of each financial year a special Committee to be designated &ldquo;The Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo; to examine and report to Dáil Eireann upon the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by Dáil Eireann to meet the public expenditure, and to suggest alterations and improvements in the form of the Estimates submitted to Dáil Eireann.  The Committee shall consist of nine Teachtai, none of whom shall be a Minister, and five of whom shall constitute a quorum.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 46, as it is, would leave anything in the nature of putting the Committee on a proportional basis to some sort of private arrangement. Because if you take 46 literally it would mean that the Committee would be appointed in the ordinary way by a majority vote.  Perhaps the Committee on Standing Orders considered this.  It simply says: &ldquo;The Dáil may appoint special Committees upon Motions appearing on the Agenda. Such motions shall, save as otherwise provided in these Standing Orders, specifically state the terms of reference to <Col N="2147" /> the Committee, define the powers devolved upon them, nominate the members to act upon them, state the quorum in each case, and, if necessary, fix a date upon which they shall report back to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee were really considering it in the light of our own experience.  I think every Committee appointed heretofore has been appointed by proportional representation or on a basis that gave an agreed amount of representation to every party in the Dáil.  The Committee had that in their mind more than anything else when drawing up that Standing Order.  But that experience might be put into words and made binding.</P>

      <P>47 covers 46.  We accept the principle that the Committee ought to represent the whole Dáil.  I do not think there is any danger that any other opinion would prevail in any other Dáil, but it is just possible that a majority of the Dáil supporting a Government might possibly, for its own protection, appoint a Committee almost entirely representative of its own party. That is not the intention here.  With regard to the Committee that is to examine the accounts, that Committee ought certainly to be drawn from all sections.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that you might with advantage add &ldquo;according to the provisions of Standing Orders 46 and 47.&rdquo;  A small point arises on this, but on examination it may not prove to be so trifling.  I would suggest that instead of saying &ldquo;The Committees shall, as far as possible, be representative,&rdquo; which is hardly what is intended, that you might with advantage say &ldquo;Committees shall be, as far as possible, representative.&rdquo; There is a real difference between the two, and I think there should be a little amendment of the punctuation.  As it appears there it might be read that it was not desirable that a Committee should be representative because it was not possible, whereas by the slight change I suggest it would make it clear that it should be representative as far as possible.</P>

      <P>We would want to have defined the meaning of the word &ldquo;representative.&rdquo; It may be supposed to mean one from this side and one from that side and one from the other side. In my opinion, that would not be right at all.  It would not be representative of the Dáil.  One man from each party would be able to explain the views of that party, but he would not be representing them.  My idea of representation is that the parties ought to be represented on the Committees according to their power here, and according to the strength of the numbers that sent them here.  You can read two meanings into the word &ldquo;representative.&rdquo;  The real interpretation is, that the members of the Committee should be representative of the different parties, according to their strength.  Otherwise the Committee would not be representative of the Dáil.</P>

If the message were one of considerable urgency he might then interrupt the speaker who was on his feet and wait until he took his seat, and then communicate the message he received.  We would then decide whether we would interrupt the business of the Dáil and deal with it at once.  The message would be first delivered to the Ceann Comhairle, he would read it, and form his own opinion whether it appeared sufficiently urgent to stop the business at the moment to communicaite his message, or whether he would wait until the motion before the Dáil was debated.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of a Joint Sitting of Seanad Eireann and Dáil Eireann shall be the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Eireann.  The proceedings of every such Joint Sitting shall be governed by the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann, so far as they may be applicable to such Joint Sitting, and every question of the applicability of any Standing Order, or the adaptation thereof necessary or expedient for its application, shall be determined and ruled upon by the Chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>A question arises on that.  It may have been considered by the Committee, and I think it was.  I suggest that it might still be open to consideration.  &ldquo;The Chairman of the <Col N="2153" /> Joint Sitting shall be the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  I think it would be an act of grace if it were so arranged that you would have four chairmen&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle, or, in his absence, I suggest An Cathaoirleach; and, in his absence the Deputy Chairman of the Dáil; and, in the absence of these three the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad. I think it would be an act of grace, and would not affect in any way the privileges of the Dáil.  It has been put to me that it is a thing we ought to do here, not by anybody in touch with, or a member of the Seanad.  We have 128 members, and the other House is composed of 60 members, and when an election takes place the membership of the Dáil will be 153, while the membership of the Seanad remains at 60, pending alteration of the Constitution, if such were ever contemplated.  I think the number of possible orators from the Dáil would always be able to ambush any number of orators from the other House, so that this suggestion, I think, would be perfectly safe.  It would perhaps be looked upon as a graceful act, and, under all the circumstances, I do not think we stand to lose anything by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the matter of grace, there is a more practical consideration which puts the balance in the other direction.  The Constitution, and particularly the Articles of the Constitution moved by the President of the Executive Council, provide that the Seanad should make its own Standing Orders, and they may be very different from the Standing Orders of the Dáil. The practices in the Seanad are very different from the practices in the Dáil. The practices of the Chairman of the Seanad are very different from the practices of the Chairman of the Dáil, and inasmuch as some Standing Orders must be made for a joint sitting, and inasmuch as the place of meeting must necessarily be the place of meeting of the Dáil, the Committee thought the Standing Orders of the Dáil ought to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The President says certainly.  The Chairman must be a person who is familiar with the Standing Orders of the Dáil and administer the rules governing the debate.  A new chairman unfamiliar with the Standing <Col N="2154" /> Orders of the body over which he is to preside may make all kinds of blunders and cause a good deal of commotion in the conduct of debate, if there is not perfect harmony.  That is a practical consideration.  It seems to me to override the question of grace and courtesy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ERNEST BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the objections put up by the last speaker are very much in the nature of special pleading.  The joint sessions will be held for the purpose of debating but not voting upon proposals of any Bill or amendment, so that the Standing Orders which the chairman will be called upon to apply will be such as to be in the competence of any Chairman of the Seanad.  These joint sessions are something in the nature of conferences.  They are merely for the purpose of discussing things and perhaps arriving at a way out of some impasse that may have occurred; that is, the Seanad may be inclined to hold up a Bill for the period during which it can hold it up, unless it can get some concession.  On the other hand, the Dáil may be very desirous that the Bill should be passed through without delay. It may be inclined to make some concession. These joint sittings will be for the purpose of arriving at an amicable way out of the difficulty that has arisen, and I think, in view of the purpose, if they are to serve any purpose, it would be well that the question of the courtesies should be observed.  It is not a very important matter, but certainly I think that, as regards any question of a joint sitting, it will not add to the possibility of it being fruitful, and other than a mere waste of time, if the Dáil is to insist on claiming everything in the way not only of privilege, but of dignity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is certainly desirable to make some provision in the rule, instead of leaving it to chance.  I think the suggestion made by the President is as good as any other we are likely to come to.  Certainly some decision ought to be come to, because, look at the position we are in to-day.  Supposing a joint sitting were going on, and we were deprived of the services of our Ceann Comhairle.  There is no official Deputy available, and we would have the unpleasant difficulty of asking the Seanad and ourselves to vote between my colleague, <Col N="2155" /> Deputy Nicholls, and myself, or some other member of this body.  I think it is desirable that the matter be provided for by rule, and it is very improbable that all the people will not be available for a joint sitting.  It also is not a very great concession, because it looks more on paper than it probably will be in practice.  A joint sitting will occur so seldom, and will be so important, that I think we can take it for granted that it will not be fixed for a time or date on which our own presiding officer will not be available.  Therefore, the Deputy Chairman will only be called upon to serve for the period of rest and refreshment during the joint sitting period, whenever that may be.  I think the proposal of the President will smooth the difficulty, and certainly make provision for a case that actually exists to-day if we happened to be holding a joint sitting and there were no available official Deputy in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect that has been lost sight of.  We cannot say that the Chairman of the joint sitting shall be a member of the Seanad.  These are the Standing Orders of the Dáil, and we have been precluded from meeting the Seanad Committee for consideration of such matters as this. Therefore, we would be going outside our authority if we put into the Standing Orders a provision which said that the Chairman of the joint sitting of the Seanad and Dáil should be someone outside the control of the Dáil.  We should have to leave it in that case to the decision of the joint sitting.  In the absence of the Chairman of the Dáil we should have to leave it to the joint sitting to decide who would be chairman of that sitting.  We cannot put into the Standing Orders a provision that an officer of another House shall be at the disposal of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that argument could be carried further, and we could say that we, as one body, cannot decide who will be chairman at all at the joint sitting.  If there were to be any agreement on the matter, and if we were to take up the point of view that we must have our own way, and have nobody else, the Seanad would be entitled to say the same, and the matter, if it is to be provided <Col N="2156" /> for at all, should be provided for, not by Standing Orders, but by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at the question apart entirely from personal consideration, apart from your own very capable administration of the office you hold as Ceann Comhairle, and apart from taking into consideration how the duties of the office are discharged in the other House.  I am looking at it from the point of view of Article 38 of the Constitution, which says that a Bill having been sent up from this House, and not being passed by the other House, a joint sitting shall take place.  Now, a joint sitting must obviously take place in a majority of cases on the initiative of the Seanad.  It is they who ask for it.  It is they who really wish to discuss, and to point out here what their objections to a particular measure may be.  Is it not reasonable, and is it not right, that if there should be any misgiving on their part regarding the putting of their case that there should be some provision on their side at some stage of the proceedings for their own Cathaoirleach presiding over the proceedings? I have come across in my time, as well as many others, difficult propositions as a chairman, and they did not terrorise me.  Generally, I manage to get through the ordinary business.  There might be cases where the Chairman of the Seanad might not act impartially.  I do not think it is at all likely in an assembly composed of the two most important bodies of the nation that any individual, no matter how strong-minded he might be, would attempt to abuse his office to such an extent as to prejudice the putting of cases by members of the Dáil.  The Standing Orders must be the subject of consideration of any person who is likely to occupy the position of president over a joint sitting of the two Houses.  It will be really a debate which does not involve all the intricacies of the ordinary duties of a chairman of the Dáil, and, as such, I would have no fear whatever. I do not believe that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad would abuse his office, and, even if he were to, I would have no fear for eventualities.</P>

The obvious thing for us to do was to make rules for our own House.  If the Seanad asked us to make rules for their House, we would gladly have done so; but since we cannot bind them down in any way, the only thing we could do was to make our own rules and to stand by them.  We tried to get around this in various ways, but were always confronted with the statement that we could not interfere.</P>

These Orders are not binding on the Seanad unless the members of the Seanad care to accept them, and care, so far as they are concerned, to apply them to their own use. So far as it concerns the Seanad, anything we may do here is simply permissive and in the nature of giving an authority. Nothing that we can do, as far as I can see, can possibly be binding, and certainly we have no authority, apart from the concurrence of the Seanad, to draw up Orders for a joint sitting.  We are drawing them up in order to bind ourselves in the case of a joint sitting.</P>

We should not use the argument that we have no authority over the members of the Seanad, to prevent ourselves from doing anything that we might think it reasonable to do.  What we should have in mind in the present circumstances is what is a reasonable thing to do.</P>

      <P>To my mind we have the matter in our hands in this way; if we have no power to make rules for a joint sitting, it is perfectly certain the Seanad has no power to make rules for a joint sitting.  Then it comes to this, that the joint sitting must make its own Standing Orders.  I think we have a clear vote of two to one in a joint sitting.  Therefore, it is clear that if we can agree here upon what we think are proper Standing Orders, we can carry them wherever the matter may be raised.</P>

I think the best thing to be done in this matter would be that, to preclude the difficulties to which the Minister for Local Government has referred, which have been indicated by Deputy Shannon, that each House might draw up its own Standing Orders respecting joint sessions, and the members of each House obeying its own Standing Orders would lead to a state of chaos, the best thing would be to refer this to a joint committee of both Houses, <Col N="2159" /> of which one half would be appointed now, and then an agreed conclusion could be brought to each House from such Joint Committee.</P>

      <P>We have here distinctly got a very important case that does affect rulings that will be of considerable effect hereafter.  We have stated that the Standing Orders for Dáil Eireann shall be the Standing Orders of that joint session, and although it is perfectly true that no vote will be taken, and the matter be confined merely to debate, it is perfectly clear to anyone who has attended the meetings of the Seanad that they have developed on different lines of procedure there to what we have developed, and I think it is extremely likely that the tangent will be developed still more markedly by the continuance of each separate practice.  I fail to see how the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad will be able to interpret and apply, or, if necessary, adopt the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann, employing the procedure and practice of Dáil Eireann under these <Col N="2160" /> Standing Orders, if he is wholly unfamiliar with the Orders and with the practices and with the procedure.  The Committee, I imagine must have given very careful consideration to this on those lines, and, I think, it is perfectly clear that Standing Orders can only be interpreted by those to whom they are familiar, and those are the persons who have been in the habit of adjudicating upon them.  I do not see why such a course should in any way be considered tactless or discourteous to the Seanad. There is no question of tactlessness or discourtesy implied in the matter at all.  It is simply a question if the Chairman of the Seanad should in a particular case give a ruling that every member of the Dáil knew to be contrary to the practice of the Dáil, and if a member of the Dáil were to arrive and state that such were the case, with the consent of his colleagues, in spite of the fact that the Chairman's ruling would be final, that the Chairman himself would be put in a very delicate and awkward position.</P>

      <P>I think a lot of these objections to the President's amendment are based on the supposition that the Chairman of the Seanad will be a very ignorant individual.  It does not require a man of very great intelligence to understand our Standing Orders.  I think a man of ordinary intelligence ought to be able to understand them and rule accordingly.  Of course, if the Deputy assumes that the Chairman is likely to be an ignorant individual, of course, he is right.  I think you seem to strike a note of no confidence in yourselves, and that you are subordinate to the Seanad or somebody else.  If you make your orders, and these people come here, they have got to obey them.  I do not think there is any ground for discriminating here at all.  I think when you passed so many Standing Orders that you can also pass this one.  I do not see why you should strain at this at all.  There is no reason why you should.  I think it would be an act of courtesy more or less.  No doubt they are a lesser body in every way&mdash;in numbers, influence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only thing I am puzzled about is as to what Deputy Figgis is at.  I have looked through the rules of debate, and I do not find in any way that any person presiding over a meeting of the two Houses sitting together would be in a position to act unfairly towards anyone.  I do see here that the Chairman, in the event of a member misconducting himself, is under instructions to have the offending member removed.  I do not know if the Deputy has that in mind, that he would object to be removed on the order of the Chairman of the Seanad in the event of his misconducting himself; but there is nothing else in it.  It is not a question of resolutions, motions, and so on; it is only a question of relevancy to the subject under discussion, and it has nothing to do with the business; there is no finality about it.  It simply exhausts the subject which the Seanad, in its wisdom, thinks has not been sufficiently exhausted in the treatment before the Dáil when the Bill has been under consideration, or that the Dáil has not considered in the correct perspective whatever views the Seanad may have had on that particular Bill.  I do not know any way in which the Chairman could, without gravely abusing the Standing Orders, infringe on any member's liberty.  I do not know how, if it were likely that he should do such a thing, that with the knowledge that we have of the rules it would not be possible to bring it to his knowledge; and as, however, I expect there are more sensible men in the world than there are fools, like a sensible man the person occupying the Chair at that time can see at once the force of these remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has misunderstood, in my opinion, the powers of the Seanad in respect of joint sittings. Their power is not so slight.  It is not merely to come and meet and discuss and affirm a single resolution.  The Constitution provides that for &ldquo;a Bill other than a Money Bill a joint sitting of the members of both Houses may, on a resolution passed by Seanad Eireann, be convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon, the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo; Now, they may begin at Clause 1 and go right through.  That joint sitting <Col N="2162" /> might continue for twenty-one days unless the Standing Orders of the Dáil are made operative.  The Standing Orders of the Dáil make provision for meeting members who are overstepping the bounds of order, for motions and amendments, and if the Chairman is not familiar with those Standing Orders, members who are inclined to be obstructive or to strain the Standing Orders to the utmost can make havoc with the business.  If it were simply a joint meeting to discuss a formal resolution it would be an entirely different matter; but here we have the phrase, &ldquo;for the purpose of debating the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo;  They may make it into a very big proposition and a long-continued one.  It all depends upon the Chairman if the Seanad decide that they are not going to agree with the Dáil, that they are going to challenge a vote on every amendment that we wish to bring forward.  That is the motion that the President moved, and I am sure he must have had in mind the possibility that any question on any Bill might be brought forward, unless it is a Money Bill.</P>

      <P>Well, if I have learned one lesson in my life, it is that debates similar to those on the Treaty will never take place again in this country. I think that they exhausted all the oratory in the country, and that nobody wants to see a repetition of them.  So much so, I think, that one man wrote in one of the Dublin papers that he went to confession and confessed that he had stolen a goat and the penance he got was to read the Dáil speeches on the Treaty debate seven times.  That, I think, is our safeguard with regard to any prolongation of debate over these matters.  The Seanad, as I have seen it, is a body which does not want prolonged debates.  It does its business rather quickly, I think, and it did so any time I was there, and this Dáil is of much the same character.  I have no fear of a prolongation of a debate of that sort, particularly in view of the experiences we have had.</P>

      <P>I think it must be quite clear to the Dáil that there is no substance at all in the points put forward by Deputy Johnson.  The object of a joint session would be to allow to members <Col N="2163" /> of the Seanad an opportunity of convincing members of the Dáil and converting them to their point of view on some particular business.  They will not do that by making long and unnecessary speeches.  As to having the thing continued from day to day, that is utterly impossible.  The Dáil will, in response to a request from the Seanad, arrange for a joint sitting.  It will set apart a particular day, say a Tuesday, for the joint sitting, and there will be no meeting of the Dáil on that day.  The meetings of the Dáil will continue on the Wednesday, and the Seanad cannot possibly occupy this House without the consent of the Dáil.  The joint session cannot continue when the Dáil meets, so that the whole thing is pure nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest that was the difficulty that arose just before Christmas, when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was unable to attend here.  You may remember that for two consecutive nights, when we were sitting from 3 o'clock to 8.30 p.m., the Ceann Comhairle was in the chair the whole time, without being able to leave for tea or anything else, because there was no rule which enabled anyone to take his place.  He was not absent, and, therefore, Standing Order No. 3 did not come into operation.  My impression is that when we passed Standing Order No. 3, what we had in our mind was the possibility of the Dáil assembling here and finding neither the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputy on the spot, and of then electing somebody to take the chair, in order to go on with the business.  I think it would be well to make provision of the kind that we have been working upon lately without any Standing Order to meet it.  This proposed Standing Order does not quite do that.  It is entirely for the Dáil to say whether it would be better to let the Ceann Comhairle himself nominate two Deputies who could take the chair temporarily, as the Deputy Nicholls and myself have been doing for half an hour or so in the evenings lately, or whether the Dáil itself should nominate at the beginning of the session, two Teachtai who should act in the case of both the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle being absent, or in case of the Ceann Comhairle being present and desiring to vacate the chair for half an hour.  I do not care who does it, but, I think, it would be more convenient that at the begnning of the Session we should nominate two Teachtai who could be called on temporarily in a case of necessity, rather than that it should be left to the Ceann Comhairle to get up himself in the chair and say he was tired and wanted to go away for half an hour. I think the Dáil itself should appoint someone, and I do not think that duty ought to be imposed upon the Ceann Comhairle.  I think he ought to have the right, as he has been permitted lately to have it, to ask someone to take his place. Whether that person should be nominated by the Dáil, or by the Ceann Comhairle himself, I have not endeavoured to form any opinion on it.</P>

      <P>As the motion stood it seems clear to me that, when we were dealing with meetings of the Dáil as such, in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputies, the Dáil must appoint a substitute.  That is certainly the intention as I see it now, and the Panel was to be a sessional arrangement for Committee work.  I gather now from Deputy Fitzgibbon that he favours the proposal that the Panel should be formed at the beginning of the session, even for meetings of the Dáil.  Whether that is desirable or not I have no particular <Col N="2169" /> opinion.  Perhaps it might be wiser to leave it as it stands, and, in the absence of the two appointed Deputies, the Dáil itself should appoint a substitute for meetings of the Dáil.  In practice it will probably result in the Chairman of the Committee, or at least one of the Panel Teachta, being appointed.</P>

      <P>They are two different types of cases altogether. We have already agreed to an amendment of this Order, which would enable the Ceann Comhairle to call on his Deputy, or, in the absence of the Deputy, on one or other of the Teachtai on the Panel to preside either in the Dáil or in Committee.  That, I think, is agreeable to everybody; but when the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputy are absent the Dáil should itself appoint a substitute, that is the question.  If you leave the Order as it has been amended now, it will provide that the Dáil itself will appoint a substitute in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputy, but that the Ceann Comhairle will have the power himself when present.</P>

      <P>In view of the wording of Standing Order No. 10, I think Deputies generally were more or less satisfied that we should wind up at 6 o'clock.  It certainly gives us an opportunity of doing other business. The day is occupied entirely with the Dáil, and there is very limited time for doing other business.  I was informed by some of the Deputies that 6 o'clock suited them better than 8.30.  I suggest to substitute 6 o'clock.  It would mean putting in 6 o'clock in the Standing Orders where 8.30 p.m. occurs at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>Constituents would be objecting to the work of the bricklayers. It may, of course, be very trying to Ministers, but in any case a three-hour day is not sufficient, and I think it is far better to leave the matter as it stands at present, and if the Ministers find that it is desirable to adjourn the sitting about 6 or 6.30 o'clock, and if there is nothing pressing, well, it might be conceded while the need lasts.  But I should expect that there will be quite a good deal of legislation afoot.  A number of Bills have been promised, and there are a number more that have not been promised, but that are necessary, and they may take a considerable time for discussion.  I would urge that the present arrangements be not altered in the Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>We can fairly say to the Deputy's suggestion that the bricklayer is concerned only with getting certain articles presented to his hand by other people.  He is not like a Deputy or Minister in this Dáil who may have to consider for an hour or two or three or four in the morning before he starts work the particular method of regulating the bricks he may adopt during the day.  It is well known that some subjects that <Col N="2172" /> we have under discussion here would, in order to be ready for them, require very much more study than the time spent here permits.  That has been my experience.</P>

      <P>I think it would be unwise to make an amendment to Standing Order No. 10 without considering Standing Order No. 58.  It is only in the later part of the day, and only on two days of the week, that a private member's Bill can be proceeded with, and if we were to make a general Standing Order for adjournment at six o'clock, the effect of that would be practically to wipe out private members' business altogether.</P>

      <P>Of course I know it was not; but we went through these Orders, and it was on that account I had Order 58 in my mind.  You would either have to give private members the whole day on Wednesday or Friday, or else you would have to provide in your Standing Order that Wednesday and Friday would be excepted from the days that we rise at six o'clock.  I would suggest to the President that we will get along all right as we have been going.  Nobody will endeavour to force Ministers to go on sitting until eight o'clock if they express any real desire to rise earlier.  It is always in their power to adjourn at six o'clock if they like.  We must guard the rights of private members as much as possible, because there will be a certain amount of private members' business coming on later, and it should not be in the power of the Dáil to shelve private members' business by forcing the Dáil to sit late in order to discharge it.  The kind of business brought forward by private members is of such a nature that it only interests a small minority of the population, and if a private member is forced to get up and move that the Dáil sit longer in order to do the private member's business, the result will be that human nature will prevail and we will not do it.</P>

      <P>There is a point of construction which arises very frequently on Standing Order No. 10. Suppose notice is given that a matter will be raised on the adjournment and the adjournment is proposed at 6 o'clock, can the debate go on until 8.30, or until people are tired of talking, whichever is the earlier, or is it the intention of this Standing Order that the debate shall be restricted to half an hour?

That is&mdash;the debate will continue for half an hour.  There has been no actual insistence on that Order, but that was the intention.

      <P>There is one point, but I take it that it is not very likely to arise.  If amendments are proposed on the Fourth Stage and a Bill is recommitted for consideration, for instance, and if the amendments are passed would it be possible to proceed with that stage without having the matter again put on the agenda?  This recommittal of a Bill, I take it, will not mean a greater delay than would occur at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the intention of the Committee was, and I think it should be generally approved, that if an amendment of substance is introduced on <Col N="2179" /> the Fourth Stage after discussion in Committee, then whatever time is necessary to insert amendments to that new form should be allowed.  It might mean delay, but it is intended that there should be some check upon the bringing forward of important matters on the Fourth Stage This is one of the checks.  If there is general agreement, then the usual procedure can be agreed to, and the Standing Orders may be suspended for that particular purpose.  It is intended that there should be some check upon the production of substantial amendments on the Fourth Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept what Deputy Johnson has said.  It has hitherto frequently happened that what are in fact and in practice substantial amendments are really amendments introduced as a result of discussion, and, perhaps, compromise, in the Committee Stage. They are hardly parallel with what I might consider new amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee considered that.  For example, on a Bill to be considered to-morrow, the Minister for Local Government has an amendment down&mdash;I think it is to abolish all disqualifications for outdoor relief.  That is an important amendment. It was put down by the Minister in response to an agreement in Committee that all disqualification should be removed. In that case if anybody asks for an expression of opinion from the Ceann Comhairle, whether it was a new matter, the Bill would be recommitted.  I pointed out to the Committee on Procedure that these Standing Orders mean that any Deputy who asked for that opinion and got it, that it was a new matter or an amendment of substance, would be entitled to claim that the Standing Orders should be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object, I think, was that when an amendment with substance in it was introduced, the matter comes under the rules of debate of the Dáil, which prevent anyone speaking more than once upon it.  When you are discussing the wording of a new section it very often happens that one wants to add a few words to what one has said in an amendment, or to correct something that has been put in.  That is more than a verbal explanation, and it is to <Col N="2180" /> provide that the rules of debate in Committee shall apply in what is really Committee work&mdash;the moving of a new clause or substantial amendment.  I do not think it is intended that a great delay should be caused in the consideration of a Bill, and my impression was that it would work like this: A new amendment is introduced; some members suggest we should go into Committee; that is agreed, and when it has been considered on rules governing debate in Committee we should then report at once to the Dáil, and go on with the Fourth Stage in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was understood. The only thing is that Rule 74 prescribes that when a Bill is returned from the Committee notice shall be given to receive it for final consideration. I was wondering if it might be thought that a new notice would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might.  I think we should be quite clear.  If an important amendment is introduced on the Fourth stage, and on motion the matter is referred to Committee, discussed in Committee, and passed, the Bill then takes upon itself a form different from that in which it emerged from the ordinary Committee Stage.  If members demand it, I think they should be allowed time to bring forward an amendment on the Report Stage, following the rules of Report Stage.  I think it would not happen very often.  I think it is an exceptional case that would arise; but the liberty ought to be there.  If an important amendment is concluded in a new Committee Stage, then the proceedings that are set down for the consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report ought to apply, except by general leave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>If you wanted to do that, Deputy Johnson's difficulty would be met, if, on the motion to report back to the Dáil, the Dáil was of opinion that we ought not to report back at once, we could report back on the Thursday of the following week or so. That would give the Dáil an opportunity to have complete control over its whole procedure.  The point of substance in this amendment is that when new matter <Col N="2181" /> was being discussed, we should discuss it under the rules governing Committee Stage.  Then, when we move to report that Committee work back to the Dáil, if the Dáil as a whole thought it ought not to be dealt with at once, and that further time should be allowed, it would be within the power of the Dáil so to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very valuable amendment, because we already have had experience of the necessity of being at liberty, even at this final stage, to alter in substantial respects some things left in because of oversight. I would like to suggest that when an amendment, such as is contemplated in this suggestion arises, where a Bill has come from a special Committee, it should not be recommitted to the special Committee, but to a Committee of the whole Dáil.  The reason for that is that if the necessity for this amendation has escaped notice until this last stage has been reached, it is something about which it is desirable that the Dáil as a whole should have an opportunity to consider and debate.  As regards this further portion that has not yet been touched on: In the case of a Bill returned from the Dáil sitting in Committee, any amendment previously returned shall be in order, it is possible to draft an amendment in such wise that it would defy the wit even of the present distinguished occupant of the Chair to decide that it was an amendment already rejected. I would like to have the words &ldquo;no amendment or any colourable equivalent of it, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, shall be in order.&rdquo; Just as we have given discretionary power to the Chairman to decide whether or not an amendment moved is one of substance and should be reconsidered, we ought to specifically state that it is for the determination of the Chairman, and that his decision shall be final, as to whether an amendment brought forward is in effect an amendment already disposed of by rejection.  Otherwise, unless we give the power of final decision to the Chairman, it would mean a waste of time, and we might have debate upon debate on the matter.</P>

The question raised by Deputy Magennis is one upon which I would like to have the opinion of some members of the Committee on Procedure.  It is, whether when a Bill is returned from Committee this proposed Standing Order means recommittal to a Special Committee or to the whole Dáil.

      <P>I do think it would be better, in spite of what the Minister for Local Government said, that it be provided that the Bill shall be re-committed to the whole Dáil for this reason; obviously the new amendment would be brought up for consideration by the whole Dáil, and not by the Special Committee, because it is moved in the whole Dáil.  Presumably it is an amendment of a kind that the whole Dáil would be considered a proper tribunal to deal with.  It would save time, and it is difficult to conceive circumstances under which, after a Bill had been thrashed out in a Special Committee and had come up on the Fourth Stage, it would be necessary to send back to the Special Committee for consideration an amendment that had been brought along in the First Stage.</P>

      <P>As against that the Special Committee has had the whole discussion, and would understand better what change had taken place in the balance of the Bill, and the effect of the new amendment on certain preceding clauses.

I think it should be left open for the Dáil to decide whether it should be re-committed to the Special Committee or discussed by the Dáil in Committee.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be well to explain the purpose of this suggestion&mdash;81B. It is that there shall be appointed a Committee at the beginning of the Session which shall have the duty thrust upon it of examining the Orders laid upon the Table of the Dáil in accordance with the provisions of Acts of Parliament, and that it shall report, if it thinks well, to the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present Orders are laid upon the Table, and, of course, it is optional for every Deputy, one might even go so far as to say that it is the duty of every Deputy to examine these Orders and compare them, and see what they connote and see whether they are within the bounds or intentions of the legislature. Deputies do not, and never will do that, and cannot be expected to do it.  But if a Committee is set up which shall consider it its duty to examine these Orders, and report on them if necessary, I think it will be found that the future legislation would admit with more readiness a provision that Regulations might be made by Order than if there were no <Col N="2187" /> such Committee.  The Committee on Procedure consider that a Committee of this kind, having such a duty, would help to facilitate the business, and would prevent motions, perhaps, being brought forward by individual members objecting to certain regulations simply because they did not understand them.  If a committee of this kind were appointed it would be able to find out the meaning of such regulations and orders, and probably would save a good deal of time for the Dail, which otherwise would be wasted by private members initiating debates on matters which they did not thoroughly understand.  I think the proposal is a wise one, and will add to the business procedure of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that, so far as I understand this motion, and it has been recommended by Deputy Johnson, it seems to me to make for a waste rather than for an economy of time.  Observe what is to happen.  In accordance with some Statute, an Order is laid upon the Table of the Dáil.  Unless objected to and defeated by a specific resolution, within 21 days it becomes operative.  Now, here a machine is created by which a Committee of a number not decided, and constituted in a way not determined, is to submit this Order to critical examination and to report upon it, and that report is to be circulated and become itself in turn a subject for debate.  Now we will assume that there is a majority and a minority report possible in this matter.  Each of the reports, of course, is to be circulated, and a debate upon these&mdash;why, this is simply multiplying work.  Deputy Johnson said that it was the duty of every member to make himself acquainted with the documents laid upon the Table of the Dáil.  I cordially agree, <Col N="2188" /> but a moment later he said&mdash;perhaps this is captious criticism&mdash;that the ordinary member could not be expected to do that, that is, he cannot be expected to do what is his plain duty in the matter, and because he cannot be expected to discharge the duty that is plainly incumbent on him, a Committee must be appointed beforehand which is to make up his mind for him, or to assist him in making up his mind in the matter.  I suggest, with all respect, that this is merely creating new opportunities for debate.  It is certainly taking away the liberty of spontaniety of criticism from individuals, because if a Committee on which Deputy Johnson and Deputy Fitzgibbon, for example, and others of whom I might name, constituted of membership of that type, were to report against a rule, and that an individual member like me should have to be guilty of the temerity of setting up his judgment against it, he would incur the odium of wasting the time of the Dáil by a calling in question their report.  I suggest that the Standing Orders are much better without this incumbrance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has assumed that the Standing Order makes it incumbent on that Committee to make a report.  It does not.  They shall, if they consider it necessary, report.  Every member of the Dáil is supposed to be conversant with every law, but, of course, we depute to specialists the responsibility of undertaking the duties which are imposed as a matter of fact on every citizen.  We are presumed to know the law.  In that sense I say it is the duty of every Deputy to understand every clause of every Bill brought before us, and also to understand the implications of every Order laid upon the Table for the information of Deputies.  But while that may be the nominal duty, we know as a matter of practice that it is outside the bounds of possibility, and, because of that, we make provision for the appointment of Special Committees to examine special Bills.  Every Deputy is supposed to have equal knowledge upon every subject.  There may be very conscientious Deputies, who would want to examine every Bill or Order that is laid upon the Table, and we know from experience that we may think we have got hold of very important defects, and we <Col N="2189" /> take the opportunity of raising the question within twenty-one days before the Dáil, and promote a discussion upon it, and inveigle another half-dozen Deputies to take part in the discussion.  All that may be saved if a Committee were in existence that could examine such a matter and have a right to call upon an expert from the Department concerned to explain.  I am confident that such a provision would save the time of the Dáil and not waste it, and probably would facilitate legislation in matters of detail by allowing what, probably, Deputy Professor Magennis will not approve of, certain kinds of legislation to be done by Order.  I can see the possibility of this method of legislation developing in this country, just as it has developed in England during these last few years.  There are advantages in it, but only so far as these advantages are under the control of the Dáil and under direct control.  I think if the responsibility for examining these Orders is thrown on every individual member indiscriminately, the check that should be applied will probably not be applied, but if a Committee has the duty thrust upon it of examining such Orders we may feel more security in allowing that kind of legislation.  That is the intention of the proposed Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the proposal either goes too far or does not go far enough because I consider that to be effective it ought to provide that all these Orders and Regulations and documents ought not to be put on the Table of the Dáil but ought to be sent to the Committee; because I cannot see myself, assuming that I was on that Committee, coming here half an hour or an hour earlier every day in order to grope about the Table to see what papers had been put there since the night before Some means ought to be provided for bringing to the notice of the Committee the fact that these Orders had been made, because otherwise the Committee will come here one at a time and some of them may forget to come, and unless we make provision for this Committee to meet every day, or for the Orders to be sent direct to it, in the first instance, I do not think it will have the desired effect.  The Committee will no more go about looking for Orders that are not brought to their notice than the <Col N="2190" /> ordinary member of the Dáil will, and yet the Dáil will tend to rely upon this Committee to bring to its notice in the proper time anything that they ought to notice.  They shirk their own duty, and they rely on the Committee, but probably, being human beings like the other Deputies, the Committee will not do anything except what is actually thrust upon it, so that the Orders will not receive even the attention they receive at present.  I am afraid it would not work.</P>

      <P>I should explain that there is a certain amount of confusion, perhaps, in the phrase &ldquo;Papers laid on the Table.&rdquo;&ldquo;Papers laid on the Table&rdquo; means papers which have been sent to the Clerk and which in future, when we get a Library, will be sent to the Librarian and will be available for the inspection of Deputies in the Library or in the Members' Rooms.  Notice that such papers have been received is always printed on the Order Paper.  I should like to hear the point of the Minister for Local Government about the words &ldquo;available for discussion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;printed and circulated to Deputies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think it would be preferable to say &ldquo;printed and circulated.&rdquo; It may be that no member of the Committee may wish to propose any motion in the Dáil, but if they have anything to report about one of these documents, that should be available for discussion and the way it should be made available is by having it printed as a report and circulated in the way that the Order papers are circulated, and any member may take any action he chooses.</P>

      <P>What guarantee have we that this Committee will do more than any ordinary member?  I take it that it is within the ordinary duties of members and we are told that the ordinary member will not look at these papers and will not do what is his duty.  What guarantee have we that the Committee is going to do this? None at all.  Besides, they can initiate discussions on legislation that may never be passed.  This may be good in some directions but I think it could also be abused, and in fact I think it <Col N="2191" /> will do more harm than good, and we have no guarantee whatever that the members of this Committee would do more than the ordinary member would do.</P>

      <P>I would like to put a case.  Suppose a paper is presented to the Dáil, under a statutory provision which sets forth that unless a resolution annulling this particular document is passed in the Dáil before the expiration of twenty-one days, the document or order, whatever it may be, becomes law.  The Committee suggested here has that document before it, and it prints and circulates a report.  I take it that what is intended is that, in the light of the report, a Deputy will move that the Order be annulled, or will refrain from moving that the Order be annulled, but he will not be able to move something about this report if the Statute under which the Order is presented provides that some other resolution must be moved about the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, and if you will allow me, I should like to supplement what you have said.  If any member of the Dáil not included in that Committee wished to impeach the rule or Order, he may be held up by the answer that the Committee has investigated it and has not reported; but how is that Deputy to become aware of the date on which it will be within his power so to move, the Committee either having regarded the thing as a matter not to report on or having overlooked it altogether? It seems to me altogether a needless obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that is quite so; but the Committee might make it undesirable for him to raise the matter until the Committee itself, under the Standing Orders, has issued a report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely any Deputy would know who constituted the Committee, and such Deputy would have the ear of the Chairman of that Committee. If the Deputy who sees a flaw or an objectionable paragraph in the Order wishes to raise the matter in the Dáil independently of the Committee, there is nothing <Col N="2192" /> to prevent him.  If, on the other hand, he wishes to bring to the notice of the Committee such flaw or objectionable Order, the Committee is there, ready and available for him, and the Committee could either examine the point that he raised, or disabuse his mind of what is, perhaps, a fallacy.  The one argument used that may have some effect, is the leaving of the option to the Committee to report.  I would be prepared to support the suggested amendment saying that the Committee shall report within ten or fifteen days&mdash;a report in which they might say, &ldquo;We have examined it and find no objection.&rdquo;  But the only point made which seems to me to have any substance is the point that the Committee may or may not report, as it wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Johnson not realise that what he has now proposed is, that in addition to the Cabinet, the Executive Council of the Ministry, there shall be set up another sort of Cabinet, and that other members, not constituting the Committee, are to report to this secondary Cabinet the objections that occur to them regarding certain Orders laid on the Table of the Dáil; whatever fallacy is operating on the mind of the objector, that fallacy should be removed, and his mind quietened by the Committee?</P>
      <P>So, in fact a great deal of what is the initiative, and not merely the privilege, but the duty of members of the Dáil is by this grandmotherly system to be taken over from them, and put into the leading strings of a Committee.  If his objection is good, the Committee will bring it forward, and if objection does not find favour in the sight of the committee they will make his mind easy about it, and with this placating influence at work all will go smoothly with the Order on the Table of the Dáil.  It is a most specious proposition, and seems to be giving nothing, while taking much away.</P>

      <P>There have been in other Houses Committees on Estimates. We are proposing a Committee on Public Accounts.  One might say, it is the duty of every Member of the Dáil to examine into the accounts and estimates, but we are relegating the specialised work of examination of accounts and estimates to a Committee, and we are asking them to report, and in the case of accounts, if they do report on them, that does not deprive the individual Member of the Dáil from investigating into and reporting on any account and making any motion that he may think fit.  Nothing in this proposal will deprive any Deputy of any right he has to-day.  What it does is to throw a particular duty upon a particular group of Deputies.  Any group of Members may decide that they shall form a Committee of this kind on anything, but they will only have the rights of any group of individual Deputies.  But the proposal is, that there shall be officially appointed by the Dáil a Committee that will have responsibility.  But it is not the intention, and it is not implied in the Standing Orders, that any of the present rights of any Deputy shall be in any way given up or lost.  All the rights the Deputies have will continue, but the particular duty will be thrown upon a group of Members to do certain work; and you are doing that every week, and why there <Col N="2194" /> should be a particular objection in this case I cannot understand.</P>

As a matter of order, I want to make it clear that action in the Dáil, by way of a Motion, would have to be taken on the Order or on the documents, and not upon the Report of the Committee.  Nobody could move that the Dáil approves of the Report of the Committee, if there was a Statutory provision that some other kind of motion could be made on the Order or on the documents.</P>

This has come as a great surprise to me, and I do not see that there is much use in it.  I fail to appreciate all that Deputy Johnson has said.  He seems to attach considerable importance to it and to view it very favourably, and thinks it would be of some advantage.

      <P>The argument in favour of that would not be the same as the argument in favour of Orders and Regulations, if there were Orders and Regulations which might be annulled by the Dáil within a limited time.  The Committee might prevent, perhaps, unnecessary discussions due to misunderstanding on these Orders and Regulations. But in the case of other documents <Col N="2195" /> I think the only effect of the Committee's report would be to cause unnecessary discussion.  In the case of ordinary documents, any one on which action must be taken within a limited time, discussions could properly be raised by any interested Deputy.  There would not be the same temptation to rush into discussion if he had only a very limited time within which to take action.</P>

      <P>I think, with all respect, that &ldquo;qualified to vote&rdquo; is too vague.  It may sound hypercritical, but let me quote an instance that will appeal at least to Deputy Fitzgibbon.  A man took a ticket for the grand stand at Doncaster races.  He offended the steward of the races.  In the issue it will be seen that this example appeals to the taste of Deputy Fitzgibbon rather than to the taste of Deputy Gorey.  This man offended one of the stewards, and he had him removed from the grounds.  He had paid a guinea for his ticket, and so he protested against his removal and brought an action.  It was held that the right to be on the lands of another man must be given by deed, and as the ticket was not an instrument signed, sealed and delivered, he had no right of action whatever. The law being interpreted in this meticulous way, the question of <i>compos mentis</i> might arise.  A man might have taken the oath in due form, signed the roll, and yet not be qualified legally.  I suggest, therefore, that the formula you submitted yourself is better&mdash;that is, the &ldquo;right to vote.&rdquo;  That precludes the <Col N="2200" /> necessity for these minute enquiries as to the state of mind and health, and so on.</P>
