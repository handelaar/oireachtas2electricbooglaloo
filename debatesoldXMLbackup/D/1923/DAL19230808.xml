      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that, after the landing of the National Army in Dingle, in November last, a number of horses and cars belonging to carters and jarveys in that town were commandeered, and which were used for a period of four or five months for military operations, and, as a result of which, the cars have been damaged and the horses have deteriorated in value; whether he has received claims on behalf of those carters and jarveys in respect of the use of their horses and cars; and why payment of those claims has not been made.</P>

      <P>If there is no objection I would move for permission to introduce the Damage to Property (Amendment) Bill, 1923, so as to leave the road clear.  It is a Bill to amend and extend the Damage to Property Compensation Act of 1923.  It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that the date which was fixed determining the liability of the State in respect of the Damage to Property Act was the 20th March, 1923.  Some objection was made at that time by certain Deputies, and I think by one County Council, as to limiting the date to the 20th March.  There has not been very much damage done, relatively speaking, since the 20th March, but a case was put up by more than one Deputy that it should be extended to the 31st March, and some suggested a still later date.  It is generally the view that it is scarcely fair to charge a local authority in the area of whose jurisdiction damage has been done from that date until things became normal with the cost which is generally accepted as a national liability. It is proposed to insert the date the 12th May in the Amending Bill.  I do not think it is likely that any case will be made against that particular date.  It was suggested here on the last day that we might make it the 20th April.  Altering the date to the passing of the Damage to Property Act at least has this advantage; it was certainly a much more normal time, and it is a generous acceptation of the case put forward.  I formally move for leave to bring in the Bill.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the farming element, and of the ratepayers in general, I may say that we quite agree that there was no case at all for fixing such an arbitrary date as the 20th March.  As events have turned out, it was found necessary that the date should be advanced.  I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Finance has advanced the date to the 20th May.  We have to pay the taxes and the rates, and it will be easier for us to pay in taxes for damage rather than to pay in rates.  On that account we appreciate very much <Col N="1962" /> the Minister's efforts to relieve us.  We hope there will not be occasion to further advance that date.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;In Sub-section (2) <i>(b)</i> to insert after the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in line 3 the words &ldquo;and which at the date of the passing of this Act retained its residential character.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in effect to make good an omission which was made, if I may use the expression, by the Dáil itself. We had intended to make it perfectly clear that every question as to whether land was belonging to this or that category should be looked at from the point of view of its character as from the date of the passing of the Act.  We omitted to make that clear.  This amendment makes it clear.  When considering whether a holding is residential or not, and so outside the purview of the Act, the question must be considered from the point of view of the character of the holding at the date of the passing of the <Col N="1963" /> Act, not from the point of view of the character of the holding two, three, four or forty years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with Amendment No. 3:&mdash; In Sub-section (3) <i>(c)</i> of Section 24 to delete in lines 6&mdash;7 the words &ldquo;regularly employed on&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;in connection with.&rdquo;  I want to assure the Dáil that there is no catch in this amendment. The section will then read:&mdash;&ldquo;Any parcel of untenanted land which is a demesne, home farm, park, garden or pleasure ground, or any holding usually occupied by a person in connection with,&rdquo; and so on.  The point is this&mdash; the obvious case that one would have in mind, and which the last two or three lines of that clause were intended to cover, would be the case of a gate-house on the other side of the road opposite the demesne gates.  It is not only usual but possible and quite probable that a man in the gate-house would not be working in the demesne at all.  He might have a gate-house and an acre or an acre and a half behind it on the understanding that he would open the gate if necessary.  What happens is that the man is regularly employed somewhere else, and that his wife or son opens the gate when required.  The clause itself was intended to cover such cases when going through the Dáil, but, in fact, it did not cover such cases.  It did not cover the greater number of cases that should be excluded, and undoubtedly if a man is at a gate-house in connection with such work and gets that gate-house on the understanding that he or some member of his family shall open the gate, it would be too bad that he, by reason of the fact that he got into that gate-house for such a purpose a few days before, that he should be put in the <Col N="1964" /> position of an ordinary farmer in future. That was never intended.  Two or three lines there were intended to make clear that he should not purchase.  A clause is provided further down to cover such cases or cases where a man at a gate-lodge whose wife and daughter open the gate, and who works elsewhere himself. There is another side to it.  A man might occupy a house and be regularly employed in the demesne and be entitled to purchase, and in order to get as near as we possibly could we inserted the words &ldquo;occupied in connection with.&rdquo;  There are two points of view&mdash; there are two sides to the question&mdash;on the one side you have the case where a man occupies a gate-house and is not regularly employed on the demesne, and he should not purchase, and it was never intended he should.  On the other side you have a case in which a man occupies a house and was regularly employed in the demesne, and he should purchase. The words &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; were words used in previous Acts of Parliament with regard to houses occupied by gamekeepers or gatekeepers, or people of that sort.  The words &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; express what is meant when we drafted this clause, and I would ask the Dáil to accept them.</P>

      <P>On this point the Minister has said that the words he now suggests are, as a matter of fact, taken out of existing Acts.  Perhaps they have not given rise to any difficulty, but perhaps they have never been questioned. It seems to me that the words &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; are very vague and wide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not get over the difficulty.  There would be cases where a man would be ordinarily employed on and in connection with a demesne who would not be entitled to purchase. <Col N="1965" /> I admit it is extremely hard to get a form of words which some cross-grained Commissioner or wrong-headed Judge could not misinterpret.  In my opinion these words will meet the equities of the case and will express what we want.  They are more in favour of the occupier than the owner of the demesne. There are cases where a man would be ordinarily employed on a demesne and occupy a holding, and would be entitled to purchase.  I could not quote them at the moment, but I know there are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add after Sub-section (3) the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Where the Land Commission declare that any land coming within Clause <i>(a)</i> of Sub-section (2) of this section is required for the purpose of relieving congestion the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  If the land so declared forms portion of the holding, the proprietor or tenant of the holding may within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner require that the entire holding be so declared, and the Land Commission shall in that event either so declare the entire holding or withdraw from the proposed acquisition of the said portion.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  If within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner the proprietor or tenant of the declared land so requires them to do, the Land Commission shall as soon as practicable provide the said proprietor or tenant with a new holding which in the opinion of the Land Commission other than the Judicial Commissioner (subject to the right of appeal to the Judicial Commissioner, whose decision shall be final) shall be equally suitable for the said proprietor or tenant and of not less value than the declared land. The provisions contained in this Act for transferring burdens and rights on the exchange of holdings by agreement shall extend to any exchange of lands effected under this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides for a vital omission in the Bill as it left the Dáil, <Col N="1966" /> and to my mind constitutes a real improvement in the Bill.  The meaning of the amendment is quite clear on the face of it.  The meaning of Sub-clause <i>(a)</i> is quite clear also.  It is intended to prevent the Land Commission from saying to a man with 150 acres of land, &ldquo;We are going to take 130 acres and leave you the house and 20 acres.&rdquo;  That would be manifestly unfair, and the effect of the amendment is to put the Land Commission in the position of taking either all the holding or none.  We must make up our minds to have it one way or the other, and take either all or none of the holding.  As regards Sub-clause <i>(b)</i> it should be noted that this section deals with purchased land.  There are 20 million acres of land in Ireland, and 13 millions of them are purchased&mdash;that is to say, purchased under previous Land Acts or subject to agreements under previous Land Acts.  That leaves 7 million acres of all kinds of land unpurchased. Of that there are at least 3 millions under water, waste, bog, and so forth&mdash; land that could not be called arable. That is to say, there are about 4 million acres of arable land left.  The position would be something like this.  It would be, perhaps, more correct to say that of the 17 million acres of arable land 13 millions are purchased.  It was pointed out to me that under the Bill as it stood we gave the Land Commission power to take any holding, big or small, comprised in these 13 million acres.  That is correct, and in accepting these amendments we will still have power to take any holding amongst these 13 million acres, though it has been already purchased under the Land Purchase Acts. It was pointed out that that was a very serious thing from the point of view of the value of land and also a serious thing from the point of view of security, particularly in view of the fact that in acquiring it we were not giving the market value.  It was strongly urged that the effect of such provisions would be to depreciate the value of the land&mdash; land comprised in any holding&mdash;I am not talking of demesne or untenanted land&mdash;and no doubt that was a case that had to be met.  The fact is that the last land we shall take will be purchased land, for the reasons I have mentioned, and we will only take it if there is no other suitable land available.  The next section deals with that.  But for the fact that <Col N="1967" /> I had the actual figures before me which show that it was absolutely necessary to take powers over purchased land if we were to make a real attempt to relieve congestion, I would not stand over vesting land acquired under previous Land Acts, but it was necessary to take that land, and we have to meet the case that was put up to us&mdash;the case in regard to the effect of such provisions on the value of land.  In the operations of the Bill we would not take more than 10 per cent. of purchased land, so that 90 per cent would be unaffected in fact.  As against that, the power is there to take 100 per cent. if you want to, but on the face of the Bill that would be absurd.  Who is to say whose holding is in the 10 per cent. and who is to say whose holding is amongst the 90 per cent?  When a man has purchased his holding and goes to the bank for an advance on the security, is he to be told that that is a taint on the holding?  The mere fact that we were not going to attach under any circumstances 90 per cent. of the land made it even more necessary to deal with the case, because it would be a shocking thing to taint the whole 100 per cent. because we had to deal with tenancies. There is the further fact that in 97 or 98 per cent, if the Land Commission were taking the purchased land, they would offer a slightly better holding to the man whose holding they were taking.  It is rough and ready justice to do it.</P>
    <P>They do it for a good many reasons, in the interests of equity and because it is cheaper in the long run.  They acquire untenanted land at the Land Commission price, at the resale price, and they give him a holding on it.</P>
    <P>They transfer his annuity from the holding they acquire on to the holding they give him, and all the other burdens as well.  They have really got that piece of purchased land at the resale price without doing anybody any harm, and they are in a position to resell it to tenants outside the demesne as if it were a piece of untenanted land.  That is the way the Bill would operate, and in view of the fact that the Bill would operate in that way in any event, and in view of the fact that it was a serious thing that the 13 million acres of Irish land should be tainted, I admitted to the men who made this point that it was due to ourselves and to the country that we should put even the possibility of it beyond <Col N="1968" /> doubt, and the way to do it was quite obvious.  We inserted in the Bill what we would do in 97 cases out of 100 in any event.  We said, &ldquo;We have to take a purchased holding.&rdquo;  Well, then, we shall give that man land equally suitable and not of less value.</P>
    <P>We will have no difficulty in doing that.  That puts it out of the bounds of possibility that, as a result of this Bill, there will be any depreciation in the value of land or any insecurity.  In fact, it achieves exactly the opposite purpose, and for this reason: Where we take this land we will only do it as a last resort, because there will be no untenanted land in the neighbourhood.  The owner owns 150 acres in the middle of congests.  As a result of having those all round him, he has been unable to put up his land for sale.  We will take him out of that position and give him an opportunity to sell. We will divide his lands amongst the congests for the first time, and so it will become valuable for the first time since he got it.  So far from depreciating the value of land, we are appreciating it, and so far from making for insecurity we are making for security.  It was suggested first, and I thought along these lines myself, that perhaps we might take this land at its market value.  We could not do that.  It would be no good for resale purposes.  But we really give the owner market value by giving him an equivalent holding without doing anybody any harm. It was suggested that we should draw some line&mdash;that we should not touch any land under £40 valuation.  I refuse to accept that, because we might have a case, say in Galway, Erris, Monaghan, or Cavan where the only land suitable would be a £40 or £50 holding.  We might be cutting out the cases that we want.  It is obvious enough that only big holdings are of any use, and only a very small percentage of the big holdings will be touched.  There will be even smaller holdings than of £40 or £50 value, which may be wanted in a few cases.  If we are really serious in an attempt to relieve congestion we have to take all those circumstances into account. It is absolutely necessary not to depreciate the value of land, and that is no more nor no less than what we should be doing in 97 cases out of 100.  These amendments were suggested by Senator Jameson, a man whose criticism was extremely candid and helpful.  They were <Col N="1969" /> in furtherance of a case which had to be met, and I recommend this amendment and the next to the Dáil as amendments which definitely improve the Bill in vital aspects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 5: To add after the Sub-section (3) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission shall not without the consent of the owner acquire land from him under the powers conferred on them by Sub-section (3) of this section so long as there is other unacquired land in the same locality suitable for relieving congestion which does not come within the exceptions mentioned in Sub-section (2) of this section and which the Land Commission can acquire without exercising the special powers given by the said sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with demesne land and purchased land, and we are not going to take them while there is other suitable land in the neighbourhood.  A man has a demesne and land outside his demesne.  We take land outside his demesne or some other man's land before we touch demesne land.  That is only fair.  It was put to me by Sir Nugent Everard, another man whose services to land purchase did not begin with this Bill, but began in 1903.  It was said to me, as he put it, that we took power to take demesne land &ldquo;up to the knocker.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Yes, we can.&rdquo;  I was asked could we not draw some valuation line so as to provide, for example, that when a valuation is under £200 we would not touch it.  I pointed out the same objection.  There might be a very small demesne in which a man lived, and which he worked as an ordinary farm.  There might be just one congest or two congests in that neighbourhood, and there might be no other land to deal with them.  It might be impossible to migrate them, and five or six acres might make the holdings economic. We had to have the power to take those. Therefore, we could not draw any valuation line.  On the other hand, we could not promise to give equivalent land elsewhere. The least we could do was to promise that where there was suitable <Col N="1970" /> land outside the demesne we would not touch the demesne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is as easily defended as the last, because it is liable to defeat its object by being so loosely phrased.  It will mean, I think, a good deal of controversy as to what is the same locality, what is suitable, and there is nothing in the sub-section as to who is to decide the suitability or whether the same barony or townland or county is the same locality. As it stands, the Land Commission shall not, without the consent of the owner, &ldquo;acquire land from him under the powers conferred on them by Sub-section (3) of this section so long as there is unacquired land in the same locality suitable for relieving congestion.&rdquo; If it is bad land within hailing distance, or perhaps aeroplane distance, the land cannot be taken for relieving congestion, and presumably, as the new sub-section is drafted, the owner will decide whether it is suitable.  It seems to me that to achieve the end, as the Minister himself has explained, something more is required, and some authority should be defined as the authority which will decide whether the land in question is within the same locality and whether the land is suitable.  I ask the Minister to clarify that doubt.</P>

      <P>The authority is the Land Commission, and there is a final appeal to the Judicial Commissioner in all cases.  Only on a question of law arising under this section, the only appeal on the whole Bill, the last word, is the Land Commission or the Judicial Commissioner.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. First I want to state the position.  In one case, and in one case only, is there <Col N="1971" /> any appeal from the Judicial Commissioner, and that is on a question of law arising under one section, Section 24. The question of suitability and the question of locality are questions of fact.  I was pressed very, very hard indeed to give an appeal on the question of price, and I pointed out that it was absolutely impossible to let any Court, except the Judicial Commissioner, say whether land should be worth £5,500 or £5,525. But we ought not to argue about certain matters, and there are certain things clear in the Bill.  One is that the last word on every question is the Judicial Commissioner, except on a question of law arising under Section 24.  The question of whether, in fact, land is suitable and, in fact, is in the same locality is a question for the Judicial Commissioner.  Deputy Johnson wants more definition and more precision.  We are giving wide powers, I have admitted that, very wide powers indeed, to the Land Commission, and it has been my aim the whole time to define the powers of the Land Commission as far as possible.  But when you do give very wide powers to the Land Commission it is extremely difficult, in one direction or another, to define them without finding that you are cutting down their powers, and without finding that, though you are perhaps effecting our purpose as far as one particular section is concerned, you are defeating our purpose as far as another section is concerned.  It would be impossible to make that section more precise; there is no question of doubt about it.  &ldquo;In the same locality&rdquo; is as precise as we can make it.  &ldquo;Suitable&rdquo;&mdash;I have cast about for a form of words and for a formula that would make that section more precise, and at the same time give the same wide and extended powers, and I could not do it.  This will give big powers to the Land Commission.  The Judicial Commissioner, who is running this in the future, has a great chance, and will be able to effect a complete metamorphosis in certain parts of the country, and we must assume that the man who is the Judicial Commissioner will be a very able man, a man who will know his work, and who will be able to interpret the Act in the spirit and letter. I do not think that there can be any question for a judge as to what is the meaning of &ldquo;in the same locality&rdquo;<Col N="1972" /> once he has the facts of the case before him, or as to what &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; is, or whether we could not get closer to it. Personally, I am satisfied with that suggestion as it stands, which was the suggestion of the Senator himself, and I would have been prepared to accept something, I think, on that which would not have given the Land Commissioners as wide powers as &ldquo;in the same locality,&rdquo; but it was the suggestion of a Senator, a Senator who has been extremely candid and helpful on the Bill the whole time.  I am perfectly satisfied that that leaves the Land Commission with all the powers they require, and, as far as you could do it, effects the purpose which it is intended to effect.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agrees with the Seanad in this amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add after Sub-section (4) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall render it obligatory for the Land Commission to acquire untenanted land which is intermingled with woodland, or the acquisition of which would, in the opinion of the Land Commission, be detrimental to the preservation of woodland and to the interests of forestry, and where any lands vested in the Land Commission under this Act are wholly or practically surrounded by lands under timber, or intermixed with woods, the property of the owner of the lands so vested, it shall be optional to the owner to require the Land Commission to purchase such timber, lands or woods.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first four or five lines really mean little.  They only mean that the Land Commission shall have the option as to whether they should purchase lands which are intermingled with forestry. <Col N="1973" /> They have that already.  The second part of it means that in the event of their buying 100 or 200 acres of land, which is under the same tenure as 500 acres of woods, that they are not to take the 100 or 200 acres of land and leave the 500 acres of woods on the owner, but that they should take all.  I do not think the Land Commission should be allowed to take 100 acres of good arable land and to leave the owner 200 or 300 acres of land where there is a demesne of any use, but that they should be forced to take the whole of it and vest the woods in the Forestry Department.</P>

      <P>The point is this.  We provide for the Land Commission, when considering whether they can make an advance to a tenant purchaser, that they should take into account any advances that he has previously received, and our idea was that they should take into account any previous advances under any previous Acts, whether they had been redeemed or not.  If a man who has got  advance, let us say, on 100 acres, under a previous Act, and redeemed that, and now owns his land absolutely in  the fact that he got an advance should not be taken into account&mdash;the fact that he redeemed his advance and paid it off should not be taken into account.  I think it is fair, in all the circumstances, but the real point is that it makes no difference, because the Land Commission's <Col N="1974" /> power to retain the holding is absolute. They may retain the holding because it is £3,000 or over, and they may retain the holding under the next section: &ldquo;Any holding as respects which the Land Commission declare that it is not in the public interest that the holding shall be resold to the tenant as aforesaid whether on the ground that the improvement of the holding is essential and practicable or otherwise.&rdquo;  So that really it is as broad as it is long; but if we are interested in having the equities of the case stated clearly on the face of the Bill I think this would be better done by the amendment than by the Bill as it originally stood; but it makes no difference.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is a proposed new section before Section 35. It reads: &ldquo;To insert before Section 35 a new section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Land Commission have acquired any land from an owner under this Act, they may purchase from him any demesne or other land in his occupation adjacent thereto at a price which in their opinion represents the selling value thereof, and in such case may resell the whole or any portion of that land to him, as if he were a person to whom advances might be made for the purchase of a parcel of land under this Act.  The provisions of Sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 3 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, shall apply to any resale under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to say, the Land Commission may, if they like, do what they used to do under the Act of 1903&mdash;buy a man's demesne and resell it to him.  This, of course, does not interfere with our powers <Col N="1976" /> to take any demesne land we like for the relief of congestion, but this has in mind demesnes which we do not intend to touch, and which would be left to the owner.  We would be taking a man's untenanted land at a certain price; this untenanted land may be heavily encumbered. We are taking his tenanted land at a certain price, and we are also taking his untenanted land at a certain price. In certain circumstances it may be that the man will come out of the whole deal very badly, and it was put to me that in these circumstances we should at least have some sort of relief clause similar to what was in the Act of 1903, and that there is far more reason for it now, in such a case where a man is heavily encumbered and is coming badly out of the whole deal.  We could say, &ldquo;We will do you a good turn; we will buy up your demesne at our own price, we will resell it at our own price, and then advance the money for the re-purchase.&rdquo; The net result is that we give him a certain amount of money at 4½ per cent., and it is completely at the option of the Land Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be impossible to explain Amendment 21 without explaining also Amendment 22.  They hang together. We thought it well to take over all the Land Bank Societies, good, bad and indifferent, and to give them all a chance. Far the greater number of them are in a flourishing condition, but there are a <Col N="1979" /> certain number of them which are not. Our aim was to take them all and give them all a chance of getting on their feet, having regard to the fact that they are getting more money now at 4½ per cent., and that we were paying one-tenth of it, and so on.  There might be one or two Societies which were absolutely impossible, and it is well that the Land Commission should have a certain control of the deposit.  I think the Dáil understands what the deposit is.  The deposit is a deposit of one-third of the purchase money, which must be lodged with the Land Bank by the Societies before they make an advance.  We thought it right in the event of any holding being absolutely no security or of any Society being no security whatever for the advance we were going to give them &mdash;in cases, for instance, where they bought the land far too dear&mdash;we could use that deposit for the purpose of redeeming some of the advance, so that the land would be security for the amount of advance which we would charge on it.  We give the Land Commission the advance.  The Land Commission is our agent in this matter.  If they did come across a case where the lands are not security by any means for the amount of the advance they would have to make, then they are using public money, and it would be against public policy to make the advance.  We give a way out by giving a discretion to use portion of the deposit to pay off some of the money, and make an advance for the balance.  That is, I think, in all the circumstances, fair, especially in view of the fact that they must be taken over and that the Land Commission must make the advance.</P>

    <P>The powers for the apportionment of an annuity or the discharge of portion of a holding from liability in respect of an annuity conferred on the Land Commission by Sub-section (3) of Section 38 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, as extended by Sub-section (1) of Section 67 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, may be exercised by the Commissioners of Public Works as regards an <Col N="1981" /> annuity charged on a holding in repayment of an advance made by the said Commissioners for the purpose of the purchase thereof pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870.</P>
    <P>The Land Act of 1870 gave the Board of Works power to advance for the purchase of land, so that the Board of Works was the first body in the country to deal in land purchase, not the Land Commission. A number of advances for the purchase of land were made in the same way as the Land Commission is making advances now, and while they had power under the Act to agree to the sub-division of the holding, they had no power to agree to the sub-division of the advances. It was probably a drafting mistake in the Act.  The result was that their power to agree to the sub-division of a holding was no good, because they had no legal power to apportion the advance. We are giving them power to apportion the advance, which, in addition to the powers they have already got of sub-dividing, will put them in the same position as the Land Commission in regard to the holdings that have been purchased by advances from them.</P>

      <P>This should be inserted in its proper place between the third and fourth items.  It is the last of 3 Ed. VII.  Under this section, which we are now repealing, the local Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages had to notify the Land Commission of the death of any owner of a purchased holding. The Land Commission a great many years ago used to notify the local Registrar of Titles on getting notification from the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. Some years ago the local Registrar of Titles notified the Land Commission that they did not require such notification, and the Land Commission since that time have ceased to give such notification to the Registrar of Titles.  Nevertheless the local Registrar sends up the information, because he gets 2s. 7d. for each entry.  There was no necessity to continue that, and the repeal of this section will save us £70 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion which appears on the Paper in the name of the Minister for Agriculture should have been tabled in my name.  The Minister has drawn my attention to it.  The motion is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Resolved that this House hereby declares that the Bill passed by this House and entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the law relating to the occupation and ownership of land and for other purposes relating thereto&rdquo; and whereof the short title is &ldquo;The Land Bill, 1923,&rdquo; is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say, Sir, that during the last two or three years a good deal of dislocation of the ordinary administration has been attributable to the land agitation. Questions involving land matters that have been troublesome for the last 12 or 18 months have been intensified to an extraordinary extent by the fact that very great unrest has been evidenced in a great many parts of the country by reason of so many grievances existing, which it is hoped and believed this Land Bill will rectify.  Although it can scarcely be said to be an agreed measure, this is a Bill on which the maximum amount of agreement has been brought to bear by all the parties to it. It may be that some people may have thought they could have got better terms and that other people thought they could have got a better price.  But I think the general consensus of opinion in the Oireachtas and in the country is that the measure is one that will go far towards making for much more peaceful conditions and much more ordered conditions and for greater security and greater stability <Col N="1984" /> than perhaps any other measure we have had under consideration here. We consider that the public peace is ensured by the passing of this Bill. There is a danger, through the operation of Article 47 of the Constitution, that it might be claimed that the Bill could not pass for seven days.  I am myself strongly of opinion, and that opinion is reinforced by every member of the Ministry, that the immediate passing into law of this measure is a matter of urgent necessity for the maintenance of peace. The Dáil is, I think, aware that we have had to employ very large numbers of troops in the execution of decrees.  Certain writs have been issued for the recovery of rents, which in themselves constitute an invasion of the terms of this instrument that has been considered so exhaustively by the Dáil, and which has also been passed by the Seanad. Under the law as it stands we are bound to execute decrees which have been issued for rent, and I understand that writs are being issued at present.  The Minister for Agriculture has just handed me a telegram which he has had from one part of the country dealing with this very matter.  He only received it a moment ago.  These things do not make for public peace, and the Government is always in the position of being attacked by both sides&mdash;on one side for its weakness and on the other side for its strength.  We believe that the maintenance of public peace in this country at the moment will make more for stability than any amount of strength or weakness that can be shown.  We believe it ought not to be necessary to employ in the ordinary administration of the business of the country unusual numbers of troops.  We should get away from that and get back to normal conditions. There should be respect for decisions in the Courts of Justice properly constituted and administering the law according to justice.  We do not anticipate any grave troubles arising out of the land question once this aspect of it has been settled.  There will be naturally questions of detail, which will give rise to strong feelings and strong expressions of opinion, and perhaps a certain dislocation of public services now and then. But at least one very marked advance has been made by this measure.  I and every member of the Ministry attribute its greatest success to the measure of accommodation <Col N="1985" /> which was afforded by all sections of the community in coming to agreement upon a measure of this sort. For that purpose we consider that it is necessary, in the interests of the immediate preservation of the public peace, that this resolution should be passed, which will enable us to record this Act on our Statute Book and make it the law of the land.  Accordingly I move the resolution which I have just read.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the President in most of what he has said in bringing this resolution before the Dáil.  I am bound to confess, however, that I have had a little difficulty in discovering exactly what relation much of it had to the resolution before the Dáil. I referred to this matter of Article 47 on the Army Bill.  This is the third resolution of this kind which we have had brought before us.  I think it is a matter of agreement that the particular article of the Constitution that it is intended to render nugatory was intended to be of effect with the greater part of legislation, and should only be set aside for some special matter of very peculiar urgency.  The provisions of Article 47 state that the stay of one week shall not apply to Money Bills or such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety. These words were drafted after consultation with certain people, and are an exact replica of the procedure adopted in Switzerland, where similar provisions have effect.  For instance, on one occasion it happened that an epidemic occurred there and legislation had to be passed. It was not possible to wait a week for legislation to come into effect, and it was given effect by some such provision as this.  But where is the necessity or the urgency for this particular Bill?  I have supported the Bill.  I think it is a good Bill and a just Bill.  It has been before the Dáil for some weeks, and before the Seanad for a good length of time.  Several weeks have been occupied with its passage.  What evil would follow if one more week were to elapse before this Bill became of legal effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see where the urgency of the matter is.  The Bill is a good one and would normally become law.  There is <Col N="1986" /> no intention I imagine, either from the Dáil or the Seanad to get some resolution under Article 47 in order that a referendum might be put into operation.  That has not been suggested.  If this resolution were not passed the Bill would, at the end of the week, become good law, and in the intervening period of time not one single discomfort would have arisen because it had been held up by an article of the Constitution.  I am perfectly certain it is not the intention in the Constitution that the latter part of that article should be applied to a Bill of this kind, and I do think that it is not a fair use of the Constitution to ask the Dáil to pass a resolution of this kind.  Let the Bill take its ordinary course.  I said before that I think a resolution of this kind ought to be used very sparingly indeed, and only be used when the words of the Constitution strictly can be enforced, and when the particular Bill in respect of which the resolution was asked is quite clearly necessary, not only for the preservation of peace, public safety and good health, but for the immediate preservation of these desirable things.  I do not think that it can be argued that the Land Bill is necessary in that immediate sense.  After another week would have passed the position would be exactly the same as to-day, and no evil would have happened.  If there are special reasons why it is necessary this Bill should become of effect to-morrow, instead of to-morrow week&mdash;and there may be reasons&mdash;those reasons have not been given by the President.</P>

      <P>When this motion was handed round I thought, just as Deputy Figgis thought, that it was a far-stretching of the provisions of the constitution&mdash;Article 47&mdash;and I began to wonder what can be the intention.  I wondered whether the Minister for Agriculture had been frightened by that section of the Farmers' Union led by Senator Sir John Keane, and that he feared there might be a rally of one-twentieth of the voters now on the register, or on the register within seven days, who will ask for the general hold-up of this measure for 90 days so that a referendum might be taken.  I knew that it was not likely that two-fifths of the members of the Dáil or a majority of the Seanad would present a petition asking for the holding-up, and I could <Col N="1987" /> only think of the possibility of this fiery cross led by Senator Sir John Keane and the other members of the Farmers' Union against the Bill.  But in going through the Bill for the purpose of finding out what the amendments from the Seanad meant, I came across Section 19, and I noticed what the President has pointed out, or hinted at, that proceedings may have been taken but may not be continued or enforced after the passing of this Bill.  By passing the resolution we may save 20 or 30 or 40 farmers who owe arrears, and against whom judgments had been given from having these judgments enforced.  Consequently, I am prepared to agree for the immediate preservation of the public peace in those holdings that it is well that this resolution should be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Figgis that it was never intended, when the Constitution was being initiated, that a Land Bill should be a matter of public safety.  But Deputy Figgis lives in the city and he does not know the state of the country.  He does not know that at the present time writs are being executed, and that military and police are seizing the cattle of the farmers. I tell him now that unless this resolution is passed you are going to have an immediate breach of the peace in several counties.  While I agree with a good deal of what has been said, that only shows you that the people in the city who profess to understand the country are only talking nonsense here, because they do not understand the point at all.  The President is doing the right thing.  There are a lot of landlords trying to get the money before this Bill becomes law, and I agree that it is doing the right thing to put the Bill into operation at once in order to stop these lawyers and bailiffs and other people.  This only shows what the city people in this Dáil know of the realities of the situation.  I am pleased to see that the President is alive to the responsibilities of his position, and that he does recognise that he represents the country and not a town.</P>

    <P>I wish to support the motion brought <Col N="1988" /> forward by the President.  I think it would be a great mistake to wait one day in giving the tenants of Ireland the benefits of this measure.  The Government had to take strong action some time ago against parties who had seized lands and unfortunately some of these people are at present in prison.  The sooner these people are released the better for the peace of the country, because they will be able to avail of the benefits of this measure.  Those people now have the law on their side and there is no necessity for them to seize what the law will give them.  It is a very important thing that the tenants of Ireland should get the benefits of this measure with the least possible delay.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the real meaning of the President's motion or the reasons that inspired it.  The telegram that has been handed to the Minister for Agriculture with reference to seizures made yesterday in Wexford on the Alcock Estate was handed to him after it reached us.  I do not know what the real meaning of this resolution is, but I accept it as a means of preserving the public peace.  The wonder is how the people of the country have preserved the peace so far.  The wonder is that these people in Wexford and elsewhere who have been looking for this trouble have not met the trouble they wanted. I am very sorry that they did not meet the trouble they were looking for. With regard to the remarks of Deputy Johnson in reference to the Farmers Union and Senator Sir John Keane. Senator Sir John Keane is as much responsible for the Farmers' Union as Jim Larkin is.</P>

      <P>When I speak for the Farmers' Union or the Unpurchased Tenants you may accept what I say with some degree of responsibility.  When Senator Sir John Keane speaks he speaks as Sir John Keane.  He is entitled, of course, to express his opinion as a member of the Farmers' Union, but he is speaking in the capacity of Senator Sir John Keane, and no-one else. He is less responsible for the Farmers' Union than Jim Larkin is for Deputy Johnson's policy, or for those who worked with hatpins outside the Mansion House.</P>

He is only a member of the Farmers' Union, and it is very doubtful, after his recent conduct, if he will even remain a member.  I will not speak any further about our private affairs as Senator Sir John Keane and ourselves will be able to settle these matters.  I believe this resolution may help to keep the public peace.  I do not think the resolution is of any great necessity, but if the Government thinks so, we have no objection to the Bill being put through. There may be some other reason besides the public peace behind it.</P>

      <P>I always credited Deputy Figgis with more than the usual amount of common sense.  I am rather glad the members of the Farmers' Party were in a position to give him some enlightenment on this Bill.  I thought it was common knowledge that there is considerable disturbance, annoyance, and a feeling of uncertainty throughout the country, by reason of these writs for arrears of rent.  If Deputy Figgis did not hear of that, I regret it, as he is a very far-seeing man, but perhaps it was beneath his notice.  These are things that disturb us very much.  We have got to carry out the law fairly as between all the parties.</P>

      <P>I have not got it. The telegram was not sent to me.  It was one of those things that go to show that my judgment is of a rather good quality, and, consequently, it is not uninteresting to me.  I thank the members of the Dáil for the way the resolution was received.  It was received in good faith.  The Dáil realises with us the <Col N="1990" /> vital need of disposing of the uncertainty that always surrounds a measure of this sort until the fateful day when it becomes law.  We believe it is absolutely essential that it should become law immediately, and for that purpose we put down the resolution.  It is not evading the principles or the Articles of the Constitution, but it implements them.  It is not outside the Constitution; it is complying with it.  We would certainly fail in our duty if we allowed that feeling of uncertainty and unrest, with possible disturbances, to arise in the coming week, in the event of certain people taking advantage of the fact that this Bill was not law for seven days. It would be impossible for us, or anyone else, to repair the damage, once it had been done.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember that in accordance with the resolution of the Dáil passed on Friday, June 27th, a Committee on accommodation, was asked to consider the question of temporary accommodation and to report to the Dáil, by last Friday.  Unfortunately, notice of the report was omitted from the Order Paper on last Friday; it is on the Order Paper to-day.  The Committee had one meeting.  The Seanad met in the morning and the Dáil in the afternoon of that week, so it would be very difficult to transact any business in the Committee, and the Committee unanimously decided that it was impossible for them to bring in a Report by Friday, August 3rd, and the Report is, accordingly, presented now.</P>

      <P>I think I should mention to the Dáil that my attention has been drawn to the fact that one Dublin morning newspaper credited me with the statement that I believed there was a strong case throughout the whole country for getting the Bank of Ireland premises.  I would like to say it was certainly never my intention to make that statement.  I have not had an opportunity of looking up what I did say, but I am sure I never said that, and if I misled that Journal I would like now to correct the impression.  What I meant to convey was, that there was a certain rather strong case for the Bank by some people, and if I did not add, at that time, that it did not impress me, I would like to add it now.  My contention was that we should have premises provided at the least possible cost, of the most commodious kind, and with the least <Col N="1994" /> possible delay, and the Bank of Ireland, I think, does not lend itself to either one or other of these conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That introduces some complexity in the <Col N="1995" /> wording of this motion, in view of the action that is now being taken.  The last paragraph says that a message be sent to Seanad Eireann to advise the Seanad of the passing of these Resolutions, and to request that the Seanad may be pleased to consent to the conclusion of its present Session accordingly.  Obviously in that case the Seanad must sit after the Dáil. If the position here be transposed I do not see how the procedure adopted in that motion can be put into effect.</P>

      <P>Before passing from this can the Minister give us an assurance now, or by to-morrow, at any rate, before this Resolution is proposed suggesting a Dissolution, that the promise with regard to the publication of the Register on this date, the 8th August, will have been fulfilled.  I think it would be very unwise for us to agree to a Resolution urging the Dissolution until we have the Register available, because after we have dissolved we will have no control whatever over the publication of the Register.  I would urge that it is much more in keeping with the intention of Legislative Assemblies that at the end of a Dissolution there should be in being, at least, the means of electing a successor, and in the absence of a Register there are no such means.  We were promised that the Register would be ready for publication on this the 8th day of August, but I am informed that it is not available to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am instructed that the Register will be available on Friday, at latest.  Practically the whole of it is printed, but in some districts it will not be available until Friday, and the publication of a complete Register has been delayed until Friday so that it may be available for everyone at the one time, and so that there will be no danger of anyone getting an advantage out of the fact that part of it might be ready before the whole was complete.  It has not been given out to anyone yet.  As a matter of fact, I have not seen it myself, but I think it is only fair that it should be available for all persons on the one date and at the one time.  I now beg to move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Go gcríochnóidh an Siosón so den Oireachtas agus de gach Tigh de le linn deire suidheanna an dá Thigh ar an 9adh <Col N="1996" /> lá so de Lúnasa, 1923; ar choiníoll ná críochnófar Siosón Sheanaid Eireann gan a thoil féin.</P>
    <P>(2)  Go socruítear dáta ath-thionóil an Oireachtais agus gurb é dáta é sin ná Dé Céadaoin an 19adh lá de Mheadhon Fhoghmhair, 1923.</P>
    <P>(3)  Go gcuirtear teachtaireacht chun Seanaid Eireann a chur in úil don Seanad gur ritheadh na rúin seo agus á iarraidh ar an Seanad toiliú leis an Siosón so aige do chríochnú dá réir sin.</P>
    <P>(1)  That the present Session of the Oireachtas and of each House thereof do conclude at the termination of the Sittings of the two Houses on this the 9th day of August, 1923.  Provided that the Session of Seanad Eireann shall not be concluded without its own consent.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the date of re-assembly of the Oireachtas be fixed, and that the same shall be Wednesday, the 19th day of September, 1923.</P>
    <P>(3)  That a message be sent to Seanad Eireann to advise the Seanad of the passing of these resolutions, and to request that the Seanad may be pleased to consent to the conclusion of its present Session accordingly.</P>
    <P>The only change made in this Resolution as originally drafted was to change the date of the termination of the sittings of the two Houses from the 8th August to the 9th of August.  It will be necessary to send some kind of intimation to the Seanad, which meets at 12 o'clock to-morrow.  The original intention was that the Dáil should meet at 11 o'clock to-morrow, but I see now, in consequence of this Damage to Property Act, that there will be some difficulty about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not suit the requirements of the Minister if we said in the resolution &ldquo;the present session to conclude the termination of its sittings on the 9th or the 10th of August, as the case may be, instead of saying on this the 8th.&rdquo;  I still press my point that we ought not to dissolve until, as a matter of fact, the Registers are published.  If it is possible to meet again on Friday, and that the announcement is then made that the Register is available, that will suffice.  I think the Dáil should remain <Col N="1997" /> in being until the Register is actually available for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that when the League of Nations Bill was passed it was decided to make arrangements for attendance at the Conference which I understand will he held in Geneva on or about the 10th, September.  I understand that the meeting of the Conference on that date will be an important one.  Allowing for attendance at it on that date, and for the return journey, my opinion is that the delegates could not be back before the 15th September.  That would only leave four days to make the necessary preparations for the re-assembly of the Dáil.  I therefore do not think we could meet before the 19th September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the result of the election might have had something to say to attendance at that Conference.  It would be much more satisfactory, I suggest, for whoever is going to that Conference as the head of the Executive to be able to say that in so going he had the confidence of the Dáil.  If the meeting of the Conference is postponed until after that date the position of the responsible Minister might be a very different one.  It might be <Col N="1998" /> much more satisfactory for him to know that in going to that Conference in Geneva he already had secured the confidence of the newly-elected Parliament.</P>
