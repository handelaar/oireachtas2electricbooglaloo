      <P>asked the President if he has noticed the statement made by the Premier of Northern Ireland in the presence of an English Cabinet Minister, that &ldquo;the great question of the Border is practically thrown altogether into the back-ground, and will probably never rise again?&rdquo;  And if he is in a position to assure this Dáil that this repudiation of an important provision of the Treaty does not express the attitude of either of the co-equal contracting parties to that instrument&mdash;namely, Saorstát Eireann and Great Britain?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has asked me to answer this question as follows:&mdash;The Act, in so far as it affects roads, bridges and ferries, and vehicles and traffic thereon, has, since the 4th October last, been administered by the Ministry of Local Government. Under the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, the Roads Committee was one for Great Britain and Ireland, and a Sub-Committee thereof was appointed for Ireland. When under the Treaty the Road Committee ceased to have functions in Ireland the Irish Sub-Committee dissolved. The question of appointing a new Committee for the Saorstát is being considered.</P>

Further, if it is a fact that for forthcoming examinations for such appointments the standard has been greatly lowered by the omission of several subjects essential to the efficiency of a County Surveyor from the practical examination, such as railway and canal engineering, marine engineering, hydraulic engineering, and drainage and river works; and whether such a lowering of standards tends to the efficiency of public services?</P>

I raise the question in the Dáil because I do not think it is a matter that ought to be brought forward on a motion, but I would like to know whether it is possible to ask questions on many legal and constitutional matters that crop up, either in writing or verbally.  If not, would the Chairman bring it before the Procedure Committee, because obviously it is most unsatisfactory that Ministers who are not Law Advisers should be called on to answer legal and constitutional questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking leave to introduce this Bill, I am sure it will be within the recollection of Deputies that the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced a Bill in February last providing for the continuance of charges in statutory undertakings.  The Bill was to be effective to the 31st December next. There was little notice of it, as it was rather urgent that it should be passed at the time.  Some Deputies felt, in view of that urgency and the short time that the Dáil had to consider it, that it should only be made operative to the 31st May next, with a view to the introduction of a further Bill before the expiration of that period.  I move now for permission to have printed and circulated a Bill &ldquo;to authorise certain statutory undertakings in Saorstát Eireann to continue tempo rarily after the expiration of the Statutory Undertakings (Continuance of Charges) Act, 1923, certain increases in the statutory charges made by such undertakings, and for other purposes connected therewith.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With regard to the Financial motions to be moved in Committee as this is the first occasion upon which a Budget statement has been made, I might for the benefit of Deputies outline the procedure.  The Minister for Finance before moving the first resolution, which relates to a particular tax, will make a general statement upon the financial position.</P>
      <P>The debate which follows that statement can cover the whole field of taxation and expenditure.  When the first resolution has been disposed of the other taxation resolutions will come before the Committee.  The discussion on these resolutions, if there is any discussion, will be subject to the ordinary rules of relevancy.</P>
      <P>When the resolutions have been passed in Committee they must be reported to the Dáil within ten days.  On the report to the Dáil, on each resolution points may be raised and amendments may be proposed. Finally, within 20 days from the Agreement to the resolutions in the Dáil it will be necessary to have a Second Reading of the Finance Bill embodying these resolutions.  That Bill will have to go through the ordinary stages in accordance with the Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I made a brief statement on the financial situation in connection with the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for 1923-24, which had then been laid before the Dáil.  Deputies will, no doubt, welcome a somewhat fuller statement on this occasion in explanation of the circumstances in which I have to propose the taxing resolutions which will presently come under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my last statement the financial year 1922-23 has terminated, and it is now possible to consider the position with definite knowledge of the transactions of <Col N="72" /> the Exchequer for the year ended on the 31st March.  As Deputies are aware the Ministry of Finance publish regularly every Tuesday in the &ldquo;Irish Oifigiuil&rdquo; a statement of Exchequer transactions up to the close of business on the previous Saturday, and the issue of the 3rd of April contains the statement for the full year up to Saturday, 31st March.  I propose to summarise the salient points of that statement so that Deputies may understand clearly what is the position from which we start on the 1st April of this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">RESULTS OF YEAR 1922-23.</P>
    <P>The Revenue received into the Exchequer in the year just ended amounted to the total of £27,863,000.  On the other hand issues which had to be made out of the Exchequer to maintain the public services amounted to the total of £30,197,000.  The difference between these two amounts, that is £2,334,000, had to be found by borrowing.  The total amount borrowed up to the close of business on 31st March last was greater than this figure by £197,112 which is the amount of the Exchequer balance carried forward into the new year.  The position, therefore, is that we have ended the year 1922-23 with a debt of £2,531,000, and with an Exchequer balance of £197,112 in hand.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in relation to these figures on which I desire to make some comment.  I have quoted the figure of £27,863,030 for the year's Revenue. It is, I think, well understood by this time that the revenue paid in the first instance into our Exchequer during 1922-23 is not true revenue of Saorstát Eireann.  We have in fact collected here certain taxes which really belong to Great Britain, and, on the other hand, the British Government have collected in their area some taxes which really belong to us.  The full adjustments between the two Governments which are necessary on this account have not yet been effected, and consequently our revenue figures must be regarded as subject to considerable modification.</P>
    <P>Some adjustment has indeed been effected.  At the end of March we received from the British Government a payment of £1,250,000 in respect of Inland Revenue collected by them and belonging to us.  This payment is included in the total revenue receipt I have mentioned. <Col N="73" /> At the same time we paid them an equivalent amount in respect of Customs and Excise collected by us, but belonging to them.  This item is included in our expenditure as a Central Fund service.</P>
    <P>The adjustment still remaining to be made threatens to be very substantial in amount, and, unfortunately, altogether against us.  According to the British claim, which, however, is still subject to investigation, the adjustment remaining to be made involves a payment from the Exchequer of Saorstát Eireann to that of Great Britain of an amount approximating to one and three quarter millions. This amount, subject to verification, must be regarded as a liability of the current financial year, and has been so treated in the Estimate of Receipts and Expenditure circulated before the adjournment.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the account it is right to mention that issues out of the Exchequer must not be regarded as a final or exact indication of actual expenditure of the year.  For practical purposes they give a reasonably close approximation to actual expenditure, but, in fact, they represent only issues to various departmental accounts and not disbursements to ultimate payees.  The real expenditure will, of course, not be available until detailed accounts have been prepared and audited.</P>
    <P>Before passing from the year 1922-23, I ought, perhaps, to mention how the actual results compare with the forecast which I made in my statement of the 6th October last in this Dáil.  I then hoped that our total real revenue for the year would be about £27,000,000.  In fact, according to the figures which I have now given, it proves to have been only £25,000,000.  The main reason for the unfavourable result is that at the time of my former statement revenue forecasts had necessarily to be made to a considerable extent by reference to the basis of computation adopted in the old White Papers of the British Treasury.  Improved machinery set up during the last financial year has, during the interval, provided new information and, as matters stand, this information goes to show that the White Paper arrangement tended to overstate the revenue of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>As regards expenditure of 1922-23, the chief point requiring notice is that the expenditure on Supply Services has been substantially short of the total amount of the Estimates laid before the Dáil.  In <Col N="74" /> the Estimate of Receipts and Expenditure recently circulated it is shown that of the total amount of £38,744,000 granted by the Dáil savings were anticipated amounting to £10,500,000 showing a probable net total expenditure on Supply Services of £28,244,000.  The actual Exchequer issues showed a further reduction of one million and a quarter, and amounted to the aggregate sum of £27,000,000.  This large difference between Estimates and results is due very largely&mdash;namely to the extent of £9,000,000&mdash;to compensation awards not having matured for payment as early as had been hoped when the original Estimates were prepared.</P>
    <P Just="Center">YEAR 1923-24.</P>
    <P>I pass now to the Financial Year 1923-24, which commenced on the 1st of this month, and propose to refer first to the expenditure, then to the extent to which it is contemplated that it can be met from revenue, and finally to the arrangements necessary for the finding of that revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPENDITURE 1923-24.</P>
    <P>The Estimate already circulated gives particulars of the estimated expenditure. For the purpose immediately before the Dáil I do not suppose that any elaborate survey of those particulars is necessary. An opportunity for considering the several Estimates in detail will arise very shortly when Votes for the various Services are being taken in the Committee on Finance.</P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure falls under three main heads&mdash;namely:&mdash;</P>

    </table>
    <P>The Central Fund Services consisted chiefly of the four main items, Local Taxation Grants, Payments to the Road Fund, Service of Debt, and the payment of a million and three quarters to the British Government for the revenue adjustment which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Capital Issues, which are small in comparison with the other figures, consist of sums required for Telephone Capital and for advances to the Unemployment Fund to enable it to meet its liabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The main expenditure is for Supply Services, and amounts, as I have said, to the estimated net total of about fortytwo and a quarter millions.  Of this total the Army requires £10,664,500, and Compensation charges require £10,985,550, these two together representing half of the entire expenditure on Supply Services.</P>
    <P>As regards the estimated expenditure on Supply Services, Deputies will understand that the preparation of such Estimates is a very laborious work which in all countries has to be initiated at a date a good deal earlier than the commencement of the year to which they relate. Besides this common difficulty, a further difficulty has inevitably hampered the Government of Saorstát Eireann in this work during the past year through the continuous process of change in administrative arrangements which has been a necessary consequence of the introduction of a new system of Government.  One result of these conditions is that the Estimates, as submitted, will not represent the final conclusions of the Executive Council on matters of detail to the same extent as would be possible if administration were being conducted on a settled basis.  It is in fact hoped in a number of cases to effect economies in the net amount of the Estimates as already published, and the fact that the Dáil is being asked in any case to vote a particular amount is altogether without prejudice to further steps being taken by the Executive Council to curtail expenditure. It may be of interest to Deputies to learn in this connection that the Ministry of Finance circularised all public departments a month ago for the purpose of having immediate and earnest consideration given to the whole field of administration with the object of exploring every feasible means of effecting economies. Preliminary reports are to be made in the first instance on more important matters, leaving details and minor matters to be examined subsequently.</P>
    <P>The total figures of Expenditure which I have given do not make provision for any Supplementary Estimates.  It is the desire of the Executive Council, as far as possible, to avoid Supplementary Estimates, but in the event of any such Estimates being necessitated, as a result of legislation or otherwise, it may not be unreasonable to hope that the amount <Col N="76" /> involved can be met by savings to be effected on the main Estimates by the adoption of economies in the course of the year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVENUE, 1923-24.</P>
    <P>The Estimate which has been circulated indicates generally how it is proposed to meet the total expenditure of over forty-six and a half millions.  It is proposed to find twenty-six millions of this total from revenue, made up of 20½ millions from tax revenue and 5½ millions from non-tax revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NON-TAX REVENUE.</P>
    <P>Little comment seems necessary to explain the details of non-tax revenue which are given in Paragraph B of the first page of the Estimate.  It will be noticed that of the total of 5½ millions, 3 millions is the estimated British contribution during the year towards compensation or pre-Truce damage to property. The miscellaneous item forming part of the non-tax revenue consists chiefly of instalments in repayment of local loans, the amount of which under present arrangements is afterwards transferable to the British Government out of the Vote for local loans.  I should mention in this connection that the published figures do not show, either on the receipt or expenditure side, the collection of Land Purchase annuities and subsequent transfer thereof to the British Government.  An arrangement for this purpose will, however, need to be made, but as it should affect each side of the Budget account to the same extent, it does not alter the margin between revenue and expenditure as shown in the published Paper.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAX REVENUE.</P>
    <P>The tax revenue for the year is estimated, as I have said, at 20½ millions. A Paper giving an explanation of that has been issued.  The corresponding figure for 1922-23 shown in the printed Estimate is £25,849,000, but as this is an unadjusted figure, the real comparative figure for 1922-23 should be taken as approximately 23 millions.  Thus a decline of 2½ millions in the tax yield is anticipated.</P>
    <P>The general principle on which our taxing proposals are based is that existing taxes should be continued as far as possible for 1923-24, according to the same <Col N="77" /> rates and conditions as have applied in 1922-23.  We have taken over as from the beginning of this month an elaborate fiscal system and a complex code of law that governs it, and, in undertaking the heavy burden which this involves, are necessarily precluded from making that full investigation of all the details of the system which would be an essential preliminary to any reform of policy such as the special circumstances of Saorstát Eireann might, perhaps, require.</P>
    <P>The general state of our finances makes it plain that reduction of taxation is out of the question at the present moment. Largely because of the campaign of destruction which has been waged in the country during the past year, borrowing to a great extent will be necessary during the current financial year.  The credit of the State, and the conditions on which borrowing on such a scale will be found feasible, are matters on which it is not yet possible to frame definite conclusions, and it is, therefore, important that we should not depend more than we can help upon having resort to borrowing.</P>
    <P>To explain the composition of the total figure of 20½ millions, a statement has to-day been circulated to Deputies showing the estimated yield of the several main taxes under the same heads as are adopted in the weekly Exchequer statement.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the preparation of a Revenue Estimate for 1923-24 is very much a matter of conjecture in present circumstances.  The revenue of this year is being collected under new conditions which have never previously operated.  The Free State has become an independent fiscal entity, and its taxes are being collected by its own officers, without need for adjustment, such as the temporary arrangement of last year required. This being the case, the Estimate has necessarily to be framed without the assistance that is normally provided by data collected under conditions generally similar to those of the period to which the Estimate relates.</P>
    <P>While I am bound to put forward these reservations, and to ask that they be specially borne in mind in considering the detailed allocation of the total revenue, I do not think that the total estimate itself should be regarded as otherwise than as a reasonable effort to anticipate the actual result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> As regards the figures for the several heads, it will be observed that a total of £7,300,000 is given for Customs, which is in marked contrast with the actual Customs receipt of about 2½ millions in 1922-23.  This is, of course, the direct consequence of our collecting this year all our own Customs, instead of having some of it collected for us as heretofore in Great Britain.  For example, tea coming to the Free State will no longer pay duty in London, but will pay it on landing at a Free State port or on the Border.</P>
    <P>Excise, on the other hand, is shown as £8,000,000 for 1923-24, whereas we received £16,488,000 in the year just closed.  This result is due to the fact that dutiable commodities, such as beer made in the Free State and sent to Great Britain, will cease to pay Excise duty here, as occurred last year, and will have to pay Customs on entry into Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Motor vehicle duties are expected to show an increase from £126,000 to £250,000.  This is due, of course, to the fact that the past year was abnormal, and that the gradual restoration of order and of compliance with the law will favourably affect this head of tax.</P>
    <P>The remaining items do not appear to require any special comment.</P>
    <P>In the case of income tax, it is possible to say definitely that the yield will be affected adversely by the general economic conditions which have prevailed in the country for some time past, and especially by the fact that where the tax is reckoned over an average of years, the favourable year 1919-20 will fall out of the reckoning and be replaced by the unfavourable year just ended.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of preferential rates of duty.  I have already explained the grounds on which we are recommending to the Dáil a continuance of the existing basis of taxation for this year.  For the same reasons we feel that it is desirable to continue the preferential rates of duty where these already exist. As Deputies, know, the preference takes the form of a reduction of one-sixth of the duty in the case of certain commodities of consumption (<i>e.g.</i>, tea and sugar), and one-third of the duty in the case of certain manufactured goods (<i>e.g.</i>, motor cars) grown or produced in the various Dominions&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Canada, Australia, India, etc.  The abolition of the preferential <Col N="79" /> rates, as Deputy Johnson has already explained in the course of a previous debate in the Dáil, would involve an immediate increase in the price of tea of nearly twopence in the lb., an increase which would be felt in every household in Ireland, but particularly amongst the working classes, and although the continuance of the rates represents a considerable loss to the Exchequer, we do not think that the present is an opportune time to ask the public to face the dislocation of trade and the possible hardship which this abolition would involve.  We therefore propose to continue the preferential rates, which will apply also to goods from Great Britain, for the present year, during which the whole preference question will be fully investigated.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the estimated sum of £1,700,000 already referred to is correct &mdash;that is the figure which refers to the adjustment between Great Britain and Saorstát Eireann&mdash;the financial year just terminated winds up with a deficit of £4,000,000.  It could not be described as a normal year.  From its beginning the political situation exercised an unfavourable business effect.  Disturbances of many kinds were the order of the day or night.  Property was insecure.  Motor cars were the sport of every man with a gun who had a desire for cheap travelling. Houses were commandeered at the point of the revolver.  Barracks just occupied by the National Army were the subject of attack, and posts occupied by the National troops were seized by the Irregulars, sometimes by a ruse, other times by deceit and treachery.  The public conscience was appalled by the fact that the men who were entrusted with arms, and who gave assurances to hold them and defend their posts, were found to be in a conspiracy against those who trusted them.  Continually we were being questioned: &ldquo;Can you depend on your men?&rdquo;  Such were the conditions prevailing in the first three months of the financial year just closed, and I bring that period under review now to show that ordinary business activity could not be prosperous under such conditions.  The three months following were still worse as major military operations were taking place all over the country.  In practically every city in the Saorstát there have been major military operations.  From the beginning it was evident that military <Col N="80" /> operations were a secondary consideration with the Irregulars, and the main attack was in the economic sphere.</P>
    <P>The railroads were singled out for special attention, and for a long period it was in doubt whether destruction or construction would win.  There is no doubt now.  At this moment there is only one serious dislocation, and that is in course of being remedied.</P>
    <P>The Post Office, which might be said to constitute the nerves of the business body, suffered innumerable onslaughts, but it has survived the attack, and is in excellent working order to-day.</P>
    <P>A further development of an offensive on the credit of the country began in December&mdash;namely, the destruction of house property.  This form of attack is a heritage from what is called the Black and Tan period.  It failed then, it has failed now, but, of course, it has left its economic aftermath.</P>
    <P>An examination of Banking returns shows that there has been a contraction in discounts and advances by Banks, both movements being symptomatic of reduced business activity.  All these events must be considered in relation to the two items of the balance sheet&mdash;namely, receipts and expenditure.  The balance on the wrong side is £4,000,000 maximum. On the expenditure side there are two items considerable in amount&mdash;namely, Army, £7,500,000; Compensation, £1,250,000.  If there are still people in the ranks of those engaged in hostilities against the State, who have hoped for an economic strain beyond the resources of the State, the publication of these figures will show clearly that the policy of destruction has failed.  If the military situation be reviewed it will be found that we have an Army of over 50,000 men, better disciplined, more efficient and with a better morale than at any period in our history.  In the same way the civil administration has been extended gradually, systematically and surely.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, without wishing to deprecate the need of progress and improvement in our financial administration in the future, I think it is a matter of some satisfaction that we have passed through the troubled year just ended without serious embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The anticipated deficit for the coming <Col N="81" /> year is, no doubt, serious, but it is not such as to cause any misgiving as to the financial future of the Free State and the credit of the country.  A large amount of the expenditure is non-recurring, and it is quite clear that on the arrival of settled conditions the revenue of the country will be ample to cover all commitments. We have been engaged in a war involving not merely the abnormal expenditure of warlike measures, but also the loss entailed by a system of organised sabotage&mdash;an organised attack on the industry and trade of the country.  In their attacks on trade and industry the Irregular forces have attempted to bring economic pressure on the Free State, and they have failed.  We are now emerging from a period of trial, and we are entering on more stable conditions, in which it can safely be predicted that there will be no appreciable increase of our existing commitments.</P>
    <P>For the future, the prosperity of the country and the credit of the State depend on the support which the people render to the Government of the day. After the stormy events of the last fifteen months we are entitled to ask for that support, not for the individuals who form the Government, but for the Government machine.  The persons forming the Government are immaterial.  It was not for any particular Government or for any particular Ministry that we entered on this struggle, the last phase of which is now being enacted.  No; it was for the fundamental principle of ordered government itself.  In asserting that principle we were prepared to exhaust the resources of the State.  It has not been necessary to do so.  The cost of the defence of the people's liberty is well within our resources, and there is no danger of its crippling the prosperous development of the country</P>
    <P>When ordered conditions are restored and normal life prevalent, we can safely anticipate a marked improvement in the economic condition of the country.  To repair the losses sustained we shall have to ask for the most cordial co-operation of every section.  The nation is capable of greater efforts.  We want harder work; we want greater industry&mdash;concentration by every citizen on his proper task, on his due share of the daily labour ahead of all of us in a united effort for the uplifting of our nation.  Given these <Col N="82" /> things, we have great prospects.  We can wipe out national dishonour, we can improve the conditions of our people, we can reconstruct our economic fabric, and we can vindicate the great dead who died that we might live.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, it is manifestly essential to undertake some burden of debt, and the Government will very soon appeal with confidence to those who have the interests of the country at heart to serve their own interests as well as those of the State by taking up that debt by internal subscription.</P>

    <P>I beg to move the first resolution, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That (<i>a</i>) income tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1923, at the rate of five shillings in the pound, and the same super-tax shall be charged for that year as was charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1922, under the law then in force in Saorstát Eireann or in the area now comprised therein; and (<i>b</i>) the several statutory and other provisions which were in force in Saorstát Eireann or in the area now comprised therein during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1922, in relation to income tax and super-tax shall, subject to the adaptations and modifications made in such provisions by or under the Adaptation of Enactments Acts, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922), and subject to the provisions of the Double Taxation (Relief) Act, 1923 (No. 8 of 1923), have effect in relation to the income tax and the super-tax to be charged as aforesaid, for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1923; and (<i>c</i>) the annual value of any property which has been adopted for the purpose of income tax under Schedules A and B for the year 1922-23, shall be taken as the annual value of that property for the same purpose for the year 1923-24, but subject to the provisions of any Finance Act to be passed by the Oireachtas in the current year.</P>

      <P>In regard <Col N="83" /> to the statement that has been made, I wish to ask, merely on a point of order, whether, in view of the fact that the Minister has found it necessary to give the Dáil a great deal of information with regard to the financial year that closed on the 31st March, and, further, in view of the fact that certain detailed information that we have not had until we met here in regard to expenditure estimated for the future, it would be in order, and to the convenience of the Minister and the Dáil, if the adjournment were moved, so that Deputies might have in writing the statement that was so clearly and lucidly put before us. They could then base their comments upon the exact words used by the Minister, rather than rely upon conjecture.</P>

      <P>It would be in order to move the adjournment of the debate, or, rather, to report progress, and it can be arranged that the discussion on one of the resolutions, perhaps the last one, which deals with the amendments of law, may range over the field which the Minister for Finance has covered.  We shall probably be taking that on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. THOS. JOHNSON Mr. THOS. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOS. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister himself deserves more congratulation for the possession of a temperament which will allow him to bring this kind of a resolution and of a speech forward more or less by accident to-day instead of yesterday, and to do it with a good grace and effectively; or that the Dáil should be, shall I say, commiserated with at having this kind of statement, the most important that could be made in the year, and one which one would imagine would be looked upon with very great anxiety by every person in the country, brought forward in a more or less casual way as contrasted with the serious way in which the same kind of statement is made in England.  However, we have had a statement of the Minister's intentions, and I suppose any anxiety or fear that new taxes of an oppressive character should be placed upon the people will be dispelled within a very <Col N="84" /> few minutes.  The deficit of £4,000,000 that the Minister has given us information about is a serious one no doubt.  It is £4,000,000 of a deficit on the last year's working.  I suppose if we were to press the matter, we would find out that in truth the deficit was a great deal more. We have not had any information as to the state of the financial arrangements in regard to the share of the British National debt, which, I suppose, still has to be borne in mind as a possibility if not a certainty.  Such as it is, it ought strictly to be brought within our review of the situation if we want to understand our real financial position.  Then, I think, there is also another item in the account, which has not been disclosed, and that is the cost of ammunition which ought to have been added to the Army Estimates. When these items are added, I imagine that the deficit will be shown to have been considerably more than £4,000,000. Nevertheless I appreciate the more, the optimistic tone of the closing paragraphs of the President's speech.  I believe that the country is quite easily capable of bearing the burden that is at present imposed upon it, and even a considerably greater burden, provided that the productive resources of the country are utilised and not allowed to lie waste and idle. The utilisation of those resources, human and material, is to a very considerable extent the responsibility of the Government of the day.  If we realise that responsibility we shall find that the country is quite easily capable of bearing this particular burden, and even a considerably increased one.  It might be interesting to draw attention to the comparative figures with regard to the revenue of Ireland 30 or 40 years ago, and to compare the revenue of 1890, which was for the whole of Ireland estimated to be about £11,000,000.  That is at a time when prices were at their lowest.  I suppose one would not be far wrong in speaking of £7,000,000 of that as being collectable in the 26 Counties comprising the Saorstát.  Considering the circumstances of the last year, and considering the circumstances of to-day and the purchasing power of money to-day, an increase from that £7,000,000 even to £25,000,000, while it sounds, or seems to be very great, is not so enormous as to make us afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the important deduction I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to is <Col N="85" /> that notwithstanding the extraction from the people of 25 millions to-day as compared with 7 millions in 1890 the people are considerably more comfortable, and enjoying a better state of life than they were in those days of low prices and comparatively low taxation.  The weight of taxation is not the only consideration, and if we can ensure that the taxes that are paid to the public Exchequer are to be circulated within the country the loss will not be felt by the normal workmen of the town or the normal working farmer of the country. The people who will be hit no doubt will be that considerable section of the community which is living upon unearned incomes for which they give no service, and who desire to see no taxation and low prices because their incomes are fixed and their purchasing power is thereby increased.  If we can continue to distribute well the wealth that is created, the country will be able to bear this and even a greater burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>One could not fail to remark the sentence in the President's speech when he said that improved machinery that they had been able to put into operation had provided new information, and it shows that the British White Paper arrangement tended to overstate the revenue of Saorstát Eireann.  The improved machinery is proving that the revenue which has been assumed to be due to the Saorstát has been overstated.  This is an age of disillusionment, and in this realm it appears that we are going to find many of the claims and contentions that have been used for the last 50 years in regard to the character of the country, spiritually, socially and financially, were not entirely well based.  But it is well that we should get at the truth about ourselves and about the country, however hard it may be to face it; it is well at this time when we are prepared to face realities that we should get the whole truth and build up from the base. The Minister has moved a resolution in respect to Income Tax.  His proposal is that the existing super-tax rates should be continued, and I am not sorry for one that he has not waited until he learned what the proposals of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer might be.  But I would like to find out what arrangements have been made as between the Irish Exchequer <Col N="86" /> and the British Exchequer as to the outcome of the Double Taxation Relief Bill which was passed a few days ago. What is to be the position in regard to the Irish Income Taxpayers, supposing the hopes of a large number of people in England bear fruition and that there is a shilling taken off the Income Tax?  I expect they will be disappointed.  But, supposing that is the case, are we to understand that the Irish citizens who have money invested in England, and which is subject to Income Tax where they may be paying 4s. in the £, will have to pay the other shilling into the Irish Exchequer?  If that is the arrangement then I am ready to wager that the Minister is praying nightly that the Chancellor in England will, as a matter of fact, reduce Income Tax, because a very large sum of Irish money which is invested in British investments ought, in my opinion, to give a return to the Irish Exchequer.  It is not balanced by a very long way indeed by the investments in Irish securities by residents and citizens in Great Britain.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he would satisfy our curiosity in that respect as soon as it is possible.  The Minister has told us that he has inaugurated an inquiry through all the spending departments with a view to economy.  I am all for economy, but I use the word as meaning wise and beneficent expenditure. I am afraid the Treasury Departments, the guardians of the public purse, always think of it as a reduction of expenditure, and I would like to warn the Minister against taking that view of this word economy.  I can imagine he will look down the lists of the items which go to make up the great sums required by the various departments, and he will see wages first&mdash;most of them call them salaries, of course&mdash;and it will be the lower ranges of salaries that will be looked at, and it will be said by the economists of the Department, no doubt, that salaries can be cut&mdash;wages can be cut.  The inquiry will not be as to whether the earners of these wages are giving service, but whether the amount that is paid into their pockets can be reduced. Now, I want to urge the Minister that if he is looking for economy it should be rather to put men into places where they can do the best work and pay them well for doing that good work, and that will <Col N="87" /> be the greatest economy that he or any other Minister can secure.</P>
    <P>There will, I think, if our hopes in regard to the political and military situation come to early satisfaction, be a still greater need for expenditure which is not provided for, at present, in these Estimates. You will have to make provision for the proper utilisation of these 50,000 men.  They cannot be kept as an Army, eating their heads off, and doing nothing. They might be tempted to do things they ought not to do.  They cannot be demobilised and thrown on to the labour market with no resources and no chance of employment.  And you cannot trust the exigencies of the market in the hope that there will be an immediate revival of industry and commerce.  It will be necessary to look ahead and to organise the resources of the nation in such a way that these men, as well as the remainder of those at present unemployed, can be properly utilised for the national wellbeing. That will inevitably call for a considerable addition to the expenditure in the coming year.  You will get value for it.  You will get material value for it.  It will not be like the expenditure of the ten million pounds, which is in truth waste.  Except in so far as it is saving the national life, materially and economically, in the narrow sense it is waste, and worse than waste.  Put you can utilise the labour of these men and the labour of the men who are at present unemployed in such a manner as will add to the national wealth, and even make it possible for ordinary economic processes in future years to be more productive and beneficial to the individuals who are responsible for the running of the economic machine.</P>
    <P>I hope that Ministers will not be afraid to ask for loans in sufficient amounts to cover this particular need and prevent a very much worse calamity falling upon the nation.  I was very glad indeed to hear the Minister say that he is going to appeal to the people of this country to provide the money that has to be borrowed.  I hope I understood him aright.  I hope he is not only going to give them a chance, but I hope he is going to throw upon the people of this country the burden&mdash;if it is a burden&mdash;of supplying the money that is required.  We read of a hundred odd millions of Irish money invested in British Government Stocks. <Col N="88" /> Probably there is anything from fifty to a hundred millions invested in other British Stocks.  The banks have large deposits which are not included in these two estimates of British investments. Money can be obtained in this country for all its needs, and I am hopeful that when you have obtained the money within this country you will see to it that it is expended in this country.  The estimates that have been placed before us are not satisfactory from one point of view particularly.  They do not enable the Dáil or the Committee on Finance, as I suppose we should call it, properly to weigh up the question as to whether they ought to vote this sum of money at least, whether they ought to levy upon the people this income tax of 5/- in the £, or the various other items that are embodied in this paper giving the estimate of Tax Revenue.  I realise quite well that there are difficulties in the way of making anything like an accurate estimate of the yield of specific taxes.  But the Minister's department has been able, at any rate, to make an estimate and I assume that they have got some figures upon which to base that estimate.  They have had one year of experience and I think that we ought to be a placed in a position not only of knowing the figure estimated to be the yield of the property and income tax, but we ought to know what is the estimated yield of the beer tax, the tea tax, the entertainments tax, and the various other taxes which are included in the annual reports.  We know that there is to be a sum of about twenty million pounds raised as Revenue, and the Minister asks us to raise that money by specific means&mdash;to continue the present taxation.  Before we can properly consider and judge the merits of these various taxes we ought to be told what is their estimated yield.  We have had no information on that point.  We have had simply Customs, seven million, three hundred thousand pounds; and Excise, eight million pounds placed before us.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is the estimated yield of the sugar tax, the tobacco tax, the whiskey and beer tax, the entertainment tax, and the various other taxes that are carried on from last year. A good deal of interest has been aroused, and the question was raised upon the last occasion we were discussing this <Col N="89" /> matter as to the merits of the motor tax and the merits of the film taxes.  I am not going to get into any excitement about the film tax, but I would like to know whether in the minds of the advisers of the Ministry it is going to be productive of any revenue at all, when one considers the probable amount of it? and the probable loss arising from entertainments. I feel that the Minister is justified almost wholly in saying that the circumstances are such as to warrant his carrying on the present taxation more or less as it stands, but I do not think that that decision should rule out any adjustments to meet the circumstances of the country.  I suppose it is quite an accident that the tobacco tax is going to encourage the making of cigarettes in this country; and just as that is an accident arising from the incidence of taxation, these other taxes will probably be detrimental to the particular industries affected, and I think that the Minister should not be too rigid in his adherence to the present taxes without regard to the effect upon the industrial and commercial life, simply because of loyalty to the holus-bolus carry-over idea.</P>
    <P>I would ask when the Finance Bill is brought forward, and when we are discussing these more detailed matters that the Minister should not close his mind to the possibility of altering his plans in such a way as to fit in with the industrial and commercial life of the country where it is not going to mean any considerable loss to the Exchequer.  When we have had some information&mdash;and I hope the Minister will not delay in presenting it to the Dáil&mdash;as to the estimated yield of the various taxes, we shall probably have to suggest some alteration in the incidence of the taxes which hit the poor more hardly, and the variation in some respects of these taxes.  We cannot do that unless we have some knowledge of the probable yields, and how they are affecting the country, and how any alteration would affect the Exchequer. Therefore I would press upon the Minister the necessity of providing the Dáil with that information.</P>
    <P>I believe the country will receive this Budget with very mixed feelings, as I suppose Budgets are usually received, but there will be disappointment in the minds of those who have been looking for many years to the establishment of <Col N="90" /> an Irish Government with power to control its own fiscal arrangements.  The hope of being able to use that fiscal power to encourage the development of home industries is dashed so far as this year is concerned.  The Minister says they have not had time to make any inquiry. Presumably they have been living from hand to mouth, and all the discussion and all the columns upon columns, and pages upon pages of arguments that appeared in the Sinn Fein weekly and monthly papers in the past few years, have been passed over as being unreliable, and a new inquiry is to be made the basis upon which exact knowledge is to be got, and until this inquiry is made it is not safe, it is not wise, and it is not statesmanlike, and it would not be good for the revenue probably, and it cannot be good for the industry of the country to embark upon a new fiscal scheme.  But I have a hankering suspicion that when this question was being discussed by the Executive Council they began to find lines of cleavage, and that the foundations of new Parties were there shown.  On the one side you would find the protectionist and on the other side the free-trader, and some questions were raised as to whether this should be altered or whether that should be imposed, and finally it was decided that we had better go on as we are and leave the burden of making a change to our successors.  I rather fancy something like that must have occurred, because unless that had been the case, and unless they feared a split within the camp, we would have at least something done to satisfy the supporters who put them in office and the people that led the agitation upon the economic side for the establishment of an Irish Free State. It must be a great disappointment, and I wonder whether they will ever recover. At any rate the Ministers have told us that they are not going to take that plunge.  They are not going to say whether they will advocate a policy of free imports, or whether they will put a tariff upon imports for revenue, or a tariff upon imports for protection&mdash;they simply say that for the present we are an extension of the British Government in Ireland so far as revenue is concerned, and we will carry on the good work that the British Government placed in our hands.  We will not change the incidence <Col N="91" /> of taxation; we will use the instruments they have fashioned for us, and we will let the country see at last what can be done.</P>
    <P>I am sure we are not very far from a very considerable ferment in the country upon this particular question, and I believe the sooner we get into it the better. The sooner we get people thinking about this kind of problem and problems affecting their economic and social life so much the better for the country, and I should wish for that reason only, if for none other, that the Minister had been bold enough to say, &ldquo;Well, we are going to help agriculture by a tariff on this; we are going to help industry by a tariff on that,&rdquo; and thus bring all the forces of economic discussion into the field and compel the people to think about these questions rather than other questions of less interest though perhaps of more vital importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a most interesting statement.  He has at least opened up many questions, and I suppose he will have satisfied the curiosity of very many people.  I hope though that in future years we shall have educated the country to feel that such a day as Budget day is a day of vital importance to them all, and that they will be looking forward for the arrival of the day and that they will be so much interested in the internal political affairs of the country as to be wondering from day to day what the Dáil was going to do, what the Minister for Finance was going to do, in regard to the question of revenue and expenditure.  I am sorry to say that from my observation the country has not realised, but to a very trifling extent indeed, the change that has come over the position and that the Dáil is thought of as an institution which they need not be concerned very much about. The Minister for Finance may have something interesting to say to commercial men and to financiers, but it seems to be of no concern to the average man. I think that is an unfortunate state of things and I hope we shall rapidly grow out of it and that the Dáil will justify the hopes of the more thoughtful and earnest of those who made the Dáil possible and presented it to us, and that we shall be looked to here as the body representing the people, with a Government <Col N="92" /> and an Executive authority responsible to it and to the people.  It seems to me that we ought to direct our attention, and Ministers ought to direct their attention, to creating that feeling in regard to the Dáil, and to do so we would require on every occasion such as this, when a Budget statement is made, that we should be prepared for it, and that the speech or statement of the Minister should not be allowed to be sidetracked by a trivial discussion on daylight saving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I judge it a matter of some importance that on the first Budget statement of our new State we should have an opportunity of coming down to the practical business details of the conduct of this State, and not be compelled, by one circumstance or another, to indulge in what, after all, cannot be regarded as very much other than the generalities of taxation.  We have had certain figures put before us, some of which only came into our hands this afternoon.  Others have been in our hands for some weeks.  The statement made by the Minister for Finance disclosed a revision of certain of them in important details, because of considerations that he placed before us so very clearly. In the circumstances, it seems to me that it would be unwise and unfair to direct any criticism or comment towards figures that are not before us in a final form, but are merely based upon a speech that we have had delivered to us very clearly and very lucidly, but which we have not had before us in writing, and the arguments of which are only recently in our minds.  For that reason I will ask the permission of the Dáil to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there are certain resolutions before us that it is of the utmost public importance should be passed without delay.  I suggest, if it is agreeable to you, A Chinn Chomhairle, and to the Dáil, that what might be done under the circumstances is that the eight resolutions should be passed, and the general debate on the subject adjourned. If I understand the procedure aright the passing of these resolutions is without any prejudice whatever to such amendments by way of revision&mdash;revision being clearly understood to be reductions and not increases&mdash;that may be judged advisable, necessary, or wise at <Col N="93" /> a later stage, when these resolutions come before us in a Finance Bill.  With your permission, I make bold to suggest here now that we pass the eight resolutions, seeing that they are clearly required at the earliest possible moment in order to give statutory effect to certain actions within the next few days, and that when these resolutions have been passed I would desire, if you would give me permission, to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Of course before you can do that it will be necessary to get the agreement of the Dáil. No one could move to pass eight resolutions, seven of which have not been proposed. You will have to get the matter straightened out before you can move your motion.  If we get general agreement on the matter, we can pass the motion which has been made, and then go on and pass the seven others as they are proposed by the Minister for Finance. The Minister can then move the ninth resolution about the Amendment of Law. At that stage, if it is moved to Report Progress, we can go out of Committee and adjourn.  On the resumption of the debate you could go into Committee on the ninth resolution for the Amendment of Law, continue the general discussion, and then Report to the Dáil.  General agreement, of course, would be necessary for that.  What is the opinion of the Minister for Finance?</P>

I will bring up this matter later on.  I am now only briefly dealing with it as a protest against this sordid action.  I know the same thing occurs at Waterford and at Cork.  I would not give a monopoly to any port to hold up the general work of the country.  We should try to develop other ports.  We have, for instance, ports on the west of Ireland, such as Westport and Sligo.  I say those ports are getting very little encouragement from the Government or anybody else. I would like to see that no port would have a monopoly, that the resources of Ireland would be fully developed, and that every workman should get fair play.  I am speaking mostly in protest against this action that occurred on the Dublin quays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose Resolution No. 2 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That (1) Where any employed person has omitted to make payment of any income tax under Schedule D or E, due and payable by him for any year, the Revenue Commissioners may give notice to the employer of such person at any time after a period of three months has elapsed since such income tax became due and payable, requiring such employer to deduct the amount of income tax so in arrear from any remuneration payable by him to such employed person.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) On receipt of such notice the employer shall deduct such sum or sums, not exceeding in the aggregate the total amount of income tax so in arrear, at such times, and in such manner, as the Revenue Commissioners may direct, and shall forthwith pay over the amounts so deducted to the Accountant-General of Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) If any employer refuses or neglects to pay over to the Accountant-General of Revenue any such sum or sums within the time specified in such notice, such employer shall be liable to pay such sum or sums as if the same had been duly assessed upon him, and proceedings for the recovery thereof may be taken in any manner prescribed by the Income Tax Act, 1918, including the issue by the Special Commissioners of their warrant to the collector in whose collection the business premises or property of the said employer are situated, requiring him to distrain the said employer by his goods and chattels; and failure on the part of the employer to deduct any such sum or sums from the employed person shall not be any bar to the recovery of such sum or sums by proceedings or distraint. <Col N="98" />&ldquo;(4) Any employer who neglects or refuses to comply with the provisions of this section shall be liable to the penalty imposed by Section 107 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, upon a person who neglects or refuses to deliver a list, declaration, or statement, and such penalty shall be recoverable without prejudice to any other remedy provided by the Income Tax Act, 1918, or this resolution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Where the employer is a body of persons, the provisions of Sub-sections 2 and 4, Sections 105 and 106 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall apply in relation to anything required to be done under this resolution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of Rule 11, Schedule E, of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or of Rule 7, Schedule E, of the same Act, as amended by Section 18 (3) of the Finance Act, 1922.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) An employer who pays over to the Accountant-General, or to the collector in whose collection his business premises or property are situated, any such sum of income tax as required by notice from the Revenue Commissioners as aforesaid, shall be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by such payment as if that sum of money had actually been paid as remuneration to the employed person.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(8) And it is declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he will tell us whether this resolution embodies anything different in any degree from the practice hitherto prevailing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That embodies certain powers that are possessed in the law in Scotland, and I think it embodies some of the powers that are in operation in England.  One of the reasons for it is that there are huge sums of money outstanding under Income Tax.  For 1920-1921 there are 3,725 cases where we are owed under £100.  For 1921-1922 there are 6,861 such cases.  The tax covered by these is not less than a quarter of a million.  As regards cases over £100, there are 200 for 1920-21 and 423 for 1921-1922. <Col N="99" /> The actual tax in this case is £115,000. In Dublin City alone the arrears due from employees, exclusive of workmen, is £365,000.  Making allowance for deductions which may be claimed, the net sum is something like £300,000.  I do not know whether the Deputy will agree with me or not, that the collection of Income Tax from trade unionists is scarcely an economic proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister, in answering, clearly understood the import of my question, which was whether this resolution embodies in any degree any change in the practice that has hitherto been operative? Is this the same kind of a resolution, for instance, that was passed by the British Parliament a year ago, verbally identical except for the change of name?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The alterations that I have indicated are alterations in it.  In other words we are taking practically the same powers as are in operation in Scotland.  We have taken the Scotch rather than the English system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That explains why I wanted to postpone the discussion upon this resolution.  We ought to have time to consider what is meant by the resolution. If it had been simply a carrying over, a formal resolution carrying over something that we have already accepted by our adoption of certain Acts it might be excusable that these things should be passed.  But we have had these resolutions placed in our hands now; we have not had time to read them; we have not been able to understand them, and they may commit us to agreeing to principles we object to absolutely.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I was wrong.  This is absolutely new; it deals with the special circumstances of the case I have described.  I have had an undertaking from the Revenue Commissioners that they will exercise discretion in the collection of arrears of Income Tax so as to avoid hardship in any individual case, but these are cases in which payment has been deliberately withheld from us and in which it has been almost impossible for us to get payment by any other means.  It represents a very considerable sum and deals with the class of persons who are able to pay but who have evaded payment <Col N="100" /> and who unless machinery such as this be devised to deal with their cases will not pay their contribution towards the upkeep of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel about it is that we are not able to understand it, not having had time to read it, and that we ought not to be asked to vote even upon it without some consideration.  If the Dáil expresses its view that it approves of the Minister's proposal it is to that extent committed to embodying it in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

It may be all right for Deputy Darrell Figgis to move the adjournment of the Debate in order that he, in consultation with those whom he represents outside, may have an opportunity of considering the implications that the resolutions involve.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>From my personal knowledge of the operation of resolutions of this kind, it is not new so far as the British Government is concerned.  I must say right away that I regard the question of income tax as a matter to be settled between the individual citizen and the State which presumes to have the right to impose such taxation.  I think that any citizen who regards it as a patriotic duty to comply with the laws that are made by the State of which he is a citizen will always regard himself as liable for any taxation that is imposed by the Government acting for the time being.  However, this particular resolution and all its implications have been in operation during the British regime in this country.  As a result of instructions that were issued during the Anglo-Irish war, I had personal experience of contesting the right of a British employer by whom I happened to be employed regarding the right of that particular employer to impose upon me income tax which I regarded as a charge that was necessary to retain the British Army and all its connections in this country.  I was advised by a member of the Second Dáil, who, unfortunately, has now passed away, that I was quite right in contesting that particular aspect of the case; but now I find that a native Irish Government comes along and repeats the very dose that they have already advised us to contest with the British who were putting it into operation.  I look upon the matter of income tax as a matter between the individual citizen and the State, and I think that this Government or any other Government has no right to impose upon any employer, no matter in what capacity, the duty of extracting from the individual employee, under any covering resolution of this kind, taxation which is a matter between the individual citizen and the State.  I object to and protest against the passing over to us by resolution of this kind a law that was in operation when the British were in charge of this country, and when we were advised by the people who were opposing the laws at the time to ignore.  I think it is most unfair, particularly to salaried staffs of any company or those who are employed in positions in the Irish Free State, that they should be called on to comply with a resolution of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened rather <Col N="102" /> carefully to Deputy Davin.  Unless I misunderstand him, he says that he objected to paying income tax to the British Government because he had a scruple about it lest any halfpenny of that money might be used to maintain here armed forces of one kind or another that were making war on or opposing the will of the majority of the people.  That is one proposition easily understood.  The people here had set up a native Parliament; they had set up their own democratic institutions, and it was attempted to smash those democratic institutions by force, and Deputy Davin, inspired solely by a high civic sense, objected to paying any money that might possibly assist that attempt.  The situation now has altered.  I think Deputy Davin in his statement failed to take stock of the very radical alteration that has taken place.  It is not now a question of a particular law imposed by force upon the people.  It is a question now of the Government elected by the people's Parliament, responsible to the people, requiring certain facilities for the collection of taxes which are submitted to the people's Parliament for approval.  There is a difference, Deputy Davin will agree, and he need not be afraid now that any halfpenny or penny of his money will be used to defeat the majority will of the people or to smash any institution which the people have set up.  I think that in these, as in other matters, that people catch on to ideas that were current and phrases that were current in the past, and attempt to apply them now, when in fact they are inapplicable, and when in fact the whole position is radically and fundamentally altered.  The argument that objections which were perfectly valid objections in the past are equally applicable now is unsound.  I have very little doubt that he was advised to withhold income tax in the past at his own risk&mdash;other people were&mdash;to put up to the British Government that kind of passive resistance which was the best support the civilian population could give to those who were actively opposing that Government.</P>

      <P>There is a personal matter which I hardly like to make reference to, but I should be something less than human if I did not regard it as a matter of offence that it should be stated in the Dáil by any Deputy that I desired to move the adjournment of the Dáil for any other reasons than the reasons I stated in making that request. There was no other reason present to my mind, and I cannot but regard any such reference as a discourtesy which should not have been offered.  My only desire in moving that the Debate should be adjourned was that we should have the whole particulars before us in accordance with the custom which obtains in other places, pending fuller examination of the resolutions which still remain before us, and that they should be put into effect directly they are brought in, so that nobody can have an opportunity of taking advantage of any pre-knowledge of them.</P>

      <P>I hope the resolution now before the Dáil is not going to be voted on before we adjourn.  When the first resolution was before the Dáil I understood&mdash;and, I think, the Dáil generally understood&mdash;that there were good reasons for treating it as urgent, and that the temporary resolution should go through.  I should like to know if that applies in the same way to any of the other resolutions on this paper?  The Dáil has a very real grievance, in respect of these resolutions, against the Minister who introduced them.  The Minister made a long, careful, and very clear statement. The Dáil, and every member in it, were entitled to assume that, in making that statement, the Minister for Finance was covering the ground of the resolutions which he was about to put before the Dáil.  I suppose we all assumed that that was the case.  It now turns out that through inadvertence, or some other reason, at least two resolutions are sprung <Col N="104" /> on the Dáil without any explanation having been given of them in the opening statement of the Minister for Finance.  I refer to the second and third resolutions.  I think, in view of the importance of these resolutions, and in view of the fact that the subject under discussion was the most important we could discuss here, these matters should not be rushed, and that having had his first resolution passed, the Minister for Finance should be content.  I take the opportunity of saying that personally I regret that the resolution on which the general discussion is to take place is not the first one before the Dáil.  The statement which the Minister for Finance made, and the subject he raises is the most important that could come before the Dáil, and should be treated as such.  I should have liked to see serious discussion upon that statement raised as the immediate outcome of the speech of the Minister, instead of having these various specific resolutions interpolated before we reach the discussion on the general subject.  I do ask the Minister really to let us know whether there is any reason why any other resolution beyond the first resolution should be proceeded with to-night, before the Dáil has had an opportunity of doing anything more than skimming over the very considerable amount of matter in these documents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice earlier that I would raise a question on the Motion for the Adjournment in regard to the potato crop in the County Louth. The crop, over a very considerable portion of the Constituency that I represent, is affected in a very serious way; and I may say at the outset, that the question is one which may affect the country at large in a year or so.  I think the time is opportune when this matter should be taken up earnestly by the Government. The condition of the crop affects a very large number of industrious people in the peninsula of North Louth.  The people in that area go in considerably for the intensive cultivation of the potato crop, and, at the moment, they have on their hands from ten to twelve thousand tons of potatoes which they find it impossible to market.  One of the reasons why they cannot market the crop is, that the area is a scheduled area under a Black Scab Order, the result being that the farmers, and other people, who grow potatoes in that very large area, cannot export their crop to any part of Ireland for disposal.  They usually found a market in England for the very large surplus crop they had, but this year it is impossible for them to find a market, except at a price that would not pay them to handle the produce.  I will endeavour to give some figures which, I am sure, will convince the Minister for Agriculture at any rate, that the case of these people is one of very real hardship.  I have brought the matter already under <Col N="112" /> the notice of the Minister.  A deputation of both growers and exporters waited on him in reference to the matter.  He was good enough on that occasion to send down an Inspector as a result of the representations made to him.  The Inspector made an examination of the district, and I am sure satisfied himself that the statements made in regard to the condition of the people there were quite correct.  I have not had an opportunity of seeing that report; I do not know what is in it, because I expect it is a confidential report from an Inspector to the Minister.  I believe that the report will bear out, to some extent at any rate, if not to the full, the facts that I am about to place before you.  I do not want to labour this question very much, because the Minister knows all about it. I know, however, that the obvious answer I will get from the Minister is, that he has no money.  I would remind the Government, at the same time, that they expect to get taxes from that area; they have to get the annuities which are payable to the Land Commission, and the County Council has to get its rates. But, if the people cannot get a market for their produce which is now allowed to rot at the backs of the ditches in that area, I do not see anything before them except bankruptcy.  These are people who never asked for any subsidy, or any dole, from the Government, and probably they will never have to ask for it again, but this year they are very hard hit.  I am convinced at any rate&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister is or not&mdash;that it will be impossible for them to get over their present difficulty, and pay their way during the coming year or to pay the Government what they legitimately owe and are quite willing to pay if given an opportunity to do so, unless some help is forthcoming from the Government for them.  The area comprises five electoral divisions, and contains 25,726 acres.  In that area, it is only just to say, there are the Carlingford mountains, which probably absorb about 2,000 acres.  The valuation of the area is £15,648.  If the local District Council were to strike a rate to give these people anything adequate at all as a means of relief, it would mean they would have to strike a rate of 6s. or 8s. in the pound.  I hold it would be impossible for these people, or indeed for any other people in Ireland, to bear an extra rate of that magnitude on top of <Col N="113" /> the rates that they have to pay to the County Council and the District Council at the present time.  As I have stated, the people in this area have from ten to twelve thousand tons of potatoes at the moment to dispose of, and the price offered for them is 9d. per cwt., or 15s. per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, take the prices in the Dublin market as given in last night's papers, and compare them with the prices for the same class of potatoes grown in the area, and you will find that in Dublin the price is 3s. 9d. to 4s. 6d. per cwt., or £3 15s. to £4 10s. a ton.  I do not know if it is possible for the potatoes to be allowed out for sale in the market in Dublin, but, making every excuse for the glut that would be brought about I hold that the potatoes would be sold at at least 2s. 6d. per cwt.  That would give something like an ordinary fair rate, and it might, perhaps, compensate the people in some way for growing the crop.  Eleven to twelve tons would be the average crop, and that would mean they would get about £8 per acre where the cost of production would be £30 an acre.  At the lowest price in Dublin&mdash;3s. per cwt., or £3 a ton&mdash;they would get £33 an acre for the crop, and would be glad to get that.  Unfortunately, however, the people will not get leave to take the potatoes across the line inside of which the restrictions are in force.  That is the position these people are in.  They have no place to go with the potatoes except England, and there they would get only 9d. cwt., or 15s. a ton, for the crop.  In some Irish country towns potatoes are dearer than in Dublin, but owing to the prevalence of this disease in the area the people are not allowed to send the potatoes out. There is a large amount of those potatoes of the immune variety; they will not take this disease, but at the same time even those will not be allowed out owing to the restrictions put upon the area by the Department.  I hold that the people there are entitled to consideration in some way by the Government since the Government have restricted them from selling the crop in what they might consider the best market they could get.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to try and meet these deserving people, and so enable them to tide over their difficulty.  A <Col N="114" /> man gets £8 for what it costs him £30 to produce, because he cannot get to the market where his potatoes will fetch the highest price.  I know the Minister will say: &ldquo;I have the whole of the country to look after, and I cannot allow diseased potatoes to go into other parts of it; I cannot take the risk.&rdquo;  When that risk cannot be taken I hold it is the duty of the Government and the Minister to come to the assistance of the people and to save the remainder of the country from the disease.  The position is one of extreme hardship and delicacy. These people will be compelled to allow the crop to rot at the back of the ditches because they cannot get a fair market for it.  It is the plain duty of the Government to do something to relieve the existing state of affairs.  It will, perhaps, take five or six thousand pounds to give those people a means of exporting the potatoes to England even.  At the prevailing prices it will not pay a farmer to devote his own time or to pay men to put those potatoes into bags for the purpose of exporting them.  The Government will not allow the potatoes to be sent into other parts of Ireland, for obvious reasons.  They fear the disease will spread.  When restrictions are put on, the Government, in my opinion, should come to the assistance of the people, and see they are not made beggars of just because, unfortunately, this disease arises in the district.  I trust the Minister will hold out some hope that he will be able to do something for this very deserving community that has always been anxious to pay its way if the people in it get the opportunity, and that he will tell the Dáil that, if not now, he will very soon see that the crop does not go to loss, and that these people will be saved from bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>This is a case which from its very nature demands help.  It has been clearly stated here by the deputy for the Minister for Industry and Commerce that in connection with contracts a preference of 20 per cent. has been given for Irish products.  Here is an Irish product, and I hope that the same partiality given by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Irishmen for materials produced in Ireland will be applied by the Minister for Agriculture in the particular cases brought under our <Col N="115" /> notice.  Deputy Johnson the other night animadverted very strongly on the point that fifty thousand uniforms were bought in London at 41s.  instead of being purchased in Dublin at 45s.  The result would be that the Central Fund would lose ten thousand pounds.  That kind of thing is happening in other Departments. The Postmaster-General gives a 20 per cent.  preference, and Deputy Whelehan has stated that in contracts a 20 per cent. preference was given for Irish material.  He explained the reason of it in Tuam.  If 4s. can be given to Dublin tailors on a suit of clothes I think 4s. in respect of oats and potatoes should also be given.  I am quite sure the Minister for Agriculture has not made any provision for a subsidy for Agriculture in his estimates.</P>

      <P>The case made by Deputy Hughes calls for some consideration from the Minister.  Representations of the same nature have been made to me by residents in that area, and the point that is stressed, that I would like to stress, and that Deputy Hughes touched upon, is that quite a considerable quantity of seed potatoes recommended by, if not sold by, the Department at prices from £13 to £15 per ton, were guaranteed immune from the disease, and, having bought the potatoes at this price, the people are not allowed to sell out of the area.  That does strike one as a legitimate cause for complaint. The wider question is whether, when a locality is made to suffer certain losses for the common good, the common purse ought not to be available for assistance and help.  It seems to me that this is part of a general principle where, when individuals are called upon to suffer abnormally for the common good and for the protection of their neighbours in other parts of the country, that those neighbours have a right to bear some of the cost of that suffering.  It is on those grounds and on that principle that I support the contentions of Deputy Hughes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only is the principle which has just been formulated by Deputy Johnson a sound one, but what I think is better, in view of the precedents which we are accustomed to follow, the principle has been adopted <Col N="116" /> and acted upon in a similar matter by the Department of Agriculture.  Hitherto it was not enough that any claim could be supported by reference to a sound and moral principle.  It was necessary in accordance of the traditions of the English system to show a precedent in favour of it.  In the case of Foot and Mouth Disease in cattle, where it became necessary to slaughter herds of valuable cattle, compensation was paid. It was recognised that for the sake of preserving the stock and saving one of the most valuable industries of the country from ruin that the individual farmer who suffered this terrible loss of losing his cattle, should be compensated for it inasmuch as this was done for the common benefit.  So it seems to me that not only is the case cited by Deputy Wilson a parallel, but it is better than a parallel; it is a precedent&mdash;the very identical thing.  It is not desirable, and Deputy Hughes himself in advocating relief insisted it was not desirable, that potatoes so infected should find their way into other areas that had hitherto been immune from Black Scab.  The only case that seems to me that a perverted ingenuity could make against it is to pretend that the farmers were in the position of men who had made a bad speculation, and that consequently they had to bear the consequences of their wrong view as to what was a good crop.  I think that would be a heartless, and not merely a heartless but an altogether unreasonable attitude to take up in the matter.  Because it is clearly a case that had to be discovered.  It is a matter belonging to climate and local conditions and, as a matter of fact, if we were to regard it properly the thing is rather in the nature of scientific research in aid of the agricultural industry, for it will enable us to realise that soils of a certain type, and seed potatoes of a certain type, should not be brought together. It is a valuable lesson to the Agricultural Department and even from that point of view I am arguing it is worth paying for.  It seems to me that the case made by Deputy Hughes is absolutely convincing and that nothing but an absolute inability on the part of the State to pay its way should be accepted as an answer to it.  Fortunately for the case that he has made and for the people for whose relief he seeks the assistance of this Dáil, the President told us to-day <Col N="117" /> that the attempt to destroy the financial soundness of the new Free State had failed and failed miserably, that the State is able to pay its way, is able to carry these financial burdens, even those extra and unexpected burdens that lawlessness has imposed upon it.  So that out of his own mouth I am able to quote an assurance that should be absolutely encouraging to the Minister for Agriculture to do what I am quite sure from my knowledge of him he is anxious to be permitted by the Executive to do.</P>

      <P>This is undoubtedly a genuine case.  I have as much sympathy with it as any Deputy in the Dáil.  I do not want to pretend for one moment that there is not a genuine hardship here. I am anxious from every point of view, and I would be anxious naturally from every point of view, to do something to ameliorate it.  Deputy Hughes has stated the case fairly, but I am not admitting all his figures.  He has really stated the facts of the case fairly accurately. There are very large quantities of potatoes in that area.  In fact, potato-growing is practically its only industry. I have examined the case from every point of view, and I find a difficulty in saying what they are to do with these potatoes.  But, I find with all the goodwill in the world, an equal difficulty in deciding what can be done to help them.  That really is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes has stated&mdash;but I had better clear up his figures as well as I can first&mdash;that they can get about 15s. per ton for those potatoes in England, whereas potatoes in Dublin are going 3s. 9d. per cwt., or £3 15s. per ton.  Further, that it is costing them about £30 an acre to grow them and that by an acre they will now realise about £8.  Well, these figures are just a little too good.  The potatoes on the whole are immune varieties.  There are parts of England where you can get more than 15s. per ton for these varieties. They are not ordinary varieties that people will eat if they had their choice.  They are a potato like Lochinvars, and not quite as good as the Champion. But even such as they are, there are parts of England where you can get more than 15s. per ton for both&mdash;York, for <Col N="118" /> instance.  When the Deputy is quoting £3 15s. per ton for potatoes in Dublin, I think he is quoting the price of a better class of potatoes&mdash;table potatoes, such as Up-to-Dates.  The only point I make about that is, that the loss is not quite as big as Deputy Hughes suggests.  They will lose undoubtedly by reason of the fact that they use extraordianry quantities of artificial manures in that particular area.  They probably use about twice as great a quantity of fertilisers per acre in that area as in any other area in Ireland.  They will also lose by reason of the fact that they pay exorbitant prices for conacre to grow potatoes. They pay £7 or £8 per acre.  They have done all that, and they now find themselves with their potatoes unsaleable. But remember they did all that with their eyes open.  You must look at both sides of the question.  They knew when they were sowing these potatoes that they could not sell the produce in Ireland. They knew that their only market was England.  The position now is that the English market has failed them, not because of Black Scab or any disease, but because the bottom has fallen out of the potato market in England and they cannot sell them in England.  The Department of Agriculture could not possibly take the responsibility of letting these potatoes out of the area for sale in any other part of Ireland.  This is a very virulent disease and spreads with extraordinary rapidity, and no matter what the losses are the Department of Agriculture could not adopt any other policy except to schedule the areas where Black Scab is found; so that selling them in Ireland outside this area is out of the question.  It would be risking the whole potato industry of the country.  They have the English market, they have the French market and the rest of the world, anywhere where there is a market for potatoes.  But they are not able to sell them there at a profit.  They must sell them at a big loss.  I want the advice of anybody in the Dáil as to what we should do.  Deputy Wilson suggests a subsidy. Well, I am not Minister for Finance. but if I were, I do not think I would feel justified in giving a subsidy in this case. Deputy Johnson mentioned that immune varieties might be let into other parts of Ireland, but we have no evidence that it is the potato itself that carries the disease.  In fact, there is little information <Col N="119" /> about it, though it is in the country for some time.  It might be carried in the bags, or it might be carried in the clay attaching to the potatoes, and the experts&mdash;I am not one&mdash;advise that that proposition would not be safe.  Besides, you get other sorts of potatoes mixed with immune varieties.  Immune varieties may be grown one year and the next year you might have non-immune varieties, and you would have the two mixed up. In any case, the experts advise that it would be absolutely unsafe to allow immune varieties out.  Deputy Magennis suggested that you have a precedent.  He talks about the slaughtering of cattle. That is not a precedent.  On the face of it there is some similarity, but it is not by any means a precedent.  When Foot and Mouth Disease appears in this country there is no market anywhere. The cattle simply cannot be taken out of the country.  That is not the way with potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a difference of degree. These people have a market.  They have a market in England and they have a market in France, and they have sold potatoes in France.  They have a market elsewhere, and, more important than all, they planted these potatoes knowing they had no market in Ireland for them, knowing they were growing them for the English market.  Supposing you did agree to give a subsidy, they would cheerfully grow potatoes next year, knowing perfectly well that if the English market were bad the Government would come along and pay them the difference.  That is really the whole point of the case.  No one is entitled to put all his eggs in one basket and have a gamble, and then if it does not come off, go to the Government for money.  That is what it comes to.  These people have insisted for years in making the growing of potatoes their one method of farming. They keep no pigs.  They simply do nothing but grow potatoes and sell them, and they find themselves now absolutely dependent upon the growing of potatoes, for which they have no market. They have done that against repeated warnings from the Department of Agriculture.  That is undoubtedly bad farming.  It is easy enough for me to say it is bad farming, but I know very <Col N="120" /> well that special conditions attach to that particular district.  The land is suitable for nothing else except potatoes and barley.  It is peculiarly suited to potatoes, and they made fortunes out of them during the war, but that does not justify them in putting all their eggs in one basket.  They do not even keep a pig.  There are plenty of people feeding most of their potatoes to pigs.  There are a great many ways of farming besides growing potatoes even in a neighbourhood like that.  These are the merits of the case.  They sowed these potatoes last year knowing they had no market except the English market.  They have continued to sow those potatoes. For several years that particular neighbourhood has been scheduled, and they had been warned that they were doing a very dangerous thing.  This year they have come up against it, and they ask for a subsidy.  I am as much interested in these people as any other Deputy, and I would like very much to do something for them if I could.  I have sent one of the very best Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture up there to get information on the spot.  I can honestly suggest nothing that can be done.  I could not put up a proposition to the Minister for Finance which I could stand over, despite the hardship of the case.  And I believe that if any of the Deputies who have spoken were in my position they would find themselves in the same difficulty.  I would be glad of any advice anybody could give in regard to the matter.</P>

I do not know whether the Dundalk Distillery people would buy them, but the difficulty we are in is that we simply cannot let them out.  The smuggling of these potatoes is a very thriving industry, which we do our best to stop, and if we once allowed <Col N="121" /> any of these potatoes out we would be in a very weak position to deal with smuggling.

      <P>We have no authority to advance money for the purchase of pigs.  There is authority to advance money for the purchase of seeds and manures.  District Councils were empowered to do that, but, as Deputy <Col N="122" /> Hughes explained, his position is that that would be asking too much of the people.  An advance could be made on the security of the rates for purchase of seeds and manures, but they do not want seeds there; they have seeds. There would not be much use in advances or loans for purchasing pigs in that particular area.  I am perfectly convinced that if an advance were made what they would do would be to devote the money to growing more potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>This shows the necessity that was emphasised many years ago by certain reformers&mdash;the necessity for people's banks for agricultural purposes.  These banks would make available advances to meet emergencies of the kind we are considering. Surely, in view of the peril that Deputy Hughes has indicated, which threatens the agricultural industry in the neighbouring counties, it would be possible to have a short emergency Act run through to empower the Ministry of Agriculture to make loans for this purpose, repayable after a certain number of years.  A stipulation could be made prohibiting a continuance of this practice, which the Minister says the former Department of Agriculture notified as injurious.  It is too terrible a thing to think that we can give the answer: &ldquo;There is nothing to be done; we are bound by some legal technicality.  The Minister for Agriculture is entitled to advance money only for seeds, and there his power stops.&rdquo; One reason why we looked for self-government and the provision of such an Institution as this Parliament was that we might be freed from the trammels of red tape and sealing wax, and the shackles of British officialdom, which always gave the same stereotyped answer to grievances of the people of this kind.  It seems to me that we would be as well employed in passing a short Act to empower the Minister to deal with this question as we were in passing an Act for altering the clock.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words in support of the suggestion that local authorities should be empowered to advance money to these people for the purchase of pigs.  The Minister for Agriculture said that, under the existing law, money can be advanced for the purchase of seeds.  That law was passed <Col N="123" /> in response to pressure when there was distress in the West of Ireland, and we have now distress which would entitle us to make a similar law by which money could be advanced for the purchase of pigs.  I think Deputy Hughes said that local people would hesitate to bear an additional burden.  In this case there could not be much of a burden, because they have their potatoes, and the rearing of the pigs would save them from loss, even if it would not ensure a profit. I think local people should properly bear that burden.  It would not be a very large one.</P>
