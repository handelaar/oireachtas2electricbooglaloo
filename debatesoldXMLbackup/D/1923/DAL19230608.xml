      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is aware that an action was instituted in the Republican Courts by Mrs. Ethel Calmenson against Messrs. Gerald Byrne and Co., which action was dismissed by Judge Crowley, and that an appeal against this decision was lodged by the Plaintiff, but in consequence of the abolition of the Courts, the appeal has never been heard; and what provision the Government is making for the hearing of this and other cases which were pending at the time of the abolition of the Republican Courts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he is aware that considerable dissatisfaction exists amongst the farmers by reason of (1) the delay in returning to their owners shot-guns taken by the British authorities in Pre-Truce period; (2) the refusal of the present authorities to give permits for the purchase of shot-guns; further, whether the Minister is aware that owing to the destruction caused by ground game and wild birds the prospects of the growing crops are seriously endangered, and to ask if he will state <Col N="1652" /> definitely the position as regards these guns and arrange for their distribution under whatever regulations he may deem necessary.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a large number of applications for the return to their owners of shot-guns taken by the British authorities in the Pre-Truce period, and also that a large number of applications has been made for permits for the purchase of shot-guns.  Having regard to the condition of affairs in the country, the Government, acting on the advice of the Army Council, have not considered it desirable to return the arms taken by the British or to permit the purchase of shot-guns up to the present.  The preparation of regulations governing the control of firearms generally is now under consideration and it is hoped that they can be published at an early date. By the time these regulations are issued it is considered that general conditions in the country will warrant the return of arms taken by the British and the issue of permits to approved persons for the purchase of shot-guns.</P>

      <P>asked the Ministry for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that large numbers of railworkers employed by the Great Southern and Western Railway have not been refunded the contributions to the Unemployment Fund to which they are entitled under the exemption order paragraph <i>(d)</i> Part 2, first schedule Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and amendment in second schedule of the 1921 Act, and whether he will take steps to have these moneys immediately refunded.</P>

      <P>Claims amounting to <Col N="1653" /> £5,089 7s. 7d. were received from the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway Co. for refunds in respect of the joint contributions of employers and workpeople under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  The claims were in respect of approximately 5,000 workers employed in the Permanent Way Department, the Locomotive Department, Traffic Department, General Stores Department, Gatekeepers, female clerks and office messengers. Considerable difficulty is being experienced in handling these claims inasmuch as very incomplete information was furnished by the railway company. In a large number of cases the unemployment books were not returned with the claim, whilst in other cases insufficient information was given to enable the Ministry to identify the contributors.  The claim was originally in the hands of the British Ministry at the Claims and Records Office, Kew, and when taken over by this Ministry on the 1st April last, a preliminary examination only had been made.  The following payments have, however, been effected:&mdash;</P>
      <P>£1,271 2s. 1d. in respect of workers employed in the Permanent Way Department was paid to the Great Southern and Western Railway on the 23rd April, 1923, in less than a month after the Ministry had taken over the matter; £873 18s. 1d. in respect of the Locomotive Department on the 12th May.  A further payment of approximately £200 in respect of the Traffic Department will be made in the course of a few days.  Payment of the remaining items will be expedited as much as possible, but, owing to the difficulties already stated, some time must elapse before final payment can be made.</P>
      <P>I should add that in many cases the railway companies have been unable to furnish the unemployment books, because they had been destroyed in the burning of the country stations, and that the campaign against the railways has necessarily impeded the company in furnishing the particulars required.</P>

      <P>The proposals in the Bill are such that to mark a protest against such Clauses as 6 and 7, it will be necessary to vote against the Bill on the Final Stage.  I do not intend to repeat the arguments that were used against the Clause laying upon employers the duty of collecting Income Tax from their servants, or repeat the fear that such a provision is very likely to be a precedent for an extension of this system of asking employers to deduct from their employees, debts, whether public or private.  It will also be necessary for us to vote against Clause 7, which puts into the power of the Collector of Income Tax the right to seize goods in circumstances which even for the period to which it is now confined, is not justifiable; and, further, notwithstanding <Col N="1657" /> the difficulties of the Government, the provisions of the Bill impose upon the country an unfair distribution of the burden, inasmuch as the necessities are overtaxed in comparison with <Col N="1658" /> luxuries.  On these grounds I intend to vote against the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now on the main question of the Army Estimate, and I desire to offer a few observations, not in the sense of any carping criticism of either the Minister himself, from whom I have personally received courtesies for which I am not ungrateful, or of the staff of the Department, which I fancy is very much overworked, but we are all, in a sense, beginners here, and it is desirable that we should start well.  If there are mistakes in our early efforts anybody who believes that there are mistakes should point them out in order that, if possible, they may be corrected for future occasions.  I desire with all diffidence to suggest that the form in which this Estimate is presented is unsatisfactory, from the point of view of Deputies whose duty it is to examine and criticise expenditure, and I think also that the Estimate does less <Col N="1659" /> than justice to the Ministry itself, as I shall endeavour to point out.  We are told in a note that the Army is in a state of re-organisation and it is not possible to give details.  Let it be understood that I do not suggest that details with regard to Army organisation should be given.  I think at present it would be unreasonable to expect the Minister to give details of, say, the number of battalions or the battalion strength, or the number of Major-Generals or any other rank employed in the Army, because the Army at the moment is on a war footing and has been ever since the present Government took it over.  I think they can scarcely be expected at present to have any clear opinion as to what would be a reasonable Army on a peace footing. I am not criticising that portion of the Estimate at all, but what I do say is that the civil establishment in what in other countries is known as the War Office, and what is here known as the Ministry of Defence, ought to be set out in the Estimate with considerably more detail than we have presented here.  If you turn to the Estimate of any other Ministry you find that all the staffs from typists down to charwomen are set out. I suggest we ought to have information as to the civil establishment of the Ministry of Defence for this purpose, if for no other.  In Great Britain, at the close of the war, what brought down the Government, as far as I can form an opinion, judging from the newspapers, was that those civil establishments, which had been enormously inflated in personnel during the war, were not reduced sufficiently fast or to a sufficient extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we all hope and trust that the next Estimates presented to this Dáil will be presented in a time of peace.  How will the Dáil be able to contrast the Civil Establishment of that day with the Civil Establishment of war time for the purpose of estimating whether a sufficient reduction in fact was made, unless we are told what the Civil Establishment in war time was?  I feel great difficulty in suggesting that an already overworked department should have more labour put upon it for the purpose of compiling these statistics, but I do not think it would have been a great additional labour, and I do think that they might have been given.  I said a moment ago that I <Col N="1660" /> thought the form of these Estimates did not do justice to the Ministry itself.  The reason why I said that is, that I am convinced in my own mind, not knowing anything of the facts, but believing it, that what the Ministry has done is, it has been trying to carry on in war time with an establishment it considered sufficient in peace time.  A great deal of the questions with which we are familiar, as to why dependants' allowances have not been paid and why claims have not been settled, are due to the fact that the Minister may tell us that all the money for which he is asking is money that is being spent on the war, that he has himself refused to inflate his civil staff to the extent to enable him to deal with these matters. I do not know if that is true or not, but I rather suspect it.  If so, it was highly creditable to the Ministry, but surely a mere statement on the face of these Estimates would silence a great deal of the criticism that has been going on.  If it should turn out that the staff set out in the Estimates was such a staff as we would consider adequate in peace time surely that would silence all the people who wanted to know why their claims were not dealt with, why their compensation had not been paid, and why it takes, as we have heard over and over again, a considerable time, in many cases, to get answers to inquiries.  Now, as I have said, the last thing I desire to do is to pick holes in the Estimate for the sake of picking holes.  I am not doing it, but I do venture, with all diffidence, to criticise the form in which this Estimate has been presented, on the grounds that I have said.  It ought to have been quite possible to have given the number of the Civil Establishment, and notes could have been appended to them, as notes have been appended in other Estimates, presented by other Ministries, that there were so many temporary clerks lent to this Ministry if it were a case that temporary clerks were lent.</P>
    <P>I do not move any reduction of the Estimate.  I throw out these observations in the hope that the form adopted in the present Estimate will not be continued, even if it should be the ill-fortune of the country to find that the Estimate presented for the next Financial Year was in the unhappy circumstances that are prevailing to-day.  I do not think that the state of war is a justification for <Col N="1661" /> omitting the information to which I feel the Dáil is justly entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. R. WILSON Mr. R. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have refrained from speaking on the motion for the reduction of this Vote by £3,000,000, because I consider such a reduction would be out of all reason.  I must confess that a good deal of the criticism which has been given on this Estimate has been by reason of the fact that no opportunities have been given to enable Deputies to judge whether these items are right, whether they are excessive, or whether they should be here at all.  For example, under the heading of F we have &ldquo;Medicine and Instruments for Veterinary Expenses, £22,000,&rdquo; and forage, which, I take it, is used for the horses, cost £40,000.  It seems very extraordinary that it costs only £40,000 for food, and the cost of veterinary medicine is £22,000.  It would lead one to imagine that we are feeding the horses on medicine. I daresay the Minister for Defence has a good explanation for that, but he should have set that out, and not make us believe that he was giving Beecham's Pills to the horses.  A great deal of dissatisfaction exists in the country in connection with the Army contracts.  It is contended that in certain areas, under the British regime, certain local people had the opportunity of tendering for supplies for the Army, and now nearly all those contracts are dealt with at Headquarters, with the result that the people in the country have certainly the grievance that they are not allowed, under their own Government, to tender by competition, and to get an opportunity of making a living out of the money spent in the country.  That arises in several places, and in connection with the supply of meat in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bought openly in the market, I am told, but at the same time it is delivered to Gormanstown by six men in a lorry.  I do not believe that the cost of that delivery is placed against that meat, and, therefore, it is not a fair proposition to expect a man, say in Gormanstown, to deliver meat into Gormanstown Barracks at the same price as it is taken at the Dublin markets.  That is only one instance of the dissatisfaction that exists over the way these contracts have been dealt with.  These items were dealt with yesterday from A to Z. and I am going to attack double Z.  We have here &ldquo;Appropriation <Col N="1662" /> in Aid, £15,000.&rdquo;  I expect that will be something like military stores.  Perhaps the Minister for Defence will tell us what that is.  All those remarks are due to the fact that we have no information that should have been given to us here, and while we regret that £10,664,000 is spent on the Army, still if we are satisfied that money is necessary I am not going to stand here and refuse it.  At the same time I do not like to be asked to vote for money when I do not know what it is for, and that it is properly spent.  Now, we have &ldquo;Vessels, £249,500.&rdquo;  These may be war vessels or submarines, I do not know what they are, but my friend, Deputy Gorey, says all these things are correct.  As I pointed out, I do not know how he could say Vote F is correct, Medicines, £22,000 and then forage, £40,000.  I cannot understand that Vote, and, perhaps, the Minister will explain it.  We realise that the Army has put this country right, and we have nothing to say to the Army, but everything in its favour.  We think that the Army Accounting Department is not acting fairly with the public, and we think they should see that their debts are paid promptly.  I, myself, know several cases where men had been out of money for a year.  I drew attention to this before on the Finance Bill.  It is really giving the Government a bad name in the country, because of this want of accuracy or accounting, by reason of their not paying people who have given services, and are kept out of their money for a year.  I certainly know one such case.  I hope the Minister for Defence will speed up these payments, and though he referred me to the Minister for Finance, I really think, as he contracted the debts, it is his business to see that they should be paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to move the reduction of the amount of this Estimate under Head A by £100, in order to call attention to <Col N="1663" /> some matters in connection with payments. A few days ago the Minister gave me a certain answer with regard to the wages of certain of the clerical staffs employed under the Army.  Now, in spite of the replies that he gave on that occasion, there is a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst certain clerks employed in various Departments under the Army.  I am not going to suggest that any difficulties there may be in the administration of certain Departments are altogether due to this discontent, but I would remind the Minister that if he has got a contented staff he will get much better service in the long run from that staff than he would get from one discontented.  I want to draw his attention also to a grieveance from another quarter.  I refer to certain Military Policemen.  I an informed that the rate of pay in this service at the beginning was £3 15s. 0d. per week, with maintenance.  It is suggested that recently a number of soldiers have been transferred from ordinary military service to military police service, and they are only getting £1 18s. 6d. per week, and though they are getting maintenance allowance they are getting no dependents allowance.  I have no personal knowledge of this particular thing, but numbers of these people have come to me with complaints.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some explanation of this.  With reference to the clerks, to whom I referred, I find that they belong to two or three departments. I also find that there are complaints even amongst the attested clerks in the Railway Protection Corps in the Griffith Barracks.  They complain that they have not been paid the efficiency pay which the Minister mentioned.  I think it amounts to 2s. or 3s. per day according to duties. They claim that they are entitled to this pay under what they call a financial instruction, that the money has been due, to some of them at all events, for a considerable time past, and that it is still outstanding.</P>
    <P>A rather more serious question arises when I come to the position of other clerks.  I have in my hand here a document which was drawn up on behalf of a number of attested clerks under a certain department in the Army administration. It is a complaint and a request for better treatment in respect to payments.  I suppose <Col N="1664" /> the ordinary, normal way would have been for this document to pass through the hands of whatever officer was incharge of these particular clerks, and through that way to the officer concerned at the head.  But the officer concerned, I understand, refused to send the document forward, and the ground of his refusal, it is suggested, is that the language is a bit strong and vehement.  As a matter of fact it is not.  There is not what you might even call a cross word in the whole document.  There is certainly nothing that might not ordinarily be passed through.  It was quite a legitimate grievance that these men wished to get remedied in what, I think, was quite a legitimate way.  If that is not the way they are to get grievances remedied perhaps the Minister will inform us what is the legitimate way.  If these people had got their grievance remedied privately, and had had their document forwarded there would have been no occasion for them to come to public representatives, and for these representatives to go a little bit out of their way to call attention to these things in public.  But if no other method can be adopted for doing these things, then the sooner they are brought up in public and threshed out and finished with the better.  The grievance of these men is that some time ago there was withdrawn from them an outdoor allowance of 28s. a week.  They say that on entering the service many members were not asked to attest at the beginning. They were in receipt of a flat rate of £3 per week minimum, together with dinner and tea inside the barracks.  Last January these meals in barracks were discontinued. Most of the staff were then called upon to attest.  They did attest, and they were placed on the ordinary rate of soldier's pay, namely, £2 12s. 6d. weekly, living outdoor.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that, from the Army point of view, it was a wise thing for the Army to call upon certain civilian employees to attest, because the state of affairs, I think, was such at certain periods that it was up to the Army to see that they had pretty well military control over those who were working for them, and that they could deal with them in the proper way.  But if there was not exactly ordinary compulsion, there was a kind of economic compulsion about this attesting.  These men, as they say, were docked in the wages <Col N="1665" /> they had been originally getting when they attested.  In February proficiency pay was granted of 2s. per day, and this brought their wages up to £3 6s. 6d. per week.  They claim, legitimately enough I think, that that wage was not at all an extravagant wage for fairly responsible work.  There probably are Deputies who will think that it is an extravagant wage, that as a matter of fact anything is good enough for a clerk or a workman, anything running from 25s. to 35s. a week.  That is not the general opinion, I am glad to say, of the people throughout Ireland, and I do not think it is the general opinion of the Dáil. Without any demur at all, when times were hard, when there was big pressure, these men willingly&mdash;many of them, perhaps, with a certain amount of enthusiasm&mdash;worked much longer hours than the normal working day.  They did not make any particular grievance of that.  I do not think they make any particular grievance of it now, although they were assured at the time that their services in that connection would not be forgotten. These services, however, do seem to have been forgotten, because their grievances in other respects are not now being attended to.  They point out, and I think they point out with a great deal of justice and truth, &ldquo;that the present efficiency of the branch is due in no small measure to the unselfish loyalty and cooperation of the staff in difficult times. The relations between the staff and officers here up to the present have been of the most harmonious nature.  It is our earnest desire that this state of harmony may long continue, but, on the other hand, we claim that the conditions should be made at least tolerable.&rdquo;  There was nothing provocative in that statement, and that is one of the main statements in the document which they say this officer refused to send to Headquarters. They claim that their claim is justified by the Army Regulations themselves; that they are entitled to the pay of their rank, to proficiency pay, where the same is certified by the officer in command, to dependants' allowance where dependence is established, and in addition they claim to be entitled either to clothes and decent accommodation and maintenance in barracks or some equivalent.</P>
    <P>I understand they are not working in uniform, and that they have to purchase <Col N="1666" /> their own clothes.  They get no equivalent for doing so, whereas if they were ordinary serving soldiers they certainly would not be mulcted in the matter of clothes.  Single and married men with dependants, they say, are only entitled to £1 18s. 6d. under the new scale, plus dependants' allowance.  Some of the single men have dependants in the country. They themselves have to live in the City of Dublin, outside barracks, on £1 18s. 6d. per week.  I suggest that some of the Deputies should try to do that at the present moment in Dublin, and see how comfortable they would be and at the same time send something along home to whoever is dependent on them.  Some of the single men are getting only partial allowance, 7s., 14s., or 21s. per week, while the full allowance of 28s. is deducted. Clothes, boots and underclothing have to be provided at the expense of these men themselves.  Single men with dependants are granted outdoor allowances under the new scale of 14s., but they say that they would not like to offer their landladies outside 14s. weekly for their keep, and I do not think they would.  Certainly the language of the landladies would be much more lurid than any of the language complained of in this petition if such an offer was made. These men say that, compared with the ordinary soldier, they are anything but well off.  He gets his 24s. 6d., his clothes, accommodation and maintenance in barracks, and in addition dependants' allowance. On the other hand, these men have to buy all these things.  If they live some distance away from the barracks in which they work they will have to pay at least two or three shillings a week in tram fares and things like that. If all this is deducted from the little they get you will find that they have not got very much money at the end of the week. In addition they complain of their meal hours.  They used to get one and a half hours for dinner, but the time is now cut down to one hour.  As some of them live or lodge on the North side of the city, they find one hour gives them very little time within which to get to their lodgings and back again to the barrack. On the amount of money they are getting they cannot very well drop into a restaurant in the city, because restaurant prices would very soon eat up the little money they have left.  I do not think I need say any more on that, as I have <Col N="1667" /> pointed out pretty well the complaints of these men and the complaints of the men in Griffith Barracks on the Railway Maintenance Corps.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give attention to these grievances, and that he will lay down fairly the mode of procedure under which these men, or men similarly circumstanced in the Army, should proceed in order to remedy their grievances.  If one were anxious to make a party affair out of this matter I would say that it would be much better from the point of view of those on these Benches that these grievances should continue without being remedied.  An amount of discontent in the Forces at the present moment would perhaps be acceptable to certain elements up and down the country.  We do not desire that.  We desire that men who are doing a fair day's work should get a fair day's pay, and that their grievances should be remedied.  There should be no standing on the part of an officer on his rather higher dignity, so that those under him could respectfully and without any abusive language approach him to have their grievances remedied, and he should facilitate them in the legitimate remedying of their grievances.  I beg to move the reduction of the Vote under sub-head &ldquo;A&rdquo; by £100.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a few questions, and before doing so I should like to associate myself with those who had something complimentary to say with regard to the conduct of the Army.  My experience is not very great, but I must say that in anything I had to do with the Army they have been extremely civil and courteous.  I have been searched and my motor car has been searched on various occasions, and I must say that it has always been done in a most courteous manner.  I agree and endorse what Deputy Johnson said last evening, that the Army must not think itself above criticism, and that it must recognise this Assembly is at its head. Deputy Johnson got very warm on this subject, and I am quite sure that the Commander-in-Chief would be the very last person in this Assembly to say that the Army was either above criticism or thought itself superior to this Assembly. So much for that point.  I have also a little grumble to make with regard to the meagre character of the particulars <Col N="1668" /> in this Estimate.

      <P>I think perhaps it may be advantageous to follow Deputy O'Shannon's complaint in regard to the clerical staffs by adding something to the testimony he has given of the method of dealing with the pay of attested men. Deputy O'Shannon has not touched upon it, but it is important, and even of the greatest importance, that we should know exactly where we stand, and that the men in the Army should know where they stand, in regard to pay.  They were attested, and certain rates of pay were announced at the time.  I think I am right in saying that they were even set out upon the form of attestation. That, one would naturally think, would be equivalent to a contract.  It may not be so in law, and it may not be the intention of the Ministry here to follow the practice of the British Government and its Army.  But it does add to the strength of the criticism when we can quote from the Manual of the British Military Law a sentence like this, which is used by so great an authority as Professor Dicey when dealing with Constitutional Law:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The enlistment of the soldier is a species of contract between the State and the soldier, and in the ordinary principle of law cannot be altered without the consent of both parties.  The result is that the conditions laid down in the Act under which a man was enlisted cannot be varied without his consent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shannon pointed out that in the case of the clerical staff members were attested on a certain rate of pay: <Col N="1669" /> 24s. 6d. ordinary private's pay; 28s., or 4s. per day, in lieu of board when living out, and certain proficiency pay to be added.  The information adduced to the Dáil shows that, without notice or without any question of assent or consent, part of this pay was reduced.  Now, the point is, that is only one instance of several instances of a similar kind.  I have, for instance, information from Claremorris that men who joined the Works Company of the Army attested at the rate of 3s. 6d. per day and 3s. per day grade pay.  They were skilled painters.  They were reduced 1s. per day, apparently without any question; it was simply a matter for the officer in command to say &ldquo;This week we shall only pay you so and so,&rdquo; quite irrespective of the contract which they entered into.  Skilled tradesmen at Islandbridge Armoury Department were in receipt of living-out allowance, which was reduced by 50 per cent. without notice, without any question of consent, and when they made representation with a view to appealing to a higher authority they were all treated as though they were mutineers for protesting against this breach of contract and for endeavouring to get that breach remedied.  That question came to my notice, and I asked the Minister for Defence a question in Parliament upon the matter, and I received an answer, and the men were paraded to find out who was responsible for conveying the information to me.  Now, that is not very satisfactory&mdash;very much the contrary&mdash;and I think some assurance should be given to the Dáil that at least men have the right to make representation to someone, especially when they go through the usual process, as those did who were quoted by Deputy O'Shannon, in endeavouring to approach their superior officers&mdash;the officers in charge of the Department.  The question I would like to have answered more particularly is as to who is the authority for varying the rates of pay.  Can they be varied on the motion of any officer in command of a district, or even the Army Council, without reference to the Government or to the Dáil?  I take it that we are responsible for the treatment of soldiers and for the treatment of men who joined the Army in one capacity or another, and for at least honouring the promises that were made in the name of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue the case of men <Col N="1670" /> in the Army, the attested men, as though they were in exactly the same relationship to the State as a workman is to an employer who is engaged in the ordinary commercial industries.  I do not think the relationship is the same, but it is all the more incumbent upon the employer, in this instance the State, to act honourably and fairly with those whom it has taken into its service, and those whom it has called upon to sink their individuality and to sink their personal aims and desires even to the point of losing their lives at the call of the State. If there was need for a revision, that surely was a matter that should have been discussed, and such a revision and docking of pay ought not to have taken place without the consent of the Dáil, acting for the State in this matter, and certainly not without a proper understanding between the men concerned, who should be demobilised and relieved from their attestation oath or promise before any change in the relationship took place.  I was tempted, before Deputy O'Shannon raised the matter, to read for the benefit of the Dáil the full memorial which was the cause of so much dissatisfaction and discontent in the Pay Department.  I have had a copy of it, and it is as respectful and decently-worded a statement as could possibly come from any body of men.  I challenge anybody to read it and say that it calls for a rebuke of any kind whatever.  Apart from the immediate claims of the men for a pay which will ensure them a livelihood, as Deputy O'Shannon has pointed out, in the case of the clerical staffs they cannot live out decently and do the work that is required, and they ought not to be asked to leave themselves wholly at the service of the Army on the pay of 38s. 6d. per week living out; but, apart from the merits of the case and of the amount of pay, I want the Minister to tell the Dáil what, in his view, is the position of the Army authorities in respect of the men under them when they consider it necessary to make some change in the rate of pay, and whether the fact of attestation relieves the authorities from any responsibility in regard to the maintenance of the rate of pay under which the men were enlisted.  I would ask the Minister to give us some assurances that will be satisfactory, so that this position should be made clear, <Col N="1671" /> and that the grievances the men complain of shall be remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question as to the Army authorities making changes in the rates of pay in respect of men already attested on certain rates, the Army authorities did not make in any way any changes affecting such men.  On the whole question of the civil staffs, the civil staffs employed at any time during the period of the life of the Army have been of about four different classes.  In the first place, you have had some purely civil clerks paid a certain flat rate of wages.  In the case of different clerks the rate of wages might have differed. You have also had soldiers who were taken in in the early days as clerks, and who were paid flat wages rates.  These men would be entitled, in addition to their flat wages rates, to their clothing and general keep and accommodation in the barracks.  You have also had those, and they cover the greater number of soldier-clerks now soldiers, who receive their ordinary rank pay, but who get in addition, provided they are skilled clerical workers up to a certain proficiency, an allowance of 2s. per day.  These men are entitled also to get clothing, food and accommodation in the barracks where it is available.  The fourth class are those men who belong to the third class, but in respect of whom it is not possible, because of limited accommodation in our barracks here, to provide accommodation in barracks. Where the ordinary attested man of that class is not provided with food and accommodation in barracks, he receives a lodging allowance at the rate of 2s. per day, and where he is not provided with food in barracks he receives a ration allowance at the rate of 2s. per day.  In the case of the complaints that certain men were reduced from 28s. to an allowance of 14s., there was a certain amount of abuse in certain cases in which men who, while receiving both lodging allowances and ration allowances, were also getting their meals in the barracks. Ration allowances amounting to 2s. per day were generally stopped in respect of certain sections of clerks.  Where the food in the case of any particular man is not being provided in barracks, steps have already been taken to restore these allowances in the case of such men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> In the case of the complaint raised with regard to the Griffith Barracks, there is possibly in connection with the Griffith Barracks a number of attested men of the second class, who are paid a flat clerical rate.  Where men are paid a flat clerical rate they are not entitled to dependants' allowance.  The flat rate is supposed to cover their ordinary pay and what would be their dependants' allowance.  Generally there is no such thing as the Army authorities taking any particular rate and saying &ldquo;We shall now cut down this rate from such a figure to such a figure.&rdquo;  In the case of tradesmen such as have been taken on in the Claremorris Command, in addition to the ordinary rank pay, men who are attested as soldiers and who are employed as skilled tradesmen get an additional allowance of 3s. per day as skilled tradesmen, and 2s. per day is paid in respect of semi-skilled tradesmen.  It is the responsibility of the officer who is in charge of the Command to state whether, in the case of any particular man, he is to be paid the 3s. rate or the 2s. rate.  This is his responsibility in the matter, but he makes use of the best advice that is available as to what particular rate he shall recommend for any particular man.</P>

      <P>Would their past efficiency count in such a matter as against the opinion of a non-technical man?

      <P>If any man who is taken on as a skilled tradesman and who is paid the semi-skilled rate has any representations to make as to why he should not be paid 3s. instead of 2s. daily allowance he can make representations in the matter, and any reasonable recommendations that would show his qualifications would not certainly be turned down.  With regard to the point as to the submission of memorials, if any soldier or any class of soldiers have any representations to make with regard to any grievances to which they want to draw attention as to the matters of their employment, the way for them to do it is to make individual representations with regard to their particular cases.  The nature of an Army and of Army discipline is <Col N="1673" /> such that it is not correct that a number of soldiers should come together and as a group of soldiers make representations. If representations require to be made, they can come from the individual soldier himself, and if there is a second man who has representations he can make those representations for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on item (B) Dependants' Allowances. Everybody knows that there has been a lot of dissatisfaction with the way in which dependants' allowances have been paid.  I personally have been asked to look after numbers of cases and I must say that when I visited Portobello Barracks in person and saw the officers in charge of either single or married men's dependants' allowance I got very prompt attention and in most cases entire satisfaction.  I would like to call the Minister's attention to one particular case.  There is a woman named Mrs. Sheehan, living in Kanturk. She has two sons in the Army for the past six or eight months.  She made application for dependants' allowance in the usual way, but the dependants' allowance was not granted.  It appears that under a report of Mr. R. Sheehan, Customs and Excise Officer, who investigated the case and visited the woman to make enquiries, there were no allowances granted.  This woman's husband died last February. For two years before his death he was an invalid and was confined to his bed.  At the present time she has a third son who is living at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will try to give you an idea of what <Col N="1674" /> form of report Mr. Sheehan, the Customs and Excise Officer, sent in.  He stated in his report that, after investigation, he ascertained that the son at home, John Sheehan, was receiving a pension of 8s. per week from the British Army, and that he was not employed at any occupation.  That 8s. a week he spent upon himself, and contributed nothing to the support of his mother.  He also stated that he made inquiries about the alleged employer of one of the sons in the Army regarding the statement that he had been paying £2 a week to one of the Army men prior to his enlistment. In the opinion of the Customs and Excise officer, no such sum of money had been paid at all, and his report in the case of both men stated that, in his opinion, these sons never contributed anything to the support of their mother prior to joining the Army, and he would not recommend that any dependants' allowance should be given.  This is rather a peculiar thing, and it struck me that this man must have been very biassed when he made a report such as that.  It is peculiar that in a family where there were three sons, none of whom contributed anything, and where the father was a cripple prior to his death, the whole of the five could manage to rub along somehow.  I think that case requires re-investigation.  A woman who is a widow, and who has a son at home is, on the report of the Customs and Excise Officer, not given anything in respect of the two sons she has in the Army.  She ought at least be entitled to some allowance in respect of those sons. I think also that the statement of the Customs and Excise Officer who delared that, in his opinion, the alleged employer of one of the sons in the Army did not pay the £2 a week that was claimed, ought to be taken with a great deal of doubt and with a very large grain of salt.  I would ask the Minister for Defence to have this case reconsidered, with a view to giving this woman some small amount in order that she will be able to live.  In this case it appears that it is the Customs and Excise Officer into whose hands the investigation of the case was put.  It is his fault that there was no allowance granted.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the question generally, I must say that in many cases that I have <Col N="1675" /> investigated I have received nothing but courtesy from the officers in charge, and even if some allowances had been months in arrear, within a week of my approaching the cases and bringing them under the notice of the authorities, they were settled.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Nagle that from my very limited experience, or the limited number of visits I paid to Portobello, there was nothing but satisfaction given to me in dealing with the people who are directly concerned with the assessment of separation allowances.  I contend it is not a fair thing to expect the Deputies, who in the ordinary course might have more responsible work to do, should have cast upon them the work of going to Portobello in order to see that these allowances are properly dealt with.  Many cases have come to my notice, and unfortunately for many reasons I have not been able to go to Portobello.  I quite agree, if one had time to go there, there is nothing but pleasure to be gained in dealing with the officers directly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one case&mdash;I will not give any name&mdash;that I would like to submit to the Minister for consideration.  Although it may be only one case so far as I am concerned, there may be many other such cases of a similar nature hinging upon the decision of the Minister or the responsible authorities.  It is the case of a woman who has three sons in the Army, two of whom are married and from whom she can receive no direct allowance.  In the other case the son was unemployed for a very long period prior to joining up, and as a result of not being able to give any money to his mother for some time previous to his enlistment she has been prevented from getting any dependant's allowance.  This is a very unfortunate thing, and it is something over which this individual had not any direct control, because he was unable to secure employment, and in consequence he was not in a position to give his mother anything prior to joining up.  The unfortunate thing about this case is that, since representations were made to the authorities at Portobello, the unfortunate young man was killed in an ambush in Co. Kilkenny.  I do not know from the terms of the Bill which the Minister asked leave to introduce the other day <Col N="1676" /> what exactly is the amount which the widowed mother is to receive.  I put it to the Minister that in a case such as that, especially as the man was unemployed because work was not available, and he was consequently unable to contribute to his mother's support, something should be done.  It is an exceptional case to the extent that the unfortunate man has been since killed.  I would ask the Minister to mention if there is any ruling in a matter of that kind.  There may be other cases upon which the Minister would be asked to rule in the same way.  Perhaps he could tell us if anything could be done in the way of an allowance for the widowed mother for the time this son served in the Army prior to being killed.</P>
    <P>On the general question yesterday evening I referred to one or two things which the Minister did not deal with in his reply.  The first is, what is the future policy of the Army Council or the Executive concerning the future of the Railway Protection and Maintenance Corps? I would like to know if the Army authorities have received any assurance from the Railway Companies, from whom that particular Corps has been principally recruited, regarding the reinstatement to their former positions of the particular men, and whether or not their service in the Army will count for promotion and other conditions of service when they re-join their former employment.  I also ask him to give some answer regarding the question of vessels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to bear out what has been said by some of my colleagues respecting this Department, which is one of the most satisfactory Departments attached to Portobello. We find that there is general dissatisfaction with reports sent in by Inspectors down the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say something in that connection.  Some time ago I asked the Minister a question in connection with this matter, and I pointed out that during the European war the Pensions Committees in various areas were allowed to adjudicate on those claims after they were investigated by the Pension Officer, and in that way the people's interests were better looked after.  The Minister denied that such a thing happened, but I think he will find, on investigation, that that was the case. I would like to add my tribute to the Dependants' Claims Department at Portobello.  To my mind too long a period elapses between the date the assessment is made and the time when the cheque is issued.  There is some fault there.  Any time I had occasion to go to Portobello Barracks, I found that the assessments had been made, but the cheques had not been issued, although the intervening period was about five or six weeks.  I will ask the Minister for Defence again to go into the question.</P>

      <P>As pointed out yesterday evening, out of an Army of approximately 50,000 there were 39,204 claims made in respect of dependants' allowances, some married, some single. In all 31,294 claims are being paid. 2,563 claims are under investigation, only approximately 600 being more than of a month's standing.  A total of 5,347 claims were rejected.  In the case of married men there is not any difficulty or delay generally in making the necessary payments.  In the case of unmarried men investigation is necessary. <Col N="1678" /> Dependants' allowance is only paid on the understanding that the soldier contributes one-third of his pay to the support of people at home, and then, on a graduated scale, certain allowances are payable if it is clearly shown, on investigation, that there is dependence or partial dependence.  The machinery that is being used for making investigations throughout the country has been the Customs and Excise machinery, and I feel that these officers have, under very, very difficult circumstances in the country, done excellent work and served the State and this particular Department very well.  We have had to draw the line some place, and we have had to take it as an axiom in dealing with these matters that the family of an unmarried man who joins the Army shall not be in an improved position because of his joining the Army to any greater extent than the pay which he receives as an Army man.  If his contribution to his family before he joined the Army was less than one-third of his Army pay, we do not admit that there is any liability for paying any dependants' allowance to such a family.  We have found it necessary to adopt an attitude that where an unmarried man, for whatever reason, unemployed or otherwise, was not contributing to the support of his family, we could not undertake, on his joining the Army, responsibility for making any payment to him except the ordinary pay of the rank to which he joins.</P>

      <P>I desire to call the Minister's attention to the question of military lands which were formerly held by the British in this country. There must be thousands of acres of such lands up and down Ireland.  I presume that we have taken them over and that the English have no more to do with them.  I should like to know if that presumption is correct.  If we have taken them over, then, surely, there ought to appear somewhere in the Estimates the payments which it is expected will have to be made in the course of the coming year for the upkeep of these lands, for labour employed on them and for the civilians generally whom the Army authorities may employ to supervise these lands.  I do not see any item here under which that could come, because the Minister explained yesterday what miscellaneous expenditure meant. It seems clear, on the assumption that the English no longer control these lands, that that important item has been completely overlooked in the preparation of these accounts.</P>

      <P>Who is responsible for the letting of those lands?  I have a case in mind about which I wrote to the Minister for Defence last Friday.  In Ballincollig, near the Barracks, there are two houses, Oriel Cottage and Oriel Lodge.  The lands of Oriel Cottage and Oriel Lodge were controlled by the British Military.  The houses were burned down by anti-Treaty forces last year.  A man named John Mahony had the grazing of those lands and had two Kerry cows on them.  He supplied families in the village with milk.  About two months ago there was an auction of certain lands in the district, and the land belonging <Col N="1681" /> to Oriel Cottage and Oriel Lodge was reserved for private treaty according to the Auctioneer.  Mahony, who had his two cows on this land, approached the Auctioneer, and asked him would he give him an opportunity of continuing to rent this land.  He stated he would make known his wants to the landlord.  About a week afterwards, having heard no word from him, he again approached the Auctioneer. He was asked how much would he give, and he said he had been paying £3 to the British landlord.  He was asked would he give £5, and he agreed, thinking that the thing would be settled.  He heard nothing until five weeks afterwards, when he was informed that a Mr. MacMullen, of Cork City, had taken over those lands which were lying near Oriel Lodge.  Mahony, as an individual, and nine or ten families to whom he had been supplying milk, considered that it was a great hardship that a well-off man like MacMullen should be able to take those lands without an opportunity being given to the man who had been renting the lands of taking them.  I would like the Minister to make an investigation into the matter, and, if possible, to give Mahony a chance of competing in the open market for the land, instead of allowing it to be given away by private treaty to an individual who is not so badly in need of it as Mr. Mahony.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to press an amendment if you will allow me to speak on this.  I am not finding fault or I am not hypercritical of this Estimate.  In my opinion, the Estimate is a very moderate one indeed for the services required, but I should like to ask the Minister for Defence whether there are any regulations which give a detailed statement of the present Army Medical Service.  Has the Director of Medical Services any authority to make any appointments in the Service?  Does he settle the rank and number of officers required?  How is the rate of pay fixed for this Medical Service?  Who judges the capacity of the men taken into the Corps?  How many men are employed in the Corps?  What are the conditions of service, and the most important question <Col N="1683" /> I would like to ask, does the Minister for Defence or the Executive Council hold out any hope that these appointments in future will be open to competitive examination? because it is most desirable that the Director of Medical Services should not be subjected to pressure, either of political or other nature in making these appointments.</P>
      <P>I understand, at present, that things are in a state of confusion and that it was impossible to organise at once a special Medical Service, but I would like to know whether there is any prospect of men getting into this service through their capacity alone.  I should like, also, to ask whether this £80,000 includes payment to practitioners who were attending to the army through the country.  These are the points that I want information about, because I do not think any of us know anything whatsoever about the position of the Army Medical Service.</P>

      <P>The present Army Medical Service is a service in which all the appointments that have been made are only guaranteed for a period of 12 months.  The number of persons to be employed in the Medical Service and their ranks and pay were all settled by a Pay Commission set up by the Executive Council&mdash;a number of Army Officers, together with a number of members from the Treasury side of the Government.  The Director of Medical Services is the appointment of the Minister and he, in the particular circumstances in which we are, is solely responsible to the Minister for the efficiency of the service, and the appointments, which were all made with Ministerial sanction, were on the recommendation of the Director of Medical Services.  The Service at present consists of 86 lieutenants, 45 other commissioned officers, 15 probationers, 17 dentists and 30 nurses, together with the Headquarters Establishment. I regret that I have not the figures for the Headquarters Establishment by me, but the Estimate makes provision, as well, for the payment of outside medical practitioners who are called in on urgent cases.  What the future of the Medical Service shall be, and what regulations it shall be found most suitable to set up for the filling of appointments are matters that we cannot deal with at present.</P>

      <Col N="1684" /> Last year, in most exceptional circumstances, the Army Council called upon Dr. Maurice Hayes, and one or two associates, to rush together a medical service that would treat the wounded of the army in different parts of the country, and too much cannot be said of the work done by Dr. Hayes and his associates at that time.  Having organised the Service, at the end of the Financial Year past, Dr. Hayes, having done very great service to us in very critical times, went back to his ordinary professional life, and a new Director of Medical Services was appointed.  To some extent the temporary conditions that prevailed last year with regard to the requirements in the Medical Service line still continue, and while these do continue we could not have dealt with these appointments in any other way than the way in which they were dealt with.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head K, Mechanical Transport, the estimate of the amount required is £336,000, an increase over last year of £64,000.  I am of opinion that it would take nearly the full amount of that estimate to pay for compensation for commandeered cars.  I would like the Minister to give me an answer as to when it would be likely that these people from whom cars have been commandeered would be paid.  I am of opinion, as I have visited the department where the Motor Commission is sitting, that there is not a sufficient staff there to deal with the number of claims.  I think you will want at least a dozen men there to deal with the claims, as there are hundreds of claims coming in almost every day.  If the claimants have to wait until two or three men are able to get through all the claims, I am afraid they will have to wait for three or four generations before their claims are met, and I think it is the great-grandchildren of the present applicants who will be receiving compensation.  It is necessary, I think, that the Minister should try and endeavour to do his utmost to expedite the payments under this particular Section.  It would be much better and more economical to my mind if the Minister would secure decent transport for the military.  It will in the first place give more employment, and the more cars that are bought the greater circulation of money.  A great many of the people from whom cars have been commandeered are in the awkward position that though they are in debt to the banks and traders, and that the banks and traders are now threatening to come down on them, the military owe them money.  I am quite sure that in accordance with the Act passed by the Dáil that the Sheriff will have sufficient power to get military aid to seize on the goods of those people, although it is through the seizure of their cars that they owe the money.  Now, with regard to the transport, <Col N="1686" /> I think a limit should be put to the speed of those cars, whether they were commandeered, or are the property of the military.  You want to be on your pins and needles, as they say, to get out of the way when a military car, is coming either in the day or the night. The soldiers in those cars as so delighted with the work that they did for the Nation that they are all singing, to the disturbance of the people who have to work the next day.  I think it is time that this large display of military motors and lorries going through the country should cease.  I do not see any necessity for them at present, and the less you see of them now the more people will appreciate that we have peace, and are trying to get back to the normal state of the country.  I certainly do ask the Minister for Defence to try if possible to prevent such a huge display of military cars through the country.  In the first place, it is destroying roads, and causing more expense on the rates which must be borne by the counties.  It is not like the old Transport Board, that used at least to give 50 per cent. towards the cost of maintenance.  This Army Council have not yet thought of that idea of dealing with the people in this manner.  I urge the Minister for Defence to increase the staff in this motor department, so that these claims should be dealt with properly.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Defence if there is any possibility of expediting the return of motor cars to people from whom they have been commandeered.  There is one particular case I have in my mind at the moment. A car was commandeered from a man in Thurles last July, and this car was the man's only means of livelihood.  About a month or so after it was taken he got into communication with the Ministry about it, and he received a reply to the effect that they were trying to trace the car.  They have been tracing the car since last August, and apparently they have not succeeded in tracing it yet.  The result was that this man had to go and look for other employment, having got no compensation.  This man was idle for months, and that is only one of the many cases.  In connection with the furious driving referred to by Deputy Lyons, we all, I think, recognise that there was a necessity for fast driving at one time, <Col N="1687" /> but I do not think that there is any necessity at the moment.  This fast driving that is taking place through the cities and towns is a danger to the public. I think it was Deputy Professor Magennis who, some day last week, asked the question if anyone had ever seen a military lorry travelling at 50 or 60 miles an hour.  I think we might ask the question has anyone seen it travelling at any other speed than 50 or 60 miles an hour.  I may mention that I was up in Portobello Barracks some time ago, and I saw one of the clerks there had to jump on the bonnet of a car in order to save his life, and he was carried about 50 yards.  That was inside the barrack gates, where there are prominent notices that the speed limit is 4 miles an hour.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that all the cars in the possession of the Army are on record, as to where they were obtained and how; whether they were bought, borrowed or commandeered, or otherwise? It may be necessary at some future time to have a record of the answer we may get to this question.</P>

      <P>I think this question of the speed of motor cars is applicable to every area, and I will ask the Minister to pay special attention to it. I am also in a position to state that there is a lot of joy-riding going on on the part of officers at present, and this ought to be checked.  I can cite a certain occasion in the area I represent when, in the midst of irregular activity&mdash;we got very irregular down there all in a minute&mdash;a driver who brought six or seven officers down to a seaside resort for a dance had to bring his lorry home in the dead of night all alone.  I do not think that should be tolerated in any army.  As to the question of the commandeering of cars, certainly at one period of the hostilities it was a perfect scandal.  If we had the same hustle in dealing with matters of this kind as we have in the driving of cars there would not be much to grumble about.  A little more discretion should be exercised in certain areas as to the cars that are commandeered.  I have had personal experience of cars being commandeered in certain places and from certain firms, the commandeering of which was responsible for men being <Col N="1688" /> thrown idle on the streets.  I am conversant with one particular case, that of the Wexford Corporation motor lorry, which has been commandeered on several occasions, with the result that a dozen men have been thrown idle for two or three days.  On one occasion I drew the attention of the Minister for Defence to the matter, and he told me that the lorry should not be taken again unless it was a matter of grave urgency&mdash;an ambush or something of that kind.  We presented the Minister's letter to officers afterwards, but it was of no avail.  On one particular occasion this lorry was commandeered for the express purpose of taking away empty bottles from a dance which the officers had the night before, and the men had to remain idle during that time.  This is a state of affairs which should not be tolerated.  It is getting the people up against the Government and the Army.  Anybody with any sense respects the Army for what it has done in creating the state of affairs under which we are living now. Nobody has any special desire to criticise the Army as an army, but certainly these little incidents are responsible for making a lot of people anti-Government.</P>

      <P>The Estimate under sub-head <i>(a)</i> makes provision for payment in respect of damage to, commandeering of, and hirage of cars, as well as the replacing of our present cars by cars of a different description.  It has been necessary at particular periods to do a very considerable amount of commandeering. Very few people have any idea of the type of transport machinery that was at our disposal when we were called upon to undertake the task that we were called upon to undertake, and very little knowledge of the type that material was, so that we had to place on the people in different parts of the country who had motor cars the burden of allowing us to have their cars.  That necessity has almost absolutely ceased now, and the commandeering of cars is, I am sure, not going on in any part of the country at the present time.  The Committee which is dealing with the question of compensation and claims in respect of cars have a considerable amount of work of a rather judicial nature thrown on them.  They have had serious difficulty in entertaining in any way some of the claims that have come <Col N="1689" /> up to them.  If the work of the Committee can be expedited by additional clerical staff, that Committee shall not be left without additional clerical staff at its disposal.  The work is not, to any very large extent, work that extra clerical staff can help at, but whatever is required to expedite the work of that Committee nothing will be left undone to have its work expedited, because we all realise that the sooner claims of this particular type are dealt with the more economic the dealing with these claims will be.  We are in a position to know where all the cars in our possession came from.  We might have some difficulty in deciding whether any particular car, which was not an Army car, was a commandeered or a captured car, because we have a very large number of cars that we have taken from the Irregulars. Everything has been done to return cars that were held from the public, and any cars that we have from the public we are prepared to return immediately if particulars are given to us of those cars and if we can find those cars in a serviceable condition.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of speed, anything that can be done to stop nuisances of any kind on the part of our cars will be done.  A lot has already been done. I cannot help feeling that where two Army cars out of 100 are seen travelling at an excessive speed, that the whole 100 cars get the blame for what the two cars do.</P>

      <P>Would it be competent for a Deputy to raise a question of contracts upon Vote L, and those immediately succeeding without incurring the charge of ingenuity&mdash;that is Vote L dealing with provisions, Vote M petrol, and Vote N clothing?  I take it this would be the proper time to ask for a little information as to contracts. I make no apology for referring to the question of contracts, because those of us who have followed events in England for the past twenty years know that war time is a very favourite time for a most undesirable section of the community to try to make illicit profits out of the disturbed state of affairs by praying upon the want of business experience in the Army.  Therefore with the examples which we have before us in recent history it is very essential that very special care should be taken to <Col N="1690" /> avoid any such thing there, and I should like information as to what has been done in that matter.  I know that there have been cases where apparently the lowest tender and best tender has not been accepted.  I do not know how far that is general.  I know one case&mdash;I am told, though I cannot personally vouch for it, that it is not an isolated case&mdash; where A and B and others tendered, where A's tender was a good deal the lowest, and where B succeeded in getting the contract, but not being in a position to carry out the tender he went to A and besought him to deliver to him, B, at his Army tender price, the things which A had not been allowed to get the contract for.  I can give the Minister particulars of that case.  I am aware that a Contracts Committee was formed by the Government to deal with Army and other contracts, and I invite the Minister to inform the Dáil how the position of Army contracts stands in relation to that Committee; to what extent that Contracts Committee in fact has control of Army contracts?  For instance, is it true that the Army authorities, who objected to civilian interference in these matters, have sometimes been too quick for the Contracts Committee, told them there was too great pressure of time, that they could not be consulted, and that the Army would take things into its own hands?  It is certainly true, and I make the Minister a present of the information, if he does not know it, that a certain type of contractor has proved too quick for some of the Army authorities.  What has happened in some cases has been this&mdash;I am not now speaking of goods supplied after tender&mdash;goods supplied in large quantities for which bills were sent in afterwards have been charged for, as you would expect, at a good deal more than their proper price.  Some of the gentlemen concerned discovered at an early period that the military authorities being aware of the fact that they were being overcharged made a habit of taking off so much from these demands for payment. The consequence is that at a very early stage in the war some of these profiteering gentlemen, in sending in their accounts for goods supplied, took good care to add on to the amount of their account an amount which they had reason to anticipate <Col N="1691" /> would be taken off by the authorities. Anybody who knows what is liable to happen in contracts of that kind would know how very necessary it is to have proper supervision, and any information the Minister can give us to satisfy the Dáil that every possible care is taken against gentlemen attempting to prey on the community by getting contracts out of the Army by devious means will be welcomed.  This particular type of vulture exists in every country where there is a war, and I am sure the Minister himself will realise that the utmost control is necessary.  If there is a Contracts Committee in existence one would like to know what its duties and powers are, and would like to know if this control is a very real one?</P>

On the question that has been raised about contracts, I take it that we are now dealing with these three or four subheads on the Vote.  I would like to have a statement made on behalf of the Army Supplies Department, if there is such a body, or on behalf of the Contracts Committee as to the general position touching purchases.  We have heard occasionally of the establishment of a Contracts Committee, and I desire to reiterate the question that Deputy Gavan Duffy has raised as to whether we can take it as a matter of certainty that now, at any rate, all contracts for the Army are made by the Contracts Committee. I would also like to know whether tenders <Col N="1692" /> are in all cases sought for, and what is the position of firms that have been place on the Contracts list.  Is there any assurance given to such firms that they will get a share of orders, or what is the requirement of such firms after they have been placed on the Contracts list?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire particularly to have some information in regard to the supplies of uniform and clothing, of which I understand a large contract was given to Schneider of London two or three months ago; as to the circumstances under which 50,000 suits were ordered, and whether the delivery of such suits has been up to time.  Further, whether the delivery of such suits is at such a rate as could be met by even the smaller clothing manufacturers in Ireland. I think it is due to the country generally to have some detailed information as to whether it is good or not for the reputation of the contractors.  I think it is well that the facts in regard to the contract for 50,000 suits going to London should be made known.  I understand that orders for a large quantity have since been secured in Ireland, but one wonders what is the difference which prevailed on the Contracts Committee or the Army Authorities or whoever was responsible for giving this order away. One would also like some information as to whether contracts for clothing and contracts for materials generally are given to manufacturers or to traders of established reputation in the business, or whether any person who is able to send in a tender is treated on an equality with people of established reputation in the business?  There are ugly rumours abroad respecting the way in which certain people have been able to leap suddenly into fame as contractors for supplies, people who were not in the business of contracting, and who were not in the business of supplying anything like the class of material for which they were contracting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears, for instance, of a particular expert in his own business.  I will give him credit for being an expert in his own business, but I do not know whether he is an expert in other matters or not. <Col N="1693" /> He was a dentist and he found himself in the position to be able to undercut people of established reputation, whether as traders or manufacturers, in the boot trade.  That is only one instance.  Now one would like to have positive assurance that such stories, which are quite well authenticated, are no longer true.  Whatever may have been the reason or excuse for such practice in the past, it ought to be no longer possible for any repetition of such practice to occur.</P>
    <P>The President has told us many times that it is bad policy, and not consonant with public policy, to make a bald statement that certain definite preferences would be given for Irish manufactures. We recognise it is undesirable to allow Irish manufacturers to hide incompetence behind a preference.  What one would like to feel sure about is that there is no chance of other influences being brought to bear upon persons who are finally responsible for giving away orders, whether contract orders or otherwise. One would like to feel assured that the Contracts' Department, which is presumably impersonal, has a definite grip and control of the giving away of contracts, and that they will assure themselves when new people come into the field, who by virtue of their newness are only capable of tendering effectively by some underhand methods, I think that at least should be the assumption&mdash;a quite reasonable assumption&mdash;and that any such tenders should be looked at very, very carefully with a microscope, and that all the surrounding of such tenders should be examined before the orders are given.  I think it would be well for the Dáil that we should have a full statement indicating all the methods of giving out contracts, and showing what the present practices are, and showing what the general understanding is as between the Headquarters, the Quartermaster General's Department, and the various local authorities and Contracts Committee. The fuller the information that is given to the country upon such a matter as this is the fewer suspicions there will be and the better feeling generally, and greater confidence will be available for the support of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the desire that has been expressed that the Minister for Defence should make a very full statement with <Col N="1694" /> regard to this very important question of contracts, and it is necessary that he should do so in the interests of the Department over which he has charge, and it is all the more necessary because it is exceedingly difficult for people who desire to assist him by bringing rumours to the surface, and having them properly exposed, furnished with the facts that are essential.  I give a case exactly of what I mean.  I know a particular person, a friend of my own, a contractor whose word I have every reason to believe, and he said he was tendering for a certain contract.  The contract was placed elsewhere, and when he went to see an officer at Portobello a certain suggestion was made to this man with which he was not able to comply.  He left the barrack, and did not get the contract.  I immediately asked him to furnish his name, and the full particulars of the case, and that I would at once take the matter to the Minister for Defence who would investigate it, and be able to deal with it; that it would not only be to the assistance of the service in general, but that I was perfectly certain that the Minister for Defence would regard it as assistance to himself if a matter like that could be put down on record, and that he had some facts to proceed upon.  What was the answer I received?  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;If I were to do so, I would become a marked man, and would have no future chance.  No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will let the whole thing go by.&rdquo;  Now, I had no reason to doubt that man's word, but it only exhibits the difficulty there is to get rumours, which are current, into such a form that the Minister himself can examine them and deal with the matter in the way in which I am perfectly sure he desires it should be dealt with.  The more necessary, therefore, it is for the credit of the Army and for the credit of the country&mdash;the two being involved together &mdash;that the matter should be dealt with by the Minister for Defence in a statement to this Dáil which will show perfectly clearly that all contracts disposed of by the Army are disposed of by them in such a way and under such a system that rumours of this kind that have been current will have no future currency.  It is, after all, a question of system.  But no system that any Army or Government has ever invented has managed to protect itself entirely from rumours of this kind.  Deputy Johnson referred to <Col N="1695" /> the Scheider contract; other Deputies know all that was said in regard to that contract, and I think the Minister for Defence would be doing a service if he dealt with all the facts in respect of that contract just as fully as he has them. If he would say, for example, if it is or is not, a fact as represented to me, and I state it here as having come to my ears in that fashion, that when the Contracts Committee of the Executive Council desired to deal with that matter, it found the matter was already dealt with by the Army for the reasons stated by Deputy Johnson, and that finally some part of that contract was taken away from the contractor to whom the contract was given, and the matter is dealt with in some other way.  It must be perfectly clear to the Minister for Defence that previous speakers and I myself disavow all intention of raising these matters in a spirit of hostility or enmity. It is a matter that, if one may be suffered to say so, personally knowing the Minister for Defence, I know that he would do all in his power to get this thing put in such a way that credit would redound to the Army and to the country in the disposal of these contracts.  That hardly requires, I think, to be stated in this Dáil.  And anything that is said here by myself and by those who have spoken, I am perfectly sure is said in a full and perfect recognition of that fact. But there have been ugly rumours, there has been a certain amount of disquiet, and I urge the Minister for that reason to make a statement convincing this Dáil that all contracts will be handled by one Department&mdash;the Committee set up by the Executive Council&mdash;and that the method will be such that the officers actually requiring the goods will not be enabled in any way to come into contact with the contractors who are asked to tender for the goods.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Figgis has any reason for doubting the word of the man who came to him and told him that he was approached by an Officer in Portobello barracks in connection with a contract, that he was asked to do something which his conscience suggested to him he should not do.  I take it the suggestion is that the officer asked this would-be contractor to bribe him if he was to get the contract; and if the contractor came to the Deputy and said that his mouth was sealed about the matter, because he would be a marked man if he spoke about it, I think it is an extraordinary omission to do his public duty by that Deputy, and is not in accordance with what is supposed to be the courage of the Deputy: that he could not come to the Minister and say that such was the case, and give whatever particulars of the case that had come to his knowledge.  A certain limited number of people deal with contracts, with specific contracts, and with the clear statement that had been made it would have been possible to find out who was responsible for it, if anyone were responsible, and it would have helped us if the thing is a fact.  I, personally, see no reason for believing it.  If what I say had been done, it would have given us an opportunity to lay our hands on something that was wrong, and it might have saved Deputy Figgis and those other people who talk over these rumours among themselves, and who worry, apparently, very much among themselves, it would have saved them, perhaps, some worry.  Certain statements were also made by Deputy Gavan Duffy, but Deputy Gavan Duffy has never made any suggestion to me, as a responsible Deputy, that there was anything at all wrong, in any way, with the Contract Department.  It would be much more useful to me to have, from time to time, any information that came his way; it would be much more useful to have that information than to have statements broadcasted here from the Dáil to the <Col N="1697" /> effect that the whole Army Contract System was rotten, and that every Tom, Dick and Harry had his pull out of the public funds from the Army, because the people who are responsible for Army administration were simply a pack of thicks and fools, and did not know how business should be conducted.</P>

      <P>The only interpretation I could put on the Deputy's statement was that the public purse was being robbed through the Army Contracts Department by the incompetence, or otherwise of those connected with it. We faced, in the most efficient way, whatever difficulties came to us.  In extraordinary circumstances, we had to provide an Army with its clothing, food, shelter and equipment.  We naturally had the experience of having to buy, and very early in the days of that experience the Army Authorities suggested to the Government a broad principle in regard to Government contracts: that was, that there should be a Government Department as detached from other Departments generally as, say, the Treasury is, which would deal with all questions of contracts, all questions of fairly large contracts at any rate.  That Department would know thoroughly the resources of the country, the business organisations of the country, and the directions in which the Government, in providing itself with material or otherwise, could get the best possible value.  The Army Authorities made that suggestion to the Government.  That indicates the lines upon which the Army Authorities were trying to work, and the result of that suggestion was that the present Contracts Committee of the Government came into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Contracts Commtitee of <Col N="1698" /> the Government, with that idea, is working to absolute perfection, and with that idea tackled in the most systematic way that the Government, in its present difficulties and circumstances, could tackle this question.  The Committee is composed of the administrative heads of a number of buying Departments, and is so organised that contracts for any particular matters are divided up amongst the buying Departments of these particular Departments in a way in which you can make use of, to the best advantage&mdash; the buying experience of these buying Departments.  The greater majority of Army purchases are made through that Committee now, and they are made through contracts entered into in the ordinary way in which ordinary contracts are entered into.  As far as the Army itself is concerned, contracts for Army machinery itself, these are practically contracts for food that are bought locally.  On the question of buying, the Army was faced with the position that it was buying a lot of technical equipment.</P>
    <P>The Army Authorities saw that in order to get the best possible technical equipment, and in order, when buying technical equipment, it might be necessary to harmonise with technical equipment utilised by other departments, it was necessary, when buying technical equipment, that technical requirements should be made to run the gauntlet of a technical expert body, who, as well as being able to advise the Army Authorities with regard to the up-to-date position of technical equipment in any particular direction, would also be able to say to the Army, &ldquo;This, or that, or the other is the technical equipment in this particular line, which it is most economical for you to buy, because when no longer required for Army purposes it can be turned aside for the use of this or that particular Government Department.&rdquo;  As well as initiating the idea of Central Government control and supervision in the matter of buying, it has initiated the idea of Central Government Supervision. from the point of view of harmonising the technical equipment bought by different Government Departments, and seeing that where technical equipment is being got, that we know the last word in what are the world developments in that particular direction.  Mentioning these matters is, I feel, the best possible assurance <Col N="1699" /> that we can give here to the Dáil, and to the people whose money is being used, that the Army, in dealing with the question of contracts, looks at it from the business and efficient and up-to-date point of view.  You have not had any of that particular type of squandering that is so rumoured about.  I do not know if we even had the dentist that Deputy Johnson speaks about, although I think we did hear something about that dentist when we were last discussing Army Estimates.</P>

      <P>I can give an assurance that there were not&mdash;what shall we call it&mdash;defects in the Army Buying Department three months ago, such as have been suggested here to-day. The ideas and the ideals in the matter of contracts that I spoke about, are ideas and ideals dating from September or October of last year.  In the matter of the large purchases that were made in England in the beginning of this year, and not through the Government Contracts Committee, which would have ordinarily been dealing with Army Contracts at that time, we did come to a point in the early spring, when reviewing the situation, the Army Authorities decided that it was absolutely necessary to be in a position to supply with full and complete equipment our 50,000 men.  We decided that within the shortest possible time, we would get 50,000 uniforms and whatever the necessary quota of other articles were, in order to have 50,000 men in such a way that we could say they were perfectly and fully equipped. Being a matter of urgency, the simplest way that presented itself to us for securing that we were in that position was to have the British War Office visited to see what machinery they usually used in getting themselves provided with the various types of equipment.  They facilitated us in every way, and gave us whatever information was at their disposal. The amount of purchases made at that particular time was to the extent of £667,000.  We got our material to the time, that we required it, and we got it saving a large amount.  The actual cost was £443,000.  We estimated that to have kept that purchasing in Ireland would cost us an additional £224,000, and that we could not have got it within the time that we required it.  The circumstances were exceptional, and we did the best possible thing.  We got our material promptly, and we got it through channels through which we were perfectly satisfied we were getting it at the very best price at which it could be obtained.  We had not any differences at the time with the Government Contracts Committee which thoroughly understood our circumstances and our wants; and we were in a position to say to them what our requirements would be subsequent to the <Col N="1701" /> 1st June, and to tell them that any particular class of materials that we would require for delivery after the 1st June could be contracted for through them in the ordinary way.  Actual orders have been placed through the Government Contracts Committee for 30,000 pairs of boots, and these boots are being provided at a cost of 18s. per pair.  The other main contracts for the Army, for clothing and other matters, are being passed and dealt with through the Government Contracts Committee, and there is no margin, except on whatever food is being bought throughout the country, for people robbing the country through the Army.  In the matter of food bought through the country, there are certain laid down prices for the different parts of the country, in a scheme that enables us to control well, the expenditure upon foodstuffs in the country.  There is not at the present moment any need for concern, or any need for paying attention to rumours, and complaints and grievances that you hear with regard to any efficiency in making any of the purchases required for the Army.  If the Government Contracts Committee is not in the perfect condition of the ideal that we have set before us, as it will be developed from, it is there, and if it is preventing the Army and the Army buyers doing all those appalling things which only Army buyers could do, apparently, and which apparently Army buyers must do, well, the Army must get credit for having suggested that that Committee should be there to do that buying.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I said very little just now, and what I did say was very moderate.  I abstained specifically from making any sweeping general charges as the Minister has suggested I did, and I object to being charged with having made sweeping general charges.  I merely voiced the prevalent dissatisfaction as to certain aspects of the contract question, and I invite the Minister, as I or any other Deputy has a perfect right to do, to give us information as to control over contracts.  That is the essential thing, and that is what I wish him to do.  I think this outburst against me was, in the circumstances very uncalled for.</P>

When he is so insistent, I submit this is a motion of which not merely notice should be given, but the terms should have been set out.

After all, the Committee has to meet, and it can hardly meet before Monday or Tuesday. It then has to decide upon its procedure, and probably to submit a questionnaire or at least get into communication with witnesses who would be able to inform them what facts they think are essential to form a judgment on this question.  I think that the 6th July is quite too early a date to expect a report duly considered. I, therefore, beg to move that the date be altered to the 4th August.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the adjournment until Tuesday at 3 o'clock. On Wednesday last I announced the intention of the Government in regard to <Col N="1706" /> setting up a Civil Service Commission, and I should like, with the permission of the Dáil, to make a fuller statement in the matter.  We have considered very carefully the functions which our Civil Service Commission should have, and we have looked at the functions of Civil Service Commissions in other countries. There is the model of the British Civil Service Commission, the first to be looked at, inasmuch as it was the Civil Service Commission functioning here before the change of Government.  The functions of that Commission extend to the recruitment of all officers of the Public Service with the exception of certain special posts with which we are not immediately concerned.  The British Civil Service Commissioners have to issue Certificates of Qualification for all officers before they can be appointed to the Public Service; they make regulations, subject to the approval of the Treasury, as to the manner in which persons are to be admitted to the Public Service, and these powers of making regulations extend to temporary posts and to professional and technical posts.  The British Civil Service Commissioners are not concerned with promotions occurring in the customary course in the Public Service. In the United States and in some of the Dominions the Public Service Commissioners have power of control of the Public Service extending beyond recruitment into the sphere of promotion, organisation, and even remuneration.  In the case of the United States it has to be borne in mind that the system of Government is on a totally different basis from that of the Saorstát.  The Ministers there are not responsible to the legislature, and are not dependent on the approval of the legislature for the conduct of policy.  The position, therefore, is radically different from what it is in the Saorstát, where Ministers are members of the Dáil, and are answerable to the Dáil for their procedure.  It is true that in one or two of the Dominions where Ministers are answerable to Parliament, the Public Service or Civil Service Commission has functions extending beyond recruitment, but, after careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that a wider extension of powers than those covering the whole field of recruitment would be unsound in principle.  The determination of numbers and scales of <Col N="1707" /> salary of the Civil Service is essentially the determination of public expenditure, and as such the Minister for Finance, who is responsible to the Dáil for expenditure, must bear the whole responsibility of sanctioning the numbers of Civil Servants and their scales of salary.  It is quite obvious that it will be impossible for the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the National Budget, and who has to propose measures to the Dáil, to make ends meet, to carry out the duties of his Ministry in this respect if his powers of control of, perhaps, the largest item of Government expenditure were put into Commission in the hands of a body not responsible to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of promotion and of discipline.  The power to promote and the power to take disciplinary measures are, perhaps, two of the most important marks of executive authority. If a Minister is to be responsible for a Department, he must have full executive authority over that Department, and he cannot be held answerable to this House for the doings of that Department, unless this House will give him authority for the administration of that Department. Further, as regards promotion, it has to be pointed out that only the Minister and his responsible advisers are in a position to appraise the merits of the staff working in the Department with a view to the selection of the best men for promotion, and it would be impossible for an outside authority having no actual experience of the working of the Department, of the actual merits as displayed on work of individual officers to attempt the task of saying which officer is the best fitted for promotion.  We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that our Civil Service Commission should, as in the case of the British Civil Service Commission, be confined to recruitment, and should extend to the whole body of clerkships, etc., in the Public Service.  The British Civil Service Commission is not a body created by Statute.  If it were a statutory body the Executive Council could, by an Order under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, create a body of Commissioners to carry out the functions of the old Civil Service Commission in the Saorstát.  The British Civil Service Commission was created by Order in Council, and its powers and duties as <Col N="1708" /> they at present stand, are derived from Orders in Council.  It is, I think, desirable that the Civil Service Commission of the Saorstát should be created by Statute, and I propose to have a Bill drafted providing for the establishment of a Civil Service Commission on the lines proposed.  I hope to be able to ask leave to introduce such a Bill in about a fortnight.  At the moment we must have somebody to arrange for the forthcoming examination, confined to officers and men of the Army, for posts in the Customs and Excise, and as a provisional arrangement we propose to constitute a Commission as explained in my statement on last Wednesday.  It shall consist of the Ceann Comhairle, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and the Secretary of the Ministry of Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine myself to the first point mentioned by the Ceann Comhairle, that is the powers and functions of a Civil Service Commission. First, I would say that I think all parties were pleased to hear that the Government had made up its mind to appoint a Civil Service Commission which would control the entrance of people to the service of the Government.  It will regularise matters which have been the cause of some complaint, justifiable or otherwise, during the past twelve months.  The President has stated it is the intention of the Government to confine the functions of the Civil Service Commission to the matter of recruitment, pure and simple.  In this, I think, so far as the functions of the Commission are concerned, it is modelled rather on the style of the British Civil Service Commission. They, too, I believe, confined their functions merely to recruitment and other things mentioned in a paragraph of the President's reply on the last occasion when he answered Deputy Johnson.  I would urge that consideration should be given to whether it would be possible to enlarge the functions of that Commission. I notice that the President stated that inquiries were made, and they found <Col N="1709" /> that it was unsound in principle to have any other questions discussed than those of recruitment alone, and he mentioned that as the Minister for Finance is responsible for the salaries of those officials that it would be necessary they should keep full control of that in their own hands.  While admitting that the salary should be under the control of the Minister for Finance, there are many other matters connected with the Civil Service which should and would come properly within the scope of a Civil Service Commission. It is not sufficient, merely, to provide the people who form the machinery.  It would be advisable that the working of the machine, apart from the actual paying of the money which it costs, should be controlled by a body such as the Civil Service Commission should be.  There are questions, not altogether of promotion, but questions of the reorganising of staffs, transference of staffs from one Department to another, and reconstitution of the service, which might be very well under the control of an independent Commission of this kind.  I do not think the Minister, in mentioning the countries which were looked to as models for a Civil Service Commission, mentioned Canada.  My recollection is that they have a Civil Service Commission in Canada of men who were appointed much on the same tenure of service as that of the judges in this country, whose functions do extend much further than the question of recruiting. Further, a rather interesting thing, I understand, is that South Africa, shortly after it was set up as an independent Dominion or Commonwealth or Free Nation, did model its service for some time on the British.  Then it tried a combination of the British and Canadian models, and finally it adopted the Canadian system, which has worked very satisfactorily.  I should like to know whether the Government, before coming to their conclusion, made close inquiries into the systems worked in those Dominions I have mentioned, and if so, I should be glad to know what the result of those inquiries are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised in the communication made by the Minister for Finance, the President of the Executive Council, does really arise a question of far greater importance than one of any appointments <Col N="1710" /> that have been made or of any personnel of the Commission itself. The status and powers of the Commission obviously raise a question that is of fundamental importance, and not merely of fundamental importance in this country, but has been so judged to be of importance in all other countries and has received very careful attention. The real essential difference lies between a Civil Service that shall be very largely, under the terms of their service, subject to the parties of the day that may happen to form the Government of the day, or shall be able to look to some body that shall stand outside of such parties and be directly responsible to the legislature as a whole.  That is a question that will always, I take it, range different people on different sides.  The English practice has been of the first kind and later practices in several of the Dominions where there has been responsible Government has been of the second kind.  It has been indicated by Deputy O'Connell and is a fact that the Dominion of Canada, having tried the English system of letting the Civil Service Commission be only responsible for deciding what class of person shall enter the service, but to leave the service thereafter at the control of the Ministry of the day, decided then to change that principle and to create a statutory body that held the same relation to the legislature as the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and my own very emphatic conviction is that the second principle is the wiser principle.  To it the President charges, with a great deal of weight, that by that method the Ministry of Finance loses control in respect of matters of Finance for which it is responsible to the legislature.  I think a little closer investigation will show that that objection is not sound.  Ultimately the Minister for Finance, under either of the two schemes, has that control.  He cannot help but have that control.  But, whereas in the one case, under the English system, he only has that control through his Department, in the second case the control is exercised directly in such recommendations as he may make to the legislature. What happens in what I may call the Canadian system, what I may call the External Commission system, is that the Commission makes recommendations in respect of salaries, in respect of terms of service, in respect of all matters concerning <Col N="1711" /> the Civil Service and the working of the Civil Service, to Parliament as a whole, and if it should happen that the Commission, in a particular matter, recommended that a new grade, for example, should be created and that the grade should carry a certain rank and salary between certain limits of deviation, such an order should not be of effect until it had lain on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament and had received the recommendation of Parliament. What, then, would happen in that case? Inasmuch as the Minister for Finance in any responsible Parliament is the only person who can make a money recommendation, ultimately that order would come of no effect until the Minister for Finance had moved a resolution enabling the Dáil to bring it to effect.  Before he did so, the Minister for Finance of that day would bring before the Dáil, and the Dáil would be entitled to know, and the public would be entitled to know, the full reasons why he considers it was his duty to recommend that that be not adopted and that it be returned to the Commission, rebutting such arguments as the Commission may have put up. The result is a very considerable one.  By getting an independent body of the kind that I am suggesting now you get a body that the entire service has a measure of confidence in.  This is exactly so, I understand, to have been the experience in Canada, and I further understand, to have been the particular part of the Canadian experience that commended it to South African adoption.  The Civil Service, as a whole, has that confidence, that all parts of it might not have in the Government of the day.  Governments of the day are created by a majority that sways to and fro and inevitably, no matter how cleanly they desire to handle things, and no matter how cleanly they do handle things, are subjected to suggestion that a Commission of this kind stands free of, and the result is greater efficiency in the service.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, do I understand this is a temporary measure and that a Bill, which will raise all this, is to be introduced in a fortnight's time?  If we are going to discuss Civil Service, the Civil Service of the future, on a motion of this kind, and we are going to discuss it all over again in a <Col N="1712" /> fortnight's time, I think we are wasting our time now.  I really do.</P>

      <P>Well, the President made a certain answer to a question on Wednesday, and it was agreed that his answer could be discussed to-day at this particular time.  The President made a further statement to-day in which he said that he proposed bringing in a Bill.  He did not give that information on Wednesday on the motion for the adjournment, but the matter arises, I think, on the statement of the President with regard to the functions of a Civil Service Commission, as conceived by the Government.  It is a matter for the discretion of the Dáil generally, and for the Deputies, whether they choose to discuss it now or wait until the Bill is brought in, but it is not out of order.</P>

      <P>May I put this representation before you?  When it was agreed to take up this matter on the motion for the adjournment to-day; we were not aware of what we are now made aware by the President, that a Bill was to be introduced.  Now, some of us have been briefed with the same brief, and I would suggest that the discussion should be adjourned until the Bill has been brought in.  It would be very much better.  We would know exactly what is proposed, because, after all, the President's scheme is not now being discussed, and we do not know what it is. For example, if I might urge this one consideration, the President spoke in general, broad terms of the British scheme, but he said nothing about the Whitley Councils nor have any of the other speakers so far, and the whole Civil Service Commission and its working, as at present operating in England, has undergone a most radical alteration during the years of the war.  The President did not allude to that, not, I am sure, because he was not aware of it, but because he did not want to go into the details.  All these details, how far the British model is being varied and in what respect it is being departed from, we will be in a position to discuss specifically when the Bill comes in.  To do it now, really I do hold with Deputy Hughes, is merely going to have the thing encored and perhaps prejudiced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect to this, and I take it that the intention in bringing this matter before the Dáil was to get the sanction or approval of the Dáil to the second part of this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>To get the approval of the Dáil to the second part of the proposal, and that of course is somewhat important to the basis of the temporary arrangement, at any rate, quite apart from the question of the Bill that is to be brought in.  As a matter of fact, the approval or disapproval of the Dáil to such a proposal might prejudice the whole case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Dáil is committed to in this case is that the three persons I have named would be appointed as a temporary Civil Service Commission, and would hold these examinations, and the rest of the matter would be dealt with in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are two distinct matters.  The President has introduced this matter in a slightly different light this evening.  There is the question of the Bill which is to determine the functions and powers of a Civil Service Commission.  Upon that a very wide discussion will arise in the ordinary way, because it will have to be submitted to the ordinary procedure for Bills.  I think we ought to decide first does the Dáil now wish to discuss that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing that matter at the time.  May I be permitted to say I feel, and earlier felt, the very point Deputy Hughes has made, and I feel that in this matter that we might have been led somewhat otherwise than the Minister for Finance has led us, for he suggested the matter would probably not arise on the Bill, and now he says it will arise on the Bill.  Whether these suggestions are now being put before us with a view of discussion so as to give the Bill final shape or not is a matter that the Dáil has not been informed on.  If the matter is to arise on the Bill, I agree that we ought to wait until we get the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was intending to get a decision as to whether we are going away from general discussion, and then there is a particular arrangement, that the President mentioned as a temporary arrangement, and that would arise immediately after if we had decided that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree on the general point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the other matter, there is a general question of urgency which the President has raised, and there is the particular question that concerns the personnel of the proposed Commission. When I was asked to undertake this particular duty I understood, and Deputies will not need very much convincing about it, I am sure, that the matter was one that purely concerned the holding of examinations for recruitment, and having been pressed on the matter I decided that I might act if the approval of the Dáil for my so acting could be obtained. This is the exact position on that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not one matter rather hinge upon the other? I mean to say the question that we have postponed, does it not in a very great measure govern the subsequent decision, because if the Commission were to be of the sort, if it were decided that it were to be of the sort outlined in the President's proposal, and later given more definite shape to in a Bill, in that case one might be inclined to approve entirely that the personnel be as it is, but if the Commission be of another sort, such as I was outlining, then the personnel would have to be changed accordingly?</P>

      <P>A new factor is brought into the discussion.  A new Bill is to be introduced and powers will be given to this Civil Service Commission in regard to its duties in that Bill.  The Dáil may decide to enlarge these powers, and &ldquo;The Government has decided to set up a Civil Service Commission to control recruitment to the public services subject to the approval of the Dáil in regard to the chairmanship.  We propose that the Civil Service Commission should be constituted of the present Ceann Comhairle as Chairman.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I hope the President will forgive me if I am quite frank.  I think the President has mended his hand on this matter.  He stated this evening that that is so.  It is now suggested that exactly all that he requires is a body to conduct an examination for Customs and Excise Officers, the candidates for the examination to be confined to members of the Army.  Is that correct?</P>
