      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (1) whether he is aware that men were arrested and live stock seized by the military on the lands of Kinnury, near Westport, on the 25th inst.; (2) whether in 1915 an agreement was drawn up with the consent of the landlord&mdash;Miss Crotty &mdash;by which the tenants on the estate became yearly tenants for the lands in the landlord's possession at a stipulated rent; (3) whether in the interval between the preparation and signing of the agreement the landlord changed her mind as to the term of letting, and thus a deadlock was arrived at; (4) whether the tenants tendered the rent each year and that it was refused; (5) whether matters have been further complicated in recent years by two landlords demanding rent on the Crotty estate; and (6) as the land in dispute will evidently come within the scope of the new Land Bill, he will adopt such measures as may ensure the release of the men arrested, the return of the live stock seized, and the staying of further proceedings pending the purchase of the estate.</P>

That is to say, that all the Estimates in connection with a particular Department, the Departments being set forth in some agreed order, should each be taken, the Minister remaining in charge to move each Estimate and relieving all the other Ministers not directly concerned, as well as the Minister for Finance, so that the Dáil may know that all the sub-Departments of a given Department will be dealt with and completed before any other Department is entered upon.

    <Title>LAND LAW (COMMISSION) BILL, 1923&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on the First <Col N="1255" /> Reading of this Bill that as a result of the operations of the Transfer of Functions Order, which transferred the administration of the Land Acts, the Office of the Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission ceased to exist, and that we were under the necessity of reconstituting the Land Commission.  There are three bodies dealt with in this Bill&mdash;the Land Commission, the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board.  The Land Commission was constituted by Section 41 of the Land Act of 1881.  It consisted later of Judicial Commissioners and Lay Commissioners. The Estates Commissioners were Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission. They were the body known as the Estates Commissioners, and were constituted by Section 23 of the Land Act of 1903.</P>
      <P>The Lay Land Commissioners administered the Land Law Acts; the Estates Commissioners, who were the same persons, administered the Land Purchase Acts.  We have come to the conclusion that there is no further reason for this sort of Pooh Bah arrangement, and this Bill really abolishes the two titles.  The <i>personnel</i> was always the same.  There is one body now&mdash;the Lay Land Commissioners and they administer the Land Acts and the Land Purchase Acts. With regard to the Congested Districts Board, it was set up by Section 34 of the Land Purchase Act of 1891.  Its powers were increased by the Congested Districts Acts of 1898, and they were still further modified and to some extent increased by the Irish Land Act of 1899.  The powers of the Congested Districts Board relate not only to Land Purchase, but also to Fisheries and Industries.</P>
      <P>We have now a Ministry of Fisheries and a Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and in the ordinary way the powers of the Congested Districts Board in relation to both Fisheries and Industries would be transferred to their proper Ministry, and the Congested Districts Board would be left with its Land Purchase functions only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Land Commission&mdash;the reconstituted Land Commission&mdash;it is proposed to set up shall take over all Land Purchase and Land Law Act functions of the Board.  There is no reason now for <Col N="1256" /> having two bodies dealing with Land Purchase or Land Laws.  It was certainly useful in the past, when control by the British Government and Parliament existed, that a body which at least to some extent was representative should be dealing with the administration of services like Congestion and Land Purchase generally.  There is no particular reason for it now.  You have two Boards stripped of Fisheries and Industries functions, and there is no reason whatever why Land Purchase function should not be administered by the body administering Land Purchase generally.</P>
    <P>I take it that there will not be very much dispute about that.  The Bill provides that all the property, assets and finance of the Congested Districts Board as they stand at present shall be transferred to the Land Commission.  I may say that we transfer not only the Land Commission functions and the Fisheries and Industries functions to the Land Commission, but the Ministries Bill, which is to be introduced, will re-transfer this work and will re-allot the function of the Land Commission as between the Department of Agriculture and every other Ministry.  There was no other alternative. We could not very well transfer the Land Purchase functions of the Congested Board to the Land Commission and leave the Congested Districts Board administering Industries and Fisheries. There was no advantage in that.  We might as well transfer the whole lot and let the Ministries Bill re-transfer any function that required to be so rearranged. The matter is urgent.  We could not wait until after the Ministries Bill was through, pending sales being financed by the British Treasury of land purchase.  We wished to put the position of the Land Commission definitely beyond doubt in order that somebody could give a receipt for moneys received from the Treasury.  Hence it was necessary that this Bill should go through as soon as possible, so that pending sales should not be held up.  The Congested Districts Board was not financed by Vote in the ordinary way.  It was financed by Grants under various Acts of Parliament. They received £25,000 under Section 5 of the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Act of 1899, £20,000 under the Irish Land Act of 1903, £144,750 under Section 49 of the Irish Land Act of 1899, £41,250 from the Church Temporalities, <Col N="1257" /> making a total of £231,000.  These were Grants payable under the authority of these Acts of Parliament, and they were payable yearly, and if at the end of any year the Congested Districts Board had not spent the full amount of their income it did not go back to the Treasury, but was held by them, and in that way they gradually built up a fund, and that fund at the moment amounts to £153,000.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that these grants in aid shall be abolished, and that in future the reconstituted Land Commission shall be financed by moneys voted from the Oireachtas.  Just as there is no particular reason why the C.D.B. should be maintained in the new circumstances, there is no particular reason why this system of voting moneys, specific sums yearly, under the authority of a special Act of Parliament, should be continued.  It was distinctly useful, everyone will agree, in the past; it was useful that there should be specific sums payable under the authority of a specific Act of Parliament to Irish services, and that if the said Irish services were unable to spend the whole of that money during the year that it should be retained by that service.  There is no further reason for that, because the Irish Parliament has control over all Irish services, and should be in a position to say each year what moneys are to be paid to each.  Therefore, these grants in aid are to be abolished, and in future the moneys required for the service of the reconstituted Land Commission shall be voted by Parliament.  With regard to the accumulated funds of £153,000, these are transferred to the Land Commission, but it is provided that they shall be used as grants in aid of the Vote.  The fund will be gradually wound up in that way, and I should say that before this time next year we will be in a position to say what moneys for the Land Commission are to be voted by Parliament, and hence Parliament will be able at a glance to see how much money is going to each service.  This sum of £153,000 is to be used as appropriation in aid of the Vote.  With regard to the Staff, Section 5 deals with them. It reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Immediately upon the passing of this Act the Congested Districts Board shall stand dissolved, and thereupon every officer and person then in the employment of the Congested Districts Board shall be transferred to <Col N="1258" /> the employment of the Irish Land Commission, and shall, for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919, be deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by Parliament or the Oireachtas throughout their service under the Congested Districts Board within the meaning of Section 17 of the Superannuation Act, 1859.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The staffs shall be transferred to the Land Commission and graded by the Establishment Branch of the Ministry of Finance, and put in their place in the Land Commission in the ordinary way. These are the entire provisions of the Bill, and I beg to move the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement with the proposal made by the Minister to amalgamate these two or three different Departments which have been doing practically the same work.  I think the amalgamation will make for efficiency and economy in the public service when it is carried out.  Whatever reasons may have existed in the past, and perhaps there were reasons, they no longer exist, and I think it will make for a general tightening up and more economical working of the system when these Departments are amalgamated.  With regard to the point made by the Minister as regards grants in aid, I think this question of giving grants in aid to Departments, Boards or bodies to do work which is really Departmental work, is one that, in my opinion, in any case, should not be over-encouraged.  On the whole, I think it is better that such work should be performed directly by Government Departments, which would be subject to direct Government control. I am only giving that as my own personal opinion.  With regard to the question of the staffs, Section 5, to which the Minister referred, does not make it quite clear that the staffs will be placed in the same position as if they had been, all along, in the Land Commission, or directly under the Government.  This was, in effect, if not actually, a Government Department.  The Congested Districts Board was doing Government work, and the staffs engaged by the C.D.B. were in practice, in any case, if <Col N="1259" /> not technically, Civil Servants.  They were recruited in the same manner as Civil Servants were recruited; they passed the examinations held by the Civil Service Commission, but, owing to the fact that the C.D.B. was not directly under the control of the Government, they were not technically Civil Servants.  I think that technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way of the members of this staff getting now the same treatment as if they had been Civil Servants right from the beginning. I understand that for some time past, owing to this technicality to which I am drawing attention, these staffs have been claiming the rights, which up to the present have been denied them, provided under the reconstitution which took place in the service under the Whitley Commission.  At present that is still under consideration. These staffs appealed to the Government Departments some months ago to get the benefit of this reconstitution that was carried out in the other branches of the Civil Service.  That has not been given to them up to the present, but I hope, now that they are coming over directly under Government control, that they will get the full benefit of this reconstitution.  I do not wish to go into details on this matter, because I am quite sure that the Minister himself is fully aware of the facts. I wish only to say that the C.D.B., which hitherto was rather inclined to place some obstacles in the way, have now, I understand, recommended that the staff should get the just treatment to which they are entitled.  I take it that under Section 5, for the purpose of superannuation, these staffs, when taken over, will be treated exactly as if they were Civil Servants right from the beginning of their service.  I am sure it is only necessary to call the attention of the Minister and of the Dáil to this special matter in connection with the staffs to have definite provision made in the Bill for them.  I hope that at the next stage the Minister will see his way to make suitable provision for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the general principle of this Bill is one that will get almost unanimous assent. Anything that would tend to gathering together into one body functions that are <Col N="1260" /> identical and which have hitherto been scattered amongst many bodies is to be encouraged.  This is the first attempt we have seen to collect similar functions into one administration.  That is the general principle of the Bill, and it is not a matter that should arouse any disagreement whatever.  But it raises, as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, the question of the staffs.  The whole of the State depends upon the contentment and loyal functioning of its civil servants, and the collapse of two administrations means that the identity of the two staffs will henceforth be established.  It means, further, that the staff of the Congested Districts Board will be placed on the basis of civil servants, and will naturally be graded on that basis.  The actual words used by the Minister in that regard when introducing the Bill on the Second Stage were: &ldquo;These servants, under Section 5, will be graded into the Land Commission in the ordinary way.&rdquo;  It is the prerogative of a Minister, while not exactly being a monopoly of the Minister, to use words that are deft without exactly being precise. These words are deft, but not precise.  I do not know exactly what they mean, and I would be glad to know how these persons are going to be graded &ldquo;in the ordinary way,&rdquo; and what &ldquo;the ordinary way&rdquo; is presumed to be.  We know that the Congested Districts Board up to about 1915 did give excellent service to the congested districts, and that that service was well intended and well intentioned, and that the good intentions were carried into practical effect.  It might be charitable to draw a veil as to what happened after 1915.  For that, perhaps, the officials themselves are not primarily responsible.  In any case, these matters lie in the past.  With regard to the future, we have a body of civil servants who have given excellent service to the most needy people of this country, and we are now informed that they will become civil servants in the Free State. It would be desirable if, at this stage, we had some fuller information, in order. when we come to the Committee Stage of this Bill, Deputies would have more exact information before them on which to base what they might judge to be necessary amendments.  We might be told rather more precisely, even if a little less deftly, what was meant by the Minister when he said that these officials <Col N="1261" /> are going to be turned into a new and necessary body, and that they will be graded in the ordinary way.  The case has been admitted on their own behalf by one of the members of the Board that that grading would be on the basis of the salaries of the Second Division civil servants.  It is claimed by the officials of the Board that that pledge, given on their behalf before the Royal Commission of 1913, has not been kept.  If such a pledge was given by a responsible member of the Board to the staff, that pledge should now be made good.  In any case, it is right that persons who are going to be taken into the Civil Service and who passed the necessary Civil Service examination, should be graded exactly to the same grade as they would have had if they had gone into the Civil Service originally instead of into the service of the Congested Districts Board.  That demand is made not in advantage to the officials, but in the advantage of the general efficiency of the Civil Service&mdash; contentment and a feeling of justice and equity being a very essential part of that efficiency.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on the introduction of this Bill for the amalgamation of these two Boards.  There is no doubt that a dry rot did set in in the Congested Districts Board.  It was becoming intolerable in the congested districts, and the Board have lands on their hands for generations undivided.  We of the congested districts do not want any tightening up, as has been suggested by Deputy O'Connell.  What we do want is an infusion of vigour, so that the land will be divided up and not left, from generation to generation, resurveyed time after time, with one surveyor following another, until nearly every stone on the estate is known to some of the surveying officials. As to the officials of the Board, a number of them are, I understand, ungraded. The service of these officials who are ungraded, and who are nominally civil servants, should, on the amalgamation of the Boards, be counted from the first year that they entered the service of the Board, and their pension and emoluments should be so calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my approval of this Bill also.  I think that the joining together of these <Col N="1262" /> two Boards would give us a better instrument for the carrying out of the wishes of this Dáil with regard to the coming Land Bill.  The division into two Boards before led to considerable confusion.  I should like to join with Deputy McBride in hoping that we will have a new driving force of some considerable strength behind the working of this Board.  People in the congested districts, looking on at the operations of the Board, got it into their heads that there was some hidden hand holding back the officials of the Board from carrying out the obvious intention of the Legislature with regard to the Congested Districts Board.  The case of the Congested Districts Board is that the Board had not sufficient power, and points to the new Land Bill as proof of that.  The Board states it had not power to carry out large schemes of migration which it wished to undertake, and it has thousands of acres of land on hands owing to the congests to whom they offered the land not being able to undertake to take the land because the inducements were not sufficient. That is the case of the Congested Districts Board&mdash;that it offered men land, and the men could not undertake the burden in the face of the depression in the farming world.  I am sure that under the new Bill we will have these conditions improved.  I think a very good case has been made with regard to the officials of the Congested Districts Board.  If there was no proposal to unite the two Boards, I think you would have a splendid staff of officials in the Congested Districts Board to operate land schemes of a complicated character similar to the work done in the Land Commission, and I think it was hard to draw distinction in the matter of salary between the two staffs.  Now that you are going to join the two Boards, I hope it will be impossible to draw that distinction.  I trust that the Minister for Agriculture will consider the case of these men and put them on the same grade as the officials of the Land Commission.  In fact, if it is not done it is obvious that it will lead to great dissatisfaction, as you will have men working side by side on a different footing.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill which, I think, will be non-contentious, and the outline of the new Land Bill has clearly shown that there will not be room <Col N="1263" /> for the different Departments to function in this matter.  I am not so much concerned with the vested interests of the officials, because I am sure they are well capable of looking after themselves.  I am sure it is not the intention of the Government to inflict any hardship upon them except what is consistent with the ordinary administration of such things. I merely want to understand this point. He states that £231,000 was given to the Congested Districts Board, and that there is £153,000 in hands now.  That shows that only £78,000 was expended. That, covering a period of twenty years, shows only £4,000 a year.  I did not understand that the ramifications of the Congested Districts Board were so moderate as that.</P>

They might have saved a couple of thousand a year, and now have £153,000 in addition to what they made by farming alone.</P>

I am perfectly well aware that by the scheme of amalgamation which is under way the work will be well done.  Having regard to the fact that the new Land Bill is going to cost the nation a million to bring it into operation, if it passes, I would like him to be able to tell us that by the abolition of the Congested Districts Board you will save this £231,000, and that therefore the million which the Land Bill is going to cost will be a saving in disguise.  I can understand when you have to take over this staff and amalgamate them with the Land Commission that their salaries will be kept on, but <Col N="1264" /> there will be less supervision.  The portion which deals with officials will be dealt with by another Department; that which dealt with untenanted land will be dealt with also under that.  I think there should be, and must be, a considerable amount of this £231,000 available for the revenue of this State.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister for Agriculture to take account not only of the Congested District areas, but also of those areas in which there are very large ranches, and that when those are divided up the workers in the small towns will not be overlooked.  My district, it is true, is not put down as a Congested District.  Of course, the people of Westmeath and Longford are supposed to have sufficient land, but there are other people that should be taken account of.  Furthermore, I should like to associate myself with the Deputies who have congratulated the Minister on introducing into this Dáil the first Land Bill in a century to be given to the Irish people.  I think the point of view the nation is taking at the present time is that the Minister for Agriculture should be looked upon as the idol of the people.  In a very short time they will begin to realise that we have one man at least in Ireland who is able to satisfy the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, I am sure he will take into account those officials, including the Commissioners and Inspectors, who worked under the old Dáil when the majority of those men risked their lives going through the country trying to value land.  I hope these men will be dealt with fairly, as they carried out their duties very satisfactorily.  Personally, I have spoken to people from all parts of the country since this Dáil was established, and all are well pleased, and bear out my statement that those men are capable of carrying out their duties as Commissioners.  I sincerely hope that when the time comes the Minister will retain the staff he has at the present time.  I do not want to elevate him in any shape or form, because the more you praise him the more people begin to think he is not as good as he really is.  As far as I can read in <Col N="1265" /> the Press and from the opinions of the people, I am certainly under the opinion that the Minister for Agriculture is one of the most popular men in Ireland.  He will have no difficulty whatsoever in coming back here again, providing that in the Land Bill he introduced he has taken into account the landless people first, and, above all things, that he is going to include town tenants, in order that they will have a stake in the country as well as the people he intends to plant on the land.  Furthermore, when we are on that subject I should like to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Section 5 deals with the points raised by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Figgis.  The effect of the Section is to enable the staff of the Congested Districts Board to be transferred to the Land Commission, and to give them what are called the &ldquo;added years,&rdquo; which they would, in the ordinary way, get on establishment, notwithstanding that they have been paid not out of Vote but out of Grants.  The Superannuation Act provides that, on establishment, a certain number of years, during which the particular Civil Servant was not pensionable, would be added to the establishment years to enable the official to be pensioned at the ordinary rate.  That only applies to Civil Servants paid out of Vote.  These Civil Servants have been paid out of Grant and not out of Vote, and that section gives the same rights to these men&mdash;I should not call them Civil Servants&mdash;as those who have been paid not out of Grant but out of Vote.  It gives them the right to have certain years added, on establishment, for the purposes of pension, just as if they had been <Col N="1266" /> paid out of Vote.  I think that covers the point made by Deputy O'Connell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That deals effectively with the pensions, but the point I was making was with regard to their grading.  It is complained by them that they might be taken over and placed in a lower grade than that to which they would have been entitled if they had passed into the Civil Service on passing their examination.  The question primarily turns on the salaries they would now be receiving had they, on examination, gone into the Civil Service, rather than gone into the service of the Congested Districts Board.  In other words, if they are now taken on and graded as Civil Servants, they should be taken into the same grade that they would have achieved if they had gone into the Civil Service at the outset instead of into the service of the Congested Districts Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What grade would they have achieved if they had gone into the Civil Service at the outset?  The point which has been raised by Deputy Figgis shows the impossibility of dealing with this question in an Act of Parliament. What grade would they have achieved if, instead of entering for the examination of the Congested Districts Board, they had entered for the Civil Service examination?  That is purely speculative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of misunderstanding about this matter, and I am taking the points as they arise. There is a good deal of rumour that we intend to take over the staff of the Congested Districts Board and treat them, shall I say, badly.  I do not know that there is any foundation or that there could be any foundation for that sort of rumour or for that point of view.  We cannot, in an Act of Parliament, specify that such an official shall be an executive division clerk, and that such a man <Col N="1267" /> shall be a higher executive officer.  You cannot do that.  You cannot say what grade they would have reached had they entered as civil servants instead of joining the staff of the Congested Districts Board.  We must take them as they stand, examine their records, get their recommendations, and grade them into the Land Commission in a sympathetic way, placing them in the different grades of the Civil Service that their term of service, their efficiency, and the other considerations that one takes into account when officials are being established warrant. That is all we can do.  We cannot be more specific in an Act of Parliament. I do not think it would be possible to amend that section so as to meet the point that Deputy Figgis raises.  That will have to be left to somebody.  It will have to be left to Establishment, and we must assume that Establishment will do the right thing by these officials.  There is no particular reason to assume that they will not do the right thing.  To attempt to grade these officials into the Civil Service by sections of an Act of Parliament dealing with each official&mdash;or, if you like, with each class of official&mdash;would be quite impossible.  This section gives Establishment all the power they need. It gives them power to put an official of the C.D.B. into any position in the Land Commission.  It gives Establishment&mdash; that is, the Establishment Branch of the Ministry of Finance&mdash;the power to establish any official of the Congested Districts Board, and to give him credit for the years he served in the C.D.B.  It specifically provides power to give him credit for these years, notwithstanding that he has not been paid out of Vote, but out of Grant.  It gives power to establish him and to give him pension rights.  What more we can do I cannot see.  That is all I have to say about the staff.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy McGoldrick's point, I think he misunderstood me.  The annual income of the C.D.B. is £231,000. They have saved a certain amount of that and they have £153,000 in the bank or in the stocking.  I am not quite clear as to the point put by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon. He wants to know who is to administer the Sailors and Soldiers Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathalOShannon" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON">
      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to know whether the provisions of that Act <Col N="1268" /> which concerned the old Land Commission and the Estates Commissioners are to concern the new Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount of land bought under the Sailors and Soldiers Act.  It was bought before the Treaty was signed.  Some of that land is divided; some is not.  It will have to be financed by England.  Every penny of it will have to be paid by England, and what is not divided must be divided under the Sailors and Soldiers Act.  There is only about £200,000 worth of land undivided.  It will be divided under the Sailors and Soldiers Act.  The Act empowers the Land Commission to buy the land mainly for sailors and soldiers, and the interpretation of the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; is that they are giving about 51 per cent. to ex-service men and the 49 per cent. for the relief of congestion, which we consider an extremely good bargain, having regard to the fact that we are getting the land and the British Treasury is paying for it.  There is one small estate being divided under that Act at present.  What is happening is as follows:&mdash;There are six labourers' cottages on the estate.  There are four ex-service men in the labourers' cottages. The four ex-service men&mdash;labourers&mdash;are getting four farms.  The balance of the land is being divided amongst congests in that neighbourhood, and the British Treasury is paying for the whole performance. I do not know that there should be any real objection to that, but certainly I have none.  I am quite satisfied that we ought not to repeal the Act and tell them to keep £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right; nobody did suggest it.  With regard to Deputy Wilson's point as to what we will save, I cannot say.  We will not know what we will save until we amalgamate the staffs and until we get the service beginning work.  It is perfectly obvious that we would be saving considerably, because this duplication of functions will have definitely ceased.  But it will be difficult at any time to say what we will save, because the Land Act, when it is passed, will entail very much increased expenditure both for the Land Commission and for the Congested Districts <Col N="1269" /> Board.  I agree with Deputy Wilson that it is not exactly a pleasure to us to have to supply a million pounds as part of the price of land which a number of tenants in Ireland are getting; but if the tenants wish to pay the full price, they have only to say it; it will suit us down to the ground.  We gave this concession not so much in relief of rent, but rather as a concession to the general depressed state of agriculture.  If the farmers admit, for the first time, that they have more money than they want, we will be only too pleased.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the President will enlighten the Dáil, and those interested in the subject we discussed yesterday, as to the real position in regard to the £40,000 that is alleged to be still available for experiments in tobacco growing?  I hoped yesterday that we would have some explanation for the purpose of clearing the air; it has not yet been given, and I think it would be well if the Minister would make an explanation of the position with regard to that sum of money, which was voted out of the Development Fund and earmarked for experiments in Ireland in tobacco growing.  The sum was £70,000; £30,000 is alleged to have been spent, and the balance, £40,000, is earmarked for the purposes of the experiment.  It is believed that that sum is available for that purpose, and it should be utilised for that purpose.  Perhaps the Minister will explain exactly the position with regard to that portion of the Grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>My information on the subject is that a sum of up to £70,000 was promised, but no fund was made available in respect of the promise. However, following the undertakings or promises that were made, something like £40,000 has been already expended. As far as the balance is concerned, we are prepared to carry out our part of the undertaking.</P>

      <P>A letter from the Development Commission to a gentleman in the country contains this clause:&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly the ten years arranged for this experiment have been very troubled ones, and it is impossible to draw much <Col N="1271" /> conclusion from the work which has been so upset by abnormal causes.  The passing of the Free State Agreement Act puts an end to the connection between Ireland and the Development Fund, except that I suppose our existing commitments, which will no doubt include a considerable sum outstanding in respect of tobacco, will have to be adjudicated and paid over.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The information that has been supplied by those who ought to know the position in regard to this sum was that it was actually allocated and sanctioned by the Treasury, and of the sum of £70,000 over £40,000 was still unexpended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information. My information is that there was no such fund of £70,000, but that there was an undertaking to raise money each year in order to meet some amount of £70,000 and of that sum something like £40,000 was voted.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance asked us whether we could supply figures or facts with regard to the growth of tobacco because the grant should be based upon those figures.  I am in a position to supply the figures for the cost of growing an acre pre-war, of heavy pipe tobacco.  The cost in that case was £22 19s. 11d. per acre. The receipts from that acre of grown leaf were about £15.  This estimate was made in pre-war days, when wages for the men working reached 2½d. per hour. To-day that figure would be three times as much.  Therefore, taking the extra cost of labour at the present moment, and other costs, they would bring the cost of production nearer to £40 per acre, or close upon it; that is the cost of production alone.  The receipts would be only somewhere about £15.  The bonus that the Minister offers&mdash;he put it down, I think, at about £40&mdash;and it will be easy to see that the growers could not possibly grow an acre at that rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <P>I do not know whether this discussion is in order.  What I wanted yesterday was some proof, whether this would be an economic proposition so far as the cost to the State goes, and these proofs were not given. If people hold that a subsidy should be given from the State, and that there <Col N="1272" /> should be a reduction of duty on homegrown tobacco, it lies upon those people to prove that, taking into account the cost of production, the sums of money secured by sale of the leaf, and the employment it supports, entitles the State to spend the sum demanded upon that particular service, and that, viewed in the light of a business proposition, it would prove economical.  We have not got that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DOYLE Mr. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question at all about that.  It is not an economic proposition without relief from duty; that is very easy for anyone to see.  If it was an economic proposition nobody would be going to the Department, the Treasury, or any other body looking for a bonus in connection with this crop. It can easily be seen that without a reduction or a rebate of the duty it is not an economic proposition, and anyone who thinks it is an economic proposition without a reduction or rebate had better put the notion out of his head.</P>

      <P>On the 6th May a telegram was sent to Colonel Sir Nugent Everard: &ldquo;Finance Ministry prepared to increase existing grant of twenty-five pounds to forty pounds per acre actually cropped in 1923, or, alternatively, will sanction, in lieu of existing grant, payment of one shilling per pound of marketable tobacco actually produced in 1923, and sold, subject to acreage being limited to sixty acres.  These offers are conditional on your waiving any claim you may have to a special grant or compensation in respect of uncropped areas in 1921 or later.  The conditions of your existing agreement, dated 23rd January, 1914, except clause two, will apply.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That telegram was before a meeting of the tobacco-growers of the County Meath, with representatives of Labour present, on the following day, and they passed the following resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;That this meeting of the tobacco-growers of Meath, with representatives of Labour, having had under consideration the offer of the Ministry of Agriculture of a grant of forty pounds per acre, or 1s. per lb. of marketable tobacco grown in 1923 and sold, beg to point out that the proposed grant, which is thirty per cent. less than the preference given to Indian tobacco over American in our markets, is altogether inadequate, and is, moreover, hedged in by impossible conditions, such as the waiving by Colonel Sir N.T. Everard, the rehandler, of his claim for payment of moneys due to him from the Department. The offer amounts to this, that the growers will get an additional grant of £15 per acre, limited to 60 acres, provided the rehandler forfeits the equivalent of £17 9s. per acre for 60 acres, or <Col N="1274" /> £26 4s. if only 40 acres are grown, money actually due to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have only just had these particulars put into my hand, and have had no opportunity of going into them, out it seems that an explanation is required of the rather curious attempt to compromise, so that a gentleman to whom the State owes money should have the condition imposed upon him that he should waive his claim and take something less than his claim or he will get nothing.

      <P>The register of electors is prepared by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace, with the assistance of officials of local authorities, and the cost is met normally by moneys advanced by the County Councils, and these Councils then reclaimed one-half of the expenses from the Ministry of Finance, and this Vote provided the sum necessary for this recoupment. Owing to the delay in the submission and examination of claims, a large number of claims for registers prepared last year are still outstanding, and for this the sum of £25,000 was necessary.  The sum of £29,000 is required in respect of the register now being prepared on the basis of adult suffrage.  In view of the extension of the electorate, this register will be more expensive than previous registers. One-half of the cost of printing the register is borne on the Stationery Office Vote.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether there is any possibility of any of this money being used for the purpose of the election when it comes.  If it is so, I hope there will not be the same reason to complain after the next election in the case of presiding officers as there was after the last.  On that occasion presiding <Col N="1275" /> officers had to wait a very long time for the payment of necessary out-of-pocket expenses which they incurred.  I take this opportunity, though it is quite out of order, to ask whether all the expenses incurred at the last election by presiding officers throughout the country have yet been paid.  Up to two or three weeks ago I had at least one complaint that such accounts had not been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say if they have all been paid.  I do say that, according as they come in and are vouched for, there is no delay in payment. Owing to the abnormal circumstances that existed as from shortly after the last election was held, it might be reasonable to expect that a delay would take place; but, as I say, in the case of accounts that came in and were vouched for, there was no unreasonable delay in making payment so far as the Ministry of Finance was concerned.  I sign cheques for these payments regularly.</P>

      <P>I think the cases in which delays occurred have come to my notice, because people believe that I was responsible for them as Minister for Local Government.

There is just a question that perhaps the Minister for Home Affairs would be able to enlighten us upon: that is, whether the Under-sheriff, whom the Minister for Local Government refers to, is one of the gentlemen that will have the duty of carrying out other Acts?</P>

The work they had to do was extraordinarily heavy.  They were working day and night for the full 24 hours.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I had experience of this work for many years.  The costs of making up the register are divided between the County Council and the Government, the Government paying one-half. That, I take it, is what the Deputy refers to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what <Col N="1277" /> happens is, if there are 5,000 electors in one county and 5,000 in another the expenses would be approximately the same.  There would be a difference, however, if the area of one county were greater than another.  The amounts paid, I imagine, are fixed by reference to the number of electors on the register.  If in one county the number of electors is double the number in another, obviously the local authority would have to provide a larger number of polling booths in the larger county, and that, of course, would entail much higher expense in that county than in the other; but there is no discrimination against a county or any favourable consideration for a county.  The arrangement is made on a fair basis.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask whether the Minister has any plans with respect to the extension of the authority of the Registrar of Friendly Societies? There seems to be a general feeling that his powers are non-existent.  Is the Minister satisfied that the office, as at present conducted, fits all the requirements? We have heard that the Registrar, while he has legal powers to institute prosecutions, is not provided with any assurance that the cost of such prosecutions will be met.  Whether that is the case or not I cannot say, but it has been put forward as a reason why secretaries of societies registered under these Acts have been allowed to pass by their duties with regard to the balance sheets and the like.  They are supposed to send in yearly returns, and I saw an official record a few days ago which showed that a very large number of societies did not send in their returns.  One explanation was that the Registrar, while he had legal authority to prosecute, had no assurance that he would be reimbursed for any funds expended in prosecution.  Therefore he was deterred from prosecuting. One would also like some information on <i>(b)</i> as to the purpose of this grant-in-aid to the lawyers' trade union.  I suppose it had a good intention once, but one wonders whether the reasons still persist why £325 should be voted annually to the lawyers' union.  Deputy Fitzgibbon is not here, but there are several other barristers and solicitors present who would, no doubt, be able to enlighten us on the purposes for which this money is used, and the service it renders to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, that matter has been more or less under consideration for something like eighteen months.  I cannot promise at present to undertake to do anything about it until after the elections, as it is a very big question.  The late General Collins and myself were in collaboration with regard to it.  It would not have been possible to deal satisfactorily with it owing to the pressure of business in <Col N="1279" /> the last eighteen months, but we do not intend to lose sight of it.  I am sure that the Deputy will recognise that, in dealing with a matter of this kind, to deal with it fairly and equitably and with administrative capacity requires a normal atmosphere and a careful examination of all the circumstances.  That is necessary in order to do something that would be really beneficial to the Societies.  I realise that there may be hardship involved in the delay in dealing with it, but it will be a matter for the consideration of the Oireachtas, when it comes up for final consideration, for the adoption of recommendations, or for the setting up of any officer that may be required. As regards sub-head <i>(b)</i>, this is a grant in respect of portion of the expenses incurred by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in fulfilling the duties imposed on it by the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, with regard to the Roll of Solicitors, etc. (61 and 61 Vict., c. 17).  As regards sub-head <i>(d)</i>, at present seven students are in receipt of research allowances at the rate of £150 each per annum, involving a payment of £525 during the first part of the financial year.  Provision is also made for five allowances for the next academic year, which commences on the 1st October.  In respect of these allowances two quarterly instalments, £375 in all, may become payable during this financial year.  As regards sub-head <i>(e)</i>, this relates to (1) the assessment of compensation by an official arbitrator in respect of land authorised to be acquired compulsorily for public purposes, and (2) the hearing of the estate duty appeals under the Finance Act of 1910.  The post is vacant at present.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> The great bulk of the estimated Vote was for paper, £53,500; miscellaneous, £22,000, and printing and binding, £15,000.  Subject to the fact that there is preference given for Irish manufactured goods, all stores up to sample are purchased in the cheapest market.  The past year has been to a large extent one of equipment.  A number of new Departments have been set up, and there were also a number of special Commissions of Inquiry and Research, all requiring stationery and printing at the shortest possible notice.  In addition, large requirements for the National Army and Civic Guard had to be met.  The Stationery Office was not always in a position to exercise an effective control on demands.  Many Departments have made more than normal demands upon the Stationery Office, and it has not been always an easy matter to meet their requirements. To give an idea of some of the difficulties of this Office, there is a new contract now for envelopes, and it is observed that as many as 64 different sizes of envelopes have crept into the ordinary usage of Public Departments. The Stationery Office intends to invite the co-operation of all the other Departments to revise their requirements, not only in size, but also in quality.  Substantial reductions have been made in the Estimates.  £29,000 less has been voted than for the last year, 1922-23.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire, on this Vote, to call attention to the policy of the Stationery Office of the Government in the matter of the prices which they charge for their publications.  Already, on a former occasion, I called attention to it by way of question.  Books, publications and reports in which the public are interested, and which were hitherto sold at the nominal price of 1s., are now costing 5s., 6s. or 7s.  In our hands you have an example of a publication which cost 10s.  I am sure a large number of the public would be anxious to find out the details of many of those Votes, but there are very few indeed prepared to pay 10s. for this publication. I would suggest, with regard to this particular publication, that it is advisable that it should be published in sections under separate Ministries or Votes, as it was under the British regime. <Col N="1281" /> One person might be very interested, for example, in the Post Office Vote. He would not trouble very much about Agriculture or the Stationery Office or Education, and, in the same way, a man interested in the Vote for Agriculture and the details of that particular service, might not trouble much about the Post Office.  Therefore, I would suggest that these Estimates might be available separately.  I think that could still be done.  There is no reason why those should not be issued separately even still, and published at a nominal price, so that people having an interest in special departments can secure copies. I do not know on what grounds the prices charged for some of those publications are fixed, but it would seem to me, in any case, that the Government, in adopting the policy of charging prohibitive prices for those publications, are not adopting a wise policy.  People are interested&mdash;anxious to be interested, in any case&mdash;in the work of the various departments, as set forth in the various reports, but the policy of charging exorbitant prices for them will kill that interest.  I would suggest, therefore, that those publications should be issued at reasonable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with Deputy O'Connell on the question of raising the prices of official publications of the State.  It is a matter which affects the public at large.  Even though a loss be incurred, I suggest that that loss would be abundantly worth while if the official publications were issued at a cheap price, in order that they might be made available to a large number of people.  Take the question of one of the most interesting publications that has been issued by this State or by any State, and which was issued during the last few months, dealing with the statistics of imports and exports, revealing the entire machinery of this State, and exposing a position showing clearly that our credit is as good as the credit of any other country.  That is a matter that should be inquired into by every citizen.  How can anyone expect any citizen to purchase a paper bound copy of this kind at the price of 10s.?  I forget what the price was before the Free State came in, but it does not look well for the Free State to charge more than was charged previously.  The <Col N="1282" /> people ought to be able to purchase statistics of the State at the cheapest possible money, in order that they might be thus encouraged, by purchasing them, to examine into the workings of this State.</P>
      <P>I also raise the question which I raised yesterday: that is, that publications of this kind ought to be made available for such deputies as desire to have them. At the present moment it appears to be the rule, contrary to the practice in other countries, that deputies have to purchase these books.  I think that ought not to be the case, because these are publications issued under the official sanction of the legislature, and are very germane to an understanding of the matters raised here.  There is a third matter&mdash;but perhaps the Minister might not so forcibly appreciate the value of the argument.  If you raise the cost of those publications to quite such a figure as they stand at at the present moment there are inconveniences imposed.  For example, about a quarter of an hour ago I laid my copy of the Estimates, charged at 10s., on the benches here.  Perhaps it was owing to the high price, but I came back a quarter of an hour afterwards and found it was missing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what preference he is giving towards the purchase of stationery in Ireland?  How much is this particular service costing the Central Fund?  With regard to what Deputy Figgis and other Deputies have said, I wish to point out that, although the prices have been raised, a profit of £10,000 for the sale of those publications is estimated this year.  I think that is not bad business at all. The sum of £15,000 for Dáil Debates seems to be tremendous, and we ought to try and limit our speeches.  I would like to know what is the exact amount of preference given to the Irish paper companies by these Departments, and what it is costing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>British Parliamentary publications were originally priced according to a low scale fixed by the House of Commons, and having no relation to the cost of production.  This was altered during recent years owing to the greatly increased cost of production, and this altered scale is carried out in Dublin in respect of Bills and Acts only.  Debates <Col N="1283" /> were fixed at a special rate of 1s. per copy, afterwards reduced to 6d., at which price they still stand.  The market has not gone up, although the price has gone down.  That explodes the theory of Deputy Figgis.  He will appreciate that when he is Minister for Finance by-and-bye.  All these theories he is putting forward now he will find out later are not as water-tight as they appear. Stationery Office publications are priced according to the cost of production, plus a commission to agents.  The price of this class of publication is materially affected by the number of copies printed, and that includes in all cases those required for the Public Service. Therefore, as a general rule, the receipts from copies sold never bring in the cost of production.  In the case of larger editions and reprints the receipts do more than cover the cost of production.  Recurring publications such as examination papers are priced at the same figure each year.  There was an article published in a morning newspaper recently dealing with the cost of these publications, in which we were criticised to the same purpose.  My information is that this newspaper has increased its cost to the public by 300 per cent.  Special issues, such as Departmental Reports, have, under the Statute, to be printed and presented, and occasionally the price fixed is much below the cost of production. As regards the Estimates Book referred to by Deputy Figgis, and which he has apparently lost, I hope to give him, a presentation copy to make up for it.  The price of that book worked out at 21s. per copy, and it was approved for issue at 10s.  The Irish Land Commission Report for 1920-1921 worked out at 42s., and the selling price was made 10s. The British Estimates, which were originally printed in separate classes, and ultimately issued in volume-form, were priced at 18s., although it was only a reprint, and 1,500 copies were printed, as against Dublin's 500.  With regard to Deputy Wilson's question I should say that a preference of 10 per cent. to 12½ per cent. is given for Irish manufactured material.  Four-fifths of the paper supplied up to January, 1923, was obtained from Irish firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>They mean McDonnell's, the Irish Paper Mills, and the North of Ireland Paper Mills.  I take it that they are all Irish manufacturers. The paper market was then in its lowest, and accordingly contracts for supplies to cover six months' consumption of certain items were made throughout Great Britain and Ireland.  £8,000 worth of paper was ordered, and of this Irish supplies were £4,079&mdash;McDonnell's, £1,499; Irish Paper Mills, £988; North of Ireland Paper Mills, £1,592.  There was no preference to Irish paper.  It has been bought as the cheapest in the open market where certain qualities were required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. O'BRIEN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point the Minister might consider: Whom are these documents printed primarily for? Are they printed for the use of the public primarily, or are they printed primarily for the use of the various Departments of the Government and the members of the Dáil?  Putting a price of 10s. on this document may mean anything.  There may be no sale for it at all.  It is not a document you would expect the average citizen to study carefully.  In fact, instead of requiring him to pay 10s. for it, it might be well-spent money if you were to pay him 10s. on condition that he studied it carefully.  The State would probably benefit.  I think the Minister for Finance should look at the matter from that standpoint.  If there was not the sale of a single copy, it would be necessary to print these documents for the use of members and of the various Government Departments, and any extra copies would only involve the cost of the paper and the machining.  The price to the outside public should be fixed on that basis.  That is a matter that should be considered, because the putting of exorbitant or prohibitive prices on this kind of document does not bring in revenue to meet the loss involved in the printing. We all sympathise with Deputy Figgis in the loss he has sustained.  I would suggest that it might be of advantage to him <Col N="1285" /> if he would move a greater distance from the Ministerial bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this question of the price of publications. I think it ought to be the business of the Stationery Office to encourage the sale of official publications as widely as possible, and I suggest it could be done on the lines that Deputy O'Brien has hinted at, without loss, at any rate, to the Exchequer and with great advantage to the political education of the country. With that object in view, I would suggest whoever is to have charge in future of the official sale of these publications ought to be obliged to make the most of the agency.  To put the corner of a shop and half the side of a window at the disposal of the Stationery Office for the sale of official publications is not satisfactory if one wants to encourage the sale of these publications.  I would suggest, if there were a shop specially opened for the purpose of selling official documents not only of this Government, but official documents of all sorts of Governments of countries in all parts of the world, especially when they are printed in a language that can be understood by the common people, that it would add to the political education of the people and assist the student in comparing administrative and legislative methods here with similar work in other countries.  The work of the Stationery Office need not be confined to the sale of the publications of the Saorstát. I suggest that there could be very satisfactory public work done by the encouragement of the sale of Blue Books, official publications, White Papers, Green Books, and any other coloured books of a public character from the various countries, especially those which print either translations into English or print the original documents in English.  Occasionally I have been privileged to read translations into English of the official publications of quite a number of Governments, and they do throw some light upon the way a country can be administered, especially when one is dealing with economic and industrial aspects of government. I suggest that it is well worth while considering the desirability of really setting about this as a business with the intention of selling as large a number of publications as possible.</P>

    <P>On the question of Irish paper, I am <Col N="1286" /> not quite sure that I understand the position of the Stationery Office.  I took down the words of the Minister in his first statement, in which he said &ldquo;that, subject to a preference for Irish-made goods, all the goods purchased were at the lowest price.&rdquo;  We had a further explanation that from 10 to 12½ per cent. of preference was given to Irish-made paper.  Is that the limit of preference?  Is it a preference of that amount that is understood in the fixing of contracts and the making of purchases, and is there no greater preference given, or is there no preference given to Dublin-made paper as compared with Antrim or Ballyclaremade paper?  I suggest that in view of the fiscal policy that the Government has adopted, if it can be called a policy, that there is reason for giving a greater preference to Dublin County made paper than the paper that is made in Ballyclare, and I would like to have an understanding that, to the fullest possible extent, Irish-made paper will be bought and used by the Stationery Office and by the printers who are printing for the Stationery Office, and that there should be a very stringent condition imposed upon the printers that the paper they are using is Irish-made paper.  I hope that Ministers will consider in this question the necessity for keeping alive this industry, at any rate, provided that one can make sure, as I have no doubt at all it is possible to make sure, that the firm supplying the paper are not taking undue advantage of the preference promised. Where the firm is doing its work reasonably well and its reason for the extra price is only because of handicaps that they cannot overcome, the paper should be inevitably Irish-made paper. Here again we raise this very thorny question of the extent of preference, and the wisdom of buying in the cheapest market, and the further question of whether one is to allow the very cheap articles, produced under special circumstances, to influence the purchase price to the detriment of Irish manufacture.  I would urge that this Department should be especially insistent upon the use of Irish-made paper and Irish printing, because we know, as a matter of fact, that there is good paper turned out in Ireland It is not now a question of experiment. There is good paper turned out, and one of the difficulties that have been met by <Col N="1287" /> the paper firms has been the opposition of artificially cheap productions.  I submit that it is not good business for the State to allow the introduction of those artificially cheap products to come into unfair competition with Irish-made products, with the possible result of ruining the industry, and being unable within any reasonable period of time to revive it.  I think the Minister would be well advised to tell us, or to reassure us more than he has done, what the policy of the Stationery Office is in regard to the amount of preference that it gives for Irish manufactured goods, and whether there is any preference given to good paper manufactured within the Saorstát as compared with Irish paper manufactured outside the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>With regard to the publications issued by the Department of Agriculture I should like to say that the Quarterly Journal contains articles of vital interest to the farmer, but out of every 100 farmers in Ireland I suppose not more than 10 know anything about it.  Their journal is not advertised either in the Press or by poster, as far as I know, and the price is rather high.  At all events, we are faced with the fact that people are not buying this Journal, though it is issued by the Department for the special advantage of the farmers.  If there was a big firm in Dublin using a Journal in order to advertise its wares it would take care it was issuing it in a form that would reach the customers.  It certainly would not indulge in high expenditure in getting out literature in a manner that would not reach the customers.  I think the Stationery Office should devote some time to striking out another plan for bringing all this valuable information and these Journals under the notice of the people for whom they are intended.  I would suggest that they would get out a weekly journal for the benefit of the farmers at a cheap price that would reach the farmers, containing valuable information and seasonable information for the benefit of the farmers.  The Journal published quarterly very often contains valuable information about crops that have been reaped, and it is too early for crops that have not been sown. A weekly journal at a reasonable price might possibly reach tens of thousands <Col N="1288" /> of farmers.  Deputy Johnson referred to the valuable literature in other countries. The Department of Agriculture in Washington will send any man in Ireland, on application, a copy of every leaflet, and they issue leaflets of the greatest possible interest.  Of course, they do not apply to the conditions in Ireland except generally.  The difficulties are not the same in all countries.  It is the same way in Vienna; they publish, not only in the Austrian language, but in the English language, very interesting documents upon agriculture.  I think the Stationery Office should try and reach people with some of the papers upon which they spend so much money.</P>

      <P>Each department is responsible for the requirements of its production, subject, of course, to the Stationery Office having some supervising control over the cost.  With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Johnson, I understand there is some slight difference between paper manufactured in the Saorstát as compared with that manufactured in Ballyclare.  Ballyclare paper is useful for certain purposes, and possibly not so suitable for others.  I have undertaken to look into that matter and see what can be done, but I do not think that it would be in the interests of the cause to give an undertaking.  If it were known that we were confined to a particular market we would probably not get any competition, and I suppose that the Deputy does not intend that competition should be restricted in any way.  I think that Deputies can rely on the fact that we will give fair consideration to goods manufactured in the Saorstát as against goods manufactured outside.  The average preference as far as I can find out is somewhere in the neighbourhood of from 10 to 12½ per cent., and I do not think that further preference is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In particular articles I am advised.  If the Irish article is satisfactory, there is a 10 to 12½ per cent. preference as against the foreign production, and in such cases we have taken the view that the best policy is to buy the home manufactured articles. Now it should be borne in mind that <Col N="1289" /> quite a large number of contracts were for a considerable period, some of them, I think, running into five years&mdash;from 1920 to 1925.  When there was an opportunity for re-considering them, notice was given of their re-consideration. After due notice had been given, we have taken that opportunity and readvertised. I think the Irish manufacturers have not got any cause of complaint with regard to the goods we have bought in the Stationery Office.  I think they get fair consideration, but I do not think that it would be advisable to let it go forth as between one firm and another in the Saorstát and outside that undue preference was going to be given to the firm in the Saorstát.  I think it would be unwise.  It might, of course, be borne in mind and the preference given, but I do not think it would be well to indicate that such a policy was imposed upon the Stationery Office.</P>

      <P>I do not think this particular Department is one upon which the Minister for Home Affairs can be wholeheartedly congratulated.  Looking at the figures for last year and for this year I observe, with some surprise, that the figures have gone up this year to more than double.  One might have hoped that with the dawn of peace a peace policy would be possible, even in the C.I.D., but these figures do not seem to show it.  The first question that one asks oneself is a question which I hope the Minister will be good enough to deal with. It is how many Criminal Investigation Departments are there, how many detective forces are there, and into how many sub-divisions is the C.I.D. divided.  One hears of detective departments of various kinds, but official information on the subject is difficult to get.  One has heard, during the past few months of crimes which all the detectives and all the detective departments put together have been unable to trace.  If we are spending £40,000 a year, and more, on secret service, it should not be possible for crimes of a political character to be committed and to recur&mdash;for it has happened more than once or twice&mdash;without evidence being obtainable to convict the guilty parties.  It is a very serious state of affairs in a new State that such things should be possible, as some of the undetected crimes that we have read of in <Col N="1292" /> recent times.  Now, I have a good deal of sympathy with the normal decent detective as such, because he has a very unpleasant job and a very difficult task, but I cannot help feeling that a section of the present detective force has not been recruited in the right place or from the right source.  Comparing some of your men with the Civic Guard you will see what I mean.  We should have as fine a force in Oriel House as the force which commands universal respect under General O'Duffy, but we have not.  One of these C.I.D. men the other day put it very frankly.  There are, he said, 200 of us natural gunmen.  Well, that somehow, is not my idea of a State detective I quite understand that circumstances have been abnormal, but I should like to hear the Minister inform us that the service is going to be combed out, and that the men who are not satisfactory will not be retained.  One has to make a great deal of allowance for propaganda in times like these, and I make every allowance for it, but there is no man in this Dáil but is well aware that the conduct of certain members of the detective forces has been exceedingly reprehensible.  There is no doubt at all that it has become a habit with some of them, when making a raid to treat the person raided, <i>ipso facto</i>, as an enemy of the State whom they are called upon to punish, and to launch forth all kinds of threats, and to do a good deal of damage in the house, to use language which ought not to be used and to pilfer and purloin.  I am not making this as a general charge, because, as I say, one does not know where propaganda ends and where truth begins, but one does know that that charge is true in a large number of cases.  I should like to have a little more evidence of strict control, a little more evidence of real discipline, and a little more certainty that a man in the detective force who misconducts himself will know that he is going to be punished for it, instead of having the matter treated lightly as a casual incident. The Dáil must remember that the persons whom you entrust with this very invidious duty must necessarily be given very considerable power, and, therefore, it is doubly necessary that you should be exceedingly vigilant to see that you have only the right men, and, if a wrong man gets in, that he is punished for wrong-doing.  I am not satisfied that <Col N="1293" /> that is being done.  I am satisfied that there is an element in that force that is not what it should be, and that should not have been allowed to enter it.  Now, during the past months, of course, these men have been doing a good deal of political work as well as ordinary criminal work, but surely it is not anticipated that that will go on indefinitely, or at all events, not on the scale on which it has been going on for the past nine months.  I ask the Minister to tell us why it is that this very substantial increase should be necessary at a moment when we are beginning to resume something like normal life.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing a similar estimate before, I asked the Minister for Home Affairs to increase the amount and enlarge the service, as I considered that this was an absolutely essential service.  At that time the country was reeking with crime, and I am certainly much surprised to hear Deputy Gavan Duffy criticise so severely the members of the C.I.D.  I have not met them, but I move around a good deal among the people, and I have not heard people find fault with them.  You cannot expect to raise a body of archangels or immaculates when you are dealing with a horde of criminals who go out at dead of night with revolvers, and give you half an hour to pay up £20 or they will burn your house.  When they go, bomb in hand or with land mines, and blow up your house and all it possesses, or when they go with the petrol tin and saturate children in bed, what can you expect?  I think it is just as well that a person should express what he feels, and I feel that the country is well satisfied with the work which the C.I.D. have performed, and it realises and appreciates it.  £40,000 in this Estimate is, to my mind, very small for a Criminal Investigation Department that has broken the backbone of the greatest conspiracy that was ever engineered to destroy a Government.  For the past two months in the City of Dublin it was absolutely necessary to destroy that criminal organisation.  The C.I.D. started out to destroy it, and they did it remarkably well.  As in all sections, there may be black sheep amongst them, but, as a whole, I think I am right in saying that they have been a splendid and highly discipline organisation.  I am sorry that we did not have them in Cork and other <Col N="1294" /> parts, for, if we had, the crimes that were committed would not have been heard of.  I hope we shall have the C.I.D. with us for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this force we have to go back to its beginning. Its beginnings were in the early months of last year, shortly after the Treaty was passed, and when it was becoming increasingly clear that there was, in this city, and, to some extent, throughout the country, a section of men who had their minds pretty definitely made up to attempt a <i>coup d'etat.</i>  It was not at that time a difficult proposition.  The Provisional Government had just been established. The Army, in so far as there could be said to be an Army at all, was in a very fluid and unsettled condition, and the late General Collins rushed three or four score of men into Oriel House under people whom he considered particularly trustworthy and reliable, and Oriel House started its career as a semi-military body. We may take it that the three or four score of men were not selected according to any drawingroom standards.  We may take it, too, that the establishment of that institution was something of a gesture; if you wish something of a threat, to those who were planning very dark and very violent enterprises.  Putting it baldly, it was the Provisional Government's Four Courts.  Now, matters went on on that basis for many months.  It was September of last year when Oriel House passed formally under the control of a Civil Department. Through all the months before that it was a semi-military body; in so far as it was supervised and controlled, it was under Army supervision and Army control.  Then during those months, too, this happened. The particular officers whom General Collins put in control, and on whom he relied to keep things straight, were recalled to the Army for definitely Army work, and it is not plain that throughout those months that institution was run on absolutely strict lines, or that there was discipline, or a very high standard of efficiency.  You have to take the institution in its setting, and the setting of the circumstances of the time, and there is no use claiming that there should have existed in that institution what did not exist in any other phase of national life at that time &mdash; discipline.  There was indiscipline in the country from top to <Col N="1295" /> bottom.  Was there any force or department in which it could be said that the standard of either efficiency or discipline was high?  About September last year the institution passed under civil control, and it passed definitely under the Home Affairs Department.  For about three or four months a genuine effort was made to make that institution, in the fullest sense of the word, a civil detective force, and the men confined there were intended for ordinary civil detective work.  Those who kept track of the daily or evening papers of the time will remember the success they had in tracing the ordinary abuses that are more or less inseparable from the life of a city, and in their successful prosecution of these abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then people had the brilliant idea that it was a comparatively defenceless place, and that it would be a bright stroke to blow up the institution and the members thereof.  Four mines were placed under the building, only one of which went off. If the four had gone off, not only that institution but every man in it, and a great many of the poor homes of the neighbourhood would have gone up along with it.  Then we slipped the leash, and those men were let out after the people who tried to blow them and their institution up, and who incidentally were trying to blow the State up.  Now, frankly, without claiming for a moment that matters there are perfect, that there is not much that ought to be remedied, much that can be regretted, just as there are things in every other Department of the national life that can be regretted, without claiming that, I claim that that little bunch of men down there in that building have done great work for this State, that they got after this criminal conspiracy here in Dublin in an energetic manner, day in and day out, night in and night out, with the maximum of risk and the minimum of ease.  They have been doing valuable work for this infant State, and it is not a right or a creditable thing that a Deputy should come in here and brand them as natural born gunmen. They may not handle a cup of tea as gracefully as the Deputy, but they have saved this State at a time when the Deputy's efforts were rather in a contrary direction.  Kipling said, &ldquo;Single men in barracks ain't exactly plaster saints.&rdquo;  Those men are not plaster <Col N="1296" /> saints.  I do grant that amongst the personnel that was established in the stormy circumstances of this time last year, there may have crept in some definitely indisciplined people, and even some whom it has not been possible to single out and deal with in an individual sense, but taking them as they are, they do not deserve the taunts or reflections cast on them here, and their work stands. They have broken the spinal column of this conspiracy against the State, and the individuals they have traced and the documents they have traced have led to valuable results not merely in the Metropolitan area but throughout the country. The successful operations in the Knockmealdown and Comeragh ranges lately, arose from documents that were traced here in Dublin.  Now, it was an easy thing to come in and raise this matter.  I have referred to it before.  I have given an assurance that no one in the Department held the view that everything was lovely in that particular garden, but it was an easy thing to come in and, simply making mountains of mole-hills, represent that Force as being simply one in which there was no good.</P>

They are both hated and feared for the work they have done by that section, and it is a way of signalling to that section to condemn them.  My position and that of my Department is clear.  We do not face this Dáil stating that everything in that institution is as it should be.  We do state that in view of the difficulties of the last year, in view of the pell-mell, haphazard way in which the institution was formed, simply a bunch of tough men, if you like, being sent in under their own officers, by the late General Collins, considering the circumstances of that time since, as much has been done towards bringing that force into a state of efficiency as is humanly possible to do.  I have no apologies to offer for it.  The time will come when the country will have some real appreciation and gratitude for the work those men <Col N="1297" /> have got in within the last six or seven months.  Its future is under consideration. I have no definite conclusion to lay before the Dáil on this Estimate, and essentially it is a thing which is receiving consideration.

      <P>I should like to know how soon Visiting Justices will be authorised to resume operations.  I shall be quite frank in saying that I consider the Government has very badly bungled the whole question of prisoners &mdash; one of their worst bungles &mdash; because, when you come to think of it, it would have been a very easy thing to allow prisoners to be visited, as they were in normal times, by certain Visiting Justices, so that there would be some reasonable outlet for <Col N="1298" /> grievances which always exist in a prison. There are, I suppose, legitimate grievances in every prison, and the Government's conduct in the matter is such that no complaint made by any prisoner can be checked by anyone outside.  The Ministry will say, &ldquo;Oh, it is propaganda,&rdquo; and other people will believe the complaint, no matter what it is.  It is obviously in the interest of the State that you should have someone visiting prisons from outside, and I suppose more particularly so when you have 10,000 or 12,000 men in prison, without any warrant of law whatsoever.  Our almighty Ministry would not condescend to have the matter legalised, because if they did the law would have contained checks and controls which would have irked the Ministry.  If they had proper tribunals established it would have enabled people to get out who were wrongly imprisoned. Every man here knows that there must be numerous prisoners against whom, from the most loyal Free State point of view &mdash; that of the Ministers themselves &mdash;there could be nothing, who have been arrested on suspicion.  What remedy have they?  I do not know whether the Ministry contemplate handing over the prisoners as a legacy to the next Government, or whether they will be released just before the Election.  It would, I think, be useful if we could have a statement of policy upon this very serious matter of the prisoners, a matter all the more serious now that the Government has not made an agreement with the Irregulars.  I desire, in this connection, to draw attention to one matter of considerable urgency.  In the course of their investigations the military or civil agents of the Government have, on three or four occasions, I think, seized sums of money which had been collected for dependents of the prisoners, and these seizures would probably be justified on the allegation that the money was intended for something else.  But, in fact, funds that were destined for prisoners' dependents, and for no other purpose, have been seized, sequestered, and not returned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I state the case in view of the fact that we have such things as &ldquo;Gratuities to prisoners&rdquo; and &ldquo;Contributions to Discharged Prisoners Aid Societies,&rdquo; if you look at P and Q in the Vote?  I quite understand that the Minister does not desire this matter discussed, but it is really a very serious matter.  To my certain knowledge there are people on the verge of starvation; there are people, who do not know whether they will have to-morrow's dinner or not, dependent on these prisoners, and several hundreds of pounds have been seized by the authorities, and all demands are met with silence &mdash; there is no return of the money.  I felt that I only had to raise the matter even for the Minister for Home Affairs to realise that that state of affairs cannot be defended. It is a monstrous thing, at a moment like this when violence has ceased and when one would have thought that even the most devoted adherents of the Ministry would have been delighted to do all they could to forward the interests of these unfortunate dependents.  I would like an assurance that any money taken in that way will be given back to those who are administering this Fund.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy please indicate the various sums that have been taken, the places from which they have been taken, the dependants for whom they would have been appropriated and any other information that he has at his disposal, particularly precise information of the starving dependants that he has mentioned?  We all have hearts, just the same as the Deputy, and looking over the last twelve months one is rather amazed at what became of the money that was seized by these grand idealists he told us about whose dependents are now on the verge of starvation, a seizure of £130,000 on one occasion. The Deputy smiles.  It is not a sum to be smiled at.  It is a very considerable sum.  We have now to levy it from the dishonest as well as the honest tax-payers, and I suppose we will have to levy it from the dishonest idealists that are amongst the Irregulars, as well as the honest idealists who are amongst them.  But to get up here and make an oratorical outburst and give a description of certain people who are starving by a Deputy who does not come near the Ministry and give any information about <Col N="1300" /> the monies seized, and so on, is, to my mind, not advocating the interests of the persons he pretends to have at heart. I do know of one case where deposit receipts for considerable sums have been taken charge of by us, and I do know that an honest case has not been put up, that they are the property of dependents of Irregulars or of persons in need.  I do know that the Irregulars, or their agents, have been told that if they did produce an honest case that it had been collected for that purpose, that it will be devoted to that purpose if guarantees are given to us that the money is bona fide for dependents. Huge sums of money have been taken not alone from banks, public institutions and other bodies like that, but from private individuals.  What has become of it?  Who has it?  The relatives of the unfortunate dependents that the Deputy has spoken of?  What are they doing with it?</P>

      <P>With reference to that point of order, the Minister is responsible for making this necessary, inasmuch as he charges against this Vote the pay of the Military Staff, the pay of the Governor of the Prison in whose charge the prisoners are.  The prisoner in these circumstances, while according to the argument of the President he is a prisoner whom he has a right to keep, is kept for preventative purposes.  The case of the Ministry in regard to these prisoners is that they are kept for the purpose of keeping them out of mischief. <Col N="1301" /> They are not tried and convicted, but the arguments run as though these were convicted prisoners.  I submit that in the case of prisoners from whom property is taken when they are arrested they ought at least to be able to say to whom that property shall be given, otherwise it is theft.  You are not only taking the prisoner's body to prevent his attacking the State, and avoiding the necessity for trying the prisoner, but you are taking his possessions.</P>

      <P>I will leave that with Deputy Gavan Duffy, but I will deal with the case of the property of prisoners which is personal to the prisoner, and which is being retained by the authorities, lost by the authorities, never returned by them, even when men have been released.  Members of the various departments, I do not know whether they are C.I.D., Protective Forces, or some secret organisation within the Army, but one or other of these uniformed forces have obtained possession of the property of prisoners.  One has a right to expect that that property would be deposited and catalogued and returned at least when the prisoners are released, but many cases have arisen in which no such return has been made. Ministers have no right to speak of these people as though they were criminals and as though what they had on their person was stolen property.  Unfortunately the state of mind of Ministers is too often that the fact of arrest is sufficient proof of guilt.  Now, touching this item, C.C., there are no details available. This is a provision for the current year, and I think we should be informed as to whether it is the intention to have military governors in these prisons for the whole of the year, and why the charge for the salaries of military governors should be put on this Vote against <Col N="1302" /> the Prisons Board.  The fact that these military officers are in charge of prisoners again makes it necessary to treat this Vote as the occasion for dealing with the condition of these prisoners, and I will support Deputy Gavan Duffy in his plea as to the necessity for some civil inspection of the prisons &mdash; if you like a medical inspection of the prisons, or an inspection of the prisons by Medical Officers of Health.</P>
      <P>A paragraph in the newspapers a few days ago, presumably supplied officially, gave us the information that there had been, as a matter of fact, a neutral investigation of the condition of the prisons.  Somebody representing the International Red Cross Organisation had the right of inspection of the prisons, and issued a report very satisfactory to the Administration.</P>
      <P>It was curiously condensed, and not at all the sort of report which one might expect, having been through the hands of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Unless it were edited for the benefit of the Irish newspapers, I can hardly imagine that a deputation of the International Red Cross would have issued a report, having visited Irish prisons and inspected them, so very short and summarised as that which appeared in the Irish papers, I suggest that it would be advisable for the Propagandist Department to give us the benefit of that report in full.  But, apart from that, if it is allowable for civilians from over the seas to visit the Irish prisons to testify to their good administration, surely there is good reason why civilians from within the Free State should be trusted by the Ministry to be honest critics, not to connive at the escape of prisoners just as much as the International Red Cross Deputation might be trusted.  It certainly would be to the credit of the Ministry to allow civilians &mdash; medical men &mdash; to visit the prisons and find out and report to the people the exact state of affairs in these prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are supposed to be ten or twelve thousand prisoners.  I have met prisoners who have been released, and who have spoken in terms very satisfactory, and indeed, laudatory, of the administration. I have met other prisoners who have just been as honest, but as denunciatory as the others have been laudatory. I am convinced from all I have heard, that some prisons are badly administered, <Col N="1303" /> that conditions in these prisons are unsatisfactory, while I am convinced that others prisons and other camps are satisfactory, and that the Ministry has no occasion for its hardly-begotten blushes. I would urge that it is not going to do any harm to the Ministry, if they have any confidence in their administration, to allow a Commission of Civilians, Medical Officers of Health, to visit the prisons and the prisoners and to report to them &mdash;to the Ministry itself and to the public &mdash;as to the condition of those prisoners and prisons.  There are, as I said, ten or twelve thousand prisoners, and they are sending letters abroad.  In addition, some of them are coming out &mdash; and they are reporting what they allege to be the facts.  Some stories are doing very great harm to the credit of the country, and those are the stories that will be circulated widely.  Other stories are coming out which are, as I said before, no discredit whatever, but rather are commendatory. These stories will not be circulated, and, in view of these arguments, surely there is no good reason why a body of men and women, capable of discriminating and capable of judging for themselves from what they see, should not be allowed to visit these prisons and report frankly and honestly upon the conditions of the prisons and upon their administration.  I would press that proposal upon the Ministry.  They can afford to do it without any risk of undermining discipline or any risk of allowing prisoners to escape.  I could never understand the refusal to allow this in the past.  There is surely no reason now to continue that refusal, and I would strongly urge the Ministers to allow such inspection for the satisfaction of the country, and if possible, a justification of their own administration.</P>

      <P>I would like to question one matter that was mentioned by Deputy Johnson.  He said that the Ministers had the idea that every prisoner collected, if in the possession of any money, was in possession of it dishonestly. I did not say so, and I was the only Minister who spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the inference from the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I mentioned <Col N="1304" /> one particular case in which a prisoner had got a deposit receipt.  There was no such inference to be drawn from my remarks, nor had I intended any such thing.  If there is an honest effort on the part of prisoners who have money, or deposit receipts, in their possession when arrested, or any other securities, to show that they are in honest possession of that money, we have no intention of keeping it.  But we are not, certainly, going to be humbugged by prisoners who, posing as honest men, have considerable sums of money in their possession, for which, when they are questioned, they are not able to give a reasonable explanation.</P>

      <P>I was also extremely surprised to hear the Deputy's statement that prisoners were relieved of some of their money when captured, and that particulars of these sums of money had never been catalogued.  I was surprised at that.  The President invited Deputy Gavan Duffy to give instances of cases where sums had been taken, which were Prisoners' Dependents' Funds, properly so called.  These instances have not been given by him.  I would like to hear from Deputy Johnson instances of the cases of petty pilfering he alleges, because now that is what it has come to.  I suggest to the Deputy that he ought not to take ex-parte statements from the other side of this question.  I dare say charges are made, but I have heard no proof given. I quite sympathise with the Deputy's point of view in trying to protect what is for the moment the under dog.  But there is something more important than that in a discussion like this, and it is that the truth should be told and generally known.  The facts are that everyone here in this Dáil and every Party knows of hundreds of cases in every county where men are made up as a result of what has happened in the country during the last year.  We all know of such cases. I know it myself in my own county.  I <Col N="1305" /> know of people who have deposit receipts in the Bank who will be well off for the rest of their lives as a result of the system of common thefts which masqueraded as Republicanism for the last year. There is not a single Deputy nor a Party here who does not know I am telling the truth.  It has been done wholesale in every county.  For the last six months farms of land have been bought and paid for at prices that would surprise Deputy Gorey, at £70 and £80 and £100 an acre. We all know of these cases, but we will never be able to prove them.  These farms have been bought with money stolen from the banks, from the post offices, and from the big houses in the district.  That was done wholesale.  You cannot treat what has happened as if it was, on the whole, Republicanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>A point of order was raised before as to whether we were right, in discussing the question of property taken from a prisoner or prisoners, to bring in the question of Republicanism. No question has been raised on the merits or demerits of Republicanism, but now the Minister is going into the question of Republicanism on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree; I did not think the discussion was in order, but the point was raised that we were taking money from the pockets of prisoners.  I point out that when you make a charge of this kind you must remember that in every county in Ireland, as every Deputy and every Party here knows, there are plenty of instances of men who have been made up for life as the result of what has happened during the last twelve months&mdash; Irregularism, masquerading as Republicanism, by looting from their neighbour, looting the local post office, and looting the banks or the local land owner's house.  I know men who have deposit receipts for monies in the Banks who never had them there before this past year.  Everyone knows them, and we want to know where they got that money. We are all morally certain in our own minds where they got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the welter of the last year you could not prove things the same as when conditions were normal, when ordinary civilians came forward to give evidence, and when jurymen did their duty as they should do it, without a gun being put at their ears.  We cannot close our eyes to <Col N="1306" /> those facts, and we cannot forget, when we find an irregular with a large sum of money in his pocket, that it is necessary to enquire where he got it.  The least we might do is to save the tax-payers, and the least we might do is to find whether the irregular got the money at the local post office, at the local bank, or at the local big house &mdash; the local land-owner's house.  Somebody will have to pay for that some day, and when we find irregulars with large sums in their possession, the least we are bound to do is to find out where they got it.  The Deputy stated that we have not got accounts of those monies.  I do not know what amount of money is in the hands of the authorities arising out of the capture of prisoners. The statement that these monies have not been catalogued and that these monies will not be accounted for is a statement that I did not expect from the Deputy.  I merely wish to remind the Dáil of those facts, so that the discussion relating to the funds collected for Prisoners' Dependents should be treated as it should be, and we should not come to the conclusion that we should treat what they now call the Prisoners' Dependents' Fund in the same way as in 1920 and 1921, when funds were put up by honest men, even if they were poor, and put up for an honest purpose.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the International Red Cross visit to Irish prisons, and he also said how important it was to have the prisons visited by impartial people.  The situation in Ireland is, that since the Treaty there was no branch of the Red Cross here, and, under those circumstances in the ordinary way the International Red Cross in Geneva took an interest in the humanitarian arrangements in the country. The International Red Cross has an international status, and they sent a deputation here.  I agreed that the members of the deputation should visit the prisons.  I was not aware whether their report would be good or bad.  They have issued a preliminary report which Deputy Johnson referred to, and I understand they are going to issue a fuller report later on.  From the point of view of impartiality, I think Deputy Johnson will agree that it would be impossible to get anybody who would be as impartial, or whose word would carry equal weight in this country, as that of the International <Col N="1307" /> Red Cross at Geneva.  They made their report, and I think that more or less speaks for itself.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to avoid him mixing me up with the case which was alleged to have been answered by the Minister for Agriculture, and the case I was making. The Minister for Agriculture is very adept at that sort of thing, and I want to try to avoid the necessity for the Minister for Home Affairs repeating the performance.  The case I am referring to is the case of prisoners whose houses are raided, and who are taken into prison.  The searchers, whoever they may be, perhaps the persons who make the arrest, take property from the prisoner. It may be presumed by the prisoner that there is some record being taken of any money and property, but in many cases the prisoner never again sees his property. I am not talking about deposit receipts.  Perhaps the Minister might be charged with having possession of a deposit receipt belonging to me, because they have taken all the property that was handed them by the British Government. Deposit receipts may mean nothing, but where men are dependent for their living upon weekly earnings, a very small sum of money is of great importance to the dependents of that prisoner. If, as is the fact in many cases, prisoners' friends or relatives have no access to, and know nothing about, the Prisoners' Dependents' Fund, or about the Republican propagandists, and are entirely ignorant of the Organisation they have no means of applying for assistance, and they are left on the charge of their immediate neighbours.  It is this kind of administration, and this kind of looseness that I am referring to when I am talking about monies taken from prisoners of which no account is given, either while they are prisoners or after they are released.</P>

      <P>I trust we will get particulars of money taken from prisoners and unaccounted for on their release, <Col N="1308" /> and proof that they had it.  While the Deputy is prepared to say that no such proof ought to be necessary, I am prepared to say that it is at least as necessary, as it is necessary to support the case that the money was taken from them by some officer of the Government and never returned, never checked, never catalogued.  The Deputy is rather insistent that these men should be presumed to be archangels until proved to be nearer to the contrary, but I am rather insistent on this &mdash; their mere statement as against people for whom they have naturally a rather venemous mentality should not be accepted without critical examination. This is not the only lying propaganda that is indulged in, as the Deputy knows, or ought to know.  Sub-head (C.C.) states that it has been definitely decided to transfer the payments provided for under this sub-head to the Army as from the end of the current month.  If I were asked just why it was ever necessary that they should be accounted for by a civil department, I am not sure that I could say.  It was administratively convenient at the time when these men were simply in the prisons, before the intern ment camps were started, and were in close touch with the officers of the Prisons Board.  The vote we have been bearing under this head up to the present &mdash;I think Deputy Johnson had some curiosity about it &mdash; includes the following:&mdash; 3 Governors at £800; 1 Governor at £700; 5 Deputy Governors at £650; 1 Vice O.C. at a similar rate; 33 Clerks, 3 at £6, 2 at £5, 26 at £4 4s., and two at £4 per week; 3 typists, 1 at £2 4s., 1 at £2, 1 at £1 16s. 8d. per week, and 1 Clerk lent from a Government department who receives £2 10s. a week.  This is the vote that we have been bearing up to the present, and there is some question as to whether it should ever have been borne by the Prisons Board. Off-hand I could not give an exact statement of the considerations leading to the state of affairs, but it has been agreed between the Departments that it should end at the close of the current month.</P>
      <P>On the questions of the present conditions, I do not want to add much to what the Minister for External Affairs has said.  This international body did send over delegates.  They were brought through not merely the prisons but through the internment camps, and they will report in due course.</P>

This point has to be remembered that, without reasonable co-operation where you have a large number of men imprisoned or interned, the conditions within these places of imprisonment or internment cannot be ideal. Now, so far from there being such cooperation, these men seem in places to have lost their senses; they seem to have had no realisation of the danger to their own health by cutting up their blankets and stuffing them down the lavatories with a view to choking them; all their energies seem to have been directed towards making these places uninhabitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly the practice in Limerick prison, and in Mountjoy by one particular group, and also in Galway prison.  That was one form.  Another form was to smash the hot water pipes and then complain of the cold.  I could show the expenditure of very large sums, recurrent expenditure of very large sums, for repairs to damage of that kind.  Finally, we were forced to the view that this was simply an attempt to cause the Government to keep on spending public money repairing these things which were broken as frequently as they were repaired, and finally we had to direct the Prisons Board that, while sanctioning one more repair of a particular kind, in the event of future breakages they should not be attended to until such time as the prisons were clear of military prisoners.  The smashing of the hot water system was continued through the prisons, and after the direction we had given to the Prisons Board we did not repair the system.  Then the prisoners complained of cold and of insufficient bed covering when they had burned or torn up the blankets.  There were complaints of sleeping on the floor when they had burned the beds or otherwise destroyed the bed boards and mattresses, and of discomforts they suffered.  Where they had torn up the floors and broken the windows I am not going to say that there <Col N="1310" /> had not been physical discomfort to prisoners.  There has been.  In Maryborough, for instance, where they tried to burn the prison, there have been discomforts. Men were only served out with blankets on condition of signing for them, and saying that they took responsibility for them, and that, if anything happened to the blankets, they recognised there was no case for another supply.  Many of them refused to give any such undertaking; they refused to accept responsibility for a second set of equipment that was to be served out to them.  In the circumstances, they did not get that equipment, and I have no doubt they were most uncomfortable.  I am very sorry that they were so foolish and so utterly unreasonable as to take up that attitude, but when you are dealing with public property, and with public funds, there is appoint beyond which you cannot get in lavishness and folly.  It will, of course, be a great relief to the ordinary routine prison service when it will be possible to take these military prisoners out of the premises of the Prisons Board and bring them entirely into military custody and into internment camps.  They have done enormous damage to public property and to the property of the Prisons Board, and have been rather a strain on the officials generally.  It is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Defence when he will be able to place these men entirely in military custody, and entirely in internment camps, rather than in gaols.  The increase in the Vote is attributable, mainly, to three items: (1) for increased numbers of staff in detention camps over the whole of this year; these camps were only open for a portion of last year; (2) provision for a greater number of prisoners than provided for in previous Estimate; (3) the need for repair to damage wantonly done by prisoners in retention in Civil Prison buildings.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say, in view of his answer to a question that there are three Military Governors at £800 a year, one at £700, and five Deputies at £650, what is the reason why such a distinction is made as between Military Governors and Civil Governors.  According to the Vote, the salaries of the Civil Governors are:&mdash; Class I., £400-£500; Glass II., £300-£400; Class III., £250-£300, and Deputies, £250-£300.</P>

There is also the fact that the work and the strain on the Military Governor is out of all comparison with the ordinary hum-drum routine duties of the Civil Governor of a prison. It is very responsible work and involves a great deal of night duty.  The proper supervision of the prison requires that the man in charge be on his feet at all hours of the night to receive prisoners and to see that the guards are doing their duty.</P>

It is worth bearing that in mind, when dealing with the cost of living.  Here you have food bought wholesale and not extravagantly&mdash;reasonable, substantial food, for reasonable men and women, and the cost of food for a man and his wife is 25/9 a week.  In dealing with clothing, we see that the cost is round about 8/6 per week for a man and wife.  Thirty-four and three pence is the cost of food and clothing for a man and his wife.  I want Deputies to bear in mind that usually in this country there are attached, in the course of time, to a man and wife, a number of children, and they usually desire to live in a house and have other amenities of life, which all cost money, so that when you think about rates of wages you can refer to the Dundrum Asylum, and there you have statistical proof at hand provided by the Ministry.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Dáil it is the duty of the Government to make provision for compensating the potato-growers of North Louth for the loss of their crops, which have been rendered unsaleable by the scheduling of the district covered under the Black Scab in Potatoes (Special Area, Ireland) Order, 1923, issued by the Department of Agriculture, dated 14th February, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was dealt with in April last, and a good case was put up by Deputy Hughes and other members who spoke.  I was not present at the time.  A good deal has been said, and everything that was said has been said well, but I think due consideration was not given to the position.  I was brought out to this district, and brought over it, and saw an extraordinary and very unfortunate position.  I think if the authorities have not an order that this could come under, it is our duty to make an Order whereby it will be treated.  We have the Diseases of Animals Act, which brings in Foot and Mouth Disease, Tuberculosis, Swine Fever, and several other things have been brought in where cattle have been destroyed in the interests of the State. You have here an area with about eight thousand tons of potatoes, any single one of which would be able to bring Black Scab out of a district.  A few months ago there was 12,000, pow it has come down, and while those potatoes are there it is a festering sore.  Naturally, they will not keep them there; everyone knows there is a leakage.  As a matter of fact. they have leaked into this district from Down, one of the Northern Counties. While they are there it is a source of danger not only to Louth but to all the other counties of Ireland.  As men of the world we know that while men have a crop, and want the means of subsistence they will fight to get it, and will sell those potatoes, and they are selling them.  I contend it ought to come under the same heading as the Diseases of <Col N="1315" /> Animals Act, or any other Act put in force for the safety of the whole community, and an immediate order ought to be issued to bring it under that head. Apart altogether from that I have been through this district, and have seen the people, and I know the difference between drones and workers.  If I ever saw workers in my life they are those people.  They are certainly a desirable element in the community.  They have been working under difficulties, and the difficulty will be appreciated more when I say that that particular district is only fit for two crops &mdash; potatoes and barley It is fit for nothing else.  It is not land which can be set to everything.  It is not suited even for oat growing or wheat growing.  These people are human.  They have no other means of existence or subsistence, and they are trying to get a market for their stuff, and the disease is coming out.  This contamination will spread, and the area affected this year will be larger next year.  Assistance has been found for every other class of the community, and, I have no hesitation in saying, for people not half as deserving as those people.  This is not a dole.  They have too much pride to ask this as a dole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen 150 tons of potatoes there with one man, 100 with another, 50 with another, and so on. Nothing can be done with them.  It may be said that these people engaged in a commercial transaction and failed, but it is not a question of a commercial transaction at all, as far as we are concerned; it is a question of the safety of the rest of the country.  These people have nothing at the moment.  They paid for manuring the crop last year, and they did not realise anything.  They are in debt, and they have put in a crop this year without any manure.  If they do not get manure to utilise on the crop within the next month or six weeks they cannot use it at all, with the result that perhaps there will only be one-fifth of a crop or no crop at all.  Not alone do they not want a dole, but they are prepared to offer to the Government or to anyone else the whole crop at £1 per ton.  That is all we are asking for them.  I hope I am not going to get the answer that <Col N="1316" /> nothing can be done.  I know that the Ministry and that every Deputy in the Dáil has as much sympathy with these people as Deputy Hughes and I have, and that it is only a question of finding the best means of dealing with the matter. I have seen a 20 per cent. preference given to other classes of Irish industry, and I do not know whether there is precedent for that.  In this case we have an Irish industry and Irish people. Surely we are not going to be told that there is no precedent for this or no Order under which it can be done?  Is there an Order under which preference can be given to Irish goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I ought to be more concerned with the welfare of the whole country than with that of a particular district, but while this huge crop is there it seems to me that it would be like shutting up a plague or a disease in a house without removing the cause, if we were to leave that crop lying there.  You cannot do that, because you know it will spread. You cannot confine Black Scab in this area while that quantity of potatoes is lying there.  I think it would be a kindness to the rest of the country to meet this difficulty in some way, as it would prevent the extension of black scab to a larger area.  As a matter of fact, I do not think the people would thank you at all unless you do your very best to prevent the spread of this disease.  It is the duty of the Government, to my mind, to protect the rest of the country, and I think that the danger to the rest of the country is one of grave moment, and that there is the strongest reason why this crop ought to be destroyed if it cannot be taken out of the country, and that the people should be compensated. I believe the market in England has broken down, and that the potatoes would not make the cost of packing or transit.  I suggest that if the Government are not prepared to take over the crop and market the potatoes or make some use of them, that they should destroy the crop and compensate the owners.  These people are one of the finest people I have ever been amongst; one of the most industrious people and the last people in the world to ask anything of anybody, and I think that we, as a young nation, would be behaving very badly if we allowed ourselves to be prevented by technical barriers.  It is our duty to remove the barriers and to provide <Col N="1317" /> a new Order if necessary, and I ask the Minister for Agriculture to consider this and meet the case in some humane way.  I am sure he will try to do that, as I have full confidence in the Minister.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I cannot say very much beyond what I said before when the matter was discussed on the 13th April.  I put the case to the Government and the Dáil as best I could, and I laid the bare facts before them.  At that time the Minister for Agriculture could not see his way to give any monetary assistance to those people.  Everything that Deputy Gorey has said on the matter is true, and I am delighted that he has such a good opinion of my constituents.  The only thing is that I hope he has not an eye on them. I would be inclined to think from some remarks he passed that he was casting an eye that way.  If he is, I can assure him that these people whom he describes as hardy workers, and such decent and respectable people &mdash; which I know they are &mdash; will not be caught with chaff from Deputy Gorey.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has described the case very fully, and, as far as I am concerned, I give it my whole-hearted support.  I am sure that in doing that I will be voicing the opinion of every Deputy in the Dáil who wishes to see everybody, not alone in that area, but in the whole country, flourishing and to see that particular industry in a flourishing condition.  If the Deputy can suggest any means that have not been suggested before, so much the better.  But the case he has made at the moment is the best case he can make, I believe, but it has been made before.  If the Deputy on that occasion had remained in the Dáil and lent his voice to the case that was then made, perhaps a different complexion would have been put on it than was put on it by the Minister at the time. Perhaps he was called away owing to some unavoidable cause, but it certainly looked strange that the Deputy left the Dáil immediately the adjournment was moved on that occasion.  That may be a personal matter, but as far as the actual state of affairs in that area is concerned it is very bad indeed.  I have made inquiries very recently on the subject and <Col N="1318" /> I am prepared to verify the statement that the actual sum per ton that is being paid at the moment to the grower of potatoes is ten shillings.  It is impossible even to get them away at that price.  I have gone over his ground before, and I do not believe in saying the same thing twice.  I therefore content myself with seconding the motion.</P>

      <P>I am not, as everyone knows, a farmer, and I am not a present nor a prospective representa tive for the County Louth, but it is a very curious thing that outside my own native county, and part of Co. Limerick, there is no corner of Ireland I know so well as the Barony of Lower Dundalk. In that barony I think I have walked over almost every acre of the two parishes of Carlingford and Cooley, where these potatoes are grown.  I have been down there nearly every year for twenty years, and I have never seen people like them to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before, and to get a potato crop out of what looks to be a most unfruitful soil.  I do not think this is a case for subsidising people, or for doles, or anything of that sort, but when it was discussed by the Dáil some time ago, it appeared to me these farmers were asking for a profit on a crop that they would have got, if the bottom had not fallen out of the market.  I did not think that was a fair request, but I do think that the safety of the country which depends to a very great extent on the potato crop is now involved in the matter.  As long as these people had any market elsewhere for their potatoes I think they were bound to go there.  It seems to be admitted now that they cannot get these potatoes out of the country, as the price they would get in France or England or other places would not pay the cost of carriage, and so you are keeping in the country, because you cannot get it out of it, what Deputy Gorey said may make it a regular plague spot. Smuggling has been going on in the county, as one reads occasionally of prosecutions of people for breaches of this Order that was made, prohibiting the export of these potatoes from this country. The whole barony has a sea coast, and there is very little to prevent potatoes getting away by sea from the Barony of Lower Dundalk finding their way to other parts of Ireland, and <Col N="1319" /> spreading this plague through the whole country.  I think there is ground for suspicion that the plague came across Carlingford Lough from the potato-growing district of Kilteel.  If these people have this crop in the pits it will find its way out, if the owners can get any money for it, in spite of any precautions you can take.  I heard the Minister tell us on the last occasion that very little was known about this disease, except that it was a very virulent and a very infectious one. Therefore, it seems to me, in the interests of the State, that this crop should be seized and destroyed, and that people whose crop is seized should be compensated by getting the market value of the crop as it is to-day.  That is the law in almost every other case where private property is seized for the public good. Deputy Gorey mentioned pleuro-pneumonia in live-stock, where the compensation must be according to an assessment of whatever may be the market value.  There is the Cattle Plague Order and the Swine Fever Order, and in these cases where live stock is destroyed, compensation must be paid.</P>
      <P>There is another case with which we are more familiar.  Under the Public Health Acts if I have infectious disease in my house the Corporation can come in and seize bedding and other materials which are liable to lead to a spread of the infection, but they must pay reasonable compensation for the property that is destroyed.  With a large crop like this in the interests of the country it should not be given a chance of getting away. My impression is that the Minister for Agriculture would not find it impossible to dig out some authority that would enable him to seize and confiscate this crop.  If there is any such authority in my humble judgment, it ought to be exercised in the interests of the country. It is only reasonable that people whose crop is destroyed should receive fair compensation, not a profit, but whatever they could get if there was an open market. It appears that the total compensation for the amount of potatoes in this district would not probably be very large, and if something is not done to destroy this infectious crop it may cost the country very much more to put it down elsewhere next year, or the year after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>When this <Col N="1320" /> question was raised by Deputy Hughes, recently, the case was made by the Minister for Agriculture that these people had been warned, and warned more than once, of the danger of persisting in growing the potato crop in the same place year after year, notwithstanding that the infection has displayed itself. Now, as the case was presented by Deputy Hughes, it appeared to me most convincing that the situation was exactly parallel with that in the case of the slaughter of cattle for the saving of the stock in the rest of the country, and that notwithstanding the case made by the Minister for Agriculture that these people were offenders.  The reason I was not at all convinced by the case made by the Minister for Agriculture on that occasion, is that we cannot overlook that the Department of Agriculture served to these people &mdash; or, at any rate, was instrumental in procuring for them &mdash; seeds of potatoes which were declared by experts to be immune from Black Scab, and there are, I understood from Deputy Hughes, stocks of potatoes of that particular type.  I know of three, our old friend the old champion, and there is the Irish Queen and another potato of Scotch ancestry, which are notoriously immune from this disease.  But the difficulty is that the spores which come from the disease, and which are capable of multiplying rapidly, can be disseminated through the country if any portion of the soil attaching to the tuber finds its way elsewhere and, just as in the case of the dissemination of Foot and Mouth Disease by birds and by the boots of men walking across the fields, in the same way these spores can be carried, and the difficulty is then a very serious practical difficulty. These people have put in immune potato crops and have grown them and now, because of their being in an infected area, and as the market in England is not forthcoming, they have stocks of potatoes which are quite healthy but at the same time are suspect, and it is desirable that they should not be circulated in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the recollection of Deputies that Deputy Doyle proposed that a subsidy by way of loan, should be given to these people to invest in pigs to use up the supplies, and it struck a great many of us at the time that that was a very practical suggestion.  But the trouble was that the <Col N="1321" /> Minister for Agriculture had no power to do that.  It seems to me, therefore, an easier plan than merely to seize the crops and destroy them, to pass rapidly a One Section Act that would enable the Minister for Agriculture to come to the rescue. It seems, so far as as my knowledge of Black Scab goes, that infected potatoes do not need to be destroyed.  They undergo a natural destruction themselves. It is really suspect tubers that would require destruction, and we are dealing now with supplies of potatoes, as I pointed out, which are quite healthy and are not affected by the disease, and are merely possible disease carriers because of extraneous circumstances.  Now, it does seem to a looker-on, as I am, with regard to agricultural matters merely a looker-on, that this, being a section of the greatest industry in the country, for whose welfare we are all most vitally concerned, a small expenditure of money in an emergency like this would be well invested. One remedy that might be taken and has not been attempted yet, which, of course, naturally occurs to me as a Professor, is to endow, or rather offer, some large prize for research work.  That has been done in Continental countries with regard to various scourges and plagues that have affected the agricultural industry, and I have no doubt, if it were made worth while, that scientific research would be prosecuted persistently into this and what to do with the infected soil would be discovered.  There is in law a remedy for every complaint, and science has shown it is able almost to rival law in providing remedies for every evil.  This is a case on which the Agricultural or rather the Technical Education Department, could usefully expend some of its funds, and it is a point in which Universities, with their Chairs of Agriculture, their Agricultural Departments, could come to the relief of the Nation if it were made worth their while.</P>

    <P>There is no necessity to labour this point.  It was laboured extensively on the last occasion, and it has been added to this evening and we have, I think, pretty representative evidence that it is the general feeling of all sections in the Dáil that something should, be done for this community. It may be argued that the money cannot be found, but it could be found.  It is only a matter of a few thousand pounds, and it would really be in the nature of an insurance against great harm to the whole argricultural industry.  It is really a matter of ensuring that the disease will not be allowed to spread throughout the Free State, and possibly mean ruin to a considerable extent of future potato crops.  It ought not to be beyond the ingenuity of the Ministry to find a way out with dignity to itself, and with advantage to these people.  As other Deputies have said, they are not exactly begging, they are not wanting what is commonly called &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; but if it is a good and useful thing in the national polity that other diseases should be treated drastically in order that they may not do very extensive harm, then this should be dealt with in the same way. A Deputy on the last occasion very pertinently pointed out that the powers that now exist for the purchase of seeds were originally acquired because of certain distress in the West, and these powers were given in order that that distress might be relieved.  This is not exactly a parallel case, but it is a somewhat similar case, and it should be possible for the Dáil and the Ministry to meet the case. I believe that if they gave it further consideration and made a fair attempt to meet the people concerned, that a satisfactory arrangement could be made.  I ask the Dáil to vote for Deputy Gorey's <Col N="1323" /> motion.  He will not put many motions before the Dáil which either I or my colleagues will ask the Dáil to vote for, but I certainly do ask the Dáil to vote for this, and I would ask the Ministry to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am as anxious as any Deputy, naturally, I think, to do something, if possible, in a case like this, but I would impress on the Dáil the necessity of not being rushed into anything, or not coming to a conclusion without being sure of all the data.  It is not usual, as Deputy O'Shannon pointed out, to have a Resolution backed by himself and Deputy Gorey and Deputy FitzGibbon. <i>Absit omen</i>!  Really the subject is not as important as such an omnious combination as that would lead one to believe. There is a lot more cry than wool about this.  I am quite prepared to admit that the people in Cooley and Dulargy are suffering, and suffering perhaps seriously, but their case is not nearly so bad as it has been stated.</P>

      <P>Let us get at the facts. Now, first, this is not the only area in the Free State scheduled.  We first scheduled an area in 1917; there is not a word about it, and it is scheduled to-day.  You know the old principle, &ldquo;If you only have a goat to sell, have him in the middle of the fair,&rdquo; is a good one.  We hear a lot about Cooley and Dulargy, but we have other districts scheduled, and there is not a word about them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Much the same.  In 1921 we had a conference in Dundalk.  It was after the Black Scab this disease showed itself in the other district higher up.  By agreement with the people in Cooley and Dulargy, and with the merchants in Dundalk, who used to handle their potatoes, we scheduled Cooley and Dulargy for the year 1921-22, from March to March, and we arranged that we would give the assistance of the Department towards selling these potatoes in England.  They had always sold their potatoes in England and they never had an Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the area was scheduled they practically always sold their potatoes in <Col N="1324" /> England, but, on account of the scheduling we arranged that we would supervise the store-dressing, and generally give the assistance of the Department's officials in the shipping and handling of potatoes up there.  This was before Black Scab broke out.  It was in 1921 that the conference took place with the growers from the district, and the merchants in Dundalk. In 1922 Black Scab appeared, and there was another conference.  It was agreed that we would schedule the area again, and for 1921 and 1922&mdash;I mean by that the spring of 1922 to the spring of 1923 &mdash; the people there understood clearly, and agreed that their potatoes were only to be sold in England, and they could not sell in Ireland.  There is no question about it, they understood perfectly well for two years what the chances of their business speculations were.  As I have said, they never sold potatoes to any extent in Ireland, and if at this moment &mdash; I could hardly say at this moment, because already 53 per cent. of the potatoes are sold &mdash; or three months ago, we allowed the potatoes into Dundalk, there would be no better price given in Dundalk than in Cardiff.  The prices would not be as good.  That is the fact.</P>
    <P>The people there clearly understood when they were growing potatoes in 1921-22 that they could only sell them in England.  From past experience they understood they had no other market. It came as no surprise to them.  The fact of our scheduling the area made no great difference.  It merely meant that we were helping them to handle the potatoes.  Deputy FitzGibbon pointed out that if as a result of State interference you destroy a man's business or property you are bound, or at least it is usual, to compensate him at the market value of the potatoes at the time.  I am willing to meet him on that point.  We are not interfering with anybody.  A very large amount of potatoes go out of the district.  The potatoes are of a special variety, the Lockhart variety; they are not bought much in Dublin, and are bought only in a few places in Ireland. They are bought largely in Cardiff.  If we allowed the potatoes on any large scale into Dundalk, the only market for them, the price would be no better.  We are allowing them to Cardiff, or anywhere else in England, and, as far as the Department's interference is concerned, it <Col N="1325" /> has not cost them two pence.  That is an absolutely fair statement of the case. Perhaps from the point of view of a Minister for Agriculture it would be a nice thing to get money and dole it out to those people in Cooley and Lordship, and any other of the affected townlands.  Let us be clear, if we are giving our money, what is it given for?  We are not giving it because we interfered with their market, or because we put them to any loss. They have the market they always had, and it does not matter two pence to them whether or not we let the potatoes out. There is no demand for Lockharts, and if we are giving them compensation, it is because they entered into a speculation with their eyes open, and it did not come off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  We have done something.  Deputy Hughes has been practically living with me for the last three weeks in regard to this question, and as a result of his representations, we sent an official of the Department to Cardiff, and he has arranged with the Cardiff merchants that very large quantities of the potatoes will be taken there.  My information is not that potatoes are being sold at 10s. a ton, but that there is a profit of 10s. a ton. I know that is not big, but it is as good a profit as anybody who has grown potatoes anywhere else is getting.  We have got very large quantities of the potatoes away, and the figures are something as follows:&mdash;Exports of potatoes from Belfast this year are only 20 per cent. of the exports of last year.  Exports of potatoes from Dundalk this year represent 53 per cent. of last year's exports, and practically all those potatoes came from the scheduled area.  In view of those figures, how could the State step in and make a special case?  Take Belfast port, where there is nothing to stop potatoes of all kinds going through.  They exported 20 per cent. of last year's exports. The fall is due to the fact that there is not as good a market as last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The potatoes were not <Col N="1326" /> sold in Belfast; they were sold in England, and they included all sorts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that it would have any bearing upon the case. I am taking the Belfast Port.  Potatoes are exported from Belfast port, and this year only 20 per cent has been sent from Belfast port of their usual potato export. Dundalk &mdash; practically all the potatoes come from the districts of Cooley and Lordship&mdash;has sent through 53 per cent. of its usual export.  Now, it does not matter about the price, but it shows that in that matter they have done as well and a little better than some people who have not been scheduled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get the exact figures.  The figures for the last three months of the export of potatoes from this district have been 53 per cent. of last year.  Is that clear?  For the same period the export of potatoes from Belfast is only 20 per cent. of last year's. If these figures show anything they show that Belfast is not as well off in this matter. I may say that the potato centre of Belfast would deal with potatoes that would come through the market there in the ordinary way.  If these figures show anything they simply show that the market for potatoes generally is not as good as it was last year; and they show that the market for potatoes from this district is a little better as the result of the arrangements we have made than the markets for other districts where no special arrangements have been made. That is clear in this case.  It is also clear that if you are to give these people anything you are giving it not because the State has interfered with them, but be <Col N="1327" /> cause their trade was unprofitable for the year.  There may be reasons of expediency why you are going to give them something, but it is not for the same reason as you pay for cattle slaughtered under the Diseases of Animals Act or any other animals slaughtered under that Act.  It was pointed out that if these potatoes were left there they will trickle out.  Well, 53 per cent. of the potatoes are gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figures show that six or seven thousand tons are taken already, or agreed to be taken, and the Department's inspectors advise us that as a result of the bad few weeks that we have just passed through and the consequently late crop of potatoes this year, that a very large percentage, as compared with any other year, will go.  The case, in any event, is not nearly so bad as stated.  It is not a case of having the whole crop left there on the field.  A very considerable percentage of the potatoes at the worst will go.  If it is a fact that we will be able to arrange to dispose of these at a very small price as a result of the bad market, and if it is a fact that in any event the district were scheduled or not they would never have a better market, I do not see a case for giving special treatment.  I cannot see it.  I do not see a case for passing special legislation for this particular case.  If you do pass special legislation to meet this case, are you going to invite other scheduled districts?  If we are handing out money at all we might as well hand it out all round.</P>

      <P>They have not made much noise about it.  There is no potato grower in the North who has not a surplus, a big surplus.  Deputy O'Shannon asked what was the alternative, what else had they to do.  They have not extra good land, they have light land, but it is much better land than the land in Galway, Connemara, Kerry or a great many of the other counties I could name. It is not bad land, and it is not so much <Col N="1328" /> that it is bad land, but that it is land that is particularly suitable for growing potatoes, and it is so suitable that they have made very big profits, and they refuse to turn to anything else or even to mix their farming.</P>

Parts of Clare or Galway &mdash; I could name the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you like, and in each county you could find worse land than this. But it is peculiarly good land for potatoes. They have made very big profits out of potatoes, so big that they refuse to turn to anything else.  This year they have practically their full crop of potatoes sown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so heavily manured. They put in three times as much manure as other farmers in Ireland do.  But they have practically their full crop sown this year.  Why would they not?  Why should they not if the Treasury is to pay for their crops in a bad year and they make colossal benefits in good years. I am as anxious to help these people as anybody in the Dáil, but there is no case for special treatment here.  We told them that we would authorise the local District Council to make grants for seeds and manure.  They did not accept that; they did not want it.  They could have kept pigs and a hundred and one things but they have chosen this year again to sow practically the same area of potatoes.  You cannot help people like that.  If they are willing, from their point of view, to take chances like that they should not come here and ask for assistance.  When you look into all the facts, and forget the sympathy you would like to have, and merely go into the facts, there is no reason why this case should be singled out, and I am sorry I cannot recommend the Dáil to do so.  We have done what we could; we have sent a special officer to help them to try and get rid of these potatoes, <Col N="1329" /> and we have been very successful. The prospect of having bad weather and of not having new potatoes at a very early date should enable them to get rid of a considerable amount of their crops, not all perhaps, at prices as good as any for men growing potatoes.</P>

      <P>The Minister has evaded the grave question of infection. The danger of infection is serious for other parts of the country and for other people.  If there was a good market in England the potatoes would have been sold.  Everyone knows the crop this year is double that of last year, and therefore 53 per cent. last year is only 25 per cent. of the present crop.  Belfast, he says, accepted 20 per cent. Belfast only exported 20 per cent., and had Belfast proved a better market there might not be such reason for exporting the potatoes.  The Minister made a good case, but the whole of it depends upon the market, and if there had been a market in England there would have been no hardship.  This is not a question of right, it is a question of the safety of the country, and if the danger has been removed these poor people should be helped.  They used their best judgment with a view to marketing their potatoes in England, but there a beneficient Providence had given a fine supply where formerly the people of Louth had a magnificent market. Under these circumstances they thought they could rely on the charity of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

That is the matter that concerns me and the other Deputies who represent other areas of the country.  It is an important question, and it is the only question that I asked the Minister to deal with.  It is very funny on the part of his own Department, to find that they can spend money in giving compensation for bees.  If a hive is destroyed, <Col N="1330" /> the owner is entitled to compensation and be gets it.  The question here is the great question of preventing infection spreading not only in Cooley area, but all over Louth, and to Dublin and the rest of the country, and if such infection does spread all these areas will have to be scheduled.  I have only been in this particular district once, and on that occasion I met three or four dozen carts coming home from Dundalk market after selling their potatoes, and these potatoes are leaving by boat and cart for all parts of the country.  Deputy Hughes talked about chaff.  I am not concerned about chaff; it is no good to give to hungry people, but if he is very anxious about chaff let him go down to his own part of the country and give it to the people. I am ready to meet Deputy Hughes up there if he goes there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1254" /> for Defence whether he has received a complaint from ex-Battalion Adjutant Mr. J. Hargrove, of Gort, to the effect that, while he left Gort Barracks on April 5th, 1923, he was paid his wages of £4 per week only to January 1st, 1923; whether it is a fact that other Battalion Adjutants similarly circumstanced were paid to 1st March or 17th March; and whether the balance alleged to be due to Mr. Hargrove will be paid him.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Hargrove's case was not similar to that of other Battalion Adjutants.  He was never formally attached to the Army, and his services were not required after the 1st January.  He did not work after that date, but was permitted to live in barracks on the plea that he would be in danger of hostile action by Irregulars if he returned home.  It is not intended to issue any further pay to him.</P>
