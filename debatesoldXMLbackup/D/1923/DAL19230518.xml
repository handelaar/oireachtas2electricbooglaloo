      <P>asked the President whether Thomas McGlynn, one of the persons recently deported from England, but subsequently released, was arrested on information supplied by the Government of the Free State, and whether the Government is satisfied that McGlynn was innocent of any conspiracy, and that there was consequently no ground for his arrest.</P>

      <P>The deportation of Mr. McGlynn was consequent on certain information in the possession of the Military Authorities of Saorstát Eireann. Mr. McGlynn signed the usual form of undertaking, and the Government having satisfied themselves that he could be relied upon to observe its terms decided that he could be released without prejudice to the safety of the State.  The Government cannot undertake to pronounce upon his guilt or innocence.</P>

      <P>A deputation from the Dundalk Harbour Board was received by the <Col N="1078" /> Revenue Commissioners on the 19th ult., when the effect of the new fiscal arrangements on the Dundalk Distillery was examined and fully explained to the Harbour Board.  I understand that, as a result of the discussion, the Harbour Board intended to send representatives to interview the proprietors of the Distillery, but I have no information up to the present as to the result of the interview. That is how the matter stands at the moment.</P>
      <P>The whole question is a very technical one, and if the Deputy wishes to have detailed particulars I will arrange with the Revenue Commissioners to supply them.</P>

      <P>Registrars of the abolished Dáil Courts were required to submit such accounts, but, owing to the disturbed state of some parts of the country it has not always been possible to have complete accounts furnished with regularity, and, in the case of East Cork District Courts, summarised returns only have been presented.  These do not show what payments, if any, were made in respect of car-hire or train fares.  A return of receipts and expenditure will be furnished, when available, to each of the former District Justices who functioned in the East Cork area.  Until the final accounts have been received and examined, <Col N="1079" /> it will not be possible to state whether there is a debit or credit balance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that in accordance with the rules applying in Civil Prisons, all civil prisoners are exempt from labour on Roman Catholic Holydays of Obligation, as they are on Sundays, whether in consequence of such exemption, it has been the established custom, for over 30 years, to allow as many of the officers of the Prisons as could be spared off duty on those days; whether their being off duty on such holydays imposes no financial burden on the State, and whether it is the intention of the Government to deprive those officers of this long-existing privilege, and, if not, will he issue instructions to all Prison Governors that this privilege is not to be taken away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Prisoners are exempted from unnecessary labour on Christmas Day, Good Friday and certain other Catholic Holydays.  There is no established custom with regard to allowing officers off duty on those days, but Governors of Prisons have discretion to grant leave to officers whose services can be spared.  They would not, however, allow off duty any officer whose absence would impose a financial burden on the State.  I see no reason for interfering with the Governor's discretionary power in such cases, and I do not propose to issue special instructions on the subject.</P>

      <P>The cattle in question were seized by the military acting on the authority of the Commander-in-Chief, the Executive Council having agreed that the violent seizure and illegal occupation of lands throughout the country constituted <Col N="1080" /> a problem incapable of being adequately dealt with by civil procedure.

      <P>That is in the nature of a hypothetical question, and I could not answer it.  I think the question of the validity of their claims to pensions has been decided.  I could be compelled by law to decide their appeal under Section 8 of the Local Government Act of 1919.  The Council will have every opportunity, when the appeal comes to be heard, of putting forward their views as to why these rate collectors should not get pensions.  If it is decided that they are entitled to pensions, then the County Council will be compelled by law to pay the pensions.</P>

      <P>There are Peace negotiations going on at present, and a Truce has been arranged temporarily.  The Truce only applies to the I.R.A., the Free Staters are not recognising it, as they are raiding wholesale.  The Peace negotiations will be a great success.  The Free State Government cannot accept it as the terms are a breach of the Free State Constitution, but the Irish people will accept it, as at present they would take anything for Peace.  The truce will not last long, as we are expecting a reply from the Free State, a negative answer of course.  The war will then start again.</P>
      <P>is confined to the knowledge that it was written by a person having access to the home of Mr. Ernie O'Malley, interested in the Prisoners' Dependents' Fund, the activities of Mr. J.J.

      <P>On the whole matter of answers to questions, I am afraid the position is not very clear to some Deputies.  A Deputy who puts down a question is not necessarily entitled to an answer at all.  Answers to starred questions are printed in the Official Report, and a copy is sent to the Deputy as soon as we receive it.  In some cases, and it was so understood at the time when starred questions were first put down, there might be a certain delay before the answer could be given.  Answers to some of the questions have been considerably <Col N="1088" /> delayed, and I have asked the Minister for Defence to go into the matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Orders of the day, might I suggest, for the convenience of Deputies, that when we are dealing with Estimates for public services some indication should be given as to how far we are likely to go on a particular day in dealing with these Estimates.  We know the order in which the Estimates will be taken, but when there is no limit set it is impossible to say, for instance, that three sets of Estimates will be taken on a particular day, because the Dáil might decide that there was only time to deal with one set. If we were to decide that not more than three sets would be taken on a particular day, I think it would be a matter of great convenience to Deputies.</P>

With regard to the other point, that we should set down a number of Estimates for a particular day, and say that no more will be taken on that day, that is a matter on which I would have to consult the Minister for Finance on every occasion on which the Estimates appear on the Order paper.  I think it would be advisable if such an arrangement were come to.</P>

Thus, rules are submitted governing proceedings prior to the election of the Ceann Comhairle in a new Dáil.  A further group of Orders regulate the method of dealing with the motion to proceed to the next business.  Two important   financial rules are introduced: one imposing restrictions on the debate of Supplementary Estimates; the other enabling the general policy of a Minister in respect of a Department to be discussed without involving a particular item.  Other Orders deal with the matter of constituting the House, and with the issuing of writs, and the receiving of reports from the Clerk.

It is an approximate Estimate only as the staff of the Department is not yet determined and no details can be furnished. The Comptroller and Auditor-General was appointed only in January last, and, with the exception of a principal officer to act on his behalf under <Col N="1093" /> Section 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act of 1923, the other officers of this Department are on loan from and paid by other Government Departments. In addition to the principal officer referred to, there are a number of temporary clerks who have been recruited in the past three months.  The main intention of this item is to audit most of the Votes of Parliament and to report to Parliament the results of the audit.  The Department is at present dealing with the accounts for the year ended the 31st March, and the reports of these accounts will be submitted to the Dáil in due course.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister inform us whether the inclusion of National Insurance Audit includes both Health and Unemployment Insurance, and if there is any intention to bring into this Department the responsibility for all the audit work, say, of the Local Government Department?  The entry under the heading &ldquo;National Insurance Audit&rdquo; suggests that there was some intention to concentrate State Audit under this Department.  Will the Minister tell us whether that is the intention, and what Departments it is intended to include, and also will he give us some information as to what the &ldquo;Appropriation in Aid, £200,&rdquo; refers to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition the Department conducts certain Statutory Audits, and also accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General by mutual agreement between him and the Ministry of Finance.  Sub-heads D, E, and F, which have been referred to by the Deputy, provide for the expenses of the National Insurance Audit Department. This Department is engaged on the auditing of books and accounts of Approved Societies under the National Insurance Act of 1911.  Hitherto this Department was a branch of the National Insurance Audit Department of Great Britain, but on the transfer of functions and in view of the fact that it was only a small Department, it was considered advisable to amalgamate it with the Exchequer and Audit.  The bulk of the work relates to insurance audits.  It is done in the country, and consequently the provision of £1,200 for travelling expenses is included.</P>

I am asking it because it seems to be quite a desirable development that the various Audit Departments should be concentrated, and I was hopeful that the Minister would say that this was an indication that that was the intention.</P>

I do not know about Unemployment Insurance. I think there is no indication in the Estimate that Unemployment Insurance is included.  I will make inquiries and give the Deputy the information. &ldquo;The Appropriation in Aid&rdquo; is the estimated amount to be received in respect of audit on behalf of Departments whose funds are derived from sources other than Votes of Parliament&mdash;for example, Intermediate Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this particular Vote, I take it that we are waiting for the long-promised Ministries Bill to set up and legalise the Ministry of Finance; and I assume that, <Col N="1095" /> pending the setting up of this Ministry, the Department is being carried on much along the lines of the old British Treasury Department.  There are one or two matters in that connection to which I would like to draw attention.  One of them is what I regard, in any case, as the rather undue interference of the Department of Finance in the working of other Departments.  I am speaking now rather of what used to occur under the British regime, and what I assume is the practice at the present time.  I trust that when we do come to set up or regularise that Department, through the medium of the Ministries Bill, that the functions of this particular Ministry will be definitely set out, so that we will know exactly where we are.  The point I wish to emphasise is this, that it seems to me that the Department of Finance insists not only on general control of the finance of each Department, but on control even so far as matters of detail are concerned.  For instance, let us say that a sum of money is voted, or appears in these Estimates, for any particular Department, say the Department of Fisheries&mdash;a sum of £3,000 is voted for the development of Fisheries&mdash;it should be sufficient on the part of the Minister, or Department of Finance, to have some say in the total amount that is voted for that particular service.  I do not think that they should come in and say in what particular way that £3,000 should be expended, down even to the last sixpence.  I think the Minister for the particular Department ought to be in a position to say, according to his judgment and the judgments of his experts, how that sum of money which has been voted in the Estimates for his Department should be expended. If he finds that it is not wise to spend it in one particular direction, he should be free to spend it in another which he thinks is more profitable.  I think he should be the judge of this, rather than somebody in the Ministry of Finance.  Under the old regime the Education Department&mdash;I speak of that because I know more of its inner working than any other Department&mdash;was supposed to be controlled by a number of independent Boards, but, as a matter of fact, the real control rested with a minor official in Dublin Castle.  Not alone in <Col N="1096" /> financial matters, but in purely educational matters, this particular man's judgment overrode the decision of the particular Board or Department that was dealing with Education.  As I say, I do not think that is a good system, and I think, when the Ministries Bill is being drafted, that we should know exactly what the functions and what the powers of the Ministry of Finance are in these matters.</P>
      <P>There is just another matter in connection with this that I would like to have some information on.  I do not see under this particular Vote, nor in any other portion of the Estimates, provision made for a Civil Service Commission.  I do not know what are the present arrangements by which people enter the Civil Service.  In the old days there was a well regulated system of competitive examination under the control of a Civil Service Commission.  We do not know what are the present arrangements &mdash;whether there is any controlling body, or whether people enter the Civil Service in a haphazard way.  I think the necessity for setting up a proper Civil Service Commission, which will control the entrance of candidates into the Civil Service, is very essential, and that it ought to be set up without any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other matter in this Vote, and that is in connection with the Teachers' Pension Office.  This, I presume, is not the particular Vote under which the general question of these teachers' pensions should be dealt with. We should confine ourselves on this Vote merely to the administration; but one matter I would like to call the Minister's attention to is the very great delays that occur between the time a teacher retires and the time his first pension is paid to him.  Sometimes it is three, four, five or eight months after his retirement before he is paid his first instalment of the pension. I do not know whether that delay is entirely due to the Pension Office, but I wish to direct the Minister's attention to it in any case.  There is one other matter in regard to these pensions, and that is the system on which they are paid. These pensions are paid quarterly.  They are very small sums.  I think something should be done to try and introduce the system of monthly payment of these pensions, as has been done in other services. The sum is exceedingly small in a great <Col N="1097" /> many cases, and I think it would not entail a very great deal of extra labour on the part of the Pension Office if they were paid monthly rather than quarterly, as at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the items mentioned under Sub-head (A), in connection with which we are informed it is not yet possible to fix a definite establishment for the Ministry, one would rather gather there is some kind of establishment already existing.  How far that could be called a definite establishment is another point.  I think we might have some information with regard to it, because the sum in respect of Sub-head (A) has been put down at £40,000.  I assume that £40,000 is not a pure guess.  There must be some material for the framing of such an Estimate, and I think it is desirable that in the case of Estimates of this kind, where, quite inevitable at the present moment, a degree of indefiniteness must necessarily occur, such information as the Minister has had in arriving at this particular Estimate should be given to the Dáil.  I think the Minister will perceive the justice of that, and I think he will also perceive it is very desirable such a course should be adopted.  I desire to emphasise the point made by Deputy O'Connell in regard to the Civil Service Commission.  That is not merely a matter for the Dáil.  It is also a matter respecting the general state of public confidence in Civil Service appointments. The Minister must be very well aware, just the same as every Deputy here is aware, of the opinions entertained by persons outside in regard to those appointments. No doubt other Deputies have had the same experience as I have had, and are continually being bombarded by letters alleging that appointments are being made that are not efficient, and that should not have been made, and alleging also that appointments are being made on the grounds of friendship rather than on the grounds of efficiency.  I have for some years taken my part in the political movement in which the Minister for Finance played a very distinguished and honoured part. He knows, having served in it from the beginning, that it was an axiom in Sinn Fein that all public appointments should <Col N="1098" /> be made as the result of a Civil Service examination, and that there should not be any procedure&mdash;I will not say there should be what I would call &ldquo;jobs&rdquo;&mdash; such as would lead to an allegation that there was the possibility of a &ldquo;job.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was always the principle of Sinn Fein that that should be, and the allegation was made by Sinn Fein in those days against the Parliamentary Party that private influence was used with regard to the getting of public appointments.  It is very easy for public unrest to be created in this matter, and I think one may justly assume that unrest of that kind, partaking of the nature of rumour, must always be unjust.  It must always outrun the facts.  Any person who has any knowledge or experience of life will agree that that is axiomatic.  The only way to stop that is a form of procedure so that there will be no possibility of the currency of such rumours.  I do desire, in the friendliest spirit possible, to join with Deputy O'Connell in urging upon the Minister to lay down in this and in all other Departments the principle that no person shall have any appointment because of fear, because of favour, or because of any part that that person might have played in the past.  The part that person played might be worthy of reward, but if worthy, the reward should take a monetary form, and have all other obligations cancelled with it.  The service of this State should only be entered by a public examination held under the auspices of a Civil Service Commission, so that the Civil Service of this country may in itself be more efficient; but, perhaps, what is even more important than that, that public confidence may be maintained, and that no opportunity should be given for rumour that will infallibly be unjust, I know, but that is only waiting its opportunity to make assertions and to fill the country with suggestions that appointments are going in larger measure than we know them to be going, irrespective of such efficiency tests as qualifying examinations may furnish.</P>

      <P>I do hope that the Minister, before this Vote is passed, will give some explanation of the position of this Department regarding appointments to the higher posts.  The fact that there is no definite establishment yet fixed, and therefore no details of what the £40,000 <Col N="1099" /> represents, deprives us of some opportunity for finding out for ourselves some of the information at least that would be desirable.  As Deputy Figgis has said, there is a good deal of criticism abroad from inside the Service, and that may be characteristic of Services.  I do not know.  From what I can gather, it is very deep and loud to-day, and ought to be met by some public statement of the position.  The allegation of course, is that in this and other Departments experienced men who have worked their way through the Service are being superseded by men of no greater qualifications, possibly less, and of less service, and therefore the inducement to efficient service is being taken away.  I have no knowledge, and I am not able to say, whether there is any ground for this criticism, but it is very widespread, and it has not come to me directly to any extent, but I think it is widely spread, and is causing a lot of dissatisfaction, which is not good for the health of the Service. I invite the Minister to make a full and candid statement of the position with regard to appointments, the possibility of promotion, and why men are being superseded, and new appointments made over the heads of experienced and well qualified servants who have been in the Service of this country for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say just a few words on this matter.  I would ask Deputies to visualise the problem that confronted the Government on its formal establishment here, and to ask themselves whether, it view of the elements that were there, it would be possible to have arrived at any solution that would satisfy, even substantially satisfy, anyone&mdash;any solution that would not give rise to rumours of which Deputy Figgis has spoken, and any solution that would not give rise to complaint.  You had, in the case of most Departments, not one Civil Service, but two.  You had the British Departments and the corresponding Departments of the fighting Dáil.  Take, for example, Local Government; take the Finance Ministry itself. Almost every civil department of the British administration had its counterpart in the service of Dáil Eireann, and the task that confronted us was the amalgamation and unification of these <Col N="1100" /> two lots of civil servants.  It would have been impossible to effect that unification without heartburnings on the part of members of the Civil Service, without some people feeling that they had been passed over and that less competent men had been put in their place.  Some, naturally, would hold the view that length of service should be the sole criterion, but length of service under whom&mdash;setting length of service as against risk of service, let us say, undertaken by those who served in the Departments of Dáil Eireann before the Truce.  You cannot effect a solution that would not leave heartburnings on one side or on the other side, on men who had given faithful, moderate, humdrum service to the British regime, or the risk of the men who gave signal service in rather strenuous times under the fighting Dáil. With those elements no solution completely satisfactory to all persons could be arrived at.  I would put this view that that problem, difficult, delicate, and thorny in the extreme, has been handled in a manner that leaves very little ground for criticism; and the complaints that have been flying about and the rumours that have been circulated, when sifted out, have often been found to be without substance and foundation.  We have grappled occasionally with complaints and asked for specific details and for names.  We have volunteered to go through the personnel of the staff of particular Departments with a view to seeing just what grounds and justification there were for complaints of that kind.  When the thing was tackled in that way there was always a withdrawal.  Naturally, in times like these, with the Government assailed, for obvious reasons, by a section of the people, you will have exaggerations of that kind.  I ask the Dáil and the public to believe that with a very difficult problem, with all the elements for jealousy and friction, in a time of transition, with a new administration saddled with all the personnel of the old administration and without applying Article 10 of the Treaty, that problem has been tackled with a considerable measure of success, and has left very little reasonable grounds for just criticism.</P>

      <P>I expect that within the next week or ten days I will be able to introduce an Order dealing with the Civil Service Commission.  It <Col N="1101" /> is not necessary to anticipate anything to be said on the subject then by making any statement regarding the position now.  I suppose that will be regarded as satisfactory.  The matter has been under consideration for a long time.  It is not one of these things that one can find the solution for very rapidly.  We realise the importance of setting up a Commission which will command the confidence and respect of all sections of the community. We expect that the recommendations it will make will inspire confidence and give satisfaction, but I do not think that it is necessary to go further than saying that about this particular item mentioned.  Now, as regards the establishment. The Estimate was framed somewhere in the month of March, and there was no chance of giving further information then, or even furnishing all the information that is required now, which might normally be expected in an Estimate of this kind.</P>
      <P>Fifteen or sixteen months ago, when the late General Collins was Minister for Finance, he appointed Mr. O'Brien as Secretary of the Department, and Mr. O'Brien had administering sub-departments of the Ministry three different officials&mdash;Mr. Bewley, Mr. Flynn, and Mr. Brennan.  Mr. Brennan was administering the Finance Section, Mr. Bewley the Supply Section, and Mr. Flynn the Customs Section.  It was, I think, his intention, and I believe he wrote Mr. Brennan informing him it was his intention, to appoint him as Comptroller and Auditor-General. Members know, from what has happened since, that other arrangements were made, and they are also aware of the fact that we have set up a Board of Revenue Commissioners.  Mr. O'Brien is Chairman, and associated with him are Mr. Flynn and Mr. Carey.  It will be seen that we had again to reconstruct the Ministry of Finance establishment. Mr. Brennan is now Secretary of the establishment, and associated with him are Mr. McElligott in Finance, with Mr. Colbert and Mr. Codling in Supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of selection for important offices in the State is by what is called a Pool Board.  That Pool Board is set up by the Government, and consists of experienced officers.  The Secretary of the Post Office is Chairman of the Board, and with him are Dr. Smith and Mr. Pierce Kent.  The Ministry has nothing to do <Col N="1102" /> with the matter except to receive reports and consider them.  Criticism, occasional whispers, and very rarely definite charges have come in.  Very often rumours of criticism come from all parts of the country. It is, I suppose, one of the misfortunes of a Ministry that criticisms of that kind are continually being made.  I do not know any form of procedure that will be set up or any regulations that will be made, that will free any Ministry now or in the future from criticism.  One of the most hostile persons, I suppose, in the State is a disappointed civil servant. Deputies know that.  In one case a clergyman came in to me and said that we had an official at the head of the Civil Service who was both an Englishman and a Freemason.  On inquiries being made, it was found that he was neither a Freemason nor an Englishman, so the clergyman was surprised and consoled that that was not the case.  If there be one position for which there are forty applicants, there is sure to be one satisfied person and thirty-nine dissatisfied ones.  Anyone who has had experience of public Boards knows very well that if you happen to be in the position of having voted for a person who gets a position, you have created enemies for yourself of the eight or nine other candidates who were not appointed. It is right to say that there have been positions given away to persons who have not passed through the door of the examination hall, and the Ministry is prepared to accept the blame, if there be any, for such things as that.  In the Local Government with which Mr. O'Higgins and myself were associated for a considerable time, something like 70 employees, officials and others were engaged, and each one of those was afforded the opportunity of entering the service without examination.  We believed then, and do so now, that those of them who were prepared to render service to the State should not be debarred by reason of the fact that they never passed through the examination door.  The service they had rendered in a critical time to the State was, in our opinion, sufficient to justify them to have their claim considered, even though they did not pass through the examination door.  Our opinion then was. and now is, that though they did not pass the examination, they were well qualified for the work they undertook, and the work they are doing <Col N="1103" /> at present.  The same thing applies to other officers of the late Dáil.  Practically every official there who was prepared to render service to the State has been employed by us.</P>
    <P>It was not possible to have an examination for the servants of Dáil Eireann during the years that we passed through from 1919 to 1921.  But there has not been any recruitment of friends of the Ministry, or of friends of friends of the Ministry, and the appointments which have been made are appointments over which we can stand, and which we are prepared to justify.  In criticising any of these officials of the State I think it is fair, if Deputies think there is a case for criticism, or that we have not appointed the best persons to the position, that it should be the subject of discussion here, where we can meet it, and where it will be possible for us to restabilise the confidence of the people, and to let them see we have discharged our duties in these responsible times with due regard to the responsibility of our position.  I question, and I deny, that any appointments have been made on other grounds than those of efficiency.  I am satisfied from the recommendations which we have got from the Pool Board which was set up that we got efficient public servants recommended to us, and, if it should happen that persons were recommended who might subsequently be found not to be efficient in the discharge of their duties, I say that is not our fault, and that it is one of the accidents that is inseparable from the administration of a State.  While saying that I do not admit that such is the case.  I have no knowledge that such is the case.  It is not fair to tell us here that there is ground for dissatisfaction outside when Deputies have not brought under our notice specific instances of appointments that should not have been made.  If a man occupying the responsible position of Deputy Figgis, representing an important constituency like the County of Dublin, has information at his disposal that we have made appointments that are not justified, that matter should certainly have been brought to the notice of the Ministry.  It has not come to that, that there is such competition for seats in the Executive Council that we have got to buy our positions or to keep our positions here by making such <Col N="1104" /> appointments, and it ought not come to that, that a man would keep information such as that and pile it up until the election day, and then thunder out criticism which should be mentioned here and not on an election platform.</P>
    <P>In all my experience of public life, I have always heard such criticisms.  I am sure that when other people occupy these benches that they will also be subject to them.  There have been some appointments made by us outside the Civil Service. There have been no examinations for a very considerable time.  These appointments were made not by the nomination of any member of the Ministry. They were recommendations of responsible officers of the State who would themselves find, if proper recommendations were not made, that it would be their responsibility and their loss.</P>
    <P>In the exceptional circumstances of the times we accepted those recommendations. There was no machinery here when the Provisional Government took over office that would enable them to construct from the material supplied a capable Government machine.  There is now, after 13 or 15 months, a Government machine which will enable any succeeding Ministry to discharge its duties with satisfaction to the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter mentioned by Deputy O'Connell.  I am prepared to look into it if the Deputy communicates with me on the subject&mdash;that is the payment of teachers' pensions within a shorter period.  I do not know what the procedure is with regard to that, but, if the Deputy communicates with me, and I find it is possible to do it, I am prepared to meet him in that respect, but I cannot undertake to do that without examining the case.</P>

      <P>I have received a large number of complaints myself and have attended to none of them.  I assume any person who writes making a complaint of that kind is a person who is complaining for personal reasons, and I have destroyed the letters and paid no heed to them.  It is the only procedure possible to adopt under the circumstances.  I am, therefore, not in a position to give personal cases, because the persons who put their cases before me have had their letters destroyed.  I am not dealing with them.  What I am saying is that rumours of this kind are bound to be in circulation if there is not a system by which the most scrupulous impartiality is given, and the most efficient service is given, by compelling all persons who go into the Civil Service to pass a Civil Service examination qualifying them for it.  If that were done there would be no room whatever for rumours of the kind that are circulated.  The Minister must know that they are circulated. When I say I have had letters of that kind I have asked no other Deputies if they have had letters, but I am perfectly sure they have had.  These rumours exist.  I have admitted frankly that they are, probably, greatly in excess of the truth and largely unjust.  I stated that the only way to deal with the whole circumstances is to establish a Civil Service Commission to establish a qualifying examination, and then there is no possibility for rumours or for complaining letters.</P>

Now, one can just imagine those lines being published in leaded type in any of the newspapers, and how they will shake the confidence of the public, not in the Ministry, but in the Dáil, because the Dáil having had that statement made by a Deputy is practically committed to the very same charge as the Ministry.  The Ministry only remains in power by reason of the support it gets in the Dáil, and if the Dáil supports a Ministry responsible for making appointments like that the responsibility is theirs as well as the Ministry's. I do not think that is quite fair <Col N="1106" /> either to the Ministry or to the Dáil that criticisms of that kind are made unless evidence of the fact is brought out, and it ought to be brought out here.</P>

Surely it is <Col N="1107" /> competent for Deputies to voice what is common talk not in the form of definite charges, but for the purpose of giving Ministers an opportunity of making a statement in the Dáil of the position of the Ministry in regard to appointments or any other matters of internal policy. If Ministers do not do that of their own volition, from their own knowledge, if such stories are abroad, then it is the duty, I say, of Deputies to intimate to the Dáil and the Ministry that these stories are abroad, even if they do not believe for one moment that anything wrong is happening.  It is the duty of Deputies to invite Ministers to state the facts, and I do not think Ministers should resent such an invitation.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £422,250 be granted to complete the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1924, for the salaries and expenses of the Revenue Department.&rdquo;  A sum of £212,000 had been voted on account.  The services previously performed by the Customs and Excise Department and Inland Revenue Department have been amalgamated, as Deputies are aware, under the title of Revenue Department, and the payments in connection with the running of the combined services are included in this Vote. &ldquo;(A).  Salaries, Wages and Allowances,&rdquo; covers the salaries of all the established and unestablished officials of the Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue, and also payment for any necessary overtime.  The officials of the Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue Departments were formerly recruited by open competition.  Pending the setting up of the Civil Service Commission several vacancies have been temporarily filled by the appointment of temporary clerks, selected by a Departmental Committee. The printing of the new postage stamps has been undertaken by the newly-established Stamping Branch. Further appointments will need to be made in connection with the Revenue Department, and it is intended to open for competition amongst members of the Army, I think some fifty posts out of <Col N="1108" /> possibly seventy or seventy-five to reserve them for competition amongst men who have served for the last twelve or eighteen months or two years, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The situation and the districts of officers and surveyors of Customs and Excise cover very wide areas, and much travel is necessitated in the performance of their work, especially in connection with enquiries in relation to old age pensions. That is under head (B).  Examinations will be held in respect of the appointments I have mentioned for Customs officers.  The whole arrangements in connection with the matter have not yet been completed, but it is hoped that within the next month or two that will be done and there will be competitive examinations which will afford some opportunity of appreciating the work done by these men in the Army and will at the same time get a good class of official for the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be necessary, or at any rate desirable, I think, to indicate in this Estimate what proportion of the expenses ought to have been charged to the next vote, No. 7.  It is pretty well known that a Customs officer, or an Excise officer, has a good deal of work to do, enquiring into cases for other departments, such as the old age pensions, separation allowances, and work of that kind.  It would be an advantage if some indication were given, in these estimates, of what proportion of the charges ought to be accounted for by these particular departments.  Apparently no allowance is made in the estimate for these services.  They are all charged against Revenue, and no mention is made in the other estimates of such work done by the Revenue Department, so that in the end we have this estimate for £634,000 as being the cost not merely of Revenue collection but of Revenue collection plus a good many other miscellaneous services which I think ought to be shown separately, or, at any rate, some estimate should be given as to what these miscellaneous services cost to this Department.  There is item C.&mdash;Removal of furniture, £5,000.  Is that intended to cover removal from one part of Ireland to another?  Is the removal of officers from Dublin or Cork to Belfast or Derry charged against Saorstát income or <Col N="1109" /> revenue?  or is it for bringing in the furniture of officials from other parts of Ireland or from parts of England?  The item seems high, and perhaps a little explanation to amplify the bare item of cost of removal might be vouchsafed to us.  Then there is item J.&mdash;&ldquo;Copies of the Poor Rates for Income Tax purposes, £500.&rdquo;  That is a small matter, perhaps, but it actually represents payments hitherto made to the staffs of the local authorities, but in recent years made by way of overtime to the staffs of the General Valuation Office for copies of the valuation lists.  Now, while the staff are, no doubt, glad of this overtime money, it seems to me the work ought to be done as part of the ordinary business work of the Valuation Office.  In any case it seems absurd so to show exactly the cost to the Revenue Department of work done by the Valuation Office and to show nothing at all of work done by the Revenue Department for other departments.</P>
      <P>Item K is an item for £2,000 for the construction, purchase and maintenance of vessels and boats and other conveyances. On this Vote one would like to know whether any arrangement has been made for a share, at least, of the British patrol boats or Revenue cutters, or whatever name may be given to them, and whether any of these have been handed over in place of cash.  Perhaps in the course of the Minister's reply he will tell us whether that has been taken into account, or whether this £2,000 touches the cost of expenditure upon the NorthEastern Frontier.  I suppose certain boats may be required in Lough Erne. Perhaps the Minister would just enlighten us as to the meaning of that item.</P>

How many of them are employed; from what class are they recruited, and what are the present methods of recruitment pending the complete organisation of the service; and whether, also, these vacancies have been widely advertised so that people desiring to join this particular service of these <Col N="1110" /> particular lower grades might have an opportunity of presenting themselves for whatever kind of examination there was, if there was any examination or test, before they are taken into the service?  I should like to ask, too, whether there has been any considerable number of transfers from Great Britain, and particularly of officers in the Six-County area.  I understand that a number of them have been desirous of getting transferred to the Saorstát, but that they found some difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first point made by Deputy Johnson was that certain items in this Estimate should properly be charged to the next Estimate. In the prefatory note to No. 4 there is some explanation given in connection with the Estimates generally.  I do not think that it would be possible in the case of Old Age Pensions to assess the proportion which would be properly chargeable to that service; that is, the service of Customs officers.  Customs officers are sometimes employed perhaps in the morning on customs work, and in the evening on Old Age Pensions work. Perhaps one day they are at one thing and the other day they are at the other, and I think there would be some difficulty. I am speaking from my own experience of one particular officer.  I find him in the morning in connection with old age pensions work, and in the evening in connection with Excise matters. It is rather difficult to say off-hand what the amount would be for each portion of his service.  I do know in connection with some of the work done that there are very heavy expenses incurred where an officer has to make a journey, for instance, of a few miles into the country to see an applicant for old age pension and to get particulars and so on.  It may sometimes necessitate staying in the hotel of the town near where the person lives for a night.  I do not know that there has been any segregation at any time of the proportion of cost of Customs and Excise officers between one kind of work and another.  I should also say this: As regards the Revenue Department, Deputies will remember this is the first time an estimate in respect of Customs and Excise expenditure has come up here. Last year we paid the British Government; this year we have set up our own <Col N="1111" /> machinery and taken over machinery ourselves. With regard to removals, if an official of the Revenue Department is transferred under the direction of the Commissioners from one locality to another, the expenses of his removal are borne by the State.  This is an estimated sum.  It may be very much less.  I do not know that.  In case where we were transferring officers the transfer, I think, would be only in the nature of a swap. If we give back an Englishman and we got over an Irishman, I do not think that in that case we would pay the expenses. The case mentioned was one from Cork to Belfast.  I do not think in that case we would pay the expenses. But this is an estimate, and it is for the purpose mentioned.  There was no question raised on item E.  On item J, I take it that these are copies of poor rate valuations supplied from the local authorities. I do not know if it refers to overtime as mentioned by Deputy Johnson or not, but I will make enquiries and get him particulars.  It is a small sum of £500.</P>

As regards K, which deals with construction, purchase and maintenance of vessels, boats and other conveyances for the protection and collection of revenue, a launch is used at Cobh, and in other ports there are row boats.

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £2,177,000 be granted to complete the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1924, for Old Age Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908 to 1919, for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith, and for pensions under the Blind Persons Act, 1920.&rdquo;  A sum of £1,093,000 had been voted on account.</P>
      <P>The amount is slightly less than last year.  I think we are rather committed to the disbursement in the case of &ldquo;A&rdquo; (Pensions, £3,270,000), which is scarcely just.  I think quite a number of people are getting pensions from the State at the present moment who are living in fairly comfortable houses, supported by their relatives.  This is a question which will have to be considered, whether it is a just burden upon the State to charge it with contributions in respect of such persons.  It was not the original intention. The original idea was that persons who have reached the age of seventy years should not be left in want, but a great number of people in this country have got pensions who, under normal circumstances, would certainly not require them, and in respect of whom it was never the intention of any State to bring in legislation to provide them with pensions.  However, that does not arise now.  It is a matter for future consideration. I now move this vote.</P>

      <P>I just wish to say that, in my opinion, it is a false principle to suggest economy under this particular head.  Economy has been enjoined upon the Ministry, but they have a discretion, as far as I understand, to try and keep expenditure as much as possible below the Estimates.  While it might be safe and useful to do that in other Departments, the application of such a principle in this Department, dealing with Old Age Pensions would, in my opinion, be absolutely wrong.  I do not <Col N="1113" /> think it is right to enjoin, or to expect, economy under this particular head.  This is a Department to which, I think, too little attention is given, and I think that above all others in the country it is one that should have very special attention given to it.  We all know that in this Department the very greatest difficulties are placed in the way of old people who are rightfully entitled to get the pension. Instead of the spirit of the Pension Act being extended towards them, these poor old people are faced with the greatest difficulties in the matter of establishing their exact position on the question of age.  In my opinion these difficulties, instead of being placed in the way of old people, should be removed, and every facility should be given to them so that when they are qualified by age that they should at once receive the pensions they are entitled to.  I think something should be done in that way to make it easy for those who are rightfully entitled to the pensions to get them.  I know, because of the difficulties principally on the question of age that have been placed in the way of old people, that glaring cases of hardship have occurred, and a terrible injustice has been done to poor people who, while rightfully entitled to get the Old Age Pension, were denied it because of their inability to establish their cases on the question of age.  I think a Nation like ours should not tolerate injustices of that kind.  If we were to do so, in the present conditions in the country, we would be doing, I think, a very wrongful act.  I think the Ministry should realise its responsibilities in this matter, and should give to this Department, above all others, very special attention.  What I urge is that greater facilities should be given to old people who are entitled to the pension, but who may have difficulties about establishing their ages.</P>
      <P>Now, I would ask the Government, under this head particularly, to say that they are animated by the spirit of what this Act ought to have intended, whether it intended it or not, and that is to try to provide for the poor people who are deserving and ought to participate in the charitable nature of the scheme as it was formulated and designed, that no difficulties will be placed in their way, and that no economy at all will be practised to hold up the progress of this particular matter.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal in the argument of the Deputy. There are undoubtedly, cases of hardship where deserving applicants do not, for one little technicality or another, receive the Old Age Pension.  That may be due sometimes to misunderstanding on the part of the applicant, and, in some cases, misunderstanding, and perhaps rather big generosity of heart, on the part of some of the Pensions Committees, but frequently cases arise in different parts of the country where the local committees have recommended these pensions in certain cases, and for one reason or another they have been turned down by the Department. No doubt, the Department must stand on the strict letter of the law in these cases.  Perhaps some of the Committees thought they were doing a good thing for the country by getting as much out of the British Treasury as they could, and they think they can do the same now, and the Department does not intend to allow them.  But there are people in some parts of the country who, in default of getting this pension, are being put on the rates, are being maintained through some of the County Home Health schemes.  The question has been raised two or three times here, mostly by way of question and answer, in certain cases, particularly as to the absence of such things as baptismal certificates.  In a good many cases it is not possible for people to get baptismal certificates.  The Minister has answered that question not many months ago, but I think it would be useful if he would give now a statement of the evidence that would be acceptable to the Department in default of compliance with certain technical regulations such as baptismal or marriage certificates.  Not every old age pensioner has had the fortune, or misfortune, to get married and can supply a marriage certificate in default of a baptismal certificate. There is another point that might be answered, and that is what is the position of a pensioner who, for one reason or another, has removed out of the Saorstát into the Six Counties or to some part of Great Britain?  Will the pension be paid by the Saorstát?</P>

      <P>He would be a brave man who would stand up before the electors at present to say that this Vote should be done away with, but the magnitude of the expense to the State <Col N="1115" /> can be realised when you see that every man, woman and child in the Saorstát contributes £1 to the old age pensioners; and as each old age pensioner gets £26 per year, there is one pensioner in every 26 inhabitants of the Free State.  That will give you an idea of the expense that this State is under in connection with this Vote, and if Great Britain were paying at the same rate as that which applies to this country, their Vote, instead of being £16,000,000, would be something in the neighbourhood of £40,000,000.  Now, my complaint is that too many people are trying to get this Old Age Pension, that there are many people who have children well able to support them, and, having regard to the fact that our country is not paying its way at present, efforts should be made&mdash; I do not say in the case of want, but in cases where it is pretty well known people can live by the support of their friends&mdash;to stem this tremendous Vote of £1 per head on every man, woman and child in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I am wondering at the speech of my friend on the right, Deputy Wilson.  I am wondering whether the Old Age Pension was first given to relieve distress or as a kind of gratuity to honour old age.  The Deputy speaks of every person in the Saorstát giving £1 per head.  I think that every person who contributes towards these Old Age Pensions will agree that when a man or woman has had the honour of living to the age of 70, that person should be entitled to the pension.  I do not take into account large farmers, a great many of whom at present are making their wills when they come to the age of 69, and handing all their property over to sons and daughters so that they themselves may become eligible for the pension.  I see here in the Estimates for 1923-1924 the sum for Old Age Pensions is £3,270,000, and 1922-'23 it is £3,320,000, a decrease of £50,000.  Item B., &ldquo;Expenses of Pension Committees,&rdquo; is £7,700.  I am beginning to wonder where this expense goes to.  I am acting on an Old Age Pension Committee for the past three or four years, which, like hundreds of other committees through the country, is honorary.  Of course, that £7,700 goes to pay high officials who go around the country, such as Excise officers and Income <Col N="1116" /> Tax officers, etc., trying to deprive the people of their pensions.  If a house seems to be clean and tidy these officials say: &ldquo;Those people are not entitled to the pension,&rdquo; but if they go up to their knees in slush at a farmer's house they say, &ldquo;Those people are entitled to the pension.&rdquo;  I really think that something ought to be done to improve this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I will confine myself to the Estimate.  At present there are hundreds of old men and women who are up to the age of 70, and who are certainly entitled to the pension, but owing to not being fortunate enough to be able to secure their birth or marriage certificates they are denied the right to the pension, and, as Deputies have already explained, they are an incumbrance on the ratepayers of the locality in which they reside.  I think there is a certain provision in the Act that allows a person to get a pension if the applicant can find two people older than himself or herself in the district to guarantee that they knew the applicant for such a number of years.  I would like the Dáil to realise that the present generation does not live so long as generations of the past.  As we go along we die younger, and it is very hard for us to find people living in the neighbourhood with the required knowledge.  For instance, in another 40 years will we find one in Dublin to say &ldquo;I knew President Cosgrave when he was a boy&rdquo;?  It will be impossible. Therefore, I think that if these people got two magistrates to sign a declaration on their oath that they were of the age, that should be sufficient to secure for these people the pension.  Another matter I would like to place before the Dáil is the case of a working man who happened to be 68 years of age.  If his wife happened to be 70, and if that man is in receipt of 35/- per week, that woman is deprived of the pension owing to the income brought into the house by the sweat and labour of that old man.  But, then, on the other hand, you will find if a person had saved a certain amount of money, or some of their rich friends died and left in their will an amount of money to be put in the bank&mdash;say £450&mdash;at the age of 70, that £450 should be quite sufficient <Col N="1117" /> to pay for the maintenance of that person until the day he would have to go to the next world and give an account of his services here.  That person is entitled to the pension, but the person in receipt of 35/- a week is deprived of it. Something, I certainly say, will have to be done with regard to this Old Age Pension. I have been on a sub-committee, and we have certified in several cases that the people were of the age, and when it came up, of course, to headquarters, they say they are not.  They are poor, and, of course, they do not help the poor; they help the richer.  If you happen to put them up the ladder, it seems to be the duty of the aristocrats to put their feet on their necks and push them down.  That is the idea, and certainly something wants to be done to give the pension to those who are entitled to it.  I know there are a great many people getting the pension who could live without it.  I agree with removing the pension from those people who made their wills and gave their property to their own offspring, but if the decrease means depriving the working man who has worked all his life, I object to it.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring one specific case under the notice of the Minister.  In replying to a question of mine, I think, on Wednesday, about a man who was refused the Old Age Pension, the Minister said that the pension was disallowed, not on account of age, but because his means were estimated to exceed £49 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per year.  What exactly does that mean?  Is it because a man is supposed to have earned £49 or £50 that he is not entitled to the pension; is it because that man earned that last year, and is now incapable of working because of old age and bad eyesight, that he is not entitled to receive the pension now?</P>

      <P>It falls to me, I think, to answer the questions that have been raised in respect of Old Age Pensions, because I am the Appeal Officer in this matter.  Deputy Morrissey asked a question. I am not sure, without having the papers before me, of the facts, but I understand that there has been no allegation that the man is not still earning more money than is allowed by the Act.

I have no sympathy with practically anything that was said by the Deputies who have spoken on this question. I am satisfied there are thousands of people getting pensions who are not entitled to get them, and I certainly propose, so far as I am concerned, to see that pensions are not given in the future, as easily as in the past, to people not entitled to get them.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to deprive, or intention to withhold the pension from anyone justly entitled to it, but that is a different thing from saying that we should show no slackness, or that we should go outside the law or go outside the equity of the case.  This question of baptismal certificates, and the impossibility on the part of some people getting them, has been referred to.  We had the other day the case of a man who about four years ago sent up affidavits to prove that he was 70 years of age.  It was stated that no baptismal certificate could be found in his case. His application was refused, but he turned up next year with further affidavits to prove that he was 70 years, and that no baptismal certificate could be found.  He was turned down again.  He came up three or four times at intervals of about a year, and then, last year, he really arrived at the age of 70 years, and he produced the certificate.  This is a matter in which a great deal of fraud is practised.  The fraud does not seem very serious to the individuals, and I would not place very great reliance in affidavits on this matter.  There are numbers of people who would not get into the witness box in a criminal trial, or in any serious matter, and swear a lie, but who would swear a false affidavit in these cases.  They think it is no great harm, as the State can afford to pay a poor man 10/- a week, so that while we accept affidavits we cannot be expected to place explicit reliance on them.  We must have regard to any other circumstances that come to our notice, and if there <Col N="1119" /> are any suspicious circumstances unless the affidavit was very specific and seemed to bear the stamp of truth upon it, I would not undertake to believe it simply because it was sworn to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great number of the people have assigned their property to their children or others.  They are really supported, or would be supported, by those children or those other people, and there is no reason at all why they should get pensions.  Many of them have slipped in and got pensions in the past.  In view of the heavy charge those pensions involve, I think we will have to be a great deal more strict in future.  In many cases people's incomes have not, in my opinion, been estimated properly, and people who have no need of a pension, and could do very well without it have been granted a pension.  There are people who are supported on property quite sufficient to bear them comfortably and they have got a pension.  There again we will have to be more strict.  The Local Committees are not giving the assistance they should give in the administration of this Act.  It is the general rule for local committees to try to get pensions and not sift cases.  I have, of course, known where cases have been sifted, and I know of Committees who do their duty well and have tried to get at the truth, and do not try systematically to mulct the National Exchequer.  Taking the Committees generally, they do not do their duty in any conscientious manner, and they do not assist in the way they should. The charge involved by Old Age Pensions is a very high one, and while we do not want to do injustice to anybody, or inflict hardship on anybody, we must reduce that charge as far as it can be reduced within the law.  It seems to me this whole question of Old Age Pensions is one that has had results that were not expected. There is no doubt that the granting of Old Age Pensions has led to persons taking out-door relief who would have been reluctant, and, perhaps, ashamed, in the past, because of their circumstances, to have applied for out-door relief.  They could have got along, and would have got along, without it. There is no doubt the way in which Old Age Pensions were granted, especially to people not entitled to them, and not needing them, has had a certain demoralising effect.  To prevent that we will have in future to be very strict in seeing that <Col N="1120" /> people who do not need, and are not entitled to, pensions do no get them.  It has been stated by several Deputies that something must be done in regard to this matter of pensions, and that is what I propose to do.</P>

      <P>Frankly, I do not like the note that is struck by the Minister regarding Old Age Pensions.  It indicates that in the mind of the Ministry it is simply a form of poor relief, and something that should be discouraged.  We heard a good deal during the last twelve months from the Ministerial benches about the necessity for fulfilling the obligations we have taken over in respect of Civil Servants and in respect of property people.  We have heard a good deal from the Ministers about the necessity for doing justice to people in regard to their property, not acting in such a way as would make them feel that the new regime was going to deal unjustly and unfairly with people of property, and not make them feel that the new spirit of the country was going to penalise that particular section of the community.  I say that we have at least as big an obligation to the Old Age Pension poor.</P>

      <P>I have no objection whatever to that, but I know that the kind of instruction that goes out from the Central Office, requesting a tightening up, very often results in injustice, and <Col N="1121" /> when we are told that there is going to be some effort made to penalise the old man or woman because his or her relations are in a position to maintain him or her, that is a breach of the law.  You have no right to take into account the wealth, the worldly conditions, of the relatives, and, because of their ability to maintain a pensioner, to compel that pensioner to become a dependent upon his or her relatives, as the case may be. If any of you know anything of the conditions in this country, as in every other country, you will realise that in the case of some relations it is a punishment to ask old people to be dependent upon them.  One of the virtues of this Old Age Pensions Act was to make the old man or woman feel that at least they were paying their way to some degree, and make them have a feeling of some independence, so that they could say, &ldquo;I am paying my way in my daughter's, son's, or son-in-law's house.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Even &ldquo;Having made over my farm.&rdquo;  That may be discreditable in the minds of Ministers and in the minds of farmers, and in the mind of Deputy Lyons, but are we considering this matter as a matter of poor relief or not?  Is it to be considered as an honourable obligation of the community to a citizen who has served the community well and honourably? Is the community going, at least, to ensure that that person is entitled to an independent old age?  You may have cases where men hand over their property to their sons.  Possibly for 20 years the sons have earned all that is handed over to them.  I believe, although it is not in the Act, that every person, rich or poor, ought to have this pension.  The Act makes a limit of income, and I am prepared to stand by that, and ask that it should be fully honoured.  I do not think that the Ministers look at this problem from other than a financial point. There should not be any penalisation of thrift.  We do not desire that the man or woman should always, of purpose, spend every penny they earn.  You encourage them at other times to be thrifty and to save something to assist them in their old age.  Then when they come to <Col N="1122" /> old age and have money to enable them to live decently, or help towards enabling them so to live, you say &ldquo;we will not pay them the pension because they have saved some money.&rdquo;  I say that is a distinct discouragement to the thrift which, at other times, you are urging them to follow.  I would ask the Ministers and the Dáil generally to bear in mind that this provision for old age pensions was drafted and brought into operation as something distinct from Poor-Law Relief, and has not the character of Poor-Law Relief.  It is a pension, an honourable pension, and you ought not to degrade it: unfortunately, Poor-Law Relief is generally considered to be degrading.  It ought not to be brought into the category of Poor-Law Relief, and we ought not to make threats or suggestions that that is to be the end of our administration.  Now there is a matter of more detail I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister for Local Government. It is a typical case, I believe, and I think it would require just that touch of sympathetic consideration that is required in the administration of this Act.  A young man leaves Dublin to go to the country to work.  He leaves a mother and the mother's sister, and he takes responsibility for their maintenance. They become eligible for the Old Age Pension.  He keeps them with the assistance of the Old Age Pension.  The mother becomes decrepit and is obliged to go into hospital&mdash;the hospice for the dying, in fact.  The aunt could go on to the Poor Relief and continue to receive her pension, or the pension could go to her maintenance.  But because maintenance in the hospice is counted as income, bringing her outside the limit allowed by the Act, the pension is lost, The son is faced with the problem, whether he is to send the aunt into the Workhouse&mdash;put her upon the Poor-Law Relief&mdash;so that he can help to maintain his mother in the hospital.  I suggest that an hospital case of that kind ought not to be taken into account as relief, bringing the person outside the range of the Pensions Act; that, as a matter of fact, the hospital people ought to receive the benefit of the pension, rather than that the son's income should be drawn upon to keep the mother in the hospital, so that he might be allowed to continue to maintain the aunt as well.  That is a <Col N="1123" /> case where sympathetic consideration is required in the administration of the Act; but by the very hard and fast line that is being taken under the impulse of the instructions given by the Minister for Local Government &mdash;judging by his speech here to-day &mdash;they are driven to take the hard line, which is doing an injustice, and I say, is not carrying out the spirit of the Act, which is to consider Pensioners as men and women who have served the State, who have done their work for the time, and towards whom the State has an honourable obligation.  I hope it will not be considered in the light of something dishonourable or in the nature of Poor-Law Relief, or in the nature of something that people ought to be ashamed of asking.  The very fact that they have lived their life to the age required, ought to be reckoned to their credit and not to their discredit.  Because the amount is so large is not the fault of the Old Age Pensioners.  That is one of the responsibilities we took over, and it is one of the facts of the situation which we were all aware of when we were demanding the right to administer our own affairs, and to take over these financial obligations. Let us not think of repudiating this particular obligation at any rate.</P>

      <P>I would like to say one word about the subject that has been introduced as to Old Age Pensions.  On both sides of the Dáil it was taken for granted that the fact of the old farmer signing away his right to his property, was a thing strongly to be condemned. There might be another side to that question. When the Old Age Pension Act was introduced I regarded it as very welcome, for the reason that when a farmer came to the age of 70 years, it would be an inducement to him, if he got 10s. a week, to hand over the management of his farm to that middle-aged son or young son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>That son would probably be 30 or 40 years of age, and the farmer, in consideration of getting the pension, would sign over the holding to the son. Anyone interested in agriculture in Ireland must admit that it is a most desirable thing that the management of the small farms of Ireland should be taken out of the hands of men of 70 years of age. <Col N="1124" /> From the point of view of agriculture, and from the point of view of the State, it is a most desirable thing.  From the point of view of the individuals living in the house, it is a most desirable thing. Very often the fact that the father will not give up the holding prevents his son getting married.  That is no new thing. Either the farm should be in the hands of a man of 70 years of age, or in the hands of a man of 30 or 40 years of age. If the old man who worked it all his life assigns it to his son, then he has no way of living.  After all his years he has no way of living.  The passing of the farm from himself to his son has beggared, or, at all events, has qualified him for the Old Age Pension within the meaning of the Act.  To turn round and say to him, &ldquo;You deliberately signed away your holding in order to get the pension,&rdquo; is to accuse him of what is not a very heinous offence.  I say it is a very obvious and reasonable thing to do&mdash;just as a man in the position of a policeman, or a coastguard, or any other position walks out and lets his son walk into the post.  When he walks out of the receipt of benefit from the farm he must get something instead of it.  I say it is one of the best things in the Act.  It might be said in defence of the other point of view, that the least the son might do would be to support the father and mother.  Very well.  It often happens that that father and mother might have sons abroad, or sons in Dublin, far better off than the son left at home, and why should not they through the State, contribute towards the maintenance of this man, as well as the son with whom he is living in the house? Besides, it leaves the father and mother independent.  I am sure one of the intentions of the Act, and with the Act we must carry out its intentions, was to put the old man and woman when they reach 70 years of age in a position of independence, some independence as far as the pensions go.  I am entirely of opinion that every man and woman of the age of 70, no matter what their means are, should get 10s. a week.  If they are well-to-do, if they have a large income, very well; they have paid more towards the State and towards the support of Old Age Pensions than any other man.  They should get the Old Age Pension.  It should not be a question of measuring out what is their income.  Once they are 70 years of age they should get the pension.  The <Col N="1125" /> qualifications for getting the pension were prescribed in the British House of Commons, where they could look back over long traditions as regards baptismal certificates, and union records, and they can have all these particulars with regard to the age easily specified and easily ascertainable.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, owing to circumstances connected with foreign rule, the parish and the State records are either not there or are badly kept.  Therefore you have a pitiful wrangle between the old age pension applicant on the one side, and the Excise officer on the other side, as to the applicant's age.  The Minister for Local Government has told a story which I believe is quite accurate, and which I accept, but other stories can be told on the other side.  I had a letter some time ago from a priest in Mayo giving a list of the names of twelve applicants for old age pensions in his parish, and he said that he was positive that everyone of them was over the age of 70.  He said he could get reliable people, over 70 years, to testify to the fact that these applicants were eligible.  All the applicants were, however, turned down.  I am sure that the Excise officer who investigated the cases was acting honestly, and I believe the priest was also acting honestly.  The Minister for Local Government previously told us that there were a great many old age pensioners in Mayo, but he must remember that three-fourths or five-sixths of the farmers there are under the £6 valuation.  It is not the fault of the applicants that the records are not there, and when they are not there people cannot be blamed for putting up the best case they can.</P>

      <P>I would like to press for a definite reply to the question asked by Deputy O'Shannon as to what is to become of persons for whom there is no record of age.  Up to this, affidavits were received by the Local Government Minister, <Col N="1126" /> and were accepted in most cases but the reply given to Deputy O'Shannon has been surrounded with such ambiguity as to leave the matter in a position worse than before.  In County Wexford, where one church was burned down, it is impossible to get certificates in that parish.  The position of persons for whom records cannot be got should be made known.</P>

      <P>While I do not agree with much that has been said about people with means getting pensions, I agree that there are a number of people who do not get, but are entitled to them. I will never be one to say, where a man disposes of a farm, in his old age, to his son, who is bound to maintain him, that he should get a pension from the State for doing the State out of money it should have got.  I know of cases where people have been refused the pension although younger brothers or sisters who were able to get certificates got the pension.  Yet it was known in some instances that people who were over four years older than people receiving the pension could not get certificates and the pension was refused.  I think that is a case the Government should take into account where it is proved that the applicant is older than the pensioner.  As regards the remarks of Deputy Sears about old men disposing of their farms to their sons, I know many cases in which men who did so were not afterwards wanted in their own house.  I hope that the farmers in this country, whether they get the pension or not, will keep the land in their own hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in connection with this matter to which attention has not been called, and which arises out of Deputy Wilson's reference to the proportion of people in receipt of old age pensions in this country as against England.  It is well known that our old people who have reached the age of 70 are the remnants of a six million population, because in the forties we had a population of eight million, but we have had a dwindling population since.  There is, therefore, a bigger proportion of old people in this country than in England or in any country where there is an increasing population.  That should not be forgotten when looking into the question of proportion of old people in receipt of <Col N="1127" /> pensions.  Deputy Sears drew attention to a very important matter with regard to old people who give over their farms. It is well known that in the West of Ireland, especially in Galway and Mayo, there are a very large number of holdings which really cannot be called farms in the strict sense of the word, and which are uneconomic holdings and insufficient to support even the owner.  Deputy Sears also struck a note&mdash;a very important one, to my mind, and well worthy of consideration.  I think there is a great deal in his suggestion that a man who owns a farm is no less a worker than a man who occupies any public position. The man who owns and works a farm works it for the good of the community, and, having reached the age of 70, is equally entitled to a pension with any other worker who reaches that age.  That is a point of view that is worth some attention, and might be worthy of further development.  I notice in the Estimate that there is a decrease of £50,000 in the amount of pensions payable.  I would like to know whether that is due to the tightening up of which the Minister told us, or whether there is a decrease in the number of people who have reached the age of 70.  With regard to the matter of age, the Minister has told us some peculiar stories, but there are one or two on the other side.  There is a case, for instance, in Galway where a daughter has got the old age pension, but it has been refused to her mother.</P>

      <P>I do not think that I will say anything in reply to what Deputy O'Connell has just said; but in reference to the case of a younger brother, we would not in any case refuse a pension to any man whose younger brother was getting a pension.  We are, however, up against the fact that when one member of the family gets a pension and baptismal certificates are not available, then all the other members of the family claim to be older.  If it were clear that the person seeking the pension is older than the one who gets it, we would grant the claim at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies generally I would like to raise another point, which is, perhaps, going a little bit off the discussion.  It has reference to the Blind Persons Act.  I do <Col N="1128" /> not know if there is any return available to tell us the number of persons at present in receipt of pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act and the Blind Persons Act.  I should like to know, if it were possible for the Minister to tell us even generally, the number of persons in receipt of pensions under the Blind Persons Act and the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons in receipt of old age pensions is 129,883, and in receipt of blind pensions 3,282.  I think it will be noticed from that that a great number of those are in receipt of pensions for which they can scarcely have just claims, and if the case made by Deputies is correct, there are persons refused pensions who are entitled to them.  Very few people can tell me anything about old age pensions and applicants.  I was a member of one of those Committees for a number of years, and I know most of the tricks and the peculiar activities of the applicants. I know of one occasion where a church was burned and the records were missing. That is a great disadvantage to several pensioners.  But the burned church served its purpose to other candidates in the old days.  Where they could not furnish evidence of their birth, and where all other avenues of information were closed, they were surely born in that district where the church was burned.  I know of one person who got a pension at the age of 59.  The residence, of course, was given in the district where the church was burned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly obvious that 129,883 is a fairly respectable total.  It means one old age pensioner out of every 25, and Deputy Lyons mentioned yesterday that there was a family he knew of with ten children and the father and mother.  We will imagine another family of the same sort, and half a family of the same size, and those three together would not have their quota of old age pensions.  It was not the intention at the beginning to give a pension to every person of 70 years of age.  If that be the intention now, a larger sum will be required.  It was the intention at that time to provide some small sum to assist persons who had reached 70 years of age and to give them some little comfort.  It was not enough to keep them at that time, but that was the intention.  Persons in receipt of out-door <Col N="1129" /> relief were barred.  It was obvious that persons who were independent, and at the same time not independent, should get it&mdash;persons who were able to keep themselves apart from any assistance from Poor Law relief.  If the Deputies consider the scope of the Act should be enlarged, I hope when the time comes they will be able to devise some means for raising the revenue.  If we are to carry out the obligations in respect of various services to those people, the best way is not to consent to a reduction in the revenue amounting to £800,000 in the case of sugar and £200,000 in the case of tea.</P>

      <P>It was not the intention in passing this Act to provide pensions for persons whose families were able to support them comfortably.  It was not the intention of the Ministry, and it never was the intention of the Ministry, to withdraw this pension or to exclude from its benefits persons such as were described by Deputy Sears.  Any <i>bona fide</i> cases that can be established, and which meet the provisions of the particular Act in question, each and every one of those we are prepared to honour; but we are not prepared, especially in regard to the experience we have had, to continue to be humbugged.  There are other means of using money raised in the State than giving it to persons who do not really require it, and for whom it is not alone an assistance, but, on the contrary, a luxury.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, recognising that the unwitnessed codicil to the Will of the late Sir Hugh Lane directing a certain collection of pictures belonging to him to be given to the Municipal Gallery of Dublin is the clearest proof that can be ascertained of the owner's wishes for the disposal of the pictures after the owner's death, Dáil Eireann earnestly desires that full and just effect be given to the said collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may, in the language of lawyers, be interpreted as being understood to be an agreed motion.  I feel that in a matter of this kind it is desirable that an agreement should have been reached in order to show the substantial agreement that does exist in the main object to be achieved, and that is getting the Lane Pictures back again.  The actual drafting was undertaken by the Minister for Education, and I have accepted the drafting from him.  I would like to make that clear, because if anyone were to ask me exactly how one ascertains the clearest proof, or what distinction there was between the &ldquo;full and just effect,&rdquo; I would have to refer the questioner to the Minister for Education.  I accept this resolution that has been drafted by him.  I have dealt with the case previously, and I have nothing to add to that except to leave the matter before the Dáil.  Before doing so I want to make one matter perfectly clear.  It is just to myself that I should make this quite clear.  It is, that while for the purpose to be achieved I accept the wording that the Minister has proposed, I am not to be taken as accepting it for the reason that he has suggested. I desire to state here quite clearly that I am not to be accepted as adopting the creed that he has announced, that it is not the business of a Legislature to instruct the Ministry. I believe that it is the business of a Legislature to do so, and I think that it is the greatest honour that any Ministry could receive from any Legislature that it should have been instructed, and particularly that it should have been instructed by a unanimous vote.  I also differ from him&mdash;and I want to make this <Col N="1133" /> clear&mdash;in another matter.  He stated that if my resolution were to have been accepted in its original form it would have been a bad precedent.  If so, the precedent that was to be feared already exists.  On the 20th October last a motion was put forward in this Dáil desiring the Ministry to do a certain thing. That motion was accepted by the Minister for Home Affairs after a certain sentence was changed.  That sentence was changed.  A motion was passed desiring the Ministry to proceed in a certain manner, and action has been taken on it, so that a precedent exists.  On these two grounds I do not accept the reason for the change of wording.  I do very heartily accept the change of wording with a view to achieve the purpose which is as much in his mind as in mine, as much in the mind of the Ministry as in the mind of the Legislature, and that carries consent very widely through the country.  The pictures at the present moment in the National Gallery in London were intended by Sir Hugh Lane to have been placed in the Municipal Gallery in Dublin, and in honour of his wish and in the interests of justice that wish should be carried out and given effect to by whatever method may be found necessary.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is hardly necessary to speak at any length in reference to this resolution.  I have no doubt at all that the resolution represents the unanimous view and wish of the members of the Dáil.  I will not follow the example of the mover of the resolution by directing attention on this occasion to the question of procedure, on which I expressed myself quite clearly on a previous occasion.  The Seanad has already, I think, passed a resolution unanimously expressing its view on this subject.  I take it that the public in this case means the public who are interested in matters of this kind, and that resolution also expresses the unanimous view that the instructed public take on this matter.  It is simply a case of interpreting equitably, and not merely in a technical <Col N="1134" /> way, the desires of the late owner of these pictures.  I have no doubt that the proper weight which should be attached to the unanimous expression of the desires of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be attached to it by those who have the power of regulating the ultimate disposal of the pictures in question. I have nothing to add.  I have already anticipated that a resolution in something like these terms will express the unanimous view of the Dáil, and I trust that the fact that this resolution is accepted in this way, and without, so to speak, much to-do about it, will be taken as an indication that all the members of the Dáil are impressed with the importance that this collection of pictures destined by its owner to be housed in the capital city of Ireland will, without undue delay, find its way to that destination.</P>

One thing I would like to call attention to is an amendment standing in the name of Deputy Thrift.  As it stands at present it will require to be redrafted. For instance, it says, &ldquo;in line 22 to add at the end.&rdquo;  Line 22 and several other lines were deleted by the acceptance of Deputy O'Brien's amendment this day week.  I therefore suggest that this amendment of Deputy Thrift as it now stands is one that could hardly be very satisfactorily proceeded with, and I suggest deferring the resumption of the Committee Stage and the re-drafting of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that motion, which is the main question, I want to give reasons why we should not adjourn at all.  The reason I raise this question is that I want to give the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce an opportunity to explain the Government policy in regard to the importation of men to do Government work in time of a strike and under conditions which are, I allege, a breach of the terms of contract under which that Government work has been entered into.  The immediate matter in question is a strike in the establishment of Messrs.  O'Gorman Brothers, coach-builders, Clonmel.  I understand this firm is engaged on several Government contracts, including the building of two limousines for a high official.  The facts of the case are, broadly, that since the resumption of work in this establishment, which took place at the end of certain military activities in the neighbourhood, a new system of managing the works has been introduced.  The firm has been encouraged and assisted by Government work of considerable value. Some two or three months ago a new foreman was appointed, and with the new foreman was introduced the new policy.  Men were required, and the unions concerned were asked to supply them.  Men were sent from different parts of the country, amongst them the very best men in Ireland in coach-building; men were also brought from London. It was found that some of these men were brought to Clonmel and allowed to work for a week, a fortnight, or three weeks, and dismissed for no reason stated.  At this time, and up to the present, men living in Clonmel, coach-builders who had actually served their time in the firm, have been idle and standing waiting for work&mdash;competent men, as I say, who had served their time in the works, while men were brought from all parts of the country.  Not only that, but the head of this firm, a frequent advertiser in London papers, has been over several times to London to interview men.  He brought these men to Clonmel, and shortly afterwards dismissed other men belonging to the town who had been engaged in the works.  This sort of work culminated in a dispute, the immediate cause of which was the refusal <Col N="1137" /> of the manager or the proprietor to interview the union officials in the presence of the local official of the union who had worked in the shop, on the assertion that this local official had threatened the employer. The allegation was denied, and the man in question was prepared to prove its untruth.  The refusal of the firm to meet the local official was the immediate occasion of this strike on the part of the coach-builders in this establishment. Since that day there has been a regular run of men from London into this establishment&mdash;non-union men, men whom we all designate blacklegs and strike-breakers, who have come deliberately and knowingly for the purpose of breaking the strike.  We are not asking the Government to intervene in the matter of this strike between the firm and the men, but we are asking them not to allow Government work to be carried on under conditions which are a distinct breach of the Fair Wages Clause under which the work has been undertaken. The conditions under which the work has been undertaken are, that the work shall be carried on according to the conditions of the district.  These conditions include the terms approved of and agreed to by reputable firms and associations in the industry and reputable employers or association of employers in the industry in the district.  This practice of bringing in men from London to do work on Government contracts, or on private contracts, while men in the same business and of equal capacity, certainly of average capacity, as good men as Ireland has been able to turn out, ought not to be encouraged, but ought distinctly to be discouraged.  If it is not to be discouraged on Government contract work by the Government for whom the contract is being undertaken, then it will be discouraged very effectively by the men of the town of Clonmel and by the public generally.  The introduction of strike-breakers, and non-union strikebreakers at that, from across the water will not and ought not to be tolerated. I am raising the matter to-day in the hope that by doing so publicly trouble of a very unpleasant kind will be averted. If the dispute between the firm and the men is to be allowed to pursue its ordinary way, well and good; but on work of this kind, if a firm that is undertaking Government contracts is to be allowed <Col N="1138" /> to work at these contracts by labour brought in from England at great expense and living in the establishment of the employer under conditions such as I have indicated, it is not going to be for the health of the State, and may not be for the health of anybody concerned.  As I have said, I raise the matter in the hope that trouble of a kind which we would all deplore may be avoided.  The men trained in Ireland at this work are amongst the best men to be got anywhere; the men that have been sent to O'Gorman's by the union concerned&mdash; craftsmen of very high skill&mdash;are amongst the best men to be got anywhere.  They have turned out the best work that has ever been produced in the country.  For some reason that nobody has been able to explain, the new policy of the firm has been to change these men frequently and to introduce men from across the water who have been used to doing a different kind of work in a different way entirely from that customary.  As I say, the firm itself has had the training of apprentices to the coach-building; it has turned out efficient coach-builders; it sees these men standing idle on the streets of Clonmel whilst it goes to London to bring over other men to do the work for the Irish Government.  It is not a pleasant thing to contemplate, and I hope something may be said here this afternoon which will help to avoid the difficulty that is inevitable if this practice is to be allowed or encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>ASSISTANT MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. J.B. Whelehan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment with regard to this dispute at Clonmel is that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been approached by both parties to the dispute with a view to a settlement and as I shall very likely be called upon to intervene with a view to a settlement, I do not think I should at the present moment say anything which might tend to prejudice the chances of an early settlement of the dispute.  Deputy Johnson, however, raised questions which, apart altogether from this dispute, I might, perhaps, refer to.  He stated what might be accepted as a general principle, that it is very undesirable, and is not at all likely to meet with approbation, to import labour from any country, more particularly in times like the present, <Col N="1139" /> when unemployment is so rife here in the Saorstát; that is very undesirable and is not to be commended, and it will not be encouraged.  I wish to state that as a general principle.  I do not purpose saying anything at all with regard to the dispute in Clonmel, because at the present moment we are in touch with both parties with a view to an early settlement.</P>

If the Ministry thinks and has made up its mind that it is desirable for the Dáil to meet on Monday <Col N="1140" /> week, I would ask my friend to withdraw his amendment.  If the Ministry has taken the responsibility of saying that next week should be free, but that we should meet upon the following Monday, then I say we ought not to seek to alter that choice, and we should fall in with the intention of the Ministry on a matter of that kind, because they know the amount of work to be done, and they have made up their mind that it can be done satisfactorily, having given the holiday next week.  Let the responsibility, then, be upon the heads of the Ministry.</P>
