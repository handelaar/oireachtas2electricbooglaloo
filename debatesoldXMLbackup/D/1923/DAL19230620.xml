      <P>I do not wish to add anything to what I said on the First Reading of this Bill.  It is for the purpose of putting into operation the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust, the establishment of which was authorised by a British Act called the Irish Free State Consequential Provisions Act, and for the working of which the British Treasury will provide a sum of one and a half million pounds.  The entire work of the Trust will be financed by the British Exchequer. There will be no charge upon this country.  It will provide a considerable number of houses, which are very badly wanted.  They are wanted for all classes of the community, and it will <Col N="2148" /> serve to the extent to which it goes in relieving the housing shortage.  There is nothing in the Consequential Provisions Act as to the proportions in which the money will be divided between Saorstát Eireann and the Six Counties.  There was a provisional allocation before the passing of the Bill on the basis of 2,626 to the Free State and 1,046 to Northern Ireland.  I think the Bill is not one to which any objection could be taken.  The power of compulsorily acquiring land is not given to the Trust, but the Minister for Local Government may exercise that power, if he thinks so fit, at the request of the Trust.  I beg to move the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity which the resolution provides for saying a word or two about one aspect of this Bill which may enable the Minister to speak, perhaps, more confidently when we come to the Committee Stage.  I am referring to the period from which the pensions will be payable.  Will they date back to any time, or will they be only payable from the passing of the Bill?  More important still in one respect, I want to raise the question of the differences between the amounts provided with respect to officers and men, more particularly the men engaged in the fighting from 1916 to 1921 or 1922.  I think that the differences are too great, and are not justified by the circumstances of that time, whatever might be the fact in regard to the Army of the present and the future.  We know that in 1916 and pre-1916 that the Volunteers and the Citizen Army were comprised pretty generally of one grade, or within very small difference of one grade, in the social scale, and it was largely a matter of chance that one man was a commissioned officer, and another, his comrade, was a non-commissioned officer or private.  The distinction that is drawn in the pension scale does not in any degree conform to any distinction that prevailed then.  It seems to me somewhat unfortunate that we should make the big difference between the pensions scale, and more particularly in regard to the widows' pensions and the children's allowance.  Take an instance <Col N="2150" /> I have in mind, of two men, artisans, comrades in every way, friends of years standing, whose wives were associated, lived as neighbours' children, brought up together, and in every respect men of the same social scale, standing, outlook on life and associations.  One chose to be, and remained, a private.  The other was an officer.  They both lost their lives. Under the provisions of the Bill, in the one case the widow and children would be in receipt of £85 16s.; in the other case the widow and children would be in receipt of £186, in addition to which there is provision for an amount not exceeding £35 per year per child for the years between 12 and 18.  Now, the effect of that is to make a gulf between the children which did not apply to the parents.  It means that the children of the one are to be treated and educated in a way which the children of the other are precluded from.  I think that is unfortunate. But, inasmuch as the numbers in those years were not very great, I would like to press upon the Minister the desirability of modifying this schedule somewhat at least in the direction that the children of the private and non-commissioned officer would be enabled to receive the same training and education as the children of the commissioned officer, so that that difference which would develop under this scheme between the social scale of the sons of one man and the sons of the other would not arise.  I fear that the effect of this present scheme would be to create a difference which the men affected&mdash;the men who have lost their lives&mdash;would be the last to assent to.  I think that there could well be a distinction drawn between the earlier period and the later period.  I think very few will dissent from the proposition, for instance that the men who were active in the 1916 period might be treated separately, or even that those who were active up to the period of the Truce might be treated separately from the Army of to-day and the future.  I am drawing attention to this matter now, as I think it is the right occasion to do it, with a view of hearing from the Minister, when we come to discuss the schedules, if he will be prepared to make some modifications in the scheme that is presented to us.</P>

      <P>On the point as to how far back the payments of pensions and of gratuities will go in this <Col N="2151" /> matter.  That is defined in the particular Clauses of the Bill.  In the case of the man who lost his life or suffered disablement from wounds at any date prior to the 1st April, 1922, the payment of pension allowance in that particular case will be from the date, 1st April, 1922, and in the case of men losing their lives or suffering disablement from wounds at any date subsequent to that date, payment of pension allowance will be due to be made as from the date of death, or receipt of disabling wound.  This is defined in Clause 8 (3) and in Clause 4 (3).  The Bill generally makes it perfectly clear.  On the matter of the differences between the officers and men, these differences, I have pointed out, have been very material.  What is sought throughout the whole of this Bill to do is not exactly to pay compensation, but to endeavour to place the widow and children of any deceased member of the forces in such a position as he, if he had lived, would probably be able to place them.  The officers that we have had, both in 1916 and the subsequent period and at the present time, have been men of initiative and character and ability as distinguished from the men who occupied subordinate positions, in such a way as to warrant our assuming that in the ordinary walks of life they would have distinguished themselves and progressed to a greater extent than the ordinary volunteers. Even in the case in which you have two men living side by side in the same street and brought up in the same associations, where you have the difference between men of that type that one will, in such a period as we have gone through, accept the responsibilities of an officer and accept the duties requiring energy and attention and hard work that falls on an officer as distinct from the ordinary private or volunteer, you must admit that there are material differences in character between two such men that warrant us in assuming that one would have attained to a better position in the ordinary affairs of the country than the other would.  That is when you take general cases.  If you take a particular case, it is always easy, perhaps, to argue for a particular case; but we are dealing with general cases that affect a number of different years in the country and a <Col N="2152" /> number of different parts of the country. On the general principle of making any particular distinction and of reviewing the principle by which we differentiate between officers and men, I do not think that I can undertake to make any changes.  When you consider the proposal that we propose to make in respect of the education of children, there are only certain types and certain classes of children whom it is anything but a hardship to inflict education on up to eighteen years of age.  While you may have many children of ordinary soldiers, exceptional children, who under ordinary circumstances might be able to make their mark at school to such an extent as to warrant their remaining at school and progressing at school through means of scholarship to take the fullest possible advantage of educational facilities, we cannot say generally that the class as a whole are such as would ordinarily have their education carried to that particular age.  I am prepared to admit that there are children of the class of soldiers and ordinary volunteers whom it might be considered proper should be facilitated in their later school work, and I will undertake to consider whether, in respect of such children, whom it can be reasonably established either would have had these educational facilities if the father were alive or would be capable of benefiting generally from them, arrangements cannot be made to make provision for such children in the cases of non-commissioned officers and men.  I will also say, perhaps, that we might consider the question as to all the men who took part in the 1916 rising&mdash; that is, the first period with which this Bill deals&mdash;whether special consideration may not be given in the case of men of that particular period in respect of pensions and gratuities due under this Bill and whether they could not be made at some flat rate.  I will promise to have this point considered by the next day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The promise of the Minister is satisfactory in respect of those two points upon which he has given us an assurance.  I would reinforce what I said earlier by reminding him that rank in the 1916 period did not necessarily represent any difference of ability or competence, but very largely represented opportunity. One man had more time to devote to the work of an officer than <Col N="2153" /> another.  I think that is so, and certainly in cases that I am personally aware of the rank of the officer did not warrant one in thinking that he was likely to make a better position for himself in the material thing of life in the future over and above the position that would be won by many of those in his company.  I think the promise of the Minister to consider the matter, particularly in relation to the men of the early period, when it was a pure volunteer force, covers most of my desire in the matter, and I thank him for the promise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a matter which I mentioned on the Second Reading which I intended to bring up in Committee, but as I read this Financial Motion now I take it that I shall be precluded from doing so unless I raise it now.  That is in respect of persons who served in these forces during our recent war, and whose families may now suffer some injury by reason of illnesses or constraint other than those that can be definitely described as wounds.  I mention the case on the Second Reading of a number of those who are now in a state, say, of consumption, whose lives, in fact, have been despaired of.  Three such definite cases are now present to my mind, and there are many other cases of a like sort.  The Minister, when dealing with that matter, when I dealt with it on the Second Reading, stated that it was very difficult to get such cases absolutely checked, and in saying that he stated what was a very obvious truth.  It is very hard to get cases of that kind definitely checked, and it is very hard to prove that injuries of that kind were sustained as a direct result of active service, but if such proof in the future could be provided, then I suggest that it would be unjust to preclude from the purview of such a Bill as this, and therefore <i>a fortiorari</i> to preclude from the purview of the financial motion which we are discussing, the relation of such cases as those. There are, as I say, a number of cases where I think such proof could be instantly provided.  I am not asking that these cases should now be considered, and that the matter should now be finally decided, but I am asking what I am sure the Minister will agree is reasonable, and that is that the power of the Financial Motion and, <i>ergo</i>, the powers of the Bill to follow, should not preclude the consideration <Col N="2154" /> of such cases.  If this Financial Motion passes in the form before us it will be impossible for us in the Committee Stage to consider such cases.  You, sir, I assume would be required to rule such matters out of order because they were not provided by the financial resolution, and if they are not covered by the Bill itself, then all these cases pass by for the future, and I think that that would be an injustice.  I suggest, without deciding these matters or without going into the whole question now, that the limits of the financial resolution and of the Bill itself should be so extended that, if at some future date satisfactory proof was available that injuries of the kind to which I refer were sustained as a result of hostilities in the war of liberation, people who incurred such injuries should not be precluded from the beneficial consequences of this Bill.  Clearly they ought not to be.  There are two cases of people who have been injured which occurred to my mind&mdash;one of a young lad who was injured, and had to have an amputation of his hand, but who, nevertheless, kept his life, and another case of a comrade of his who is at the present moment in a sanatorium in this county, and whose life is despaired of. Clearly the second case is much more injurious than the first.  By this Bill the relatives of the first will be compensated, while in the case of the relatives of the second, for whom the lad was a breadwinner, no compensation will be given. I think that a case such as this comes within the general principles of the Bill, and if that were agreed the financial resolutions should be enlarged.  I suggest this to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALFRED BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the same defects in this motion as does the previous speaker.  I was going to ask the Minister whether cases such as those referred to by Deputy Figgis could not be considered or whether this motion could not be altered when the Bill goes forward to allow of cases where disabilities occur owing to army service other than wounds inflicted in fighting I am personally aware of a case in which a young man in the early stages after the Treaty was signed, one of those young men who was cheered through the streets of Dublin went to take possession of one of our barracks from the British military.  There was no one on the premises to advise <Col N="2155" /> them of the proper quarters to sleep in, and this young man was put to sleep in a bed where there were dirty blankets in what was believed to be a hospital section. As a result of that, this young man has lost the sight of one of his eyes, and the other one will, during the next week or so, be lost also.  He was a very poor boy, and I believe a very good soldier, and if this Bill debars cases like that, I think it should be amended.  I only know one case, and will confine myself to that, and I ask the Minister whether a Board of Medical Referees should be set up to enquire into such cases as the one I have mentioned.  It would save injustice being done to such young men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether those men who are interned without any charge having been brought against them, and who are suffering from wounds sustained in the Anglo-Irish war will be entitled to compensation through this Act.  I have received several communications from friends and dependants of those men in prison de claring that those prisoners are innocent. These men did a great deal to win the liberty of their country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question I would like to ask, that is whether the large number of men who at the present time are suffering from loss of health owing to services rendered against the British Government will be included? This is a question of people who lost their health, and are not able to carry out their usual duties.  It is not necessary for me to put forward the claims of the dependants of those who died from pneumonia, and those relatives of people who were shot, but I would like the Minister to answer the question whether those people who suffered any hardship will also be included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise there is that problem of persons who have suffered in health because of their military activities, but the number of actual cases is not at all as great as the number <Col N="2156" /> of claimant cases that are submitted to us.  We are not prepared to undertake any commitment now either in the terms of the financial resolution, or in the terms of this Bill, which is meant to meet a very great proportion of the problem, and meet it quickly.  We have no power to enter into any demands in respect of cases of loss of health.  At the present moment that matter is under consideration with a view to seeing how best to deal with cases of that kind that can be established and that are bona fide.  As to the matter of people who were disabled in previous periods, and who are now interned under suspicion, or for one reason or another, I do not know if there are interned any people who can be described as so disabled, but the discrimination that shall be made in the application of this Bill will not be hard or harsh, and any case of the kind will get the most careful consideration from us when it comes before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to press the matter I raised very much further, but I do feel a very short time later would have been too late.  The Minister states with great justice, while recognising the conditions of the claims of such persons I have just mentioned, that it is not the intention to make commitments in the Bill.  I think that is very just, and very right, but what I do urge the Minister is what I earlier urged, and this is entirely a separate matter; the Executive Council should make commitments to take power to deal with such cases when they arise.  As I read the Bill, and as I read the Financial Resolution, these powers do not exist at the present time.  In other words, if such cases hereafter have to be dealt with they would require entirely fresh legislation, whereas a very small change in the wording might leave it open in the future to deal with such cases without the necessity for such legislation.  I think that that would be more expeditious as well as being more just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the view, if I may, A Chinn Chomhairle, that at least the Minister would take powers in the Resolution, and ultimately in the Bill, to deal with cases of special hardship.  I was proposing to ask the Dáil to agree to an amendment on the lines that have been mentioned <Col N="2157" /> by Deputy Figgis, and also to ask for amplification of the definition clause, the word &ldquo;wound&rdquo; to include illness contracted as a direct consequence of active service.</P>
      <P>Judging by the Minister's statement he is not prepared to accept that, but at least it would be desirable that he should have power under the Resolution and under the Act to make provision for cases which are clearly attributable to service in the Army.  Let me instance a case which I think is typical, the case of William Patridge, who prided in calling himself Volunteer Partridge.  He fought in 1916; he was sentenced, imprisoned, ill-treated, and as a direct consequence, as can be clearly proved, of his ill-treatment, he died.  Under the Bill I think his widow and dependants have no claim, but it is clearly a case where there ought to be a claim.  While the Minister deprecates dealing with special cases, and I admit the undesirability of trying to argue from special cases to a general principle, nevertheless that is a good reason for getting power to deal with special cases, and the Bill does not provide for that power.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless the Resolution would preclude a reference to persons who may not yet be deceased, or who may not for a long time die, and yet who, at the present moment are removed by reason of the nature of <Col N="2158" /> their activities for this nation from the maintenance of those who have hitherto reasonably looked to them for that maintenance. In other words would we be precluded in the Committee Stage of this Bill from giving an interpretation to the word &ldquo;wound&rdquo; that might extend its ambit, so as to include, say, cases of consumption.</P>

      <P>I felt that myself, and that is why I am pressing the matter.  I feel that once this Resolution is passed the thing has become too late, and it is while the Resolution is still before the Dáil that I am urging the Minister to consider this kind of case. There is one case that is very well known to him.  I am not arguing special cases now.  I am giving this case because I know there are four or five other cases of a like nature.  There is one case well known to him, the case of a trusted officer of the Army who served very valiantly and very gallantly in the days of our war, but who at the present moment is merely holding on to life by the sheer power of his will.  There are other cases of the kind.  I know one case of a lad who at the present moment is dying in a sanatorium in Co. Dublin.  These are two cases that I have in mind, and they can be multiplied.  They are definitely cases of persons who are suffering from illness contracted while engaging in this war, just as definitely as any person who received a wound, in fact with far more injurious results.  It is not the intention, I am sure, of the Bill to preclude such persons, but the Dáil is bound to preclude them if the Financial Resolution precludes them.  Therefore, I urge that the terms of the Financial Resolution should be so extended that they are not precluded.</P>

      <P>The Amendment in my name, which has just been read, is intended to cover such a case as that to which I referred a few moments ago, where a man died directly as the result of injuries or disease while a prisoner, such imprisonment being a direct consequence <Col N="2164" /> of his acts as a soldier.  There may be other cases&mdash;I do not know of them&mdash;besides that of William Partridge. It is quite likely there are, and it is so clearly a case for allowance to the widow and children that power ought to be given in the Bill for the Minister to make such allowance.  As was pointed out, to my gratification, the Resolution we have agreed to does cover such a case, but inasmuch as the Bill does not cover such a case, I would urge the Minister to accept this Amendment either in its present form or some modified form which would carry out the intention.  I think the form of drafting is satisfactory, but if the intention of the Amendment is accepted, then I have no objection to any modification of the drafting.</P>

I really think that the case he mentioned, and two or three other cases that occur to our memories will be amply covered by a form of words that would include death as a direct result.  The case of Partridge was a direct result.  There are several other direct results that nevertheless could not be considered as immediate results.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to consider this proposed amendment, but I am not prepared to accept it right away.  You must consider the very large number of persons who were during the years 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919, down to 1921, thrown into internment camps. To commit yourself to compensation in all these cases in which claims are made for disease contracted in these circumstances, or to include anything like that in the Bill, would be open to the same objection that we had to the question of persons claiming to have suffered in health as a result of military service.  It might very well involve us in a large number of claims and in fairly big financial expenditure that we do not contemplate and have not contemplated in considering this Bill.  All I can undertake to do is to consider the amendment <Col N="2165" /> with a view to seeing later whether an amendment on the Report Stage somewhat on those lines cannot be introduced.</P>

As a matter of fact, I think there were cases of deaths just a little over the period set out in the proposed amendment. I remember one case myself in which death occurred seven months after release from prison in 1916, and that was the result of illness contracted in prison.

      <P>Unfortunately for Deputy Johnson I am taking the other view, which is that the Bill, and the amendments to the Bill, will have to be interpreted in the light of the Money Resolution, so I am afraid <Col N="2167" /> we cannot define &ldquo;wound&rdquo; in a special way unless we did so when we were passing the Money Resolution.  In point of fact, this particular amendment, which it is now endeavoured to propose, was pretty well discussed on the Money Resolution, and I allowed that discussion very freely because it was apparently plain to everybody that an amendment could not be introduced in the Bill unless the Minister consented to withdraw the Money Resolution and have it amended.</P>

      <P>The Clause as it stand reads &ldquo;The word `wound' means any wound or injury received by an officer or soldier in the course of his duty while on active service.&rdquo;  The injury may be received while the man, as a direct consequence of service, was, for instance, in hospital or in prison. The Minister in making his allowance may say that until he is discharged he is on active service.  I am doubtful whether a man would be considered to be on active service if he were a prisoner.  I think there may be other injuries, or perhaps wounds, received as a consequence of active service and yet not while actually engaged in warfare.  If the Minister assures us that a soldier is on active service since May, 1916 until he has been dismissed from the Army, then I admit I have no case.  I submit there may be damage received as a consequence of active service by virtue of the fact that he was a soldier, which ought to bring such a soldier within the provisions of this Act.</P>

      <P>The actual expression &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is defined in this way in the Bill as applied to an officer or soldier: &ldquo;whenever such officer or soldier is attached to or forms part of a force which is engaged in operations against the enemy, or is engaged in military operations in a place wholly or partly occupied by the enemy, and in this definition the word `enemy' includes all armed mutineers, armed rebels, armed rioters and pirates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Actually going as far back as 1916, a man who was in prison or internment at that particular time, in the hands of the British, may be accepted as being on active service.  As far as our subsequent operations are concerned, active service will mean where a man is actually engaged on duties that are, as a result of his being a member of the Volunteers or of his being on military service at the time, under the terms of that definition. I do not anticipate any difficulty, and I do not understand what the Deputy's difficulty is, except the point where a man was on active service in 1917, we will say if he was a member of the Volunteers then, though there was not very much doing, or if a man was on active service while in prison.  If he was in prison as a result of activities carried out by him as a volunteer, then he is on active service, but there will be little difficulty in our declaring or certifying that a man was on active service in any particular type of case that I can imagine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of these Commissions, it appears from a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture that the Commission of Agriculture have furnished two or three reports and he added the further information that it was the intention to make these reports the basis of subsequent legislation.  I suggest that these reports, and I include the report which it would appear has been made by the Commission on Reconstruction and Development and of which the Press of <Col N="2172" /> this country has given us some kind of synopsis, should be in the first instance circulated to Deputies before being made available for the public and in any case should be made available for Deputies, as in the case of the Commission on Agriculture, where the public has not been admitted to confidence in the matter. I mention that merely because it would help in the general information as to the work that is going on and furnish the information, which is being made available by those Commissions, more widely than has been done up to the present.  I would like to ask the Minister if he could make a fuller statement than he has already made with respect to the North Eastern Boundary Bureau. It appears from the details as furnished, that it is not possible at present to determine when the labours of this Bureau will be completed.  In the same details it is mentioned with regard to the Judiciary Committee that it is not possible to determine when its labours will be completed, but since then its labours have been completed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the North Eastern Boundary Bureau I think that this would make a fitting opportunity for reviewing the work of the Bureau in special regard to the work it has undertaken&mdash;the furnishing of information so as to decide the work to be eventually undertaken by the Boundaries Commission when it is set up.  It would be well to know if the delay in setting up the Boundaries Commission is in any way due to the lack of information available, which the Bureau has yet to furnish and make good.  I think the fact that this vote raised the question of the Bureau, provides an opportunity for giving information with regard to the Boundary Commission which lies definitely within the allocation of the sum to be allowed here under this vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the curiosity of the last Deputy shall not be satisfied by the Minister for Finance.  I take as much interest in this particular Boundary Commission as most men.  I have some knowledge of the work, and I think the Estimate put down here for it is a very modest one&mdash;£4,300.  If the work of that Commission fructifies to the extent of securing its objective, I think we will have the unity of the Irish nation, that is, of the thirty-two counties, very <Col N="2173" /> cheaply.  I am most extremely anxious that the Boundary Commission should come into operation at the earliest possible date, but I do not think there has been any delay.  It is not delay when work has been undertaken that it is essential should precede the operation of the body that is to be set up.  In so far as I have any acquantance with the work of this bureau, it has been engaged in doing that which was absolutely essential in order that when the Boundary Commission should operate it would operate with a fair prospect of the ideas we have in mind being realised.  I think it is not helpful to the idea of securing what we wish from the Boundary Commission to be always harping upon delay. To my mind there has been no delay, but really essential work has been done which will make it possible for the Ulster provisions of the Treaty to operate in a sense that will be equitable and satisfactory.  I do not think that any good purpose would be served by dissecting or analysing the work of this bureau.  I think we must remember that this is a public assembly.  We must remember that the conduct of the work and the actions that precede the setting up of the Boundary Commission are of a very delicate and sensitive nature, and there is much that cannot be disclosed with due consideration of the serious issues involved.  I have no doubt that many people in this country, especially in the city of Belfast, would like the President to make a statement here disclosing all that he thought about this matter, and every card that he wished to play in the negotiations that are to follow or to precede, or to go along with the setting up of a Boundary Commission.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding that, all I have said stands.  There is one other Commission with which I have some association, namely, the Commission on Reconstruction and Development.  I am a little puzzled about it.  There is an item down in salaries here&mdash;£250&mdash;which does not seem to me to be adequate.  We have a very able gentleman secretary to that Commission, and I believe there are a number of clerks and typists.  I think the amount is not sufficient to cover the salaries of those people, nor do I quite understand how the £750 for travelling and incidental expenses arises.  Does that include one year's travelling expenses of the members of the Commission, or is it anticipated that this Commission should be roving round the country to see what localities are capable of development? There have been none of these antics so far.  It has met in Dublin up to the present.  The point that puzzles me is that the figure for salaries should be so low, and the figure for travelling and incidental expenses seems to be rather excessive, in view, so far as I know, of the very slight expenses that will be incurred under that heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, perhaps, we might have been dealing with these in alphabetical order.  I want the Minister to assure the Dáil that the members of these various Commissions are not, as is commonly reported, making a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; out of them.  So far as my experience goes it is not the fact that a member who acts upon one of these Commissions is, thereby, increasing his income in any particular whatever.  I think it is necessary that there should be some assurance given that, apart from members who act upon one of these giving their services, for which they may be recompensed according to a certain scale, there is no payment whatever to the average member of such a Commission. That is my experience, and I have had a little experience on several Commissions.  So far as I can tell from that experience the Commissioners are not being paid for any of their services. The North-Eastern Boundary Bureau has been referred to.  I want to ask the Minister if he will tell us why publications coming under the head, I presume, <Col N="2175" /> of &ldquo;Publicity&rdquo; in the incidentals here, are not subscribed with the name of the authority issuing these publications.  I may be a little bit in the dark in this, I may be speaking &ldquo;off the book.&rdquo;  But certain printed matter is being distributed widely, and some typewritten matter is being distributed widely, containing no clue as to the origin.  I am jumping to the conclusion that this matter, which is evidently and obviously issued from a Government office, is coming from the North-Eastern Boundary Bureau and is paid for out of this item of incidental expenses under the heading &ldquo;Publicity.&rdquo; Perhaps the Minister will tell me that it is not true that these publications are coming out of this office, and, if so he may be able to tell me where exactly they are coming from.  I think a law passed in the British Parliament some time ago has been taken over by the Saorstát, which says that in certain circumstances every printed leaflet dealing with certain public affairs must bear the name of the printer and publisher.  I hope the Government is taking that into account.  Whether they are compelled by law to do that or not, I would ask the Minister if he will see that whatever Commission or body issues this publicity work will attach the name of the responsible authority to the printed matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a small item &ldquo;Commission on Agriculture&mdash;one copying typist (temporary), 31s. 1d. per week, inclusive.&rdquo;  I hope that is a very junior typist, and I hope the official responsible for fixing the wage at 31s. 1d. per week has not been acting under the direct instructions of the Minister for Finance.  There is a rather more important matter I would like to refer to.  When Commissions are set up, presumably intended by the Ministry to do their work with due regard to its importance, they should not be hampered by other departments for want of information that they require.  I am referring to the Stationery Office or the Treasury which instructs the Stationery Office in regard to official publications that have been called for, and which are only allowed for the use of the Commissions on a very stinted scale indeed.  Either the Commissioners have to take their work seriously or not.  If not, they ought not to be appointed.  If they are expected to discharge the work as the importance of it demands they should be facilitated <Col N="2176" /> by other Government Departments, and the plea of economy ought not to prevail when a Commission requests, or its officers request, that facilities should be given to the Commissioners to do their work thoroughly.  The intention of the Treasury to see that good value is got for any expenditure is a very laudable one, but I am afraid that the Treasury is apt to follow the line that diminution of expenditure is equivalent to economy.  If these Commissions are not to be assisted then they ought to be scrapped, and I would put in the word that they ought not to be thwarted in the proper following out of their duties by any other Department stinting the supply of material. That argument might well apply to staffs of such Commissions.  I hope that nothing by way of extravagance has been demanded by any of the Commissions I have been connected with.  I do not think anything extravagant has been demanded. But the proper carrying out of the work requires efficient staffing and a sufficient supply of such printed matter as may be necessary to inform the Commissioners. I think it is necessary to draw the attention of the Minister and the Dáil to the fact that there has been a tendency to stint Commissions that have been set up in regard to equipment for carrying out their work satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by the Deputy for Cork, somebody does know something about the Commission on Prices, as it is popularly called.  An interm report from the Commission is already in draft and is being circulated to members of the Commission for consideration. The Commission, which has had several sittings, has done its work conscientiously and carefully, with very little support from the public, on whose demand it was originally set up.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to look into the matter of publications, but the Deputy well knows that, even though a Commission has reported, it sometimes lingers on.  It is not easy for the Ministry or for any Government to limit the time of a Commission, or to mark the time at which the Commission will cease its labours.  The Deputy knows that and I have often stressed it.  As regards that particular Commission, I am not going to make any statement. It is doing its work.  If it can get any assistance it ought to get it.  If there be any Deputy in this Chamber who thinks he can afford any assistance to the Committee or to the Bureau, it is his duty, as a public representative, to render that assistance.  The gentleman who is at the head of that Bureau is known to practically all the Deputies of the Dáil, and I think they are fairly well aware of the fact that he has been associated with this work for a very long time, and that he is not unwilling to accept any assistance that can be given.  The result of the <Col N="2178" /> particular work he is doing cannot be estimated now, and ought not be the subject of discussion.  We have no objection to any criticism that will be based upon his capacity for the work, or class of work, he is doing, but at least, Deputies ought to acquaint themselves with the particular activities of the Committee before the matter is brought up for discussion. From my knowledge of the work that is done there it cannot be improved upon.  I would be glad to see it improved upon.  I would be glad to get some information as to how it can be improved, and so would the gentleman who is running this Department.  I do not know anything about the matter that is mentioned by Deputy Johnson.  If he gives me the reports he mentions I will undertake to give him the information he has asked for.  He states he is not sure whether they have been issued from the Bureau or not.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy shows me them, I will undertake to get him the information he wishes.  As regards the Commissions, those who sit on those Commissions are not paid.  I should say that it is the function of the Ministry of Finance to criticise expenditure. I have not heard any complaints from any of the Commissions that they were hampered in their work by reason of any unwarranted interference or unreasonable impositions on the part of the Ministry.  If there were any such complaints, I would have heard of them. Perhaps the Commissions have not gone so far as to make representations, and I have only to express the hope that they will not go that far.</P>
      <P>Deputy Whelehan has answered a point made by Deputy de Róiste.  I would like to say, generally, on the question of Commissions, that they were appointed in good faith.  We wish to carry out the recommendations they made.  I think Deputies are aware of our financial resources, and any limitation there has been on our activities with regard to these reports or any limitation that there will be, is by reason of the fact that there is a shortage of money.  I hope Deputies will bear that in mind.</P>

I would like to draw attention to the fact that one officer, who, one would have hoped, might find useful occupation&mdash;an arterial drainage officer who received £359 last year&mdash;is taken off the list for this year.  I presume that in the minds of the Department concerned it was not found necessary to keep this officer at this work, but in view of what is generally thought to be a very great need, I hope the removal of this officer's salary from this Estimate does not mean that the work he might be doing has <Col N="2180" /> been suspended, unless, indeed, it may turn out that all the work he could do in respect of arterial drainage has been done, and that he is now only waiting for the carrying out of the plans.</P>

      <P>As regards this vote, I think a good deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed generally over the way contracts are given by the Board of Works.  If my information is correct, the Board of Works places a certain number of firms on a schedule or something of that kind, and no firm outside of those scheduled can tender for those works.  I do not think that such a practice lends itself to economy.  Possibly the Board of Works may be of opinion that outside of those firms nobody is fitted to do the particular class of work they require.  I hold, however, that all firms, either in the building or other trades, when they are capable of doing the work set out under the various contracts, should be given an opportunity of tendering.  I understand that in the past only a limited number of firms have had an opportunity of tendering for many of those contracts.  That state of affairs should be remedied.  There are a number of small firms here and there throughout the country, perhaps in country towns, who are capable of carrying out work just as well as some of the large firms who get the contracts.  It is not a good thing for any Government Department to permit a certain number of firms to tender for a particular class of work, while other firms are kept out.  If my information <Col N="2181" /> is correct, that method has been adopted in the past in regard to several contracts.  The Minister may be in a position to give us some information on the matter.  I am sure when he investigates this subject he will see that any state of affairs such as I have described, if it exists, will be remedied.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse what Deputy Hughes has just said.  I would even go further than what he proposes, and I say that any public work that requires to be done in Ireland should be open to all traders who may be free to do it, provided they can give the same securities and guarantees for carrying it out that other firms are required to give when the contracts are given them.  It is a fact that up to this lists of traders in certain trades have been arranged, and contracts have been reserved to one or other of the firms on those lists.  I think it is grossly unfair, in view of the record of the Board of Works, that they should continue to reserve contracts to certain contractors. I believe it is a fact that at the present moment several contracts that have been placed by the Board of Works have been carried out in such a manner that rejection after rejection of the work done has taken place.  I am not making a statement that I am not prepared to prove if it is challenged.  I would like to see that state of affairs ended.</P>
      <P>The whole of the constructive work that has been done in Ireland under the control of the Board of Works should be thrown open to every man in Ireland who is willing to tender for it.  Everyone should have as good a chance as everyone else to compete for this work. These tenders should be open to the whole people of the country, and I again repeat that everyone should have as good an opportunity as everyone else to get the contracts, provided he conforms to the conditions under which the contracts are placed.</P>

There was a sum of £8,600 for this item in last year's Estimates, and there is nothing whatever this year, notwithstanding that there is an increase in the entire Estimate of £500,000.  I should like to know from the Minister why he is cutting adrift <Col N="2182" /> those grants.

    <P>That is for 1923-24.  For 1922-23 it is nil.  One would almost have thought that this sum would have been included in the Defence estimates, but whether that is correct or not the sum for fuel, light, water and cleaning of military barracks and camps seems to be exorbitant.  It is £364,000.  I think that is a sum which should call for some explanation under that head.  Presumably it is in addition to sums that are charged for under the Ministry of Defence, such as the Provision of Supplies, Cooking, etc.  I think it would repay some inquiry into that estimated charge.  Now, in view of all that is said about the necessity for economy, I am surprised to see that a £5,000 estimate is put in to be spent on the Governor-General's residence, and the late Chief Secretary's Lodge, for &ldquo;Improvement to Lighting.&rdquo;  That is £5,000 for this year for improvement to the lighting of the Governor-General's Lodge and the late Chief Secretary's Lodge.  I wonder are we to assume that hitherto the previous occupants have been satisfied with candle light or oil lamps or have they been content to sit in darkness?</P>

      <P>If that latter was the condition that prevailed, then I am not going to object to the spending of £5,000 to light that darkness, but I am suspicious that that is not the true explanation. I cannot understand the necessity for this expenditure this year.  I think the Minister could very well find a better means of spending £5,000, or what perhaps would please him better, by saving £5,000.  After all, for this year at any rate, this residence will not be the scene of great State functions, and new lighting systems are hardly necessary.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> We are invited also to vote a sum of £12,000 for the Oireachtas buildings. That raises the question of the housing of the Dáil and Seanad.  I would like to know from the Minister where we stand in that matter?  We gather that plans are being prepared, and one imagines that they are being prepared to the point of completeness.  But perhaps the Minister will remember that there was a general promise given that some opportunity would be provided for the Seanad and Dáil to say what they thought about the housing of the Oireachtas in future before any decision was taken.  A good deal of time, I have no doubt, has been spent by this department in the preparing of these plans.  I think it would be well to let the Dáil know exactly where we stand before any further expense is involved on this department.  If it is finally decided that we shall remove the Oireachtas to Kilmainham, well, then, the work can proceed.  But I think, in view of the promise that was given, that the Oireachtas should have some say in the matter.  I would ask the Minister to take us all into his confidence in this matter.</P>

There is also an item here from Cork, &ldquo;Civic Guard, Cork&mdash;Restoration of Union Quay Barracks, £19,500.&rdquo;  I understand that there are military barracks in Cork that would have sufficed for the Civic Guard.

      <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Mr. Doyle with respect to the piers and harbours, and why there has been no provision made for these in the present financial year.  As far back as October of last year, in answer to an inquiry by myself, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he was alive to the seriousness of the situation as far as the piers and harbours on the South East Coast were concerned, and that he was making inquiries. I think the Dáil will agree that this question of providing proper facilities for harbours in Ireland is most important. <Col N="2184" /> With regard to the other matters spoken of by Deputies Hughes and Cole on this question of contracts by the Board of Works, I have also complaints to make.  It is pretty well known that there are certain firms scheduled and that these firms only get a chance to tender for contracts.  At the moment, in the County Wexford, a contractor has been brought in who does not belong to the county at all.  I do not know what the terms of his contract are.  I know that he has brought in men there who are not being paid the recognised rate of wages paid in the district.  They are working more hours than the number of hours that prevail in the district.  That is contrary to the Board of Works regulations. That, however, is a side issue at the moment.  I do say that every firm in the district should get a chance to tender for any work that is being done in that district.</P>

      <P>We all, I think, agree with Deputy Alton that something should be done for the preservation of ancient monuments, although some of us, also, would be delighted if some of the ancient monuments were removed as some of them have been removed recently.  However, that is not the question that I want to raise.  The question I want to raise comes up on page 29:&mdash;&ldquo;Purchase of sites, buildings and premises for Civic Guard.&rdquo;  There has been some complaint, in some quarters, over the delay on the part of the Board of Works in settling up in some of these cases.  No doubt buildings have had to be taken possession of to instal the Civil Guard.  People in these places have been dispossessed.  There is not so much complaint about that, but the complaint is when it comes to a question of paying up for them.  I have in mind a particular case where, although repeated promises have been made to the people <Col N="2185" /> concerned that their claims would be met by the Board, yet up to the present they have not been met.  This means that those concerned have to carry out certain obligations that they had contracted when they took possession of these premises, and since the Civic Guard took possession of them these people have had to go on paying.  They are carrying out their legal obligations, but the Board has not, so far, met the original possessors of those buildings, and there is a good deal of complaint because of that.  The Board said, I think, that they would meet these obligations and that no undue burden would be thrown upon the shoulders of the people they dispossessed.  I hope the Minister will look into matters like this, and will see that these complaints will be attended to immediately.</P>

      <P>As one of the Dublin Deputies has criticised some items in regard to Cork, presumably I am entitled to make some reference to items of expenditure in connection with Dublin.  There is an item here of £20,000 for Dublin Castle adaptation.  I presume the people of the country would like to be informed as to whether the Castle is going to be the permanent residence of the Law Courts.  If so, presumably the £20,000 asked for for the adaptation will be required to make it suitable for that purpose.  If it is not to be a permanent residence for the Courts, one may submit that that £20,000 is entirely too high an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an item of £10,000 for the removal of the dome and the front elevation of the Four Courts.  That seems at first sight to be rather a large estimate for that purpose, and I think the Minister for Finance might give the Dáil some indication as to why this estimate had to be put down, and why it should be of this amount, and also I would like to know what the intention of the Ministry is with regard to Dublin Castle, and probably with regard to the Four Courts Buildings Also on page 31 of the Estimates we have an amount for the Governor-General's residence&mdash;including the Private Secretary's Lodge&mdash;for maintenance supplies, etc., totalling £11,442, Without details it seems to anybody that the several items connected with the upkeep of the Governor-General's establishment are very large indeed.  There is one small item I notice on the same page, <Col N="2186" /> upon which I would like a little enlightenment. It is an item of £821 in connection with the Cork Custom House which we are told will be met by a corresponding asset.  I would like an explanation of what the corresponding asset is.  There is a further item for the Office, High Commissioner, in London, and from the amount of that item one would presume it is intended to erect a building there.  Having no knowledge myself I see by the public Press that the High Commissioner has got an office upon a first floor.  Presumably that office cannot cost an amount so large, and presumably the intention of this estimate must be to erect a public building in the City of London for the High Commissioner. From the point of view of advertising this country that expenditure may be justified, certainly, but if it is not intended to erect such a building for the purpose of advertising the country, and consequently advertising the production of the country, and as a result getting what may be called some value, then I think the expenditure would not be justified.</P>
    <P>The Patent Office is in the Estimates, but no sum is mentioned for it, and I do not know consequently whether one can discuss it, but as one a little interested I would like some information regarding the Patent Office, and regarding the present position of patents generally in this country if it is permissible to ask for that on the discussion of an estimate which does not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to these questions I might be permitted to follow up a matter that I raised earlier regarding an item for £5,000 for the improvement of the lighting of the Governor-General's residence and the late Chief Secretary's lodge, and to draw attention to the fact that there is also a sum of £11,442 required for the maintenance, furniture, fuel and light and cleaning of these two buildings.  I think it necessary to ask the question whether so large a sum as £11,000 is required for these purposes.  We are bound by arrangement made with England to provide suitable accommodation, I was going to say alternative accommodation, for the Governor-General, and also to pay him £10,000 per year. <Col N="2187" /> We provide a house in addition to the salary.  I question very much whether the judgment of the people of the Saorstát will confirm the judgment of the Minister for Finance that a reasonable establishment, a suitable establishment would require a sum of £11,000 per year for maintenance in addition to salary.  I would like to put the family budget of the average working man with a family and an establishment of the same size, against the year's budget asked for in this Vote.  I do not want to be ungenerous or to indulge in any sarcasm, but I honestly think this amount of £11,000 for the ordinary maintenance of this establishment is altogether unnecessarily high.  There are no State functions, no Balls, no Parties. We see no Court News, or anything of that kind, and I hope we never shall, and consequently we want to understand the real reason for a charge of this kind for a suitable establishment for the Governor-General who has none of these duties to perform.  We have items &ldquo;maintenance of supplies, £8,850; furniture, fittings, and utensils, £992; fuel, light, water and cleaning, £1,600.&rdquo; I think it will require a great deal of arguments to justify that, and I invite the Minister when dealing with the Vote of £5,000 for the improvement of the lighting also to justify the £11,000 for the upkeep of the establishment.  That is a sum of £16,442 for the upkeep and improvement of this establishment for this year, and I think it requires a good deal to justify it, and I hope we shall hear the Minister's attempt to do so.</P>

This is merely a matter of renting an office on a first floor in London, and I think it is very doubtful whether we shall get such an office as we want for the sum of £5,000.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct a misapprehension that Deputies seem to have, that I am an encyclopaedia. I would want to be one if I were to answer <Col N="2188" /> all the questions and reply to all the criticisms that have been made on this Vote.  One matter that was mentioned was the subject of contracts.  Contracts are not confined to particular firms.  All large contracts are advertised in the newspapers, and all tenders sent in are considered.  Where there are small contracts for £500 or so, they are not advertised, but competition is invited. This particular department has been under the supervision of my department for nearly twelve months.  I am speaking now from recollection, and I say that I do not remember, during that time, having received more than one letter from a Deputy dealing with contracts.  This is not the best time for criticising the work of a department, unless Party advantage, or damage to the prestige of the Ministry, is intended, and I have not had experience of anything of that since we started here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The object is to submit them for consideration and to have them passed.  What I say is that the administration ought to get some assisttance during the year if, during the course of the year, some mistake occurs.  That is the time to raise it, when the mistake occurs.  If there be criticism of a particular contract we ought to hear about it at once.  If there be occasions upon which Deputies have cause for complaint about contracts that have been given out, the time to raise it is when the thing occurs.  Steps could be taken then, at the moment if a mistake has been made, to correct it for the future, but there is very little use in coming along with a general statement about contracts and saying that the policy of the Board is wrong, that certain classes of people are excluded, that certain firms are not on the list, and so on.</P>

If the policy of the Board has been wrong during the eleven months it has been under the supervision of my department, no complaint, except one, reached me during that time.  I investigated that single complaint.  It was corrected, and no mistake occurred afterwards that I know of.  If there be anything wrong in the policy of advertising contracts it is open to criticism.  That has been the policy. Is that wrong?  If it be not wrong, why is it criticised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree.  I say if they had a case for complaint, this is the place to make it.  The time to make the complaint is when a mistake occurs.  If a mistake occurs I think it is wrong to allow a year to pass before making the complaint.  If money has been wasted, or an inefficient policy pursued, I think Deputies ought to make complaint at the time and get the matter corrected rather than wait for a year to do so.  In any case, during the whole year only one Deputy raised a question. As regards the question that was raised about piers and harbours, it is not the function of the Ministry of Finance to go around the country and look for piers and harbours that people want to be reconstructed. We do not want to be spilling out money, and as far as I know no demands have come in connection with piers or harbours.  At any rate I have not seen any or heard of any.  Last year the sum of £8,600 was put down.  That sum, or at least some of it, was included by the British Development Commission, which no longer exists, and was re-voted last year.  No other demand of that sort has come in, and I hope no demand is going to come in.</P>

      <P>The £10,000 for the Four Courts dome includes, not alone the taking down of the dome, which, I am informed, is both difficult and expensive, but also taking down a good part of the walls which are dangerous, and repairing the front portion of the building.  The asset at the Cork Custom House is in respect of rent paid by the Cork Harbour Board for part of the offices.  The other matter mentioned was, I think, in connection with the Governor General's residence.  The lighting is defective and it is proposed to expend a certain capital sum which would relieve Votes in the future of a good deal of the expense.  This is only a rough estimate, and no details have been provided in connection with it.  No money in respect of that head has been yet spent and care will be taken to see that it is economically spent, if it is expended. The total cost of upkeep during the last years of the occupation by Lords Lieutenants out of the Vice-regal Lodge was £12,500 a year, and that, I think, did not include fuel and light, and it is on that estimate that this particular one is framed.  The other items which are for the Army might, properly speaking, be put down to the Army Vote.  The Office of Works has charge of the work and is dealing with it, but in the same way as the items in various other Estimates might be included in the particular Ministries, the Office of Works, doing this particular work, being responsible for it and answerable for the expenditure under this head, that item is included in the Board of Works Vote though, properly speaking, it should be under the Army Vote.  I examined that Estimate at the time that it was prepared.  It is, I think, a penny per head per day of the Army less than the British Estimate, that is the Estimate that is made up by the British Army.</P>

      <P>I could not answer that, but it is per man.  It would not affect the issue.  If the British Army were ten times as large then the Vote would be ten times as large.  I forget what the precise amount was, but I think the item amounted to £350,000 for fuel and light in barracks, and so on.  It would amount to £7 or £10 per man per year.  In any case, I tried to explain that it is, properly speaking, chargeable to the Army Vote, but in view of its administration being by the Board of Works, it is put down there.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Civic Guard Barracks, the Civic Guard now use the old R.I.C.  Depot in the Phoenix Park, to gether with Marlborough Barracks, adjoining, as their headquarters.  Originally the offices of the R.I.C. were in Dublin Castle, but they were transferred to the Depôt, and it was estimated that £3,000 would be required.  That is only an estimate.  It is not expected that the whole, or nearly the whole, will be expended on the necessary alterations that are being made.  There is the restoration of Union Quay Barracks in Cork, which was owned by the British Government during their occupation here.  It was destroyed by fire in August of last year, and it is necessary to restore it at once for fifty men, and ultimately as the headquarters for the Civic Guard in Cork.  It is at first proposed to carry out only a partial restoration, for which a vote of £10,000 is required.  In Galway it is proposed to restore the barracks in Eglinton Street, or part of them.  Part of the work has been put in hands already. There is also the restoration of No. 1 Barracks for the Civic Guard in Sligo, a Government building held free of rent.  It is proposed to restore the barracks at Ennis.  It is a Government-owned barracks, which was destroyed in August, and under the terms of the lease the Government, as tenants, are bound to restore it, and the restoration, or part of it at least, is immediately necessary to accommodate the Civic Guard.  It is also necessary in several other cases either to rent new premises or to restore some of the old ones that have been demolished, and that is responsible for whatever other sum there is in the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy inquires whether the Courts are to be kept in the Castle or not.  I cannot answer that question.  The Castle premises have been reconstructed <Col N="2192" /> to suit the Courts.  Even though it be not intended to keep the Courts there, the works that have been undertaken, although they were at pretty considerable expense, were necessary for the Courts.  Nothing has been done except what was absolutely essential.  I do not know that it is at all likely that you will have any money available for rebuilding the Courts, even if you were so inclined, for very many years, and I take it that these premises are fairly suitable for the Courts&mdash;very suitable, as a matter of fact&mdash;and that in any case, whether or not it is intended in the future to rebuild, the Courts will be there for twenty years.  It is a large sum of money to have to expend in one year, but spread over the time I think it is fair value. That matter has not gone further than the continued preparation of plans and consideration.  It is not proposed to take any step without complying with all the undertakings that I have given.  When the matter is ready it will be brought to the notice of the Oireachtas and no step will be taken to commit the Oireachtas without their express approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I want to express my astonishment at the extraordinary doctrine that the Minister had laid down respecting the duty of Deputies to make complaints during the year regarding specific matters, or, having failed to do that, to hold their peace when dealing with estimates and departmental policy, as projected and prepared for in the estimates.  I think that it is a pity that the Minister should lead the Dáil in that way.  If there is any opportunity given to the Dáil to consider and to criticise the policy of a Department it is on the Estimates, and even though they may have no complaints to make on any specific item in the past they have a perfect right to come forward and demand an improvement or a change in policy in respect of any item for the forthcoming year.  Further, for the Minister to say that it is not the business of the Department responsible for Public Works to make representations regarding the condition of public works under their charge is most extraordinary to me.  To say that it is not the business of the Ministry, or Department under the Ministry, to look after the piers and <Col N="2193" /> harbours, but that it is the business of the members of the Dáil to make these representations, is a most extraordinary doctrine.  The Minister has given us an explanation in regard to the £5,000 for the Governor-General's residence, and the improvement of lighting therein. He says that the lighting is defective and therefore £5,000 has to be spent this year in improving it.  I think that is not a sufficient explanation in view of the condition of the National finances, nor is it a sufficient explanation of the £11,442 to say that that is based upon estimates of the occupants of the Vice-regal Lodge in the past.  I think the explanations are so unsatisfactory that I am going to ask the Dáil to agree to a motion to reduce this Estimate by £5,000 so that the £11,000 which will be left will have to suffice not only for maintenance, but for the improvement of the lighting.  I beg therefore to move that the Estimate be reduced by the sum of £5,000.</P>

      <P>I wish to second that. I certainly would not be a party to such a sum as that being expended on the Governor-General's residence.

I was told then there was no money available for that purpose, and here we have £5,000 about to be laid out for light for one individual.</P>

      <P>I am not going to vote for the motion proposed by Deputy Johnson, but I wish to make it clear to the Minister and to the Dáil that in raising the question of contracts it was not for the purpose of going back on any contracts that may have been given or work that may have been done, but in order that that state of affairs may be remedied in the coming year.  I do know that facilities were not given to contractors within 5 or 6 months past that might have been given to them.  I will give you an instance of where three large contracts were to be given, and one specification was left at the office representing the Board of Works in that particular <Col N="2194" /> area, and anyone wanting to tender on that specification had to go in and sit down for two or three days and make all the calculations on that.  I hold that the Board of Works, like every other corporation, when they have  tender to give out, should get their specification printed and supplied to intending contractors. To say that a contractor or his servants should go in and sit down and wait their turn to examine a specification is not enough.  It was for that reason, and to remedy that state of affairs in the future, that I criticise the system giving contracts by the Board of Works.</P>

      <P>With reference to the office of the High Commissioner in London, the Rents Restrictions Act does not apply in London when, according to the papers, on one floor or flat it is necessary to expend the sum of £5,000 in one year.  Surely rents are not so high even in the centre of London that one flat would cost £5,000.  I think the explanation is quite unsatisfactory.  The total amount given here is £13,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to intervene for a moment.  I felt rather hurt about the criticisms on contracts, because I have had many complaints, not alone from members of the Dáil, but from business people outside.  I was anxious to prove these, and anxious to find out where the leakage or corruption was, if any.  During the whole year I could only get one case in which there was a specific complaint.  That one was dealt with, and Deputies must be aware of the fact that there is a limit to human endurance and that continued complaints, such as saying &ldquo;There is no improvement; you are just the same as the people who went before you,&rdquo; and that sort of thing, especially when you ask for specific information and do not get it, are not fair.  If there be a case in which anything of that sort has occurred and we have not taken action, then we should be indicted here, but at least we are entitled to get the information which will enable us to see that a Department is properly and efficiently run in the public interest.</P>

      <P>On Friday we will have the Second Reading of the Bill, which asks for the Board of Works, compulsory powers to acquire accommodation for the Civic Guard.  That Bill will be retroactive in its effect, and will cover cases in which there has been something little short of commandeering in the past.  There have been cases in which the military took premises, and after a delay which some people might describe as a decent interval handed them over to the Civic Guard.  The explanation of that lies in the fact that the military were charged with restoration of order in the country, and in many places they considered that the most potent factor in the establishment of order would be the establishment of a Civic Guard post.  They thought themselves right and justified in commandeering certain premises, looking always, I submit, to where the least hardship lay. After occupying the premises for some time they left them in favour of the Civic Guard.  There have been cases of that kind, and the Bill to be discussed on Friday will be retroactive in its effect. It will be retroactive also in its provisions with regard to rent, and the machinery by which it is proposed to adjust the rent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of cases in hand for some time where the military authorities, on very short notice commandeered private property of individual <Col N="2197" /> citizens as long ago as twelve months and in one particular instance made no compensation to the people who were pushed out of their house at very short notice.  That particular house in the past week has been handed over to the Civic Guard without making any allowance to the people. who occupied it formerly, for the period of occupation by the military authorities.  In this case the military authorities gave four hours' notice to two elderly ladies to leave their house, which was well furnished. They took over the premises and assured the people who were being pushed out that they could take up accommodation in a hotel or elsewhere and that they would be amply compensated in a short time for the inconvenience cause to them by being dispossessed on such short notice.  About 10 days ago I met these two ladies, upon whose behalf I went to the Board of Works on at least three or four occasions.  I think it is very unfair that the Board of Works, who are responsible to an extent in this case with the military authorities, should deprive any citizens of rent due to them during occupation of the premises as well as compensation for the damage, done during military occupation, to the property that was taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of cases, and this is only one, where property was acquired by the military, and where very valuable furniture was used by the military authorities to put houses into a state of defence.  I think that was extravagance, to say the least of it.  In addition to that, all this time has passed and nothing has been done to compensate for the destruction of the property or loss of the rent to which they were rightly entitled, and which they would be entitled to if taken by anyone else under such circumstances.  I have also a case in mind where premises were acquired by the military authorities from the Black and Tans, where a similar thing has happened.  Compensation has been claimed for the destruction of the premises, which in this instance was a licensed premises.  The claim for compensation was declined, on the grounds that the damage done was fair wear and tear.  I saw the premises last Sunday week.  The floors are torn up, the windows blown out and the sills of the windows are torn down, and all kinds of destruction has taken place.  The report <Col N="2198" /> of an Inspector from the Board of Works was that the condition of the premises was due to fair wear and tear.  If the pulling down of premises&mdash;the tearing out of windows, the pulling up of floors&mdash;is considered fair wear and tear, I can readily understand why the Government is going to ignore many of the reasonable claims made on them in cases of this kind.  I suggested to the responsible Officer of the Board of Works that the man who made the report in this case must have been riding through this particular town in a train without seeing the premises where the destruction occurred. It is not a fair argument, nor is it reasonable, that fair claims should be ignored and turned down, and I suggest that there is something radically wrong when an Inspector or anyone acting for the Government could take the view that was taken in this particular instance.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the failure of the Board of Works or the Military Authorities to make reasonable provision within a reasonable time to meet the reasonable and legitimate claims of the people who have suffered as a result of the commandeering of private property.  I understand that there are many cases outstanding of this particular class, and that many people who have overdrafts from the bank await payment of compensation which is long over-due. I would like some explanation, at any rate, from the Minister as to the present position of claims of that kind, and when it is the intention of the Government to clear up all outstanding cases.</P>

I did not like troubling the Minister, but I was ultimately informed that such matters were dealt with by a Joint Committee composed of representatives of the Ministry of Defence and of the Board of Works.  I know that such a Committee is in existence, but I submit their failure to deal with legitimate claims, extending over a period of twelve months, is a thing that requires explanation from the Minister responsible.</P>

It is not a question of &ldquo;failure,&rdquo; it is a question of a huge number of claims from all parts of the country, some certified by people no longer living, others in dispute, others where extravagant claims have been made and so on.  If the case be that we are supposed to clear off all these, regardless of expense, then I say you are going to be disappointed.  We are not going to do that.  It will take time to settle these accounts.  They are being dealt with as rapidly as possible.

      <P>I would like to mention one case in which I interested myself. <Col N="2200" /> It is a case of Mr. Coughlan, of Buttevant, whose premises were taken over by the military.  I understand the married quarters of the old barracks were being put into repair for the Civic Guard, but the military got in before the Civic Guard got there.  I interviewed the Minister for Defence, and learned that the Board of Works were dealing with such cases.  I then saw the Secretary of the Board of Works and he promised to send an inspector to visit the premises and make a report.  I heard since from Mr. Coughlan that an inspector did arrive there and made an investigation, and he is supposed to have sent in a report to the Board of Works.  This happened two months ago.  Since then Mr. Coughlan has not heard anything from the Board of Works.  I submit that it is not unreasonable, two months after an inspector has visited the premises and made a report, for this man to expect that some settlement of his claim would be made.  I understood the Minister for Home Affairs to suggest, when he spoke before Deputy Davin, that these cases will not be dealt with until after the Civic Guards Acquisition of Premises Bill is passed.  I would like to know from the Minister for Home Affairs or from the Minister for Defence if I am right in that assumption.</P>

      <P>Might I say, by way of explanation, that I think the Minister has taken an unreasonable view of the case to which I referred.  That was a case in which the premises required for military purposes were licensed premises. I do not care at any time to go to the Minister responsible if I can get access to the offices which deal with such cases. I went to the Board of Works twice in connection with that case, and pointed out that although the military had left the premises they had never handed over legal possession to the owner.  The question arose as to whether a licence could be got for the premises after they had been evacuated by the military, and the Minister for Home Affairs no doubt knows that a licence could not be granted except possession was proven to have been handed over.  The Ministry of Defence or the Board of Works refused to hand over the key of the premises.  I take it that they will have to accept liability for rent, although the premises were evacuated some time ago.  It is for the responsible authorities&mdash;the Board of Works or the Ministry of Defence&mdash;to hand over legal possession.  Although I asked several questions in the Dáil regarding this case, and went to the Board of Works, I did not go to the Minister because I did not like to trouble him. There is something radically wrong with the machinery of a Department when a liability of that kind is carried on, and this would not be so if people in responsible positions did their work in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain there are some Deputies here who feel so little interest in this matter that they think the discussion of it should be adjourned until Tibbs Eve.  The matter I am raising is not one of a trifling nature. It is one that goes to the root of every thing that affects the future economic life of Ireland.  I do wish Deputies to realise that I am not raising this matter for the mere sake of raising it, or because the discussion would coincide with the return of the reporter-prodigals to the Dáil.  I am not initiating a discussion on the respective merits of Free Trade or Protection.  I am trying to arouse some thought as to whether or not the best thing has been done in the procedure outlined by the President in his statement. Further, I regretted to hear the President say that such a matter as this could only be discussed on a vote of no confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>I think that that is not an accurate statement of the case, and if I say that in my judgment, judging from certain public statements by the President, that he is lacking in what I would call economic vision, it does not follow that I have the slightest lack of confidence in himself or his Government as administrators, or as excercisers of the functions of Government.  I believe they have as such earned the confidence of the people and it is to try and prevent that confidence being impaired by what, to my mind, is rather a mistaken step, that I raise this question at all.  On last Friday when I intervened in this matter, Deputy Johnson rose and, to my amazement, he said: &ldquo;This is a private inquiry.&rdquo;  I want to know is the economic future of Ireland and the fiscal policy of Ireland to be settled in private by a bunch of Professors. A private enquiry!  The thing affects the whole fabric of the nation in the years to come, and Deputy Johnson says the enquiry into it is a mere private affair.</P>

      <P>Here is the report: &ldquo;May I suggest in the way this matter has been brought before us that it is merely a Committee set up by a Department to advise the Department and the Ministry of what is going on.  It is a private enquiry, and there may have been a dozen private enquiries of the <Col N="2203" /> same kind within the past twelve months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has never been another enquiry of this kind since the Free State came into being.  Now the idea of those things being done in private is not likely to inspire confidence in that element of the community, who, I regret to say, have been alluded to here from time to time as if they were so many mendicants trying to sponge upon the benevolence of the Irish Exchequer.  The business-men of this country, the men who have acted in the capacity of captains of industry, are men who count in Ireland's life, and I have some doubt as to whether or not these men who are conversant with the vital things, the things that matter in the industry and commerce of the Nation, will be prepared to have the things that are vital to them moulded by three or four University Professors. I do not want to say anything that may be considered a reflection upon any of these gentlemen; I want to say that most emphatically.  The Chairman of that Committee is a personal friend of mine; I appreciate his great abilities and I esteem his friendship.  It is the one crumb of consolation, I think, that manufacturers or industrialists can find in the statement of the President, that this gentleman has had some business experience before he became a Professor. There is no indication that any of the others had.  I do not know whether Professor Smiddy still retains his knowledge of business, because it is a considerable time since he became a Professor.  I hope he has.  Professor Bastable, we are told is a man who has written a work on taxation and has a reputation which extends beyond Ireland. Undoubtedly he has.  He has the reputation, I believe, of an eminent worshipper at the shrine of the Manchester School of Economics, and I have no doubt that he will be a stout defender of the theory of free imports.  Professor Henry, I believe, is an excellent selection, inasmuch as he will be the link between North and South economically, and will bring to bear upon the deliberations of this Committee an influence which is very desirable.  I pass over Mr. George O'Brien, the historian, and I come to&mdash;I was nearly going to say the man from God knows where&mdash;Professor Smith of Birmingham.  Is the future <Col N="2204" /> fiscal policy of Ireland to be made in Birmingham?  We are told Professor Smith is a native of Galway.  How long is it since he was in Galway?  How many years have elapsed?  What knowledge has he of the conditions in Ireland? How is he competent to decide what is the way in which Ireland's fiscal policy should be moulded?  I want to know when business men, merchants, and industrialists, read that Professor Smith of Birmingham is to be one of the gentlemen who will decide the fiscal policy of Ireland, will that inspire them with confidence?  Will they not be inclined to ask who is Professor Smith and whoever heard of him before?  I doubt if half-a-dozen Deputies in this Dáil ever heard his name before it was announced by the President.  He may be as popular a man eventually as the Village Blacksmith.</P>

      <P>His name may have extended outside Ireland, but it has hardly penetrated into the world of Irish economics, as far as I know.  I do not object to Professors as such.  I think there should be Professors of Economics on this Committee, but I do object that they should have a monopoly of it and that we should be over-dosed with Professors, or forcibly fed by Professors with their own peculiar kind of economics.  In view of what Ireland has gone through at the hands of Professors, we ought to be somewhat chary about this kind of thing.  I was nearly going to say &ldquo;Thanks be to God we have no Professors here in the Government,&rdquo; but I look around and see Professor MacNeill.  Most of us, I am sure, have had experience of the temperament of Professors.  They have an unhappy knack, an inevitable knack from their training, of imagining they are always at the blackboard with a piece of chalk in their hands, giving tuition to pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Committee of Professors, and I can imagine that if the business men do go up to present their case, these Professors, men sitting in array at the table, will look upon these business men as so many pupils coming up to be taught their business.  Now, I think if we reverse the process, and got the Professors to go up and give their evidence to the business men, the business men would be more likely to translate <Col N="2205" /> the evidence of the Professors into something more in accord with the realities and requirements of Irish life and interests than the Professors will be to translate the evidence of the business men to a like purpose.  Now, one Deputy who is not here to-night, was very vehement and indignant about this Commission. I thought he was going to explode with indignation on the last night. I refer to Deputy Gorey.  I certainly thought he would be here to-night to express some opinion on this matter.  I do not agree with Deputy Gorey that any particular section should nominate their particular representative.  I do think that it is essential if this Committee is not to be simply an expedient to shelve this question, if it is going to effect any real good for the country, there should be sitting on it men who are in actual contact with the realities of industrial and agricultural life.  We are told now that people who are likely to be beneficially interested parties are not suitable for this Committee.  Now, if you want to get a body of men who will not be beneficially interested parties, well you will have to go somewhere very far from Ireland to look for them.  Because every citizen of the Free State is a beneficially interested party in the result of this inquiry.  If you want to narrow it down to exclude individuals connected with certain industries who have a private and selfish interest in these things, then I think that is casting a stigma upon a certain element of the community which is quite unwarranted. I believe it will be quite possible to get men of standing and ability, men of quite a national outlook, national in the sense of viewing the economic future from a national point of view, men entirely without private interests, who are immediately in contact with these interests and affected by the existing fiscal system.</P>
    <P>I believe that if such men are not brought into contact with it, other than that of giving evidence, if such men are not allowed a place in the membership of such a body, I am afraid that the work of the Committee will fall far short of what it might have been.  Now, I cannot understand the contention of the President that such men should not be eligible, because they happen to be interested. We have an Agricultural Commission sitting at the present time.  Has that same principle been adopted in regard to <Col N="2206" /> that Commission?  Is it the rule that no one likely to be beneficially interested in the Agricultural Commission should sit in that?  I believe there are one or two farmers on that Committee.  I believe they are likely to be beneficially interested parties in the findings of that Commission. Surely if they can be relied upon to act with impartial but informed minds on the matter the same thing should apply to this Fiscal Committee with equally satisfactory results.  The President stated in Limerick last Sunday that we had &ldquo;to carry out Article 5 of the Constitution which had reference to financial adjustments, and in doing that they might have to ask for the assistance of the best financial brains in the country.&rdquo;  Now, there is quite a contradiction there.  I am sure those financial brains might be possibly interested, and if you are going on the same principle as you act on this, you are not going to be asking for the assistance from the best financial brains in the country, but from those who know nothing at all about finance.  The President also stressed the description of those people as being impartial.  Now, we have heard a word within the last few months very similar to the word &ldquo;impartial.&rdquo; It is the word &ldquo;neutral,&rdquo; people who do not take sides at all, they tell us, but the next moment they begin to denounce the Free State and laud the Irregulars.  Now, this impartiality that is going to dominate the Committee is the impartiality of the Free Trader.</P>
    <P>They do not take sides.  They are quite impartial.  But they have, after all, the idea that Free Trade is something that has come to stay.  I want to know is this the impartiality of the permanent officials who are now in the service of the Free State but who received their training under the fiscal system of Great Britain or England and whose personalities and mentality are absolutely saturated with the virus of the old fiscal system?  Is it those who want as little change as possible in the fiscal system of this country so that their mental training will be in no way affected, and they will not have to adapt themselves to any new circumstances that may arise in the Free State. The voice was the voice of the President, but the hand sometimes was the hand of the permanent official.</P>
    <P>I want to know if this is a Committee of Inquiry or is it a Tribunal?  If it is a tribunal, then I think a very great blunder <Col N="2207" /> has been made.  I believe that a tribunal will have to be set up, but it should be one that will come at the conclusion of an inquiry, an inquiry not by professional economists and not by men who live in a world of detachment from the realities of industrial and agricultural life.  Let us have a flavour of professional economists if you like on it.  But let us have the thing that really matters &mdash;let us have this inquiry conducted by men who know their business.</P>
    <P>Again, at the beginning of my remarks I said that I did not raise this as a trifling question, that I had the hope that members would regard this subject as a serious subject, and I can say this much at any rate, that if members or Ministers here treat it as a trifling matter they will find sooner or later a very different view prevailing when they come to meet the people of Ireland at the polls on a matter like this, and they may find that the constituencies of Ministers may not be inclined to say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to their economic policy.  I say we want a Commission of Inquiry into this, and I hope the Commission will be conducted by men in contact with the realities of Irish life, and that at the conclusion of that inquiry, after the full facts are ascertained, that there will be a tribunal set up of men competent to deal with this matter.  But until then I am afraid it is not only inopportune but a mistake to create such a tribunal.  We are further told that some of these gentlemen are experts and that they possess not only a knowledge of the conditions in Ireland, North and South, but also a knowledge of the Colonies of Great Britain and the United States, countries with which the trade relations of the Saorstát are of enormous importance.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that Ireland's relations to the outside world are confined to Ulster, Great Britain and the United States.  If that is the scope of these gentlemen's knowledge I venture to say that that knowledge could be supplemented enormously by traders who have a knowledge of trade relations with other countries and many more countries than these.</P>

I believe that a great error has been committed by confining the personnel of this Commission merely to University Professors with the one addition of a man who is practically in the same boat.  I think a great error has been committed, and one that is likely to impair the confidence of the commercial world in the usefulness of this inquiry. I said at the beginning that this is not a question of confidence, or lack of confidence in the Government; it is a question of confidence or lack of confidence in the Committee that the Government has set up to carry out what to my mind is one of the most important duties that have been undertaken since the Free State came into being.</P>

      <P>With what Deputy Milroy has said regarding Professors I cannot agree, being by way of being a Professor myself, but with his general criticisms on the absence of business people on the Commission set up to inquire into the fiscal system I entirely agree.  I have the greatest respect for Professors, naturally, and I do believe that some of the Professors on that Commission of Inquiry are eminently suitable for an inquiry into the fiscal system in this country and for reporting upon it.  But I submit for the President's attention and the attention of the Government that it is quite impossible for any body of men who have not had practical experience in the flow of imports and exports to report upon the fiscal system of this or any other <Col N="2209" /> country.  It is essential to have practical experience in order to understand how even the incidence of taxation works. This Commission of Inquiry, even if it is only a Departmental Commission of Inquiry, we are to suppose must take into consideration every aspect of the life of the people in the Saorstát&mdash;the connection between the different industries and the different forms of industry, the incidence of taxation, the necessity for having free trade in certain commodities, the necessity if the necessity exists of protection in other directions, and consequently they must understand agriculture, they must understand the Labour problem, and every industrial project in this country, and the relation of this country with other countries.</P>
      <P>Now, from a certain point of view, some of these Professors are experts within their own domain, but I do submit most earnestly you cannot get the proper report from that Commission, even if it is only a Departmental Report. This whole question is of great importance to the future fiscal policy of this country, and it will have to be considered here, and you cannot get a proper report for the guidance of this Dáil or a future Dáil without having upon that Commission of Inquiry men representing the various interests and who thoroughly understand the particular matters in which they are engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit it is necessary to have on that Commission agriculturists, industrialists, and men connected with the Labour movement. I think one of the Ministers may bear me out that a model of Commissions of Inquiry was the Economic Commission set up before the signing of the Treaty, in regard to its scope, and, as far as my recollection goes, in regard to its general personnel; I do not mean with regard to the individuals there, but with regard to the interests represented.  My own view of the matter is, that this Commission may report to the Government, and even the present Government may put before the Dáil the result of that Commission, but this whole question, the future fiscal policy of this country, will have to be thrashed out here, and not alone here but in the country itself.  Judging by what we got from previous Commissions and Committees, and if I may use the word, the bulldog way in which some Ministers stick to the findings of any Commission set up, I think it is absolutely essential, <Col N="2210" /> at the beginning of this economic inquiry into the fiscal policy of the country, that men who have had practical experience should be on that Commission.  The argument of the President was that they would be personally interested parties, the assumption being, of course, that they would only take a narrow view, in other words, that a man engaged in business would only look at his own business interests. Now, there are men even in Ireland, and even within the limits of the Saorstát, engaged in business, who do not take a narrow view of things, and who are quite as competent as Professors to take a broad view of things.  There are men who are not merely interested in their own little business, and who upon such a Commission would not be always thinking of their own little business. Furthermore, there are certain industrialists, and it is quite impossible for them to consider only their own business, because their own business is so bound up with other things.  The kind of thing I refer to is that persons engaged in certain manufactures have not alone to consider their own industry, but they have also to consider the general agricultural and industrial condition of the country.  Of necessity, they are forced to consider it.  If the President reconsiders it I think he will find that that argument does not hold water.  The only thing one can do at this stage, if the Government here are not absolutely committed to this matter, a matter of such essential importance, apart from the alternative of throwing the Government out of power and letting someone else assume the Government, is to urge upon them to reconsider the advisability of putting on this Commission men who have had practical experience in business, persons who are known throughout the country to have a wide outlook, and consequently persons who can give advice.  They may agree or disagree with the Professors, and there may be various reports, but at all events they will be competent to give advice as to what the future fiscal policy should be.  I agree entirely with Deputy Milroy that this is a most important question, because the report of that Commission, if it be accepted by the present Government or by a future Government, and goes in one direction rather than in another, will settle one of the very burning questions of this country, the question of emigration.  If the policy is in certain <Col N="2211" /> directions, the emigration will continue from this country, but if the policy is in another direction it may be the means of re-establishing industries in the country and of fostering new industries, and consequently checking the flow of emigration. I would appeal generally to the President and the Government to reconsider their position with regard to having this Commission composed only of the present gentlemen, who in their own sphere are, I admit, entirely competent, and to enlarge the Commission by putting on it industrialists, agriculturists, and some representatives of labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which has not been very lightly considered by the Ministries concerned. They are deeply interested in this fiscal question, which, however settled by Professors or business men, will certainly not result in what Deputy de Roiste thinks&mdash;the stoppage of emigration and employment for everybody.  We have to suffer the same troubles and inconveniences as are affecting other countries. There is unemployment in other countries, and every country is anxious to improve its business and to improve its trade, and to make its people prosperous. In one country above all there is more employment, I think, than in any other, and that is Germany, but I believe the conditions there are exceedingly bad.  In looking at this question from the beginning we considered that there were many factors in it, and many people affected.  The ordinary manufacturer or industrialist has before his mind the expansion of his business.  If it is found that his business cannot expand unless the community is charged a higher price for certain goods that would otherwise be cheaper, the benefit is for the few and the disadvantages for the many.  A question of this sort must be considered in relation to our present business and how it stands. Our exports are very considerable.  While one might be inclined immediately to impose a tariff on all goods coming in, it must be considered what effect it may possibly have on exports.  If the Commission be enlarged who is to represent the great body of the people?  Are they to have no representation?  Are they of secondary interest only?  Those gentlemen who have been so much criticised by reason of their academic distinctions <Col N="2212" /> and ornamentations can certainly examine as many witnesses as they please, or as many as wish to come before them. They can present a report.  It is not a cast-iron report, and you are not wedded to it.  You need not adopt it if you do not wish, but, at any rate, you will have before you the considered opinions of students of this particular work, and not of any particular section of it.  Even if these had a good report it is not the last word on our fiscal policy, which may have to change as the years change.  If it be no use, if it be defective in any particular, there is nothing to prevent you in the light of the information you have gained, as soon as the report is furnished, from setting up the business men's commission that has been suggested, but it must be remembered that there is bound to be dissatisfaction both from the view-point of the agriculturists and of the industrialists, that the new powers that we have of fiscal independence are not immediately used for their benefit, and in order to expand their business.  It is very easy to make mistakes with regard to that, and to injure even the trade that they have.  There was the old idea that we had of Professors with telescopes looking at humanity from a distance, and with some suspicion even at that, but we should get away from that and think of Professors as we think of our very able colleague in the Ministry&mdash;Professor MacNeill&mdash;who is a perfectly human individual, and, I believe, just as good a business man as any of the business men or industrialists we have been told about. If we associate him with Professors alone instead of his ability in answering questions, put by critics, I think it is possible for us to fall into a great mistake.</P>
      <P>We found that during Professor Smiddy's time in America he gave us much more satisfaction than a very able business man might give us there, and certainly much more satisfaction than certain people who think they are able business men, and if we were to examine this case closely we would find that there is a certain busybody at the bottom of the whole of it; a busybody who thinks he is capable of formulating a fiscal policy for this country, and if we say&mdash;&ldquo;Let them take it or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have no imputations <Col N="2213" /> to make on the Deputy with regard to that.  I do not associate the Deputy with it, good, bad or indifferent.  I believe he would be incapable of doing it.  But only within the last couple of days I have been told by a certain prominent and respectable business man that I objected to industrialists or manufacturers on this Committee because they had an axe to grind.  I said no such thing, but I do say that we have to go very carefully in this matter.  We have, at any rate, a fairly good export trade, and it is very important to the country that we should keep it.  I do not like any tampering with it, and certainly I do not like to have our whole fiscal business interfered with unless, we have something better to put in its place.  I would like to have the advice we get something we can rely upon. I have as much experience of business as the ordinary business man.  I was not a large importer or exporter, but I do think that a man's experience in business is very much limited by the class of business he does, and exporters and importers are not always growers or producers.  It is just as easy for the business man to make a mistake as for anybody else.  I made them in my time, and I am positively certain, from what I know of the ordinary business men, that they make just as many themselves.  Certainly if <Col N="2214" /> we were to take the ordinary business men of this country for some time past one would think that they have made nothing but mistakes.  I think the Deputy is satisfied.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a motor cycle, Engine No. 11213, frame 724096, the property of Mr. Bernard Grehan, Toarlisnmore, Kilbeggan, was commandeered by armed men on the 7th April, 1922, and was found by National soldiers in a garage in Moate on May 1st, 1922, conveyed by them to Custume Barracks, Athlone, and used by the National Army; whether several applications, both written and personal, for the return of the bicycle were made without effect, and as Mr. Grehan has a claim lodged for £200 for cycle and expenses, will the Minister have the cycle returned in perfect order or compensate the owner.</P>

      <P>It has not yet been found possible to trace the motor cycle in question.  A claim was lodged on the 12th ultimo by Mr. Grehan's solicitor. He was requested on the 17th idem. to supply certain information, but so far has not done so.  In the absence of the required particulars the claim cannot be considered.</P>
