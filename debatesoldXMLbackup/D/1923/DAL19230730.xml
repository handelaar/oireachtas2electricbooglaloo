      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question as a matter of order&mdash;to know exactly where we stand.  We have just passed a resolution authorising expenditure out of public moneys by the Oireachtas for the Defence of the <Col N="1582" /> Saorstát under an Act still to be passed. We have been discussing Estimates for the same purpose for some time.  This Appropriation Bill deals with expenditure of ten millions for the same purpose. I ask now what is exactly the position? Is this authorisation respecting expenditure under the Defence Act additional expenditure, or is it to cover the same ground as the Appropriation Bill, or any other resolution which we have already passed?  I would like to have some enlightenment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to cover the same ground as the Appropriation Bill. But if we were to proceed on the correct chronological order the Defence Bill ought to have preceded the Estimates and the Appropriation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it really means we have been voting money for organisation that had no legal sanction, and we are now legalising the situation by voting the moneys again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We really were voting money for purposes which had not got statutory authority, and the necessary steps precedent to, and contingent upon that act could not be taken in sufficient time to permit of the authority being given by Oireachtas, and consequently we are now regularising the whole proceedings.  It would be very much more in order if we were in a position to have this Act passed before the consideration of the Estimates.  It was not possible to do that, and we are now taking all the steps which ought to have been taken in that time in order to put the matter completely in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Home Affairs is not here at the moment, because I would like to draw his attention to a matter that concerns his Department, but, in his absence, I will draw the attention of the President to the matter.  During the discussion on the District Justices Bill, which was passed some considerable time ago, I tried to impress the Minister with the necessity for appointing to the office of District Court Registrars, and other positions under that Act, men who would <Col N="1583" /> be in sympathy with the Government, and would not be likely to make, through their personality, the Courts unpopular in parts of the country. Now, I have had occasion to draw the attention of the Minister on two or three occasions to appointments which are decidedly unpopular, and so unpopular were they that these appointments were cancelled.  I take it they were cancelled for very good reason, either national or administrative.  I have received a memorial from the residents of Ferbane, and included in that memorial are the names of all the District Councillors in the area, and of every one ever associated with the national movement, including the officers of the Irish Republican Army. The memorial was passed over to the Minister, but he still adheres to the appointment of an ex-R.I.C.  Sergeant as the most suitable and efficient man for this work.  I suggest that in the interests of good order and the peace of the area, and particularly in the interests of the functioning Court itself that that particular appointment should be cancelled. The Minister takes the view that there are other people in the area besides those who stand for national ideals, and in deference to the wishes of that particular class he thinks it desirable to retain this R.I.C.  Sergeant in the position which he has occupied for a very short period.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the matter now, in the hope that the Executive Council will take into consideration the views of the people in the area in a matter of this kind, and that in view of the hostility which is quite apparent, that the services of this particular gentleman will be dispensed with.  It is said that there is a certain amount of money to be saved by reason that this particular gentleman will not have to be pensioned.  I think the pension to which he would be entitled for a period of four or five years as Petty Sessions Clerk would be very small, and taking all these things into consideration, and especially the feeling of the people who are hostile to this appointment, I hope the President will be able to give us an assurance that the appointment will be cancelled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise on this Bill a question respecting a matter about which I have already asked the President a couple of questions, and about which I have not had as complete <Col N="1584" /> and as satisfactory replies as I could have wished.  On Wednesday last, it will be remembered, I referred to the question of the purchase of certain trawlers, and the admission was made that 12 trawlers had been purchased.  I asked to know what price had been given for them, and was informed that the price was £87,000.  I was particularly interested in that figure, because I had already received some information in respect of this matter.  The figure that I had been given for these trawlers consisted exactly of the same two numerals.  The price I received was £78,000.  It came to me as confirmation of the information that was given to me.  I referred back again to my informant, who told me the price that he was prepared to adhere to, and that he was still standing to, was £78,000.  I only refer to that now just to show that the matters I am now going into came before me in the shape of very reliable information.  In any case, whether the figure be £78,000 or £87,000, it means that these trawlers cost somewhere in the region of six or seven thousand apiece.  My informant tells me that these trawlers were last used in laying mines, and collecting mines in the late European war, and that when they had completed that work that they lay in Inverness.  I am now speaking strictly to the information which has been repeated to me, and confirmed to me since these questions were put.  I am told that these trawlers were offered in the public market for a price that was not higher than £250 each. In any case, I give that figure, because the matter does need inquiry.  Whatever the figure be, it is perfectly clear that any person can check these figures, and that to pay six or seven thousand pounds for a trawler is an excessive figure, but how far it is excessive I am not prepared to say, except that I give this information on the authority of the person who informed me what the original price was that was paid for the purchase of these boats.  The same person also informed me that proof was available that these trawlers could have been got for a price under £250.  I would like to ask who made the purchase on behalf of the Government.  I would like to know, and I think the Dáil should be informed, who acted on behalf of the Government in making these purchases.  I asked further if certain electrical equipment, the engineering slang for which is certain electrical gadgets, had been purchased <Col N="1585" /> for these boats, and I desire to know how much was paid for them.  I was told that only one had been equipped, and that no orders had been placed.  My informant tells me that actually one trawler was fitted out with electrical machinery at a cost of £4,000, and that orders were actually placed for going on with the rest of the trawlers at that excessive and exorbitant figure, but that on last Tuesday week a telegram was sent suspending all further work.  Now, these are matters that are very important, and one ought to know, and the Dáil ought to know, in the expenditure of moneys in this way, who acted on behalf of the Government in making these purchases; we ought to know what firms tendered, and how many tenders were submitted for furnishing these trawlers.  If one of these trawlers had to be furnished with machinery, I would like to know if I am correct in saying that the price actually paid for furnishing it was £4,000.  I would like to know how many tenders were sent in for that work, to whom the tenders were sent, and by whom these tenders were accepted.  I have given all the information that has been put before me, and I know that my informant is in a position to speak correctly as to these matters.  I put the matter now to the President, and ask him for this further information particularly as to who acted on behalf of the Government in making these purchases.</P>

      <P>With regard to the matters raised by Deputy Davin, I will undertake to bring them under the notice of the Minister for Home Affairs. I do not think it would be fair to ask me to give an undertaking in connection with matters connected with another Minister's Department without consulting that Minister.  It would certainly be unfair to another Minister that I should adopt that attitude, but I will undertake to bring the matter to the Minister's notice at the first opportunity With regard to the matters raised by Deputy Figgis, the Dáil will recollect that some day last week a question was put regarding these trawlers, and the question was to have been further raised on the adjournment, but was withdrawn because I think some other question arose on the adjournment that day.  Then we were informed that there was to be a question asked on Friday or to-day, and that question was not asked on Friday or to-day, but it is <Col N="1586" /> now raised, and raised in a manner which I certainly do not approve of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We have nothing to do with the Company that Deputy Figgis is concerned in, if he is concerned in it, or the membership of any other company.  This is not the place to thrash this out, and there certainly appears to me to be a remarkable similarity with the old Irish saying that you, Sir, will appreciate, &ldquo;Dubhaírt bean liom go ndubhairt bean léi.&rdquo;  If the Deputy wants information of any sort, or can give any assistance to the Government in the discharge of its business, he ought to give it with a view to assisting the whole administration, and not with a view to getting a petty advertisement out of it.  I hope that the Dáil will never descend to that sort of system for securing popular support outside.  We are not looking for advertisement in that matter. We are just as anxious to do the business of the country in a proper manner as the Deputy is.  I have not got all the files of my Department in the Ministry of Finance, or of any other Department, in my bag every time I come in here, and if Deputies require information I put it to them that the information asked for ought to be reasonable information, information that I am in a position to give at a moment's notice, or of which I would have had some previous notice It would, perhaps, require the intellect of a Deputy like Deputy Figgis to be able to carry around all the information that one gets in the course of a day's, a week's, a month's or nine months' business.  I myself have some association with this <Col N="1587" /> trawler business, an association to this extent, that, as I explained last week, the ultimate treatment of these trawlers is a matter for consideration and has not yet been finally decided between the Minister for Defence and myself.  At no time have I any recollection of having sanctioned, in my capacity as Minister for Finance, the purchase of £4,000 of electrical machinery, or electrical gadgets, or whatever other sort of melodeon the Deputy was speaking about.  It has not come before me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I had not this particular communication on the matter before the President spoke, because I wanted to emphasise or to support Deputy Davin in the points he made.  I think it is the same case as that to which he alluded, the appointment of a Court Clerk at Ferbane and Banagher. The information that came to me, or to my knowledge, was of a very definite nature, and I furnished it to the Ministry of Home Affairs.  I have received a reply, and judging from the nature of the reply, the appointment has been confirmed, and I am informed in this reply from the Ministry of Home Affairs that &ldquo;After a very careful enquiry into the matter, there is a very definite section of local opinion in favour of this gentleman's appointment.&rdquo;&ldquo;A very definite section of local opinion,&rdquo; is open to various interpretations.  A very small section might well be a very definite section.  One individual might be a very definite section.  &ldquo;I would also add that a memorial from a great number of people of good standing in Ferbane has been received by the Minister asking for retention of this gentleman in the office.&rdquo; and it adds further, &ldquo;In these circumstances and having regard to the economy effected by not pensioning, and his undoubted efficiency as a clerk, the Ministry is unable to agree that it should dispense with his services.&rdquo;  Although that is very definite, I also think that it is regrettable that the reply should be in such definite terms.  My knowledge of the matter is confined to information which came to me, but the information was such that I, for one, felt that I could not endorse this appointment.  I hope that this communication does not indicate that the matter cannot be reconsidered, as I have good reason to believe <Col N="1588" /> that the appointment is a most undesirable one, and certainly should be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the time to raise a question on a matter which is, perhaps, rather a detail, but I do not think that there will be any opportunity of raising it, inasmuch as I had been rather expecting an opportunity for the last week or two to raise it, but it did not arise.  It is in connection with the boundary between Donegal and Fermanagh, and the position of one of those little corners which is causing so much trouble.  The County Council of Donegal, or the local Council, I am not sure which, is responsible for a considerable expenditure on the repair of roads which are in constant use by motor conveyances belonging either to the British Army or the Specials.  I understand that between two points between Belleek and Pettigo it is necessary to traverse an area which is in Co. Donegal, and that there is very considerable traffic in this area in the neighbourhood of Castle Caldwell, in the Belleek District, and I think I am right in saying that that garrison is actually in the Free State area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite certain of that, but the point I am raising is that there is considerable damage to roads there by virtue of the constant coming and going of those motors, and always the possibility of trouble arising unless men are very discreet.  What I desire to ask is, whether there has been any arrangement made regarding the upkeep of that road, quite apart from the Boundaries question, which is very ticklish, I have no doubt.  But there is a certain liability, and if the Northern authorities must be facilitated in their traversing of the particular piece of road in question, they should at least agree to a payment for the use of that road, and the damage to it.  I am told that the fort which is occupied by the British military of the specials is on the Donegal side, and in the Donegal area.  I think the Dáil is entitled to know whether any special arrangement has been come to in regard <Col N="1589" /> to that district, and if so what arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know there is no such arrangement in connection with that area.  This is the first time I have heard any case put forward in connection with the use of motor lorries on Donegal roads.  There was some consideration given to facilities being afforded the troops, or Specials from the Six County of certain areas of the Twenty-six Counties, and corresponding facilities were also the subject of consideration, but, as far as I know, the matter is not yet completed, and I take it that the use of these places by people from the Six County area would be in the nature of a set-off for any facilities we would get for the use of troops traversing portion of the Six County area, but other than that I do not know that any arrangement has been come to on this matter.  I should say that it has not been brought to my notice that the Donegal County Council entered any objection, or put forward any case that they were entitled to any consideration for the use of roads there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathalOShannon" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON">
      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well if the President would look into the matter raised by Deputy Johnson, because there is a certain amount of feeling in the Tirconaill part of the district over the matter, not that there would be any great objection, so far as I understand, to reciprocal arrangements, but as the Boundary question is looming up, there is a certain amount of, not exactly tension, but feeling on both sides.  It would be well if this matter were looked into, because certain things are happening.  I do not want to raise in any contentious spirit the Boundary question at all, but one or two things happened recently which might be provocative. I refer to the arrest of a Saorstát patrol which, I think, accidentally strayed two or three yards from its own area into the Six County area. When these things happen anybody who knows, and it is known for years, the position of affairs in the Six Counties, knows how easy it is to raise feeling to a pitch which would precipitate a conflict. The unfortunate thing up there is that when one little thing happens something else happens on the other side, and then something happens more serious again on the first side, and something more <Col N="1590" /> serious still then happens on the second side, with the result that a conflict of serious dimensions is brought about.  I think it would be well if the President would look into this particular matter, because there is grave danger that something which nobody, at all events I think in the Saorstát, would desire might result from this particular thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he has made any progress in regard to the suggestions that were pressed some months ago about making arrangements with other banks in the Saorstát besides the Bank of Ireland. Explanations were given on the last Appropriation Bill as to the necessity for introducing the words &ldquo;the Bank of Ireland&rdquo; in this section.  I understand there was, as a matter of fact, an indication given that the Minister for Finance was prepared to consider the question of approaching other banks, and not to allow the Bank of Ireland to have a permanent preference, and that it should become in fact a State Bank without State control of that bank, that in effect the Bank of Ireland might become the owner of the State, rather than the State the owner of the Bank of Ireland.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether any progress has been made in respect of suggestions that other banks should be brought into relations somewhat analogous with those of the Bank of Ireland to the State.  I do not want to go into details in this matter, but there was a more or less implied suggestion that consideration would be given to the preferential position of the Bank of Ireland, and I would like to know if any progress has been made in that direction, and what is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been raised by, I think, the Standing Committee of the Irish Banks, but we have not been able to find a solution of it so far.  The particular terminology used here has not evidenced any special concession to the Bank of Ireland, because the first line, &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may borrow from any person,&rdquo; entitles any other person or corporation than the Bank of Ireland to lend to the Government, but there is a necessity for <Col N="1591" /> the specific mention of the Bank of Ireland, owing to some clause in their Charter which prohibits them from lending to the Government unless permission is granted by the Parliament.</P>
      <P>I should say that in connection with any accommodation that we have got with the banks they facilitated us as a body, each bank taking portion of the accommodation that has been given.  It is possible that within a few months we will be able to say whether it will be practicable to make the arrangement that has been mentioned by Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance, on No. 13 of Schedule B, Part 2, a question.  A few days ago, I think, it was put to the Minister for Local Government whether the Ministry had made any arrangements regarding the giving of effect to the recommendations of the Reconstruction Commission in respect of the re-making and re-conditioning of roads.  The Minister for Local Government replied that they had considered it.  I think he went so far as to say the matter was under discussion by the Executive Council, but that the matter of finance was the obstacle.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance whether any decision has been come to to put into effect the whole or any part of the recommendations of that Commission on Reconstruction in respect of the re-conditioning and re-making of roads.  When the Commission was set up very positive assurances were given that the object of it was to find out the best means of setting about public work of a valuable kind, and special instructions were given to the Commission to consider such works as would be most likely to give general employment to a large number of men at an early date.  Some members of the Commission agreed to go upon that Commission on the distinct understanding that effect would be given to recommendations, or at least that the Commission would not be <Col N="1592" /> looked upon as a stop-gap, and its serious purpose was to bring forward recommendations with a view to the immediate setting about public works of a valuable kind in themselves, and, incidentally, which would absorb a large number of unemployed men.  The report on the re-conditioning of roads was submitted, I think, about a month ago, and I was hopeful that by this time County Councils&mdash;the Roads Authorities&mdash;would have had sufficient assurances from the Minister as to warrant them in going ahead with the work, and to put into operation schemes that are already in being.  I think the Commission is entitled to know&mdash;and I am sure that the public is entitled to know&mdash; whether the Ministry intends to give effect without any delay to the recommendations of that Commission or not. It is possible to set to work some thousands of men within a week or two on this very necessary undertaking.  It is possible to set to work a good many thousands if the scheme were taken in hands and given effect to by the local authorities as well as the national authorities.  Everybody recognises that it is essential work, whether there was an unemployment problem or not. It is essential work in many parts of the country to enable the Ministry of Finance to get on with its work, because in many parts the condition of the roads is such as to prevent or curtail the business facilities of those who are likely to be called upon to finance the State.  But we have the fact that there are very large numbers of men waiting for employment, anxious for employment, suffering because of unemployment, and this is a public work that can be put into operation quickly.  I pressed the Ministry to tell us whether they had come to any decisions on that report; whether they have decided to instruct the local authorities in conjunction with the Roads Department of the Local Government Department to go ahead, or what other decision they may have come to.  It will not be satisfactory to be told that it is still in abeyance, and that it will have to wait for some time before any decision is come to.  It is a matter of urgency; and when we are reminded of promises made and undertakings given I submit that this is one of the promises and of the undertakings that ought to be ratified and given effect to.</P>

      <P>This matter has been the subject of preliminary consideration only, and I am not in a position to say that it is at all likely that the report sent up by the Committee on Reconstruction is likely to be carried into effect.  I am saying that purely as Minister for Finance, bearing in mind what available money there is for expenditure on this or any other purpose. When the promise was given to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that Reconstruction money might be available, and would if we were in a position to get it, the circumstances were not the same as we know them now.  We were not in a position to state at that time that the balance between receipts and expenditure on perfectly normal services was very slender, if there was a balance at all; and the duty devolves on the Minister for Finance, either now or in the future, to see that there is a balance, and that at any rate the balance will not be on the wrong side before he can undertake to appropriate any money for services other than those already undertaken.  I should say that, from my own examination of this report, it was an unreasonable assumption for the Committee to make that it would be possible for the State to provide £2 for every £1 that was subscribed by the local authority.  I am speaking from recollection. I think that was the suggestion that was made at the time.  Those who have had long experience of local government will be able to say that there were three primary duties cast on local authorities: Provision of water, maintenance of roads, and, I think, the provision of light or the disposal of sewage. Essentially I think road maintenance is a matter for local authorities.  If local authorities live beyond their means and devote moneys extravagantly for other purposes, it is unreasonable to expect that the Government must subsidise them to the enormous extent anticipated by them and by this Commission. We are subsidising Urban Councils practically to that extent in Connection with building.  But I have no hesitation in saying that it will not be possible in the future, after the undertakings we have given for whatever sum is in the estimates for the services of this year, either now or in the future, to devote any such proportion <Col N="1594" /> as that for the solution of any question of which the local authorities must bear their part.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a few times that the temporary financial adjustments with the British Government have taken considerable time.  One has just been completed in connection with the Local Taxation Account, and I have instructed the Ministry of Finance to take up the question of whatever sums are due out of the Road Board Fund.  When we have discovered what that amount is, and made some inquiries as to the collection of the sixpenny rate for this year, I think we will be in a position to indicate how far the programme outlined by the Reconstruction Commission can be undertaken. But I do think that this particular service is one which has benefited very largely by the Motor Tax, and that with the sum raised by the local authorities in the ordinary way for roadmaking, and the sum we have under the Damage to Property Act instructed local authorities to strike&mdash;that that sum ought to be sufficient to deal with this particular service.  I know that everything that Deputy Johnson said is quite true.  The roads are in a deplorable condition, and a great deal of reconstruction and maintenance work ought to be done during the year, but I am not in a position to hold out any hope whatsoever, having regard to the present state of our finances, that any assistance can be given in respect of this particular service.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement is not only unsatisfactory in what it really says, but in what is implied.  If State funds cannot be made available for such a necessary work as the re-making of roads which have been damaged to a very great extent by military traffic, then no moneys can be raised for any purpose with a view to absorbing or employing unemployed men during the next year.  If public moneys cannot be found for this purpose, then I ask any member of the Dáil to suggest any better purpose on which public moneys could be spent.  The Minister's position is that no public moneys shall be spent for any public purpose of this kind or, impliedly, for any other purpose, because there could be no better purpose than the necessary re-making of public roads. What does the Minister say?  That the upkeep of roads must be the responsibility of the local authorities.  That <Col N="1595" /> might have been good doctrine before the coming of the motor car.  But it is utterly wrong doctrine to-day.  The trunk roads of the country are national roads whether called so or not.  For the Minister to lay down that they must be maintained out of the local funds, and that the State cannot come to their assistance except by the supplementary grant out of the Motor Tax is, I think, a very disappointing statement.</P>
      <P>It is very sad to hear the Minister speak as he has done, forgetting that a great part of the damage to the roads has resulted from the traffic of military wagons, which was not local traffic, but national traffic, if any traffic can be called national traffic.  That is a responsibility which ought not to be thrown upon local authorities.  It certainly should be met out of State funds.  To be told now that no such funds, except such as may come out of the Road Tax, are to be available for the re-conditioning and re-making of public roads is most unsatisfactory.  I can only take it as meaning that in the mind of the Ministry no public funds are to be raised for public works, because I cannot imagine any more necessary public work than this. I believe it is the idea of the Ministry itself that the work of re-making public roads is essential work.  If State moneys cannot be devoted towards the re-conditioning and re-making of public roads&mdash; admittedly a necessary public work&mdash; then I ask what other work can public money be devoted to.  It practically means that no public moneys are going to be available for setting people to work and getting this problem touched upon. I am very disappointed and astonished that the Ministry should come to that conclusion.  It means that the work of the Commission&mdash;the work it has finished and the work it is pursuing&mdash;is all useless. It need not have been begun, and it is no use trying to finish it, because the Government says no funds will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the statement of the Minister for Finance with quite as much regret as Deputy Johnson.  I think that the utterance of the President was not the utterance of a Minister considering broad schemes of national requirement, but the utterance of an impecunious Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> It is quite true, I think, what Deputy Johnson said that the statements of the Minister of Finance rendered useless in future any further meeting of the Reconstruction Commission.  Why was this Reconstruction Commission set up? It was set up with certain terms of reference, and was designed to cover considerations of broad general works of national utility.  I was invited to become a member of that Commission, and I did so with very great reluctance.  My reluctance was largely due to the fact that these terms of reference were stupendous.  They embraced nearly every phase which was possible to conceive of national regeneration.  The terms of reference were comprehensive enough to embrace all, and were intangible and vague enough to exclude anything which was undesirable to deal with, but why was such a Commission set up, if it was not to find means by which the State could operate, through its finance, for the well-being of the community?  If these were the considerations which were to govern the deliberations of such a Commission, the announcement of the Minister for Finance to-day, renders it useless to pursue the hope that such assistance will be forthcoming.  Certainly there is great argument and logic in Deputy Johnson's contention that the trunk roads of the country are not matters of local consideration, but are matters for State consideration.  There is no section of the main roads or trunk roads of the country the use of which is confined to the particular area through which these sections of the road pass, and as Deputy Johnson pointed out, the main damage done to these roads is by the heavy military motor traffic that has passed over them in the past few years. These roads were never designed or never prepared for such a traffic, and the County Councils cannot be expected to face the task of keeping these roads in a proper state upon their own resources. Furthermore, the question of the re-conditioning and the re-construction of the roads is, undoubtedly, a matter of consideration, because the roads are the most vital arteries of national transport, and the condition of these roads will be a matter that will enter very seriously into the improvement of the commerce and trade and industry of the country in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I must say I am really disappointed with the utterance of the President, who, of course, has to count every penny in the national purse, and if he discovers that money is not available, I presume he is not to blame, but the fact had better be stated, and we will know where we stand. It certainly does bring us right up against the fact that to appoint a Commission to enter into the consideration of schemes, the carrying out of which are absolutely contingent upon State aid, and when they have proceeded to a certain extent with their deliberations and their report, to inform them that such State aid is not available or likely to be available, makes it futile and farcical to proceed with such Commission unless the State is in a position to make good its implied undertaking that it gave in setting up the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the disappointment expressed by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Milroy at the announcement made by the President. It will be cold comfort to the labourers of the country who are walking about hungry, to learn what the Minister has to say about this reconstruction on the roads.  Take my own County of Kildare. There are hundreds of men starving, and when they go to the Labour Exchanges to get their 6s. or 7s. a week they are kept waiting for a long time for their miserable few shillings.  We are told the matter is receiving attention. Time after time we are assured that the claims for unemployment benefits are receiving attention, but how they are to procure food while they are waiting to receive it is a matter of no moment for this Legislature.  The Minister now says that the local authorities must maintain and re-condition the roads, and in these he includes the trunk roads. How are local Urban Councils with small rateable areas and large distances of trunk roads running through them, to bear the expense?  Naas has a trunk road from Dublin to Kildare for a length of ten miles running through it.  How are the people of that district to maintain that out of their income?  They have to do so, and consequently the rates are 17s. 6d. in the £.  That trunk road passes through their district, but it does not bring any money into their district, and they have simply to maintain <Col N="1598" /> the road for this through trunk traffic through their district.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister, and that is that the few industries that we have in the country are being shut out and cut off.  We have a mineral water factory in Newbridge, with a bottling store attached to it, but these people cannot get their goods into the Curragh simply because one contractor has a monopoly of supplying everything to the military.  The local people are simply shut out, and yet they are supposed to be loyal to the State.  In Ballymore there is a little woollen industry, and that is closed down and unable to give any employment. Still the cloth for the uniform of our soldiers comes from Bradford and Leeds.  That is not right.  I asked a question about a man who was in collision with a military lorry: this man was working for the County Council, and his car was smashed and his horse injured.  When he spoke to the military, and asked them to get out of his way, he was told to go and be damned. That was the way he was treated by these men.  That unfortunate man is idle for the last ten weeks because of this accident, but we are told the matter is receiving attention.  Perhaps it will receive attention in twelve months' time.  There is another matter I would like to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence, I presume I can do so under this Bill.</P>

I would ask the Government to give the people a chance to get work, because if the scheme is delayed too long there will be no people to work when you have work for them; they will all have been starved to death.  It has been said that there is no money to start reconstruction works, but there is plenty of money, apparently, to support the Army.  I would ask the President to give the people a chance to live in their own country, and one of the ways to do that is to have a road works' scheme put into operation.</P>

      <P>I think that in the long run the Minister for Finance will find that the attitude he has expressed here to-day is, from the State point of view, a mistaken attitude.  I thoroughly agree with the Deputies who have spoken on this matter, and particularly in connection with the roads.  It is not possible for the local authorities to handle this particular problem satisfactorily. It is not a problem that affects merely the Saorstat, but it affects other countries as well.  It is an urgent problem in Great Britain and the Six Counties and elsewhere, and the whole movement in these countries is towards a realisation by the State of a greater responsibility, particularly for the main and the trunk roads.  I will just content myself with giving a case in point which came within my own knowledge, and probably within the knowledge of the Minister for Finance.  I refer to the county surveyor's estimate for certain roads in the Dunshaughlin area.  Deputy Colohan has spoken about the main roads carrying Dublin traffic southwards. The roads I am referring to carry general traffic from Dublin northwards. They form one of the great arteries towards the North.  Now, the county surveyor and the local council in this area have found that they could not deal decently, not to speak of dealing properly, with the roads in the area unless they struck a rate that amounted to about £17,000.  That sum, I understand, has actually been collected, though there are some parts of the country in which the rates were struck but not collected, but in this particular area that amount has actually been collected. The Government Department concerned has insisted&mdash;I do not know whether it was on the suggestion of certain deputies who asked certain questions in the Dáil in respect of this matter&mdash;on the reduction or the holding over of that estimate by reducing it by £6,000 or £7,000, leaving the sum available at between £10,000 and £11,000.  The roads that I am referring to have suffered very severely from heavy military and other traffic, and cannot be put into any sort of decent upkeep on a sum of £10,000.  The thing is impossible.  The county surveyor, as I know, is not a man who is wasteful or extravagant.  He is a man who knows his job, and the greater part of that sum of £10,000 has already been <Col N="1600" /> spent in the last four or five years.  What remains, if the Government Department's decision is to be carried out, is only a sum of between £2,000 and £3,000 &mdash;and that is supposed to enable the Council to carry on, as far as road-making is concerned, for the next seven or eight months.  It would be impossible for the Council to carry on with that small sum.  The fact of the matter is, that the points raised in this interim report will have to be dealt with, and dealt with immediately, because in going over the country, and even outside the Saorstat, one finds that the heavy traffic of the last few years has done great damage to the roads.  The likelihood is that within a comparatively short time the roads will be beyond supporting any kind of traffic on account of the damage that had been done to them, and it is not possible for the local councils to deal with that problem as it ought to be dealt with.  The roads are a national concern, and they ought to get national assistance.  There were several other matters concerned in this interim report.  There is, for instance, the matter of the upkeep of the roads and the traffic on the roads, and there is the matter of unemployment.  One, in my opinion, is equally as important as the other; but it certainly will not give anything like satisfaction throughout the country, and, even if it did give satisfaction to the superficial observer, it will not be satisfactory from the State point of view, or from the point of view of the whole country, because it is tantamount to a neglect of this work by the central authorities or by the State.  My complaint is that the State is going to allow the roads to get into such a state that they will be unfitted for the traffic they ought normally to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of criticism from Deputies on this question, and I must say that it has been rather helpful.  I certainly cannot complain of the tone of it.  I would ask Deputies to consult first of all the items that are down in this Appropriation Bill, and to take the sum total of them, and to add to that sum the total amount that had to be borrowed last year, and which I indicated to the Dáil more than once has got to be met by the 31st March, the last day of the financial year that we are now in, and to <Col N="1601" /> deduct from these two sums the estimated revenue for the current year.  If they do that they will find that there is a deficit of twenty-five millions.  The question now to consider is, first of all, the raising of that sum of twenty-five millions, and, secondly, whether we are proceeding on a strictly economic basis to raise that sum of twenty-five millions. During the last few months, in the discussions on the Finance Bill No. 1, Deputies will recollect that several attempts were made to reduce the revenue by restricting the taxes upon certain goods, including, I think, tea and sugar, and also to reduce the Income Tax, so that we would have been left even with a larger deficit had these recommendations been adopted at that time.  Now, when I say, as Minister for Finance, that this thing is impossible, and that that thing is impossible, I am not speaking of what my own wishes or sympathies would be in the matter, but simply telling you what are the exact facts of the case that you have got to deal with.  If the Commission which considered the question of reconstruction entered into a consideration of that question with any idea that Government money was to be available to such an extent for subsidising what is, in essence, a charge on the local authorities, then I say that they made a very serious mistake.  I have the highest respect for practically every member of that Committee, those of them whom I recollect I admire for their business capacity, ability and zeal, but I say that they did not enter into the consideration of that question with the mind that the circumstances of the times should have insisted on.  The State cannot afford, under any conceivable circumstances that I know of, unless the Government is to be reconstructed on an entirely different basis, to give such a subsidy as £2 for £1 to a local authority for what is mainly a local service.  This particular question of road reconstruction is not provided for in this estimate. A sum of £100,000 is put down, but out of that amount it is proposed to advance to persons who have secured decrees in the period between January, 1919, and July, 1921, such sums as will enable them to proceed with the reconstruction of their dwellings.  There is, however, provision this year for local authorities raising in their various districts, <Col N="1602" /> sixpence in the pound, which the Commission estimated, I think, should produce £260,000, but which I am of opinion will not exceed £250,000.  There is also an estimated income to be received for motor taxes of practically an equivalent amount, and divided by twenty-six it will be found that a sum approaching £20,000 per county, on the average, will be available. That, together with the ordinary normal sums estimated for by the local authorities, should make an appreciable advance upon the present condition of the roads, granted the goodwill and the cooperation of all persons concerned.  In certain cases there was some objection, very considerable objection, to raising this sixpence in the pound, and I presume to some extent the idea may have prevailed in the mind of the persons concerned, apart from any Irregular sympathies that they may possibly have given expression to in such an objection, that this was war wear and tear and consequently that the Central Authority should provide for it.  I think we have dealt sufficiently with that in the Damage to Property Act, and that there is no necessity to go into the matter again except to say this, that it is the only expense that the local authorities are asked to contribute towards all the losses that have been sustained during the last four or five years.  I have explained over and over again that whatever anybody lost the local authorities lost nothing in this war; that their withheld grants have been paid to them, and a very considerable and marked reduction has taken place in the rates.  Certain local authorities, not entering into the spirit of this Damage to Property Act, struck a smaller sum for the repair of the roads than would normally have been inserted in their estimates if it were not for this sixpence in the pound.  This sixpence in the pound malicious injury rate and the revenue anticipated from the motor taxes, together with the sum that I have mentioned, which is certainly in the neighbourhood of another quarter of a million, provides something like three-quarters of a million pounds for improving the roads. That is a very considerable estimate, and unless the Dáil is willing and anxious to strike further levies in the nature of taxation, additional impositions, there is no chance whatever of the consideration of any extension of the Estimates that are before you.  I am sure that it is unnecessary <Col N="1603" /> to stress the importance of balancing the Estimates, balancing your receipts and expenditure.  That is not done this year.  It must be done before the end of this financial year, and it will mean that there must be a very considerable economy in the services that have been proposed, or, failing that, a very considerable increase in the taxes that have been levied.</P>

      <P>The Minister has reminded the Dáil of the state of the Estimates&mdash;the income estimated and the expenditure estimated.  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister and of the Dáil to these two facts, that the Commission was set up and began its sittings about February.  The Estimates, showing all that he has now told us, were prepared by his Department in March at latest, and were published towards the end of March.  If there was no chance then in view of those Estimates, of any public funds being available for public works, why was not the Commission told so, and it would not have wasted its time?  The Commission was set up to make recommendations, having particularly in mind the urgency of the problem of unemployment, and to submit interim reports as might be found necessary. There is no other way of financing public works except out of State funds; there is no other way of making these roads fit for use except out of State funds; there is no other way of meeting the housing problem except by a considerable drain on national taxation.  If that is the position&mdash;if the Minister cannot find any other method of dealing with these problems&mdash;then scrap all your Commissions. Do not pretend that you are setting up Commissions to suggest or to advise on points of public work, and then say, &ldquo;We have no money, and we are not going to get any money.&rdquo;  I say that it is a waste of time and a scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three matters on which I would like to have the opinion of the Executive before we pass from finance.  First of all, the Dáil is aware that in the Army Estimates there are large sums dealing with purchases of munitions and various articles of war, and many of these come from England.  We have always spoken of these matters and heard them spoken of as purchases.  I want to know whether it is the view of the Minister for Finance or of the Minister for Defence that Ireland is to pay for the guns and for the military things obtained from England.  I devoutly hope that no such heresy will be preached from the Ministerial Benches, but one never knows. I put it to the Dáil that the effect of the Treaty is a dissolution of partnership, an unwilling partnership if you like, but still a partnership; and upon that dissolution we are entitled to a valuation of the assets; that consequently any material which it may have been necessary to obtain from England ought to be treated as so much on account of the prospective assets which will, no doubt, be recognised as ours when the accounts and balance sheet are finally drawn up.  But it would be useful that we should know that the view of the Ministry is that this dissolution of partnership is one in which we are entitled to the benefit of our share, obtained by many millions of Irish money, of such items as those to which I refer.  There is another question that I should like to know the Ministerial view upon, the question of Trusts.  Has the Ministry a policy as to the admission of foreign Trusts into this country?  I raise the matter very briefly, and I desire to take no particular view on the question; but for the purpose of enabling those who <Col N="1605" /> have expert advice behind them, to tell us what their policy is.  I have no objection whatever to foreign competition; but Trusts are in a rather different category. Every considerable country, and many small countries, have found it necessary in recent years to pass special legislation, either to keep out the foreign Trusts or to restrict the operations of Trusts of their own as well as foreign Trusts.  I am not sure whether it is the Ministerial view that the curiously-drafted instructions comprising the Terms of Reference to the Committee recently set up on fiscal matters, would authorise recommendations from that body on that particular question.  I sincerely hope they will give us their recommendations on this question.  Let me point out to the Minister one difficulty likely to rise in the case which we all have in mind.  Quite apart from the question of under-cutting and other obvious dangers, what is going to happen if a big foreign tobacco trust, having established itself in this country, establishes a number of retail shops of the Salmon and Gluckstein line all over the Irish cities?  There will be nothing to prevent them; and these shops will be exceedingly attractive.  Where will the retailer be then?  I do not want to go into detail on the matter, but I do want to know if this problem has been considered and if there is a Ministerial policy upon it.  The danger, it seems to me, is that when one allows large sums of money to be spent by foreign Trusts of that kind coming into this country; that the next Government, when it has to tackle the matter, will be in a difficult position, because these people will have come into the country, and will have spent their money.  I quite admit there is plenty of attraction on the other side, the employment they will give and the better tobacco. perhaps, they will bring in; but is there a policy to have any restriction on them, or are they to be let in without restrictions, and if not what will these restrictions be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the next Government will profit by the experience they have had in the Dáil, and, before asking the Dáil to pass Estimates it will place all the Estimates before a Special Committee on Estimates.  I hope that if the next Government does not want to do so, that the next Dáil will insist on their doing <Col N="1606" /> so.  I am very anxious to see an Irish Parliament setting up such Commissions as they have in foreign Parliaments for dealing with such matters. In France there are five such Commissions, of which Finance is one.  I think it will be generally agreed that it will be impossible for the Dáil, and it has been proved impossible, to do itself justice in the matter of examining the Estimates put before it by the Executive in the absence of some such particulars (rather than vague general headings), as would be put before a Special Committee. I do think that a great deal of time would have been saved, and more efficiency secured in dealing with these matters, as well as, perhaps, some reduction, had not the Ministry objected for some reason, which I have never been able to fathom, to allow special Committees to deal with the Estimates.  I hope that next year that course will be followed.</P>

      <P>To return to the matters which we were discussing before Deputy Gavan Duffy spoke, I think I might say that the issue is pretty well knit, and the issue is whether the main arteries of the country, apart from the railways, are purely a local concern, a local interest and a local charge, or whether they are partly a national interest and charge and partly a local interest and charge.  The President takes the view that they are purely local. With all due respect to his knowledge, and to his interest in the country, I submit that he is altogether and quite mistaken.  The roads in Ireland are of two kinds.  There are the local roads, and there are the main or trunk roads, and by every argument of common sense and economy even, they are as truly a national concern as any other line of transport or of communication, whether that line be railroad or telegraph or any other line.  For that reason alone the State and the National Exchequer has an interest in and should have a charge upon them, but, as I have shown, so far is the Ministry from taking that view, that even when a local council goes out of its way to shoulder a burden which is not properly its own, and to collect what is calculated to be the bare minimum sufficient for keeping the roads in some kind of repair, the Ministry refuses to allow that council to spend the money which it has collected, and refuses, over and <Col N="1607" /> above that, to give anything towards the upkeep of the roads in that district. &ldquo;What return,&rdquo; asks the President, &ldquo;shall we get; what return in employment.&rdquo; A fairly considerable return in employment.  The President thinks not, but he has been answered: &ldquo;Thoroughly good roads.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;they will only last two or three years.&rdquo; Now, in his quiet moods the President would only laugh at anyone else who would make such a ridiculous statement&mdash;as if the roads were not of great importance and concern.  Everyone knows, no matter what the road is, that it must be renewed at periodical intervals.  The recommendations made by the Commission referred to are for the strengthening of the roads and the re-conditioning of them. I think it would be unfair, after the criticism, to put it no stronger, that the President has made on the Commission's report. The sum and substance of the Commission's report is that a scheme of finance be something like this, that the local authorities strike a special improvement rate of between 3d. and 9d. in the £1, calculated, whether the calculation is correct or not it is another thing, to bring in £282,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>If a small amount could be raised from the banks for each £1 raised locally, the State would add £2.  Now, I would point out that towards the State's own contribution there would go the motor tax, estimated at £250,000.  It would mean a considerable saving of unemployment, and, with the reduction of Army expenditure referred to by the Commission, would help considerably.  In the long run what the State is asked to do is not simply to pay out £2 in the new for every one pound raised locally, but to pay something which would not actually be £2 of new expenditure, because there would be a portion of the £2 saved or brought in in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to everybody who has travelled on the roads that there should be restrictions and limitations on heavy traffic.  There are certain restrictions as regards the railways in relation to this class of traffic, but everybody who has travelled the roads knows that it is ruining them from one end to the other.  I have gone over a stretch of road, and the motor traffic is so heavy on that road that it is almost impassable in bad weather. <Col N="1608" /> The President is taking, in my opinion, a most peculiar view of the whole thing, and I submit it is quite a wrong view that the main roads are a matter of purely local concern.  They are not.  They are just as much a national concern as the industry and trade of the country, or as the railways or Post Office, or any other service that is recognised as of really national importance.  For that reason they ought to be not only a national concern, but the nation, as apart from the local community, should bear its share of the charge for improving them and making them fit for the traffic they are required to bear.</P>

      <P>There is one little matter which I would like to bring before the Minister for Defence.  It is a case of a tailor who was employed in Newbridge Barracks.  He was invited by a military officer to come over from Leeds, where he was employed, to take charge of the tailor's shop in Newbridge.  He came over, but he was unable to get to Newbridge in time&mdash;that is, before the order stopping recruiting was issued.  Consequently he would not be attested.  He worked in all 466 hours, and he has not received any payment.  I sent on a letter, a copy of which I have in my hand, to the Quartermaster-General at Parkgate Street, on the 23rd of this month. He replied on the phone that he would deal with the matter, but as everybody is of opinion that the Dáil will soon be dissolved, I would like to see this matter cleared up.  I would like to get an assurance from the Minister that he will see that this man is paid.  He is walking about since the 21st, and it is not fair I would ask an assurance from the Minister that he will look into the matter with a view to having it cleared up.  I know the man for twenty-five years to be a respectable citizen of Newbridge, and in my letter to the Quartermaster-General I told him that his competency as a military tailor could be vouched for by Captain Fitzgerald and Captain Ward, of the Supplies Department, Island Bridge. There is no question of any slackness on his part.  The man has been treated very unfairly, and I think it speaks badly for the Army regulations and discipline that a man should be treated in that callous way.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Duffy's question, I think the sum down in the Estimates for warlike stores is £115,000.  The other matter to which he drew attention is somewhat belated, because we have been looking after that for the past twelve months.  It has not escaped our attention at any time that a portion of these warlike stores, such as furniture, etc., should be claimed for. We are not in a position to say at the present moment what is the value of the total amount, or what our particular share would be, but we have not lost sight of that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other matter, I think that was before the Dáil before.  I take it the question of Trusts means the Imperial Tobacco Company, though I do not know whether that is a Trust or not.  That matter has been under the consideration of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and a deputation from the Irish tobacco manufacturers met in my office some time ago the officials of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  It was arranged that the Ministry should see the representatives of the Imperial Tobacco Company.  I have not had a report on that yet.  As far as policy is concerned, I do not think it is possible to lay down lines of policy governing everything which affects the interests or vital needs of the country within the short space of twelve months; not do I think it at all likely that within the next few years one could give off hand a prescription which would cure all the ills we have to cure or any succeeding Government will have to cure in our time.  Every disorder, I suppose, requires a very close diagnosis, and possibly when it is diagnosed it is much easier to cure it.  In this particular case I expect the Deputy knows that there is a considerable amount of Irish money sunk in that particular limited liability company.  I expect also the Deputy, who is not, I think a nonsmoker, knows that the particular brands manufactured by that Company are effected by very large numbers of people. If the Company were to be excluded, the manufacture of those would be going to foreigners, as would also the profits.  Income tax and so on would not be coming <Col N="1610" /> into the Irish Exchequer, nor would they contribute anything towards rates. I am sure the Ministry for Industry and Commerce is considering those questions.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have a policy with regard to the Trusts as a subject in themselves.  I do not know whether they have got that far.  I should say their hands have been very full since the Ministry was established with regard to all the different services that they administer.  There has been some industrial effervescence of one sort or another, and I am sure a good deal of the time of the Ministry has been absorbed in composing the natural differences that occur between those two different orders in the community&mdash; Labour and Capital.  I think that the matter that the Deputy refers to will be considered by the Fiscal Committee.  I should say that it would.  A definite line of policy has not been adopted with regard to this, nor would it have been possible, having regard to the work we have had to do for the last twelve months, to have examined the problem and to have weighed all the pros and cons of it, and to submit a proper report to the Dáil on the subject or to be able to define a policy with regard to it.</P>

    <P>(2)  If the Minister for Home Affairs certifies in respect of any person who was killed or who has receives a wound before the passing of this Act and has or shall have died within three years after receiving such wound or injury and solely in consequence thereof</P>
    <P>(a)  that such person was at the time he was killed or received such wound a member of an organisation to which this section applies; and</P>
    <P>(b)  that such person was killed or received such wound or injury while performing his duty as such member and without serious negligence or misconduct on his part,</P>
    <P>the Minister aforesaid may, with the sanction of the Minister of Finance, grant to the widow, children, dependants or partial dependants of such person the like allowances and gratuities as could be granted to such widow, children, dependants or partial dependants under Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, if such person were an officer or a soldier (as the case may require) to whose widow, children, dependants or partial dependants an allowance or gratuity could be granted under that section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every pension granted under this section shall commence from the date on which the person to whom it was granted was or is discharged from the organisation of which he was or is a member and every allowance granted under this section shall commence from the date of the death of the person in respect of whom such allowance is payable or from such later date as the Minister for Home Affairs shall in any particular case appoint.</P>
    <P>(4)  Sections 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, and all regulations made by the Minister of Defence under Section 6 of that Act shall apply to pensions, allowances and gratuities granted under this section in the like manner as those sections and <Col N="1614" /> regulations apply to pensions, allowances and gratuities granted under that Act save that the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the said sections 5, 10 and 11 shall mean the Minister for Home Affairs, and the expression &ldquo;Ministry of Defence&rdquo; in the said Section 12 shall include the Ministry of Home Affairs.</P>
    <P>(5)  This section applies to those armed organisations specially raised, before the passing of this Act, by the Minister for Home Affairs for the maintenance of order or the protection of persons or property, under the respective designations of the Criminal Investigation Department, the Citizens' Defence Force, and the Protective Force.</P>
    <P>(6)  For the purpose of determining the rate of any wound pension or further pension or the amount of any allowance or gratuity to be granted under this section, the person to or in respect of whom the same is granted shall be deemed to have held the rank in the forces which shall be certified by the Minister for Home Affairs to correspond most closely to the rank held by such person in the organisation of which he was a member.</P>

      <P>Before you put the question that the section as amended be agreed to I want to ask for further light upon Sub-section 5.  The Minister for Finance, in introducing this Bill, and in reply to certain questions put to him, told us that the Protective Force referred to in sub-section (5) was a Force that had for its object the protection of property. The Citizens' Defence Force was a force that had to do with the protection of persons.  We have some general knowledge of the Criminal Investigation Department, but I think before we pass away from this Section we ought to have some information about these two Forces. In passing this we are committing ourselves to pensions for members of a Force of which we know practically nothing. We do not know the extent of this Force. we do not know their work; we do not know how they are officered; what are their numbers; what is their pay, or what kind of commitments there will be when we are asked to admit them into the category of those who will receive pensions. I asked the Minister if he will, before we get away from this section, give us some details as to this Force. We know what a police force is.  We know what the Civic Guard is, and what the D.M.P. Force is.  We know something about the Criminal Investigation Department and its headquarters, but we do not know anything about these two special Forces.  We learn now that they are under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs.  Are they controlled from the Head of the Criminal Investigation Department?  Are they a separate Force?  Where is their headquarters? How are they officered?  Do they wear uniforms?  Do they carry with them any authorisation?  Have they taken part in raids?  Are they armed? There are many questions that might be <Col N="1616" /> asked, and questions which will need to be asked, if we are to get the necessary information about this force.  I ask the Minister if he can go into little details as to this organisation before we are asked, to pass from this Section, which authorises the payment of pensions to those members of this Force who have been incapacitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the request made by Deputy Johnson for some fuller information. With regard to this Sub-section (5), particularly with regard to the Force he spoke of, I wish to raise it, not in order to cover the ground that has already been taken, but because I think it is a very important question for the Dáil that is raised in a sub-section of this kind in this Bill, because the Dáil has got no information whatever with regard to the existence of this Force.  Vague rumours have been circulated that such a Force exists, and matters were charged to them which were sometimes not very desirable, and I believed these rumours had no foundation in fact, and that there was no such Force in existence.  It appears now there have been such Forces, namely, a Defence Force and Protective Force.  Now, learning of them in this casual and incidental way by the introduction of this measure, we were requested to give statutory recognition without any definition of the place they are to fill and the work they are to do. Presumably if such a Force existed they have been covered by moneys voted somewhere.  I have been looking through the Estimates, and no Estimate has been passed for the expense of such a Force as this.  I would like to know if the Minister would let the Dáil know and have the fullest information with regard to them, and also let us know under what Minister they are, and under what Vote money has been allocated to them.  He might also tell us how long they are to continue, and whether, in fact, they are still in existence.  In any event, it is a very undesirable course of procedure that a Force of this kind should be given statutory recognition in this casual and incidental way.  If it was necessary that this Force should be created, and one presumes such a necessity existed, or else it would hardly have been called into existence, surely the <Col N="1617" /> proper course would have been to have passed legislation by which they could be recognised, and not brought in parenthetically and incidentally in a sub-section. If we had passed this Bill without this information being elicited it would have been possible to have said that this Dáil had recognised them legislatively, because they were mentioned in a Bill passed by this Dáil, although this Dáil had no information before it as to their existence and foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will make some allowance, I am sure, for our difficulties in introducing legislation dealing with all these matters when he reviews what we have done and remembers the occasions that still more important engagements kept him absent from the Dáil.  If he were here last week he would have heard, on Estimate 34, as much information as was available, or as we had to disclose regarding one of the particular bodies in question, the Protective Defence Force, and as regards the other Force, he would have also heard that when we found it necessary to organise this particular Force which is for a dual purpose, namely, of protecting citizens and protecting their property, that we had no other means of calling upon money for that purpose except out of the Secret Service Vote. I do not remember whether I mentioned at the time that out of the Secret Service Vote of £6,500 a sum of £6,050 had been already spent on maintaining this particular Force.  The reason that the money had been spent out of that Vote was that the Estimates had already been prepared, and if we were to adopt any course other than the one we did, it would have required a Supplementary Estimate, or the money could not have been paid out of that particular item. His mind, I am sure, would be eased if he had examined paragraph (<i>b</i>) in the Secret Service Estimate dealing with this matter.  It reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Provision for this Force has been made for a period of six months.&rdquo;  I presume that will set his conscience and his mind at rest with regard to that particular item.  With regard to the Citizens' Defence Force, I am not in a position to say at this moment how much longer it may be necessary to keep that Force in being.  I should hope that it will not be very long, but I am not going to undertake to say what the period should be.  All I know <Col N="1618" /> is that there has been a reduction in that Force, and I presume that, as far as possible, the members of that Force will be drafted into some of the other statutory Forces, if I may use that term.  It is unreasonable to ask us when that transference may take place.  We have not got statutory authority for that force at all, but we have as much statutory authority for it as we have had for the Army.  The Army is only being legalised now by a Bill, and I am sure, if I were in a position to inform the Deputy how much property had been saved by reason of the recruitment of these two Forces, and of how many lives had been saved, he would be satisfied, perhaps, with the work they have done.  As far as I know, at least one member of this Force has been killed at least one, and possibly two.  In one case where property was being guarded by a member of this Force it was subjected to attack from the Irregulars and the place was bombed from the outside. As the unfortunate man opened the door the bomb exploded and he was killed.  He died doing his duty as his duty, and I am certain, from what I know of the work of the organisation, and what it has done, that the rumours that have been started regarding it are absolutely baseless.  The Force, as far as I know, has been recruited from old members of <i>Oglach na hEireann,</i> some of whom would not have passed a medical examination.  I do not know much about these cases, because it is not in my Department, but in the Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  I think it is scarcely fair, having regard to the work that these men do, that there should be any suspicion attached to them.  The Deputy knows as well as I do, that the members of that organisation, the old members of <i>Oglach na hEireann,</i> were very considerate in any public duties they had to perform, and because of the fact that out of the small number in the Force there has recently been one man killed and a certain number wounded, it would not be possible for us to give these men any pensions unless they were paid out of the Secret Service Vote, which might at any moment cease, and therefore there would not be a Statutory liability or any responsibility on the part of the State. For that reason we put them in here in this particular Vote.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To insert immediately before Section 5 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.  (1) The Minister for Finance may from time to time by Order authorise the grant of pensions, allowances or gratuities to persons who resigned or were dismissed from the Royal Irish Constabulary on or after the 1st day of April, 1916, and before the 11th day of July, 1921, and whose resignations or dismissals from that force are certified under the hands of the Ministers for Home Affairs and Finance to have been caused by their national sympathies, and may by any such Order regulate and appoint the rates and scales of such pensions, allowances or gratuities, and the conditions under which the same are to be payable, and may by any such order prescribe the penalties for any fraudulent conduct in relation to an application for any such pension, allowance or gratuity.</P>
      <P>(2) No Order made under this Section shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by resolution of Dáil Eireann, and when considering any such resolution Dáil Eireann shall duly consider any recommendation which shall have been previously made by Seanad Eireann in respect of such Order.</P>
      <P>(3) No person shall be entitled to receive any pension, allowance or gratuity under this section unless money for the payment thereof shall have been voted by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On this amendment, before dealing with the general question, I want to draw attention to the latter part of the first paragraph:&mdash;&ldquo;And may by any such order prescribe the penalties for any fraudulent conduct in relation to any application for any such pension, allowance or gratuity.&rdquo;  That, I think, goes beyond what should be allowed by an order.  I would imagine that the ordinary law against endeavouring to obtain money by false pretences is quite strong enough without empowering the Minister for Finance to prescribe such penalties in an order. I wonder whether sufficient consideration has been given to this sub-section. I think it is too much power to authorise in this way, to give the Minister power to make an order prescribing the penalty, and I think the ordinary laws should be made applicable to any such cases.  I would ask the Minister whether he thinks that that part of the amended section is really necessary or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of any particular information from the Attorney-General I should say that in such cases there are prescribed penalties for infringing any pensions laws, but this is a new pensions law, and it is quite possible that, owing to the peculiar circumstances of it, that it might be open to abuse, and as such there might be a difficulty in prosecuting a person who had taken advantage of it and by fraudulent misrepresentation made a case for a pension, so that I take it the reason was that, it being special legislation dealing with a special class, unless provision were made for imposing such penalties it would not be possible to prosecute a person for making fraudulent representations in connection with it.</P>

      <P>I take it that the insertion of this sub-section means that the men who have been looking forward to a pension in view of previous promises will receive the pension immediately the Bill is passed with this clause inserted, which we hope will be in the very near future.  I understand that the number of claims submitted in connection with this particular clause is something around 1,100, of which 415 have already been rejected, so that it appears that the Committee, or whoever is responsible for the rejection of these particular <Col N="1622" /> claims, are taking reasonable precautions to see that, at any rate, there are no fraudulent claims passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is to the insertion of the date, making it impossible that any pension can be allowed in respect of the period after the 11th July, 1921.  I understand that out of the 415 claims rejected 33 were considered as outside the scope of the terms of reference. I have information that there are cases, genuine cases, of victimisation by the authorities who controlled the Royal Irish Constabulary after the date mentioned in the clause.  I also know that the Minister for Home Affairs is personally aware of one or two very genuine cases of that kind, and I think that this date should be so extended or amended as to make provision for any promise made to these men in July, 1920.  In July, 1920, the Sinn Fein organisation issued a circular to members of the Royal Irish Constabulary putting it up to them that, in the interests of their country, they should refuse to serve England, and that by doing so it would be impossible for the British to carry on the Government of this country any longer.  I realise, and I am sure everyone else does, that if the Royal Irish Constabulary had responded to that appeal, no matter how many British soldiers were in this country, it would have been impossible for them to carry on the British administration. That circular stated: &ldquo;Every man of Irish birth should get a chance of becoming a loyal citizen of the Irish Republic and of earning an honest living in Ireland; and that this is true even of those Irishmen who are so unfortunate as to be at present engaged in doing the work of the enemy in Ireland as members of the Royal Irish Constabulary; and that many of those men joined without a clear understanding of what they were doing.&rdquo;  This is the sentence which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister: &ldquo;We desire it now to be understood that those who resign will not be regarded as enemies of Ireland, but will be granted every opportunity to make up for the past, and every effort will be made by Sinn Fein to obtain employment for them.&rdquo;  That was the promise made by the Sinn Fein organisation, <Col N="1623" /> with the backing of the Irish nation.  Roughly 1,100 men responded to that appeal, and since that time many of these men are living on the charity of their relatives, who are good enough to keep them.  This clause makes provision for some of them to get compensation for the sacrifices they made.  I am personally aware of the fact, and it has been brought to my notice, that many of the men who resigned have been unable to get employment of any kind in this country, and it seems to be the policy of the big employers to refuse to give any employment to men who resigned in response to that appeal, whereas many of the disbanded Royal Irish Constabulary are filling positions in the big business establishments, and even in the Government service.  I understand in the Government service that some of the disbanded men are being employed, whereas many of the men who resigned in response to the circular are still out of work.  I know a case myself where some of the resigned men are employed on the North Wall as Customs watchers at £2 4s. 7d. per week, where pensioned men of the British service are employed at other similar work at £2 17s. 10d. per week.  I think that is not the treatment that the people who met that appeal expected from those who are now in a position to give effect to the promises that they made.  I have no brief for any individual member of that body, but I think they are being badly and harshly treated both by the employers, who probably are opposed to them for what they did at the time and the Government, for having so long delayed in giving effect to the promises made by their associates in July, 1920. I suggest to the Minister, in the first instance, that the date 11th July should be extended to make provision for whatever cases the Minister for Finance might feel to be reasonable, because of victimisation which took place after the Truce.  There is another aspect of the case which I also desire to draw his attention to, and that is the case of short service men in the Royal Irish Constabulary who responded to this appeal and resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the number of such cases was 184, and simply because they had only two or three or four years service <Col N="1624" /> they were turned down, solely because they were short-service men.  Look at it from the other point of view, and see how England treated the Black and Tans she recruited for doing her work at the time.  These men have been given pensions or gratuities, and I suggest that any men who resigned in response to the appeal made at the time, whether they be short or long service men, should get the conditions they were promised, and that they should be treated not less favourably than the men who served England and fought against Ireland up to their disbandment.  We have in the superannuation allowances in the Estimates a sum of £1,350,000 voted away for men who served England up to the time of disbandment.  I suggest that the amount that would meet all the cases reasonably and fairly that could be proved would not amount to one-sixth of that sum.  I think that they should be met in the spirit of the promises made at that time, and that any man who made genuine sacrifices should not be deprived of the operation of this particular clause.  There are a few, unfortunately, of the men who resigned from the Royal Irish Constabulary who have since died, and I want to know in what way their dependants, if any, would be treated under the application of this clause.  Also, there are a number of people who have sided, apparently, with the Irregulars.  I would like to have a clear ruling from the Minister as to whether or not they are debarred from the application of this clause.  The pension, or whatever is given under the terms of this sub-section, would be given to men for a certain action they took between certain times.  I want to know from the Minister if those who are now what is termed die-hards will be debarred from the application of this particular clause.</P>

      <P>As I said in the beginning, I have no brief for any particular individual, but I am personally aware in my own area of three cases of men with families who resigned from the R.I.C. in response to the call I have read, and it is very hard to think that men who took such a patriotic action should be starving. I trust that this particular clause will be given effect to immediately the Bill has passed, and that whatever pension or back money is due to these men will be given to them as soon as it is possible <Col N="1625" /> for the particular Department to make all the necessary detailed arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no power taken under this section to give anything to widows, and I certainly will not pay the pension to any person who has been in arms, or otherwise seriously responsible, in connection with the late outbreak. It ought to be borne in mind that if we entertain all the claims for compensation in respect of what occurred here in this country for the last six or seven years, we would have a large proportion of the population living on pensions. We cannot afford to do that.  A large number of men who gave good services will not draw any pensions, and have not got any jobs under the Government. These men who joined the constabulary and withdrew from it did not do a highly patriotic thing; it was their duty purely and simply, without any patriotism in it at all.  I do not know that they would be treated better in any country, or as well.  I do not see that I can change the date from the 11th July, and I do not think it is reasonable to ask that that should be done.  From that date and for some time previous it was known the result was no longer in doubt, and there are a great number of people anxious to jump off when they see the result is no longer in doubt.  If there are men with two or three years' service who left the R.I.C. they will not get pensions. If there are such, are not there a great many young men in the country who never did anything against their country's best interests and are in the same position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how I can give effect to every promise made by Sinn Fein.  First, undertakings were given for which there was no statutory authority.  I am prepared as far as possible to redeem every promise given by General Collins.  What I mean is, that when he gave that promise a very different state of affairs was present before the country to what is now. <Col N="1626" /> At that time you were in a normal sound, financial position.  Circumstances have changed, and it is not really too much to ask men to work for a living. I think we have met them as fairly as we could in the circumstances, and we have redeemed the promises that have been made to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, I think, forgets that a certain number of these men have not, on account of their previous association with this particular Force, been able to get employment, and numbers of them are still unemployed, and probably will be unemployed for a very considerable length of time.  The President says that there was not anything particularly patriotic in their resigning from the posts that they occupied.  Perhaps not, but they occupied posts which I do not think they were induced to occupy on the ground that their occupation of them would be a disservice to the Irish nation. They occupied these posts because they were an avenue of employment, most of them, and for no other reason.  At a certain stage in the struggle between Great Britain and Ireland it was thought that a very considerable service would be done to the side of the Irish forces by their evacuation of these posts.  Many of the men rose to the greatest heights of patriotism, and they did service, and good service, to the National forces, and in a personal sense a disservice to themselves when they carried it out.  If every young man in the country had simply done his duty, not to speak of rising to the heights of patriotism at all, the situation in Ireland would have been solved much earlier than the 11th July, 1921, or the 6th December, 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that they rose to the greatest heights of patriotism, but I do say they did considerable service, and that it took a considerable amount of both moral and physical courage for these men to take the action they did, especially men who had wives and children or other people dependent on them.  Another Minister&mdash;not the Minister for Finance&mdash;has pointed out quite truthfully and properly that certain men who remained in the service took big risks morally and materially, and that perhaps they did as good service to the Nation as if they came out.  They certainly did good service.  As many as a thousand of them on the call of the <Col N="1627" /> National organisations threw over the allegiance they had entered into for one reason or another.  That was a big factor in bringing about the state of affairs out of which the Saorstát has arisen.  Nobody would recognise that better than the President if he found that, comparatively speaking, one-tenth of the present National Forces were affected by certain calls and changed their allegiance to another side.  There is another point that I want raised; it is a bit ticklish, but I think it ought to be raised and faced squarely.  It seems to me a fair reading of this section that men who are taking part in the revolt against the Saorstát would be penalised not only for the period of the revolt but for the whole period.  I will say frankly and straightly that I do not think that that should be so.  In the British service and in other services I know that members of certain forces who commit certain offences are deprived, during the period in which they are undergoing punishment for those offences, of their pension and such rights.  I know many cases of members of such forces who joined the old I.R.A. and were deprived of those rights for the period of their imprisonment, but they had no difficulty at all in getting back their pensions when they resumed their ordinary avocations. I do not go so far as to say that those who have taken part in the armed resistance to the State, if there are any such, should be entitled to the receipt of their pensions for the period during which they were taking part in any such resistance, but I do not think that they should be penalised for a period prior to that.  They are not in the position exactly of either the Army or the Police Force a year or two hence when we will have regularised all these things.  They are not in the position of members of such forces a year or two hence, or rather ex-members of such Forces, who then may be in receipt of pension and commit offences and forfeit the pension for that period.  That is not exactly the position at all.  You are coming along at a fairly late hour in the day to give certain pensions to these people, and I do not think that it would be strictly just or good policy to make that penalisation stretch back over several years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were concerned <Col N="1628" /> with the question of policy I suppose I would agree to give all these fellows pensions, but as I am concerned with the justice of the case I do not see my way to do it.  I do say it would be unreasonable to ask people who have stood by the State, who have contributed towards the upkeep of the State, and who will have to contribute for many years, to grant pensions to persons who have placed such a shocking load of debt on the country and who have put back the hands of the clock for years.  There is a tribe in this country as well as in other countries who will be perpetually in revolt. That revolt is their happy and advanced method of making their protest. We want to stop that.  I think it is only reasonable that it should be stopped, and that these people should do honest work for the State in the future.  It would take any one of those men the rest of his natural life to do atonement for the damage that has been done to the country during the last twelve or eighteen months.  From that point of view alone I will not recommend the Dáil to consider for a moment the claims of any such persons for pension.  When we consider how many people there are on our side who have rendered good services for whom we can make no claim, and some of whom have not benefited in their health by reason of the anxious times they went through and the hard work they did for some years past&mdash;when we can do absolutely nothing for them, to think of these people coming along, having participated in, you might say, two rebellions, and to benefit by both, is too much.  This resignation of R.I.C. men would have been of some use if a large number of them had come out&mdash;say, four-fifths or five-sixths, or certainly more than half.  As it was, it was very little or no use.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was their fault to this extent.  While we had to persuade the rest of the country to make a big claim and a big fight, if they had exerted themselves in a smaller area and with a very much smaller number of people to deal with, they could have persuaded a great many more, but that did not happen. This particular body was certainly a body of fine physique, and the claim <Col N="1629" /> ought not to be put up that young men of fine physique should get pensions.  I have not examined the question closely, but I have not got very much consideration for men who, after two or three years' service, look for a pension.  Mark the dates&mdash;1916 to 1921.  I do not know that there are many men who paid the slightest attention to Irish politics who would have been inclined to join the R.I.C. during that particular period.  If the claim be on national grounds, they should have seen the light earlier.  So far as the claims that have come in are concerned, they got very careful, fair and just consideration.  I think we have dealt with them in such a manner as redeems any promise that was made.</P>

They were the men who were largely instrumental in preventing a number of R.I.C. men from coming out on the side of the nation.

Recruiting within Ireland for the R.I.C. stopped, to a very great extent, from the time these men commenced to throw up their jobs, and the British authorities were forced to seek recruits outside Ireland. I put it again to the President, and I put it to the Minister for Defence, that if one-tenth of the present National <Col N="1630" /> forces were so affected by anti-Saorstát propaganda that they threw up their allegiance, it would be a very considerable service indeed to the forces operating against the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>That is about ten per cent.  The question is, how many years did these 1,094 cover, and were they all resignations by reason of this spiritual or patriotic call?  Was the moral suasion exercised by certain other active members of the community without any effect at all?  I am inclined to think that it had just as much effect as the patriotic call, and I am inclined to think that, so far as service was concerned, the men who remained on at great personal risk, and who were of certain service, were much more valuable.  But I put the question on another ground altogether. Here you have a body of young men of splendid physique looking for pensions from the State, without having rendered any real service beyond &ldquo;withdrawing from the ranks of the enemy,&rdquo; to use the parlance of the past few years. <Col N="1631" /> I say that we redeemed our promises by the provision for an examination that we made of these cases.  And I do not think this matter ought to be pressed.</P>

      <P>The President knows that it is not possible to draw exact parallels.  Like Deputy Davin, I hold no brief for these men, except I believe that they did render certain services and that those services were considerable by reason of the effect they had on the people with whom they had a contract.  I want to remind the Dáil that others withdrew or were dismissed from the employment of those with whom they had somewhat similar contracts, and efforts have been made, and successfully made, to restore them to something like their original status. The President knows that that has not been possible in the case of the ex-R.I.C. men.  He ought to know, too, that numbers of them have not been able to get employment.  Up to the present they have been living from hand to mouth, subsisting on the charity of their friends and neighbours and those who understand their position.  Unlike those who are dismissed or resigned from other services, they cannot re-join any force similar to that in which they were previously engaged.  They cannot, for instance, join the Civic Guard.  There are many reasons why they are unemployed, although they are men of fine physique.  One of the reasons is that it is difficult, unless a man has a letter from General Collins or from a Minister of the first or second Dáil, to persuade the general body of people, who do not look into the nice points of things, that he is not a wolf in sheep's clothing, because the old prejudice against the R.I.C. still prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are considerations which are not taken into account by the President at all, but they are considerations which count.  If they were like Civil Servants in other Departments they would have a chance of restoration, as many of them thought they would have, to a similar position.  Most of them&mdash;I have not come in contact with them recently, but I did come in contact with them during the period of the resignations and for some time afterwards&mdash;had an idea that they would be provided for, not perhaps <Col N="1632" /> by pensions, not to lead an idler's life on the pensions of the State, but that, if the cause for which they thought they were working turned out successfully, they would have a chance of restoration to a post similar to that which they had occupied.  They were foolish in that. Their colleagues who had not even the grain of patriotism which drove these men out, and who refused to be persuaded either by the moral suasion of the National movement or by the personal appeal of General Collins, were far wiser children in their generation. They depended on those with whom they made their contract, even if they were beaten, to take good care of their interests. They were looked after and their interests were safeguarded by those who had entered into the contract with them.  There was at least a moral contract between the ex-R.I.C. men and the Irish nation, and it is up to the Parliament of the Irish nation to see that that contract is carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent have we failed in that contract?  It surely is not put up as a breach of the contract to include persons who resigned after the 11th July, 1921.  Is that the breach of contract?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was pressing for an extension of the period beyond the 11th July I had in mind the case of a couple of men who had not resigned from the R.I.C. and were actively cooperating with members of the I.R.A. previous to the Truce, and these men were found to be doing that work, and they were deliberately victimised by the authorities of the R.I.C.  I would be prepared to put into the hands of the President or of the Minister for Home Affairs cases of that kind where I could give clear proof to the Government of victimisation, where these men were let down.  If the date 11th July is insisted on it will debar from the operations of the clause these particular cases.  Some of these were married men, who tried, and tried hard. to get work, and could not get it, and now, under the terms of this clause, they will be deprived of anything for the sacrifices that they made.  That was why I was so surprised to find the date was definitely laid down, because I am <Col N="1633" /> aware that the Minister for Home Affairs had personal knowledge of one or two of the cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a Committee of two officials&mdash;one from the Ministry of Finance and one from the Ministry of Home Affairs&mdash;with the Chairman a well-known Dublin citizen. There were something like 1,100 cases investigated.  Six hundred were passed and five hundred were rejected.  Reports were considered, and in certain cases, not all, individual claimants were interviewed.  I think, from my experience, that where 1,100 cases were considered, and 600 out of that number passed, that it is a very fair proportion. But if there are such cases as the Deputy states, in which there has been an obvious injustice, I am prepared to consider that afterwards, but I could not make provision for dealing with it now, and I think it would be unwise to hold up the Bill for two or three cases when I give that undertaking.</P>

If the section remains as it is, limiting the date to the 11th July, claims which might turn out to be good claims could not be introduced.  Therefore, to give a chance for cases of the kind it would be necessary to alter the date, and the doing so <Col N="1634" /> would not make it inevitable that these persons who resigned and did not come within the scope of the present promise would necessarily receive pensions.</P>

All we ask is that it be made possible for these Ministers to be satisfied in regard to particular cases, and that being satisfied they will have power to make grants in individual cases.

      <P>In view of the fact that the amendment which has just been accepted enlarges the scope of the Bill, it will necessarily mean that the Title will have to be altered.  The proper procedure, I understand, now is to pass over Amendments 7 and 8, and to move Amendment 9.  I accordingly move Amendment 9: &ldquo;To insert in line 10 immediately after the word `Eireann,' the words `and to make provision for the payment of pensions, allowances and gratuities to certain former members of the Royal Irish Constabulary.' &rdquo;</P>

I understood from the Minister for Finance that in accepting an amendment to the section it was entirely within the option of himself or the Minister for Home Affairs to decide whether those cases should be heard at all or not.  The phrase &ldquo;to make provision&rdquo; sounds like expressing or indicating that they are to do these things.  I understood that the Ministers were to have an option in making grants in such cases, and for that reason I think the amendment should read &ldquo;to authorise,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;to make provision for.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On Section 5&mdash;I desire to ask the President if he would consider the cases I raised on the last stage.  There is a question of distribution which I do not think it would be fair to press in view of the urgency of the Bill, and in view of the possibility that the Bill would be held up altogether if an amendment were pressed.  There is one matter, however, which I do wish to press, and that is, if it is possible to include under this section the few pensioned teachers who retired before the 1st of April, 1900, and who would get no benefit whatever under the provisions of this Act.  I am not sure as to the number of them, but I think they would not be more than a dozen, or 20 at most. They are very urgent cases, and I would be glad to know if the Minister has looked into the matter since the Bill was before us on the Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see is that that would alter the terms of the clause altogether, because it brings in new matter.  The complaint that was made up to this was that certain penalisation took place through some accident, and we are endeavouring to arrest the disadvantages of the penalisation by this particular section.  Now, what Deputy O'Connell suggests would bring in new matter altogether.  They are not persons who are affected under the Teachers' Pension Rule, 1914.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the difficulty in the case.  What I suggest is that some amendment on these lines should be introduced: &ldquo;That existing pensioners who retired before the 1st April, 1900, may be deemed for the purposes of the Pensions Increase Act to have been granted pensions under the Irish Teachers' Pensions Rule, 1914.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <P>There is a difference between them, because this Act gives the benefit of intermediate benefits. I take it that under the Rules of 1914 they are getting the benefit of that now.  The point is, if they were not considered in 1914, why should they be considered now?</P>

      <P>This amendment helps to meet the criticism that was made, but I am not quite sure that it satisfies the requirements.  Perhaps, in the present circumstances, it may be the best way to act, but the association of the words, &ldquo;Minister for Defence&rdquo; with &ldquo;the Commander-in-Chief,&rdquo; seems to me to be still open to the objection.  The Commander-in-Chief of any Army, whatever he may be legally, so far as the army is concerned, is considered to be the active head of the army, and, I think <Col N="1643" /> that we ought to attempt to dissociate the two offices much more than is done in this proposal.  That the Minister for Defence is a civilian, and a member of the Executive Council, as he probably would be, responsible to the Oireachtas to whom the Commander-in-Chief of the army would be subordinate, is the idea I think that ought to be embodied in any army legislation.  While it is probable that, in fact, this new section would accomplish that if we could delete the title, the insertion of the title in the consequent amendments rather spoils the effect of the section.  I do not know whether one could imagine the Commander-in-Chief being a person who was prohibited by the Public Safety Act from appearing in uniform, but if he does appear in uniform, immediately he is a military person and not a civilian.</P>
      <P>Whatever the effect of the introduction of this section may be in law, the psychological effect upon the army is that no change is taking place, and that as a matter of fact the Commander-in-Chief of the Army is the man who is Minister for Defence.  I do not think that that is satisfactory, and I do not think that the amendment meets the requirements of the case.  However, I am not attempting to amend this Bill.  I think the conditions under which it is introduced rather deprive us of any real value in criticism. But I make that protest against the attempt to associate the military hand with the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>I beg to suggest that perhaps Deputy Johnson's point is not quite exactly as he thinks it is.  If I understand this amendment correctly the Commander-in-Chiefdom is a personal appointment, and <i>ipso facto</i> ceases to exist.  The Free State Army, when this amendment is adopted, will become like other armies in which the position of Commander-in-Chiefdom may be delegated <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It does say the Commander-in-Chiefdom is vested in the Executive Council.  In very few armies in Europe except under active war conditions, and then only for defined areas and for purposes appointed specially, are there Commanders-in-Chief. <Col N="1644" /> It seems to me that the passing of this amendment would mean that such an appointment as a personal appointment ceases and that the Executive Council <i>ipso facto</i> becomes the Commander-in-Chiefdom.</P>

Comparing these non-commissioned ranks with the particulars given in an answer by the Minister to a question put by me on the 23rd March, I find that reference was made there to a Company Sergeant as receiving a certain salary.  That rank does not appear here at all.  Is it the case that the Sergeant Major is a warrant officer?  In that case, is this Sergeant Major the Company Sergeant to which reference is made here?</P>

      <P>I had been expecting an official amendment here in response to the pledge given by the Minister on Second Reading.  He said then he was prepared to have an enlistment period of 18 months, with two years in the Reserve.  I had been expecting <Col N="1650" /> an amendment carrying out that pledge, but I do not see it here.  The time served in all Armies is very short nowadays, and the expenses consequently small.  I will not go into any argument now, but it is to be regretted that the Minister, having given a pledge, did not bring forward his amendment, and I suggest that he should move it now.</P>

      <P>I made a statement that it was not our intention to have recruiting for a long period.  I also made the statement, even if we had this Bill before us as a Bill and even if we intended to make provision by which men could be enlisted for twelve years, it was not our intention to enlist men for such long periods; but we left the clause as one that gave us a certain amount of latitude, and we thought it advisable to have it in at the present time.  I do not intend to change it now, and I do not think that I gave the impression that I did.  I simply made the statement of what our intention was, but actually I could not agree to a reduction to such a figure as that.  At the present moment we will begin recruiting for our bands, where the men will be given a very systematic course of musical training, and our intention would be that men more or less permanently recruited for bands would be recruited for a period of not less than five years.  You cannot take a man into a school of music and start him on systematic work and have him leave the Army or the band in 18 months or two years, at a time when he would just be beginning to be of some use to us.  Then, again, if we made the change from 12 years now there would have to be a number of consequential changes throughout the Bill, and I think the simplest thing is to leave the matter undisturbed in this temporary Bill, knowing what our definite and clear intention is, and that there is no likelihood of any number of men or of any men being recruited for 12 years.  It was simply a matter of convenience and of not making a change in a temporary Bill which would involve quite a number of changes. If we did put in five years there might be a tendency on our part to recruit men for five years, and we do not want to do that, so I think it was much better for all parties to leave that part of the Bill as it is.</P>

      <P>This rather raises a question that we had once or <Col N="1651" /> twice before.  I do not propose to argue the case the Minister presented, but for those who require some kind of technical training I think some form of words could be found.  With regard to soldiers, any pledge given by the Minister is not binding on any person who may succeed him.  It is not even binding upon himself. If circumstances, in his judgment, require some variation of it, this Dáil could not recognise a pledge of that kind. The right procedure is that pledges given and which were sincerely meant and called for, should be embodied in the legislation which is being passed and to which they relate.  If the Minister's intention is to recruit for eighteen months, with a subsequent period of two years in the Reserve, such as he distinctly stated here on the occasion of the Second Reading, then I think that the pledge ought to be put into the Bill and made binding legislatively.  I go further and say that I asked him definitely upon this matter, would he put his pledge in regard to recruiting into the Bill, and he replied to me definitely that it was going into the text of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to create no wrong impression.  I may have agreed, but I cannot conceive that I made a statement that I would change any of the clauses in regard to enlistment.  I only had that in my mind.  I was not thinking of doing a certain amount of redrafting, and that would have to be done if the period was changed in this Clause, because other clauses hang upon it.  I said what our intentions were, and even if our intentions were not definite as between enlistment for eighteen months and two years for the reserve, I pointed out to the Deputy that he need not press his point, because the Bill was purely temporary.  Even if we did enlist for a period of twelve years, there would be nothing to prevent those persons having their period of service terminated at any particular time by any subsequent Government.</P>

      <P>I raised this point originally.  I went into the matter fully, and I find that it would be absolutely impossible to amend the Bill in the time at our disposal so as to preclude the Minister, if he thought fit, setting up military colleges for recruiting an unlimited number of men for a period of twelve years. But I came to the conclusion, having regard to the specific statement the Minister made of his policy and the policy of the members of the Executive Council that we might rely upon it that after the period of twelve months this Bill will have to come before the then Dáil for renewal, and I think the Minister will find that if he is confronted with a definite bargain definitely broken, that it would go very hard with him in the Dáil.  I do not anticipate myself that any such thing will occur.  I think he regards this, and the Government and the Executive Council regard it, as a definite, specific bargain entered into in specific circumstances, and they will not confront the new Assembly with a standing Army as a <i>fait accompli.</i>  I think it would be far safer to rely on the promises that have been given than to endeavour now to accomplish the impossible task of trying to tinker with this Bill.  The only effect in trying to do that would be to defeat the whole object of the Ministry in producing this Bill at all in order to try and regularise things in the time at their disposal. We never could get through all the clauses in the time at our disposal or draft amendments, and therefore we are bound to take the Bill as a whole on the pledge given by the Minister, and not to try to amend Chapter 5, or other clauses, because we would only find we had reduced the whole thing to a state of chaos.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks of the Ministries' Bill, but we have not seen it.  It is still in embryo, and I do not think we can refer any defence of this Bill to a Bill which is not yet an Act of Parliament.  If the commission is to be issued by the President of the Executive Council and the Minister for Defence, surely that is sufficient for the commission. It is these two civil Ministers that are satisfied with the loyalty and courage of the officer, and the connection of the Minister for Defence with the Commander-in-Chief makes the commission a personal one, and personal from the Commander-in-Chief. As I said earlier, you cannot dissociate in the minds of the men who constitute the Army the term &ldquo;Commander-in-Chief&rdquo; from a military officer in fact.  The section that we have passed and which Deputy Figgis has referred to does not seem consistent with this title, unless we are to read into Section 5 something which we are assured is not here. If the Executive Council, acting through a Minister, is the body which has the chief command of the Army, then the Executive Council, in the name of the President and the Minister for Defence, should be the authority to issue the commission, and the Act should be left to say that the Minister for Defence is the Minister through whom the Executive Council exercise the chief command.  I would press the Minister to agree to the deletion of these three words.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Minister if he would be good enough <Col N="1663" /> to consider the definition of Dáil Court in order to make it clear that that definition includes Land Commission Court. The matter arises in this way.  I am aware that most of the Land Commission Court decrees have been carried out or dealt with by assignment.  The Minister so informed me in reply to a question. There are still a few cases outstanding which have not been dealt with by assignment. In addition to that, however, there is a class of case which has probably escaped the attention of the Minister, and that is the numerous cases arising out of the Bolshevism in the West, a matter in which the First Dáil, and in particular the Land Commission Court of the First Dáil, proved signally successful. A good many decrees were given for damages, very well deserved.  The people who went to the County Court under the English system got their damages and got paid, whereas the people who went to our Courts are still waiting for their money.  I do not know how far that is general, but I know one solicitor who has six or seven of those cases in which damages were awarded.  On account of the suppression of the Dáil Courts he has been unable to get his money.  I think that solicitor has sent particulars to the Minister.  I would ask the Minister, if there be no objection, to include Land Commission Courts in the expression &ldquo; Dáil Court.&rdquo;  In that connection I may refer the Minister to the official account of the First Dáil, in which he will find the matter of the Land Commission dealt with.  In the report for August, 1920, at page 199, it is set out that it was decided to set up a Commission, subject to the report of a Special Committee, and at page 232 it is stated the Special Committee having reported favourably, the Land Commission Bill was passed.  It is not quite clear whether the Land Commission Courts sat under that decree, or sat under a decree of the Minister for Home Affairs.  I rather gather, from what is reported in the debates, that the Land Courts sat before the Commission was established, in which case they are also included in that definition. As there are quite a number of people who are entitled to get paid damages awarded to them in very proper circumstances, I would ask the Minister if he has no objection, to put in words which will give those the benefit of decrees <Col N="1664" /> in the same way as if they had been got under some other Court established by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the affairs of the Land Settlement Courts cannot be dealt with in this Bill.  When the Bill was in process of preparation my Ministry asked the Ministry of Agriculture whether it was advisable to deal with the affairs of the Land Courts in this Bill, and in all the circumstances they considered it was not advisable.  My feeling in the matter is that I ought not to break the Eleventh Commandment: &ldquo;Thou shalt not butt in.&rdquo;  I shall leave it to the Minister for Agriculture, if he thinks a Bill is necessary, to introduce such a Bill himself.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; (2)  Any person who claims to be aggrieved by any registered decree of a Dáil Supreme Court, and who was a party to the proceedings in which such decree was made, or is otherwise bound by such decree, may apply within the prescribed time, and in the prescribed manner, to the Commissioners for leave to appeal to the Commissioners from such decree, and in the event of such leave being granted, such person may appeal within the prescribed time, and in the prescribed manner, to the Commissioners from such decree, and thereupon the Commissioners shall hear and determine such appeal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Section gives the right of appeal to the Commissioners.  The object of the amendment is to provide, in the case of a decision by a Dáil Supreme Court, an appeal by special leave of the Commissioners.

      <P>In Sub-section 4 of this section I desire to call attention to a fact which I think has escaped observation in the drafting of this Bill. Sub-section 4 provides that no registered decree of a Dáil Court shall be capable of being sued upon or enforced before or by any Court except as authorised by this Act.  I speak under correction, but I am under the impression that the effect of that statement, as it stands, would be to prevent a setting up of a Dáil decree duly registered as a set-off or a counterclaim in any proceedings in the other Courts.  Supposing you have a judgment of the Dáil Court for £100 in your favour and the defendant brings an action against you, not having paid that £100, surely you ought to be able to set up in defence <i>pro tanto</i> the fact that he owes you £100 as certified by the Dáil Court. I think that Sub-section 4, when it refers to the steps authorised by this Act, contemplates Section 19, which deals with the enforcement of Commissioners' Orders and Dáil Court Decrees, and provides that those Orders and Decrees are to be enforced by the Under-Sheriff <Col N="1666" /> in the usual way.  I am inclined to think that nowhere is there any provision which, in face of Sub-section 4, would enable one to set up in the other Court a Decree which one had duly obtained and registered in the Dáil Court.  I do not think that that is intended.  I would ask that that be amended in the Report Stage, if I am right in my premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 20, I should like to ask is there any provision making it clear that the Commissioners can award costs.  I think that is rather a serious lacuna in the Bill.  Section 20 deals with the general powers of the Commissioners.  It gives them power &ldquo;to hear and determine,&rdquo; and then it gives them certain specific powers.  I do not think it can be said that the power to award costs is given by Section 20.  I do not think myself that it is implied by Section 20.  If one looks at Section 4 one sees the phrase &ldquo;the Commissioners shall hear and determine,&rdquo; and that same phrase is used in subsequent sections. When the matter comes before the Commissioners they are told they are &ldquo;to hear and determine.&rdquo;  I have failed to find in the Act any further powers which would enable them to give costs in these matters.</P>
      <P>I think it will be obvious to anyone that it is very important that the Commissioners should have power to give costs, which very often will be a considerable item to a person who has suffered. I cannot help thinking that if that power is not given in the Act it must be an oversight.  It is, I think, intended that it should be given.  I think the Minister will see that it is necessary if it is his desire&mdash;as I think it must be&mdash; that the Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners should have the ordinary powers of a Judge to award costs, that express words to that effect should be put into Section 20.</P>

As far as I can see there is an omission, except the fact that the Commissioners, being themselves a Court, the power of awarding costs might be deemed to be inherent in them.

I would suggest also that the Minister might agree to the addition of certain words limiting the time within which the provisions of this section may be put in force by any particular applicant, as is done in another section of the Bill.  It is obviously undesirable that a matter of this kind should be left open, giving people power <Col N="1671" /> to get a re-hearing at any time.  I would suggest to insert, after the words &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Commissioners,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;upon an application made within the prescribed time.&rdquo;  That is the form adopted in another section of the Bill. You limit the time within which a person may apply, and by adding in in the fifth line of the amendment the words I have suggested, you will make certain that people cannot come in two years hence and demand a re-hearing.  If it is intended that the application be made <i>ex parte</i>, I would suggest that the words be added: &ldquo;upon an <i>ex parte</i> application made by them within the prescribed time.&rdquo;  That should be made quite clear.

      <P>There is another suggestion I desire to make in connection with the new section.  The section, as drawn&mdash;incidentally I must congratulate the Minister for Amendments on the admirable way he has drawn the amendments&mdash;puts a little too much onus upon the applicant, because the applicant has to prove that he has a good defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will see that the applicant, if he gets leave for a re-hearing, is taking upon himself the risk of having to pay the costs of the whole proceedings. Therefore it should be enough that the applicant should prove on an <i>ex parte</i> application that he probably has a good case.  I assume that the other side is not there, and that the case will be thrashed out on the re-hearing eventually.  I ask that, on the next stage, the word &ldquo;probably&rdquo; be inserted in the section. What I suggest is, that in the fifth line of the amendment it should be made to read: &ldquo;It shall be proved that such person probably had a good defence.&rdquo;  I <Col N="1672" /> think if you make the person prove definitely that he has a good defence, you are asking the Commissioners to prejudge the case before the re-hearing takes place at all.</P>

    <P>(1)  If and whenever the time limited by any statute for instituting any proceedings in any Court of law or equity would, but for this section, have expired <Col N="1673" /> on any date between the 31st day of December, 1918, and the 16th day of April, 1922, such time shall be and is hereby extended for three months after the passing of this Act, and any such proceedings which shall have been instituted after the expiration of the time so limited by such statute and before the passing of this Act, or which shall be instituted before the expiration of three months after the passing of this Act, shall be deemed to have been instituted within the time so limited by such statute.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall not apply to any limit of time which can be extended by a District Justice under Section 6 of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 (No. 6 of 1923).</P>

      <P>I desire to make one more appeal to the Minister to improve the Bill by striking out this section. The amendment to the Title which has just been carried certainly does not cover this section, because it refers only to certain anomalies that have arisen in the Dáil Courts, which are the only Courts referred to in the Title to the Bill.  This Bill deals with the time limit for starting or instituting proceedings in any Court, and it seems to me that this section opens the gates for a flood of fraud and perjury, and that it is likely to open up cases which can lead to all kinds of hardship.  People who have acted in the capacity of executors, and who administer estates in good faith and paid away property to people who were entitled to it, relied upon the fact that the statutory period of six years had elapsed from 1912, and got the property distributed.  These people, I say, who have been in undisturbed possession of the property since 1912, are now liable to be put out at the suit of some next-of-kin or of anybody who comes forward and says that he would like to have brought his action in 1918, but that he had not got the money.  If this section is passed everything that was done between 1912 and 1918 can be ripped up in the case of people who, in good faith, distributed the assets they were bound to distribute to the people who were entitled in law to receive them.  That is what will happen in cases where there was a sale of land.  People who acquired a title to lands by having occupied them for twelve years in undisturbed possession will now be liable to have cases faked <Col N="1674" /> up against them by some returned next-of-kin from America or some other place. A person who brings such a case may have no hope of succeeding, but when he sees legislation like this passed he will bring his action in the hope that the person he proceeds against will settle with him, and if not he can saddle the other person with enormous expense. Apart from these cases there are the very serious cases of tort and assault.  An action for assault was statute-barred after four years, and an action for slander was statute-barred after two years. Cases of that kind can be raked up again against some person or other, who will be told, &ldquo;You'll have the law unless you pay me compensation for blackmail, and I will take proceedings against you in Court.&rdquo;  It seems to me to be a mischievous thing in an Act of Parliament to introduce in a Bill for the winding-up of the decrees of the Dáil Courts a provision whereby the Statute of Limitations in all cases is extended and under which actions that were barred after six years can now be brought on.  In some cases a person, relying on the Statute of Limitations, who brought his action and got his decree may now find that the case can be brought on all over again.  We have had a certain amount of retrospective legislation in this Dáil, but we have never had anything to approach within a thousand miles of this.  It was only on Saturday last that I got a decree for a poor member of the minority in the Northern State.  He sold a farm, relying on his statutory title, but the parties to whom he sold it thought they would be able to squeeze him a little more, having already squeezed him out of his farm.  But his title was held to be good, and even in Belfast they have not passed any legislation like this.  If they had this poor man would have been done out of his farm and out of his money as well.  I think the Minister should pause before putting into an Act of Parliament dealing with the winding-up of decrees of the Dáil Courts a section such as this, which will create chaos in the administration of estates that have been administered since 1918, the parties concerned relying on the law as it stood at that time.  As I say, this section is only for the benefit of people who were not prepared at the time to say on which side of the fence they would come down. It is only the people who would not commit themselves to one side or another <Col N="1675" /> that get the protection of this particular section, and not only that, but for six or seven years, as the case may be, when they had the ordinary law to go to, they refrained from going into court, before 1918.  These are the people who, for eleven years, that is to say six years before 1918, refrained from going to court, who are now given an extension of five years from 1918 to three months from the date of the passing of this Act.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to say that this is not the kind of section that ought to be passed at all.  It is certainly not the kind of section that ought to be put into an Act without giving some kind of protection to people who, relying on the ordinary law as they found it at the time, administered estates or bought and sold property.  For five years before 1918 these people, relying on the law as it stood at the time, administered estates and did the other things that I referred to.</P>

      <P>I have only to say what I said on the Second Reading against the hypothetical cases which the Deputy conjures up, that there is in my Department abundant evidence, from actual concrete cases, of the hardship that would ensure if the Statute of Limitations were not extended in such a way as to omit these few years of turbulence and revolution, when there was a concurrent jurisdiction and a concurrent lack of jurisdiction.  That is the case which I mention against the cases which he says are conceivable.  I know there are actual cases of people in many areas in the country who were unable, during these years, for reasons that it is unnecessary to dilate upon, to collect debts or assets of various kinds.  It has been represented to us very persistently and very consistently in recent months that a Bill should be brought in to provide that matters of that kind ought not to be Statute-barred, having regard to the fact that for two or three years it was not reasonably possible for inhabitants in many areas through the country to get redress of the law or the support of the law for the obtaining of their rights.  I do not suppose that the Deputy would contend that in Cork, Kerry, or Tipperary, or in many other areas through the country, during these few years of strife, <Col N="1676" /> that the machinery of the law was absolutely and normally at the disposal of traders, let us say, for the collection of their debts.  That is just the other side of the shield, and putting one against the other, and having regard to the short period fixed here of three months in which cases of that kind must be brought to the surface, we have felt that the weight of the argument, and the weight of the equity, lies rather in favour of prolonging the period than to take the view where you could or could not get redress of the law, where you had or had not the machinery of the courts at your disposal between 1918 and 1921, the Statute of Limitations and other barring statutes of that kind must be held to have run.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister intends to stick to his section for the sake of the people he mentions. I do realise that there is a liability of danger such as Deputy FitzGibbon has suggested, but I think it ought to be possible to get rid of that danger by a small amendment to this section.  If we provide that the extension of time limited by statute shall apply, subject to the leave of the Commissioners, every person who wants to take advantage of this section must go before the Commissioners and get their sanction to his so doing. That, I think, would meet all the cases that the Minister has in mind, and at the same time I think it would satisfy the people whose interests Deputy FitzGibbon is afraid to see jeopardised.  Some scheme of that kind might be made to enable the Commissioners to decide on the facts whether it is right or not that people should get rid of this statute-barring. The Commissioners would be able to decide whether the case was a proper case to go forward, or whether it was an improper one.  In the latter case they would refuse to remove the bar.</P>

      <P>I think that should be done by a proper Statute of Limitations Bill, which could be brought in here when we would have time to consider the arguments for and against it. The Minister speaks of turbulence of Cork, Kerry, and Galway during the period of two years.  But what, I ask, was there to prevent anyone from prosecuting a suit here in the City of Dublin? I suggest that in the City of Dublin there <Col N="1677" /> are as many suits for the recovery of debts dealt with in a given period as there would be over the rest of the Saorstát. Here in the City of Dublin we had both courts functioning, and yet, despite that, under this section power is to be given to have hundreds of these cases ripped up, as if the turbulence of this city prevented people from going to the courts with their cases.  The districts in which the courts were not functioning were fairly limited, and could be very clearly defined in an Act; but it is the reopening of cases at random, without any regard for decency or justice, that revolts me against this section.  I do not think we could possibly amend the section by tinkering with it now in such a way as to cover cases on each side&mdash;the side of justice and the side of hardship.  I suggest that this section should be withdrawn altogether, and that the Minister should carefully consider granting an extension of the statutory limitations, which provided protection for people who had sold <Col N="1678" /> their property or administered estates <i>bona fide.</i>  Take the case of a <i>bona fide</i> administered estate.  A person sold certain landed estate <i>bona fide</i>, and for a valuable consideration, relying on the statutory title he had got.  Surely a person in that position is entitled to some protection, but under this section he would have none.  I think a Bill should be brought in covering cases of that kind and giving protection to people entitled to expect justice and not injustice from this Dáil.</P>
