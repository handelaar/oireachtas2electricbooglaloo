      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if his attention has been called to the fact that notices threatening ejectment have been issued by landlords, both head landlords and middle landlords, to tenants in O'Connell Street whose premises were destroyed during hostilities of last June, and who have, <Col N="2204" /> therefore, been deprived of the incomes from the receipt of which such rents would have been payable?  If it is a fact that, if such ejectments proceed, the landlords in question will receive due compensation, although it is the tenants businesses that have been destroyed? And if, having regard to these circumstances, he will make such additions to the Criminal and Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, now before the Oireachtas, as will give a general stay in all such cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of Clause 6 of the Bill, which excludes compensation for consequential loss, such as presumably loss of rent, no question seems to arise of a landlord getting compensation from the State for anything beyond damage to a structure which he owns.  I cannot see that there is any case for an amendment of the Bill in this respect.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether an inquiry was held by the Wicklow County Board of Health into the allegation that inmates were not receiving the proper meat allowance per day, and whether the Local Government Board in a letter read at a subsequent meeting of the Board of Health objected to the cross-examination of officials in the presence of inmates, as it tended to undermine the authority of officials.  Further, to ask the Minister what steps, in view of this letter, should be taken to inquire into the alleged grievances of the inmates of County Homes, and if it is intended to protect officials from inquiries into allegations made against them?</P>

      <P>The complaint of <Col N="2206" /> the inmates of the Wicklow County Home was considered at a recent meeting of the County Board of Health, at which the officials and inmates were present.</P>
      <P>The County Board of Health were subsequently informed that the cross-examination, which took place at that meeting, of officials in the presence of inmates would not have satisfactory results, and that such action would be subversive to discipline.  It was suggested as a better method of procedure that it was open to any of the members of the Board to make a complaint of this nature at any of their meetings and to ask that a Committee should be appointed to investigate.</P>
      <P>It was further suggested that a Visiting Committee of the Board of Health might be appointed which would meet regularly before the ordinary meetings of the Board and report to the Board with recommendations as to such improvements in administration, equipment, etc., as they might deem necessary.</P>
      <P>The Ministry's Inspector who inquired into the complaint of the inmates reported that there was no foundation for their complaint that they were not receiving the proper daily meat allowance.</P>
      <P>All complaints are carefully inquired into by the Ministry, but it will be obvious that investigations should not be conducted in a manner which would impair disciplinary control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A report has been called for, and the Deputy will be informed of the result.  If delay has occurred, as stated in the question, it was probably due to lack of funds caused by the remissness of ratepayers in meeting their obligations to the County Council. Where hardships are suffered by road workers owing to their not receiving payments with regularity the primary cause is irregularism.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Cornelius and Laddie Heffernan were arrested at Roscrea at midnight on the 28th ultimo; if he will state the charge, if any, which is to be preferred against them; if they are to be brought to trial, and, if so, when? Whether he is aware that one of those boys had intended to sit for the Easter Scholarship Examination for entrance to a Teachers' Training College, and that his arrest so close to the examination will spoil his chance of success, and if, in view of this, he will have inquiries made into this case immediately with a view to having them brought to trial or released.</P>

      <P>Before that is taken up I desire to say it is my intention, this evening, to ask permission to introduce a Bill called &ldquo;The Double Taxation (Relief) Bill, 1923, First Stage.&rdquo;  It is an Act to authorise the making of arrangements with the Government of Great Britain for granting relief from double taxation, wherever there is a charge both to a Free State tax and to a corresponding British tax, in respect of the same subject matter. I intend at the end of to-day's Agenda to move for permission to introduce this Bill.  It is a pressing matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move, to insert immediately before Section 10 a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person in a County to which a County Scheme relates who is eligible for relief may, subject to the provisions of such County Scheme and to any regulations made by the Minister in that behalf, be granted outdoor relief, notwithstanding anything in any enactment limiting the granting thereof to certain classes of persons, and this provision shall be deemed to have had effect in any such County from and after the date on which such County Schemes came into operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is consequential on the abolition of workhouses.  It really is understood in the whole Bill, and in the whole scheme of amalgamation, but it was not specifically provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arises whether these old disqualifications from relief which are now removed could not be made under the Bill to apply to the whole of the country even though there may be no new County Scheme.  As it stands there will be different conditions applying to those parts of the country where there is no County Scheme in operation.  In the City of Dublin, the City of Cork, Louth, and one or two other places, where there is no new scheme brought forward, the old disqualifications will prevail, whereas the remainder of the country, where there had been new County Schemes, will be placed in a different position, and I would suggest that the present Sub-section should be altered to provide for that.  The amendment I suggest is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person who is eligible for relief may, subject to the provisions of any County Scheme and to any regulations made by the Minister in that behalf, be granted outdoor relief, notwithstanding anything in any County Scheme or in any enactment limiting the granting thereof to certain classes of persons. etc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> The Minister will see the point&mdash;that you are establishing an entirely new Poor Law system in one part of the country and not in another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about extending this further than is done in the proposed amendment is simply that where the workhouses continue it is supposed that sufficient provision is made for the relief of all classes in the workhouse. The reasons for removing the restrictions in this temporary Bill, apart from the reasons that might apply if we were dealing with permanent legislation for reform are that the workhouses have gone, that opportunity for relief must be provided, and they only can be provided by way of outdoor relief.  Where the workhouses are not abolished there is no particular urgency.  There certainly would be a great objection to having alternative systems covering, as you might say, the same class of persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>What are these provisions? It is not generally known what they are.  I think it might be set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>At present out-door relief can practically be given only to a person who is infirm or to a widow, with two or three children, I think.  This would enable all classes of people who are destitute, but who are not now eligible for out-door relief, to be given out-door relief.  For instance, it might be that the family of healthy persons were absolutely destitute.  At the present time they cannot be relieved outside the workhouse. They can be relieved only under the provisional powers of the Relieving Officer, who can give relief in kind when a sudden urgent emergency arises.  Then there are cases of people who might be aged and infirm, but who own a quarter of an acre of land.  At present no person owning more than a quarter of a statute acre can be relieved.  I think it is certainly desirable that these people should be able to receive relief without being necessarily obliged to divest themselves of the possession of the land, because that would only tend, in many cases, to permanently pauperising them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <P>Under the cast-iron restrictions a person destitute and needing relief was obliged to go into the House.  When you have abolished work-houses&mdash;when you have closed them&mdash; that restriction must go, because where there is destitution, where people are going to starve, there must be means of relieving them outside, no matter what their state of health may be, or their age, or anything like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILLIAM O'BRIEN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the time that might elapse before schemes are considered for the other counties&mdash; Dublin, Cork and elsewhere&mdash;would it not be well if the Minister took power so that he might be able to dispense with these obnoxious provisions?  Take the case of a widow with one child; would he not think it advisable to have power to make an order that relief might be granted in such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that there are cases like that, but what I feel about the matter is that the better way to do it would be to proceed with the completion of schemes in the counties where schemes have not so far been made.  So long as the workhouse is kept open to provide for, you might say, any destitute cases that are not capable of receiving outdoor relief under the existing law, it is quite undesirable that an alternative system should be provided&mdash;that you should, on the one hand, keep the workhouse open with all the expenses attached to it, and, on the other hand, give the people for whom that is supposed to provide, another form of relief.  It seems to me it would constitute a double burden, and certainly would be expensive, and it is a matter which will only be remedied in some kind of permanent legislation.  At present I think it would not be desirable to make any change which should really be made by hastening the work of the County Schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another small matter on which, perhaps, the Minister could give us some assurance. A new section states.  &ldquo;Any person in a county to which a County Scheme relates, who is eligible for relief, may, subject to the provisions of such County Scheme, and to any regulations made by <Col N="2219" /> the Minister in that behalf be granted out-door relief, notwithstanding anything in any enactment limiting the granting thereof to certain classes of persons, and this provision shall be deemed to have had effect in any such country from and after the date on which such County Schemes come into operation.&rdquo;  Now, the Tir Connail Scheme has a 12 months' residence condition.  Can we have an assurance from the Minister that the regulations made in that behalf will not allow that provision in the Tir Connail Scheme to continue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>Section 10&mdash;To insert a new Sub-section after line 47 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Where any officer of a Local Authority who holds a pensionable office:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  is, or has been removed from his office by or in pursuance of any County Scheme; or</P>

      <P>and was at the time of his appointment to such pensionable office employed by the Local Authority in a temporary capacity, the temporary service of such officer shall, to such extent, if any, as the Minister may direct, be reckoned as service in a pensionable office for the purpose of any enactment relating to the superannuation of officers of a Local Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> Under this Sub-section account is to be taken of temporary service in the case of a person who is afterwards appointed to a permanent office when he is being removed from that office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity. As a matter of fact, in practice, under the Schemes, temporary service has been taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'BRIEN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very satisfactory as far as it goes, but it does not deal with a point that was referred to by me in the previous discussion.  I would remind the Minister that there was an amendment down proposing to give a half-year for each year of service in computing the pension of any officer of a local authority.  While the Minister then said he was prepared to agree to that in pursuance of a County Scheme he was not prepared to agree to it generally.  I would like to know how it is proposed to deal with that matter now.</P>

      <P>I did not quite catch the Deputy, but we felt it was somewhat difficult to draw any line in this matter, and that at the moment this was about as far as we could safely go.  There might be cases of people who were for a very long time on temporary service&mdash; people who were really permanent&mdash;and we thought it was a matter that had better wait over until it could be dealt with further.  In regard to people who had under 10 years' service, and who were entirely temporary we did not feel that we could do anything.</P>

      <P>Oh, no; I am sorry I misheard the Deputy.  What I said was that so far as the schemes were concerned we had acted upon that and would act on that, but that outside the carrying into effect of the schemes of amalgamation I could not promise that <Col N="2222" /> that would be a thing that would apply in all cases.  It is a somewhat hypothetical matter, and I preferred not to put in a binding Clause into the Bill.  Our practice so far has been to add 50 per cent. in dealing with persons whose offices have been abolished under the schemes, and that will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move&mdash;To omit the Section, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  No person shall hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under any Local Authority from and after the holding of the election or appointment of members to such Local Authority next held after the passing of this Act while he is or within six months after he has ceased to be a member of such Local Authority, or of any other Local Authority whose functional area is, or is situate in, the same County as that of or within which is situate the functional area of such Local Authority or in any County adjoining to that County.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Any member of a Local Authority whose membership is terminated by his resignation or otherwise, at or before the next election or appointment of members to such Local Authority after the passing of this Act shall, for the purposes of this Section, be deemed to have ceased on a date fixed six months prior to the date of such election to be a member of such Local Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 is being amended so as not to interfere with persons at present members of Local Authorities.  They need not, under the terms of the amendment, clear out of these Authorities at the moment.  They can continue to hold membership until an election takes place.  To a certain extent this does depart from the substance and intention of the resolution of the Second Dáil which was intended to operate from the moment of its passage.  However, we feel that it is only just in the circumstances to allow this amount of time.  I <Col N="2223" /> considered the question of defining classes of employees who might be exempt from this particular provision, but on going into it I was not able to make up my mind to agree to an amendment on these lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I cudgelled my brains to understand the meaning of this, as it was circulated, but now, on reading it on the green paper, I find a clue that clarifies the position.  While the proposed new section meets the case fairly well of the present members, I would again urge upon the Minister the unfairness of the prohibition, especially in so far as it applies to those persons in another county adjoining the county in question.  There may be a case to be made, and I think there is a case to be made, for the prohibition as applying to a member of a Council being employed by members of another Council who are in financial relation to the Council of which he is a member, but I cannot see for the life of me why a single exceptional instance should be made the basis of an Act of Parliament. If one were to quote the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;as he is not here I will not quote him.  I was going to say we can only produce one instance.  The Minister did quote a single instance of a member of a Local Authority being employed by another, and a contervailing position in regard to membership and employment by another Local Authority, and that apparently was made the reason why no person who was a member of a Council in any County should be employed by another Council in another County.  The proposed Act is going to make it very much more difficult in Ireland than it is in England or Scotland for persons who are employed by public bodies to give public service of a voluntary kind in administration.  I think that is a great pity, and it is a very nasty slur upon the civic patriotism of the Irish people.  I would ask the Minister whether he could not agree to deleting these words after &ldquo;Local Authority&rdquo; on the last line of Sub-section 1, so that the prohibition would be confined to service within a particular county.  There could be no real ground for prohibition in the case of a resident in another county.  The chances of collusion are almost infinitesimal.  There is <Col N="2224" /> more likelihood of collusion when you are dealing with persons employed by private employers, and the evils are likely to be just as great, and you cannot prohibit that.  I think it is unwise to cast this general slur upon persons who are employed by Local Authorities and make them unfit, or at least ineligible though well fitted to give service in another county which has no jurisdiction over the employment of that individual. I press that matter upon the Minister to see if he will not agree to limiting or, at least, deleting these last few words in Sub-section 1.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not agree to this.  We have reduced the provision, as it was originally put forward and as originally passed by the Second Dáil, very considerably.  One or two of the most glaring instances of this particular and really most objectionable sort of corruption, corruption in which responsible officials of local bodies were concerned, have occurred, where local bodies in different administrative counties were concerned, and where an employee of one Council was a member of the other, and <i>vice versa.</i>  I am able to see the argument put forward by Deputy Johnson.  I think it was put forward more definitely on the Committee Stage than on this present stage, that there are certain classes of employees of Local Authorities to whom, it might well be argued, this particular section should not apply.  The difficulty in that particular case is in deciding where the line of distinction shall be drawn.  There can be, I think, no case at all made against this particular provision when we are dealing with what we might call a responsible class of official&mdash;I think undoubtedly some provision like this is entirely necessary, and a good provision, and it ought to stand without qualification.  If a line could be drawn it might be possible to draw it, so that when dealing with certain other classes of officials who would not have the same opportunities for intrigue, it might be possible, perhaps, to confine the provision of this clause to those who were employed in one county, and not in an adjoining county.  For the present it is a watering down of a decree that was passed, and that we have attempted to some extent to enforce&mdash;not with great success indeed.  At the present <Col N="2225" /> stage I have not been able to see very well how or where the line could be drawn.  I do not think the provision, as it stands, will really infringe on the liberty of perhaps anybody who would have a case against this, and it will certainly put an end to a matter that has, not in one case, but in quite a number of cases&mdash;I know of two or three myself intimately&mdash;existed in the past, and which should not be continued.</P>

      <P>There is just one point I would like to draw the Minister's attention, to and I would urge him to reconsider his attitude with regard to drawing a distinction between the various classes of persons who would be affected by this, and also, perhaps, the particular authorities.  For instance, membership of a local council would, I take it, come under the provisions of this clause.</P>

      <P>As far as I know the relations between the Urban Councils, say, and the County Councils are not as close as those of a District Council and the County Council.  He might give that point consideration&mdash;that officials should not be debarred from membership of an Urban Council.  I know cases connected with a mental hospital where employees of that hospital are members of the Urban Council.  I think it would be stretching the thing very far to see how they could, from their membership of the Urban Council, be guilty in the way of abuses or corruption, so that I think it is a matter that might get consideration.  I think it would really be best if the particular classes of employees were defined by the Minister.</P>

There are, of course, some officials of a minor capacity in the service of Local Authorities who could not be supposed to have opportunity for the particular class of corruption suggested by the Minister, and it might be difficult here and now to attempt a classification.  If, however, a saving clause were inserted, or that the <Col N="2226" /> matter was left open so that each case could be pretty well decided on its merits when referred up, it might meet the point.</P>

      <P>I move for permission to bring in this Bill&mdash;&ldquo;The Double Taxation (Relief) Bill, 1923; an Act to authorise the making arrangements with the Government of Great Britain for granting relief from double taxation wherever there is a charge both to a Free State tax and to a corresponding British tax in respect of the same subject matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Bill which will enable us to make necessary arrangements so that <Col N="2237" /> persons having investments in England and living in Ireland, or persons living in England and having investments in Ireland, would not be subject to double income tax.  In the absence of any arrangements such as it will be necessary to make, people in both places would be mulcted.  I will have further information in connection with it on the Second Reading.  There are other matters also, such as stamps.  A cheque, in the absence of an arrangement of this sort, going from Ireland across the water would be subject to the ordinary stamp charge there as well as here, and <i>vice versa;</i> a cheque coming from England over here would suffer the same cost.  It is to regularise these things and to make the necessary arrangements and accommodation, so that we deal fairly with all parties, that it is proposed to bring in this Bill.  It would not have been rushed but that it is necessary to get it through before the 31st March, and as the Dáil is adjourning over next week, it would enable us, I think, to get through in the following week, so accordingly I move for permission to bring it in.</P>

      <P>Is it proposed to take the Estimates in this particular order in the paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in view of the time that we will be able to do that. If it gets near the time and they are not certain to be got through I would ask for preference for certain Estimates.  I beg to move: &ldquo;That an additional sum of £149,378 be granted for the year ending 31st March, 1923, for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works, for maintenance of drainage works on the River Shannon, and sundry grants-in-aid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public Works and Buildings.-The first one on the list is £149,000 for expenditure in respect of public buildings; No. 13.  The total originally in the Estimate for 1922-1923 was £510,176.  We find that an additional sum of £149,378 <Col N="2238" /> is required.  From this Vote payments are made in connection with buildings, purchase and upkeep, purchase of sites, and provision of furniture and fittings. The work is carried out by the Board of Works, and from the nature of events in the last six months it is obvious that very heavy charges, entirely unforeseenable when the estimate was framed, have been thrown on this Vote, which account for over half of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Purchase of Sites and Buildings £2,250.-The purchase of sites and buildings was estimated at £450, and the new Estimate, the revised Estimate, amounts to £2,250.  It was essential to obtain premises at Balbriggan and Cappoquin to house detachments of the Civic Guard, the old barracks having been destroyed there.  No suitable accommodation could be found which could be rented, and the only alternative was to purchase premises, for the payment of which provision is now taken.</P>
    <P>Annuities, £57,128.-The next item, AA No. 2, sub-head &ldquo;Annuities,&rdquo; there was no previous estimate and the sum inserted now is £57,128.  These payments were not included in the original estimate, as it had not then been arranged whether they would be paid by the Free State or not, but it has now been decided that they should be so paid, and provision is included accordingly. The payments are in respect of Capital Expenditure on public buildings for the Civil Service and the War Department in Ireland.  What happened in respect of these things was that usually when a site was bought a fund was opened, and liability came on the State in respect of that fund.  It is that liability now that we have got to shoulder, and the amount of it for the current year is £57,128.  I think that the building in Merrion Street is one of those concerned in that.</P>
    <P>New Works, £8,000.-In the New Works, Alterations and Additions, B of Sub-heads, the original Estimate was £78,981, and the revised Estimate is £86,981, the difference being £8,000, which has to be provided, in view of the establishment of the Irish Customs.  From the 1st prox., it is essential that a line of huts should be erected at suitable <Col N="2239" /> places along the frontier between the Free State and Northern Ireland.  The work has been put in hands, and it is estimated that it will cost about £16,000, of which £8,000 will fall to be paid in the current year.</P>
    <P>Fuel from Wolfhill Colleries, £12,000. &mdash;The next item is FF, Fuel from Wolfhill Colliery.  I think that Deputies generally are aware of the advisability of purchasing coal in the home markets where possible.  A contract has been entered into between the Board of Works and the Wolfhill Colliery for the supply of 20,000 tons of coal for Government use.  It has been agreed that £12,000 should be paid to the company as an advance in respect of the contract, and the coal to be supplied under this contract is now being delivered.  These additional supplies have been largely rendered necessary by the heavy demands for military and Civic Guard requirements.</P>
    <P>Military and Civic Guard Buildings, £70,000.&mdash;The next item is G, Military and Civic Guard Buildings.  The original Estimate was £250,000, and the revised Estimate now is £320,000.  In the earlier part of the current financial year the Army authorities placed their own orders for repairs, occupation, upkeep, and supplies of furniture, required for military purposes.  It has been decided that, as a matter of efficient and convenient administration, the Board of Works shall be responsible for these duties in future. And they are now engaged in checking in conjunction with the Army authorities, and, if approved, paying claims against the Army.  It was not possible to forsee this at the time the Estimate was framed, or that a total additional sum of £149,378 would be required.</P>

      <P>These estimates serve to emphasise the point that it is not fair to the Dáil that they should be asked within twelve hours, or at the most within twenty-four hours, of receiving these Estimates to enter upon a discussion on them and to pass them.  The promise of a week's recess does not compensate, I think, for the shortage of time and inability to consider the matters that are placed before us, and I again formally protest against the method of presenting and bringing up Estimates practically on <Col N="2240" /> the same day, and asking for votes for large sums of money in this way.  But on this particular Estimate I think it will be of interest to the Dáil and the public if the Minister would give us some information regarding the intention of the Ministry as to the future housing of the Government offices and the Dáil, and whether they consider that they are likely to remain in this building for any length of time in any circumstances, or whether they are proposing to make any change.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I said before that I admit altogether the case made by the Deputy in respect of the introduction of these Estimates.  It is certainly drawing a good deal upon the patience of the Dáil to introduce these Estimates at such short notice, but I think it will be accepted at once as being almost unavoidable.  These are cases in which we are at the end of our resources, and I think the Deputy himself must, perhaps, realise that the Ministry of Finance is very much now overloaded with work, so much so that I am sometimes two or three days behind in receiving reports from various Departments of the Ministry of Finance.  If I had a little more time it is possible that I would be abreast of them very soon, but I am sure that the situation will ease very considerably, and that Deputies will see an improvement after the first year. I would not say in the coming year, or at any rate the early part of it, that there is a likelihood of a very marked improvement. I do say that the complaint made by the Deputy is quite legitimate, and the wonder is that it was not made before this.  As regards the housing of the Government in these buildings, I have come to the conclusion, and it is borne out by many of my colleagues, that it is almost impossible to get along here owing to the congestion.  There are not a sufficient number of rooms available, and there is no room for Ministers except the one outside the lobby.  A good deal of the time of the Ministers is taken up by the number of &ldquo;ambushes&rdquo; they receive in the Government <Col N="2241" /> buildings everywhere as it is almost impossible to go to the corridors without somebody meeting one, and there are cases when if you are not &ldquo;in&rdquo; to the ordinary public you cannot get out because there is somebody outside who was informed that you were not in.  I hope to be able to give some further information before long on this matter.  There is a report, at present, in process of being compiled and I should say it would be possible early next month-perhaps the 2nd or 3rd week next month-to be able to put something before the Dáil with regard to that matter.</P>

      <P>There is one item, that is item G, in regard to which I think the Minister will appreciate the point I am about to make.  I am not now criticising either of the items there, or of the expenditure that will arise under other heads.  At the moment I am making no criticism upon the expenditure either in regard to the Army or the Civic Guard.  But it is desirable that the estimate should be brought up in a form to enable Deputies correctly to estimate the amount of expenditure required for the Army or Civic Guard.  As I understand all buildings and barracks are to be transferred from this specific estimate to Public Works and buildings, which is a more convenient method, I agree.  At the same time we lose sight of the total expenditure and what it may be on a future occasion if the estimates under G are divided into military and Civic Guard respectively, though I think that would be the more convenient method.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;that the supplementary estimate of £24,378 required in the year ending 31st March, 1923, for payments under the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc., and for other purposes connected with Irish Railways be adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> The original item for the Railways was £31,860 and it will be observed that there was an anticipated saving under sub-heads A and B in the original estimate.  This estimate now is in respect of £24,378, and it is in respect of the annuities payable to extinguish capital advanced under various Acts for the construction of railways and the provision of other means of communication, including the construction, repair and improvement of Marine Works, in the poorer districts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>From this expenditure the Buncrana and Carndonagh Railway, and Letterkenny and Burtonport Railway were constructed, and the Sligo and Belmullet Steamer service established. Marine Works have been carried out at several places in Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Clare and Cork, and in almost every important place except Dublin.</P>

      <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Railways,&rdquo; I would like to point out to the Minister that the service on the Cork, Blackrock and Passage railway has been held up for the last six months. The railway runs through a very large and important district, and for that very long period the people have been without a service.  I believe the Irregulars burst up a viaduct on the system, and burned practically every signal cabin from Cork to Crosshaven.  It is a matter of great surprise to the people that the Army did not try to prevent some of that destruction, but possibly the Army will be able to give a satisfactory explanation on the matter.  The damage and the destruction on the railway have been considerable, and all that large countryside is now practically without any railway service at all.  I think the Ministry for Industry and Commerce ought to get in touch with the Company, and find out exactly what they intend doing in regard to opening up service on the system in the near future.</P>

      <P>The increase in the Supplementary Estimates is, I think, self-explanatory.  At all events, the details of explanation given on the paper under item No. 3 are pretty full.  The items are all small, with the exception of two.  As regards the first item, for administration, half the amount is absorbed in the salary of the Minister, and I think it would not be appropriate for me to enter into a defence of that item at this stage.  The other principal item is the additional provision required to meet increased expenditure on salaries of teachers.  That item arose because when the additional provision was made at the beginning of the year&mdash;when the Estimates were prepared&mdash;it was impossible to forecast how provision for the increased salaries of teachers would work out.  The full effect of the new scale of salaries for teachers was not reached until the current financial year&mdash;that is to say, the full financial effect of it.  As to the full effect of it on education generally, I do not think it has been reached yet, or will be reached for some time to come; and I trust that the improved position of primary teachers, which is represented by this increase, will lead in the future&mdash; and in the early future&mdash;to another effect: that the increased expenditure on this particular item will be amply repaid in a benefit to the nation generally.</P>

      <P>As regards (i), the State Contribution bears a fixed ratio (.356) to the amounts realised from the sale of Unemployment Insurance Stamps.  The sale of these stamps has recently shown a substantial increase owing to the resumption on the part of a number of employers and particularly Local Authorities in the payment of contributions, and the increase of such contributions automatically increases the State contribution.</P>
      <P>As regards 2 the Insurance Act allows a sum not exceeding 12½ per cent. of the income of the Unemployment Fund to be appropriated in aid of the expenses of administering the scheme. When the original estimate was framed the amount in the Appropriations in Aid Sub-head was fixed on an estimate of the British Ministry of Labour on the income of the Fund.  This estimate has proved to be very much larger than the actual income and accordingly the sum available to meet the administration expenses has had to be reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>Under Sub-heads CC provision is taken for £150 towards the cost of the expenses of an Irish Exhibit at the Daily Mirror Fashion Fair in London in April and May next.  It is estimated that the total cost would be £1,000, of which £300 is being met by the Congested Districts Board, £400 by the Ministry of Agriculture and the balance by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, of which £150 will require to be paid in this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Sub-head FF, provision is included to meet half the cost subsequent <Col N="2247" /> to September last of the schemes for Training Unemployed Women in Home Craft Duties and for one-third of the cost of the schemes from June to September last.  The balance in each case is being borne by the Central Committee on Women's Training, London.</P>
    <P>The other two items are small in amount calling for no special comment, and are in respect of certain statutory payments hitherto falling on British Departments.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister who is in charge of Publicity to tell us whether the <i>Daily Mirror</i> has paid for the advertisement it is receiving in this publication of the Irish Government, and whether there is any justification for our subsidising this particularly undesirable newspaper and assisting it to circulate right through Ireland.  We know the sort of thing that they advertise in their own papers and the atmosphere they create amongst the buyers of the paper throughout this country.  It may be alleged, of course, that the intention behind this is to propagate Irish ideals amongst those who attend this particular Fashion Fair, but I think the advantage is all on the other side.  I certainly would like to have more information on this particular vote.  As we are in Committee, I may have an opportunity of speaking again on the subject.</P>

Now, we have certain manufactures here in this country which are not as widely availed of by other peoples as the Ministry of Industry and Commerce think they might be.  I am sure the Ministry, having at its disposal, in the first place, such an able Minister, and, in the second place, such a competent staff, is fairly capable of judging how far it might be possible to spread manufactures and other goods made in this country in other countries. It is a well-known axiom, I think, in business that one must advertise.  There are many articles manufactured in this country which are to some extent used in other countries.

In the title here is the &ldquo;supplementary estimate&rdquo;; and under the supplementary estimate one is led to infer that there is a Supplementary Estimate for the fees and expenses of the Consulting Engineer to the Government.

      <P>I take it that the meaning of the heading No. 1 is that it is a Supplementary Estimate of the amount required to pay all the items that are in that.  That estimate is supplementary to the esti mate that the Minister for Industry and Commerce presented and passed here some time ago, and some of those sub-heads at any rate will be found in the original estimate.  It is not necessary that all of them should be in the Supplementary Estimate, when the original Estimate covers all these heads. It is true that the particular heading, <Col N="2250" /> Consulting Engineer to the Government, does not appear in either Estimates. That is probably because the original estimate of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was one of those skeleton estimates of which we complained at the time that it did not set out all the details that it was supposed to cover.</P>

      <P>Does this item dealing with the training of women in home crafts cover the training of servants? Is the work of a domestic servant covered by this phrase, &ldquo;training in home craft duties&rdquo;?  I should wish to incorporate it.  I am afraid the public in the Saorstát is not aware that there are facilities at the disposal of unemployed women whereby they can become proficient in that most estimable of crafts. At the present time this is one of the great questions.  Political questions occupy the arena, and public attention is so fully occupied that this other actuality is sometimes forgotten.  There was a movement, as probably some Deputies know, inaugurated some two or three years ago, with a view to bringing domestic servants into a trades union, so as to secure betterment for them both as regards housing accommodation where they are employed and better wages.  The reaction of that was a demand of the Employers' Union to insist upon better training being afforded to the neophytes in domestic service.  Now it appears from this Supplementary Estimate that the Ministry of Trade and Commerce have set on foot this reformation to which society has been so long looking forward, and which is so eminently desirable.  It <Col N="2252" /> is a pity that the Ministry should do good by stealth.  I wish to give them an opportunity to blush on finding it fame. That is why I put the query, &ldquo;Is training in home crafts intended to include training for the purpose of domestic service?&rdquo; There ought to be centres for the purpose instituted in Ireland.  It should not be necessary to export our raw material to undergo training in London, and I suggest that that should occupy the attention of, say, the Assistant Minister for Labour in the coming months.</P>

These other sub-heads are merely explanatory, and they do not affect the motion.  I submit it is in order, and in accordance with the practice of that place from which these Estimates and the like have been copied, that a Vote or Supplementary Estimate does give the opportunity to raise any question within the purview of that Department. The point of order is as to whether the Vote that is proposed is touching Paragraph 1.  If so, I submit that it is in order for me to move a reduction of the amount by a given sum, and to explain why I desire that amount to be reduced.  I do not want to press the point of order now while the Ceann Comhairle is not in the Chair, but I want to raise the point now for security in future Votes.</P>

We are asked to vote a sum supplementary to the amount that was voted some time ago to defray the cost of the Army.  The proposal is that we should vote a sum of £267,000, additional to the sum which we voted on the last occasion.  The point I desire guidance upon is, whether a motion may be made to reduce this Supplementary Estimate by any given sum and on that motion can any matter under the purview of the Army Authorities be discussed? My submission is that the matter we are concerned with strictly is a Vote to increase the amount which has already been voted to defray the cost of the Army by £267,000, and that Sub-heads 2 and 3 are merely illustrative and explanatory and do not, as a matter of fact, affect the right of Deputies to discuss any questions of <Col N="2255" /> Army administration in as much as we are simply asked to vote a bulk sum additional to the amount which we have already voted in bulk.</P>

      <P>In discussing the Estimates originally it was open to Deputies to discuss any general question relating to the Department for which money was sought.  In a discussion on Supplementary Estimates, it seems to me, that the debate should be restricted to the particulars contained in the Supplementary Estimate for which the grants are sought and that a motion to reduce should refer to an item of expenditure under some particular heading which appears here. The discussion on the motion to reduce the particular item should then be restricted to that particular item.</P>

It might be possible, for example, that a Ministry in the future&mdash;I put it out of the question at present&mdash;could put forward some original Estimate in such a form and under such considered and carefully modulated terms and conditions as to finance, that it would not leave itself open to question at all, holding back all the matters that would leave the general question of administration and policy open to question, and bringing these into a Supplementary Estimate, and so escaping censure on the general question of policy altogether.</P>

      <P>I think I shall move for a reduction of expenditure on war-like stores by £100, not exactly on the ground you suggest, but on a different ground, the abuse by the <Col N="2257" /> Army, or rather by local commands in the Army, perhaps, of war-like stores&mdash; munitions, arms and so forth.  We hear frequently in Dublin a fairly long continued kind of bombardment&mdash;not so frequent now as it used to be&mdash;still frequent enough.  In the course of these bombardments it seems to ordinary plain civilians, at all events, that there is a great deal of expenditure of ammunition, so far as the public knows, the following day or the day after, with little or no result.  There may be an explanation of that and it may be that ammunition is not being wasted, but as a matter of fact a regular tattoo over a district of the city may be worth while in order to bluff off some irregular who intends to have a pot at some of the Army posts.  It requires explanation. There are other instances, and I have one which came to my knowledge to-day, and that is the abuse of arms by soldiers presumably acting under the orders of a military officer, in entering and removing, by virtue of their possession of arms and ammunition, of certain private property to which they were not entitled.  I shall give the Minister details of the case.  I refer to a raid that took place on the 7th instant on the office of Mr. Coffey, Solicitor, Dundalk.  He happened to have been instructed by the parents of two young men who are minors and who are about to be tried on a charge of murder, to appear on their behalf. Three soldiers entered this gentleman's office.  I do not know Mr. Coffey personally; I know nothing of his politics, and in fact I know nothing about him. That, however, does not arise.  The soldiers removed a typewriter and a copy of depositions made at the inquest. The depositions were furnished to Mr. Coffey by the Coroner, I believe. Included in them was the evidence given by a soldier at the inquest, evidence on which a verdict implicating these two young men was returned by the jury.  The abuse of arms comes up in rather a grave form, because I am told one of the three soldiers who participated in the raid and removed the documents which were needed by the Solicitor for the purposes of defence, was the very soldier who gave evidence at the inquest.  I will not pursue that further, but where such things can happen <Col N="2258" /> I think there is abuse of war-like stores that are under the direction of the Army.  I formally move the reduction of £100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the the proposal put forward by Deputy O'Shannon.  In supporting it, let me say that when we realise, or try to realise, that soldiers of the National Army have been executed for having made abuse of ammunition and arms such as we are now asked to vote away another huge sum for, we can easily conclude there has been something lacking, and there have been some loopholes in regard to this whole question of arms and ammunition.  I quite agree there have been very serious difficulties met with in the setting up of the Free State Army.  In any ordinary, well-disciplined army the protection of arms and ammunition in any depot or barracks is a matter that has always received the serious attention of the Commanding Officers.  We know that in the British Army any soldier or officer who was unable to account for arms or ammunition that were in his charge was dealt with in a very drastic way.  Some short time ago, when I was down the country, a complaint was made to me by respectable people, who are supporters of the present Government, of certain things that had been happening in that area.  I was given particulars about the misconduct of soldiers, and was informed of how a certain officer, supposedly through lack of opportunities from an irregular point of view, arranged to divide the men under his control into two sections, and on a certain night a sham battle took place.  The affair was reported in the papers, and was put down as an attack by irregulars on the troops.  My information about the division of the troops and the sham battle is reliable.  You will all agree that a good deal of ammunition was uselessly expended on that occasion. I am not quite sure if I am correct in saying that the officer has since been removed and dealt with in connection with the particular incident to which I referred.  That is one instance&mdash;one of many&mdash;where there appears to be no supervision over the use of ammunition or arms.  In no carping spirit do I put it to the Minister that this is one of the most important things that he and the <Col N="2259" /> Army Council should concern themselves with when considering the question of the Army administration as a whole.  If there was proper supervision over arms and ammunition, it would not be possible for soldiers of the National Army to be executed for treachery, and it would not be possible for arms and ammunition to be put into the hands of people who are against the Government&mdash;arms and ammunition that have to be paid for by the people as a whole.  In a recent interview, when his attention was drawn to the subject of night-firing in Dublin, the Minister for Home Affairs said that any fool could go into a back yard and pop at the sky, or something to that effect.  If that is the actual position, and if any fool can go into a back yard and start popping at random, and not directly at any barracks, it is not necessary for the soldiers in the nearest barracks to expend thousands of rounds of ammunition in dealing with an individual of that kind, whom they cannot see or locate.  When the Irish people realise that it is they who will have to pay for the expenditure of ammunition and for the use of arms&mdash;and some of the ammunition is being squandered&mdash;they will wake up and do all they can to detect and prevent things of this nature occurring. This is one of the most important things that needs looking after.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the last few speakers in the statements they have made indicating that there has been a lot of ammunition wasted.  It is hardly fair to be asking for more money to replace ammunition that is uselessly expended.  Nobody objects to ammunition being expended if it is expended for a purpose.  There are a couple of instances of wasteful expenditure I would like to draw attention to.  Some three Sundays ago I was in Macroom, when five or six lorries of troops passed through on the way to Cork.  While passing the local military barracks they saluted the troops there by firing off all the ammunition they had in their rifles.  There were deafening volleys of shots for about ten or fifteen minutes.  It was scarcely necessary for them to demonstrate their joy passing the local troops in such an expensive manner as that.  Some time in November last one of the officers commanding <Col N="2260" /> troops in Cork got married, and he was going to England on his honeymoon. I, with a number of others, happened to be on the boat with the newly-married couple.  A large body of troops came to see the party away.  They were accompanied by a whippet, lorries, and machine guns, and they celebrated the departure by firing off three thousand rounds of ammunition.  Some people say there were fully ten thousand rounds wasted.  Women and children along the quays were alarmed, and they sought shelter.  They did not know what was the matter, the shooting came so suddenly. The firing lasted fully half an hour.  The affair had a dangerous aspect in this way: Some soldiers on the boat came to the conclusion that a Mauser was being used by an Irregular who was taking advantage of the uproar to have a pot at them, and some of them got down on the deck and fired in the direction of Montenotte.  There was a possibility that some person there might be shot, and that would be more serious than the waste of ammunition.  I think those few instances alone would justify us in voting against giving more money for warlike material to men who do not appear to have any control over ammunition or arms given to them.</P>

Some time ago representations were made to the Ministry respecting many faults of the administration, in the method of giving out contracts, and we were assured that there had been set up a Contract Committee to regulate the giving out of contracts with a view to economy and efficiency. I would like the Dáil to be apprised as to whether that Contract Committee is working satisfactorily, and whether there have been any complaints recently of a serious character, whether the complaints are reducing in number, and whether the people responsible for the faults in the earlier stages have less responsibility now than they had previously for the giving out of those contracts. Perhaps if we had more time we could have stated more specific cases, but I am dealing with the matter in a general way.  I invite somebody, on behalf of the Army, to reassure us that the faults of the administration in respect of the giving away of contracts for Army supplies, war-like stores, etc., have been remedied.</P>

If it does, they will be able to carry out the views of Deputy Cathal O'Shannon when he says he does not see enough results.

I think, in view of the remarkably large number of accidents or alleged accidents that have happened to the members of the National Army that this is a matter that should be looked into immediately.  Of course, it might not be possible to prevent it five or six months ago, but at the moment, when you have such a large Army, you can certainly allow time to train those men and boys who take up rifles and know nothing about them.</P>

      <P>In the matter of making full and proper use of our stores, and not allowing waste, it would be of more assistance to me in my duty of doing that if Deputies of this Dáil coming from places around the country in which sham battles and such exhibitions as are alleged to have taken place in Cork occur, would, at the date that those things happen, write down the facts and submit a statement addressed to the Minister for Defence for our information. That being done at the time of the noticing of any of those occurrences would be much more profitable from my point of view and from the public point of view, and would be more in keeping with the responsibilities that the individual <Col N="2263" /> members of this Dáil have to help the Government generally.  If persons who have neglected to do that care to suggest that a certain amount of ammunition or rifles should be taken out of the Army's hands because an irregularity has taken place in the raiding of a solicitor's office some place, or because an alleged excessive amount of firing is supposed to take place at night in Dublin, they are welcome to do so.  Some of the imagination that has been used on some of these things might be more profitably used in considering other aspects of the Army's work.</P>

Whether there be any by-products of activity on the line of dependents' allowances, or motor car payments, or bill payments of other kinds, it is for the Dáil to say, but these different matters are being satisfactorily dealt with.  I deny that there is at the present moment, or has been for some time past, anything that could be called an excessive amount of expenditure amongst the troops from the use of firearms.  On the question of contracts, a Contracts Committee was set up by the Government.  As far as the Army is concerned, these purchases are not being made through the Contracts Committee.  They are purchases of a type that it is more economical in every way to deal with the British Government as an agent for them, and we have used the British War Office as an agent for the purchasing of these vessels and the stores here.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say that the Minister was rather displeased, according to the wording of his reply, that some of the Deputies do not take advantage of sending him information on questions of fact rather than raising such matters in the Dáil.  Personally I have tried to do that as far as possible, but when one has to face the fact, and wait for an explanation some time or another, and is continually receiving requests to repeat what he has sent in connection with the matter, I take it that is not a satisfactory way of drawing his attention to it personally. I take it also that when any individual member of the Dáil draws the attention of a Colonel, who is a responsible officer in the Army Council, to certain matters that it is the duty of that Colonel to convey such complaints if he thinks fit, to the Commander-in-Chief. On one or two occasions I sent in complaints that I regarded as of a very serious nature, and in one particular instance the aggrieved parties were prepared to come and swear as to the reliability of the evidence they were giving me.  I was subsequently definitely informed that the charges in this particular <Col N="2265" /> instance were incorrect.  When one is faced with a position of that kind one feels that little satisfaction is to be gained by taking the matter up with a Colonel of the Army, or even the Commander-in-Chief himself.</P>

I happen to live in a seaside resort where there are a considerable number of complaints from men who have served, and served well, in the Republican Army during the troubled times.  I have not any particular individual in mind now, but there are complaints that men there are getting no look in whatsoever with regard to appointments on these particular vessels.  I suggest to the Minister that for any new vessels that may be acquired consideration, where individuals have the qualifications, should be given to men who have done very good and useful service <Col N="2266" /> during the Anglo-Irish war.  I submit that suggestion because of the number of complaints that I have received in an area that I do not represent.</P>

If there are any particular people who think that they have a claim to be considered in the recruiting of these crews because of past services, I would be very glad to have a statement of their claims sent to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question I think it well to say that the suggestion made by Deputy Davin is not in regard to particular people, and it is not our desire to put forward the names of particular people as suitable for crews, but rather that localities which are inhabited by men who have experience of the sea and the kind of service that is required, should have some consideration in the appointment of crews.  The claim that we put forward&mdash;and I am sure that every member on these Benches will agree&mdash;is that there should be some distribution of patronage&mdash;if it is to be called patronage; at least that the crews shall be drawn from different areas, and not confined to one or two places.  Certain representations have been made to the Minister in this regard, and I am sure they are being considered and attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to draw attention, under the head of this Supplementary Vote, to the question of the suspension of sorting on Cross-channel mail packets.  What I wish to point out to the President and to the members of the Government is that I think it is false economy for the Government to try to affect a temporary saving on matters of this kind at a time when conditions are abnormal in the country; when trade is at its very lowest point.  You will find that later on, when conditions become normal, when we endeavour to develop the trade of the country, that actions of this kind will re-act upon the Free State.  I understand that the suspension of the day service on the Cross-channel Packet means that sorting work which was done by the Irish staffs in the Post Office Department of the Irish Free State is now, in most cases, being transferred to the English sorting staff, with the result that there will be an increase in the duties and in the number of men employed in the English Postal Service, and a reduction possibly, at some time, if not now, in the staff of the Irish Post Office.  I think it is a bad thing for the <Col N="2269" /> Irish Free State Government to do anything that will mean a reduction in the number of men employed in the Department, and throw men on to the State by causing unemployment, and, at the same time, by doing so to increase the number of men employed in the Postal Service in England.  I notice from a Press report&mdash;and that is the only information that I have on the matter&mdash;that it is contemplated to suspend the Sorting Service on the night boat on the 31st May or afterwards.  Now, when we realise that actions of this kind are more likely to assist the Six County Government by transferring to the Northern area, through the Larne and Stranraer route, correspondence which will help trade in that area, and which will re-act upon trade in the Free State area, I think that the Minister will realise the seriousness of the step taken and the step contemplated.  I hope the Executive Council will consider matters of this kind, not from conditions that prevail at the moment, but as to what effect such actions will have upon the future of the Free State.  One would think that we had a great sum of money for all these services.  This service costs £2,859,000, and although we get back revenue to the extent of £1,300,000 the loss to us on that service is £1,500,000.  Surely that is a very big sum to have to pay for this service.</P>

      <P>I see that sub-head H relates to incidental expenses and loss by default, accident, etc., and that to make good this, the sum of £12,000 was needed.  To the ordinary mind loss by default would mean default on the part of the servants of the Post Office.  I do not believe this increase of £12,000 is due to any such cause, and I do not think it is likely that mere accident either would increase the estimate by £12,000.  If this sub-head really deals with money taken or defaulted by people other than the servants of the Post Office itself I think it would be better, from a Departmental point of view and from the point of view of our Estimates, that it should be so stated and not covered up by an &ldquo;etc.&rdquo;  Therefore, I ask the Minister to tell us, and we have a right to know, whether this increase is due to any misconduct or negligence on the part of <Col N="2270" /> any Departmental officials, or whether it is due to wrongdoing by other persons not in the Post Office service.</P>

      <P>The loss suffered by the Post Office through raids on registered articles for the past twelve months approximates to a loss of £25,000.  We have been considering whether it would not be possible to discontinue the registration of letters and packets, but international regulations provide that there is no loophole and no means of escape. We have to accept, according to international regulations, registered articles for foreign countries, and we do not see much use in discriminating between home registration and foreign.  We realise that the country has suffered very heavily by accepting registration, and we only continued it after mature consideration. I assure the Dáil that we have gone into the matter more than once, and we feel we would not be justified in departing from the rule of accepting registered letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater parts of the items set out in this Estimate are due to Irregular activity.  I think Deputies should realise that a very heavy strain is cast upon the Post Office Department through the fight we are waging for the maintenance of the public service, and I desire on this occasion to pay tribute, which is due from me, to the men of the service, who have maintained the Post Office service practically uninterruptedly during a time of very great strain, and without any accession of staff.  In connection with the Engineering Department, I would like the Dáil to understand that you cannot supplement a technical staff of that kind over night. It takes a considerable time to train a linesman or an engineer of any kind employed in the Post Office, and, notwithstanding <Col N="2271" /> that, we have not increased our engineering staff by any appreciable number&mdash;possibly not more than 5 per cent.&mdash;we have been able to maintain the service, which is appreciated very generally by the community.  Not only had we to fight the Irregulars in this particular case, but we had to meet very serious demands on the part of the public and the Government in relation to barracks and matters of that kind.  At any rate, this Estimate refers largely to expenditure incurred through unexpected demands on our service through the Irregular fight.  You see an item here: &ldquo;Rent, office fittings.&rdquo; You know the reason. It is because offices were burned, and you go further down and you come to the item, &ldquo;Stores other than engineering materials.&rdquo;  These are stores which had to be provided because of the destruction, and some of that applies to engineering contract work and maintenance by Railway Companies.  We maintain the telegraph communication for the Railway Companies and it has been a very strong point with the Irregulars to destroy these communications.  It is a kind of big magnet for attack.  Then you come to the item &ldquo;Superannuation and other non-effective charges.&rdquo;  Under Article 10 of the Treaty a large number of our men are leaving the service, and we have no alternative owing to that but to provide certain bonuses.  The sum of £19,800 is included in this item. There is only one item that perhaps requires explanation and that item is for £44,000, which is the biggest item in the Estimate.  I must say I am not perfectly satisfied myself that the Post Office should meet this item of £44,000. It has been dumped over on us to meet annuities created under the Telegraph Act, which provides for the installation of a telephone service and telegraph service extending back to the date when the Post Office took over the telephone service.  Now if the British Post Office had provided new materials in this country I would have no cause to quarrel with this item of £44,000, and I think it would be only reasonable that we should accept responsibility for it, but on the other hand we have got a lot of scrap material and we are faced at the present time with the introduction of new <Col N="2272" /> materials to replace this, and I do not think we would be justified in continuing to pay any annuities whatever for any such material handed over to us by England. This arrangement is only temporary, I am led to understand, and if it were to be continued I feel we would be justified in quarrelling with it for the reason that we are forced to scrap practically all that material and replace it by modern instruments, and I do not think we could regard the £44,000 as a continuing item in our expenditure.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That a sum of £11,033 be granted for the year ending 31st March, 1923, for the salaries and expenses of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  This is not a Supplementary Estimate at all.  It is an original one, and explains itself.  At the time the original Estimates were before Dáil Eireann, the Seanad had not been constituted, and the allowances and expenses to Senators, and of the staff of the Seanad, have hitherto been provided out of the Vote for additional and unforeseen services.  Opportunity is now taken of making provision for expenditure incurred in this service in a separate Estimate, and the Vote for additional and unforeseen services will be recouped the amount already expended.</P>

      <P>I want to draw attention to this Vote.  I see here that the Clerk of the Seanad is drawing £1,000 a year, the Assistant Clerk £700, and the Second Assistant Clerk £500, and the reporting staff is put down at £800.  I do not think the Dáil has as large a staff as that, and I suppose we do seven times as much work as they do in the Seanad.  I do not see what a Second Assistant Clerk is needed for, or why such an appointment was made.  I move that the Vote be reduced by £500, the amount of the salary paid to the Second Assistant Clerk.  In my opinion, it is more or less a public scandal to be paying away money in such a fashion.  I think the place is overstaffed doing nothing.</P>

      <P>Then, if Deputy Gorey is not moving it, I propose to move a reduction of £200 in the salary of the Head Clerk and £100 reduction in the salary of the Second Clerk, and that the £300 be added to the messengers' wages in order to give them a chance of living. (Laughter.)  You may laugh if you like; we have been told here that in the English House these positions were given to pensioners.  While I am on these Estimates I say it is a very huge expenditure of money, and when we look upon the Seanad, as the majority of the <Col N="2276" /> people of the country do look upon it, as the Lower House, I think it is too much. I think I heard the Minister for Finance say here that he had nominated thirty of the wealthiest gentlemen in Ireland; and we find that before some of these wealthy gentlemen took their seats in the Seanad they sent on a communication to know whether they would be paid their expenses, and also be allowed a salary while sitting in the Seanad.  I think if these wealthy men were nominated by the President, surely to goodness the least they could do would be to save the ratepayers and taxpayers of the country this £30 a month which they receive the same as the Deputies nominated and selected by the people.  Furthermore, I see here that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad has the very identical salary as the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  Now I think that is absolutely ridiculous when you take into account that that particular gentleman has about £3,500 a year pension as well from a foreign Government. Then we find that the Leas-Cathaoirleach has £1,000 a year, the same as Deputy O Maille has here, a man who has fought and suffered for his country.  Now I think that these things should be taken into account, and I think it is possible to have a reduction in this Estimate.  I put forward a plea and ask every Deputy in this Dáil to give justice where justice is deserving. There is no justice whatever in giving the same salary to those gentlemen of the Seanad as are given to the gentlemen who have the honour of acting here in the first Parliament of the Irish people&mdash;the men who fought to get us the freedom which we have come to enjoy.  I did not say anything concerning the other Estimates, because I knew in my heart and soul that these were required, and I am perfectly well aware this Estimate could be reduced by thousands.  I think we should make the reduction here and now.  If we do, the people will have less to pay for the destruction and the trouble in the country.</P>

The Dáil will recollect that a resolution was passed here, on, I think, the 19th January, requesting the Seanad to send certain Senators to meet the President and myself to discuss the question of staffs.  A meeting was held, at which I was present, and with the findings of which the President, as Minister for Finance, concurred.  It provided that, with the exception of the Clerk, and two Assistant Clerks in the Seanad, the general staff was to be an Oireachtas staff.  That clearly makes for economy.  It provided also that the Clerk of the Dáil should be regarded as the senior.  It will further be necessary, I think, that that Committee, or some similar Committee, should consider the whole position of the staffs of both the Dáil and Seanad.  A report on that question will eventually have to be laid before the Dáil dealing with the question of the staffs of the Oireachtas, so far as they concern ourselves. The matters in this Estimate will, therefore, eventually have to come under review, if the President agrees with my view of the matter.</P>

The question that has been raised in regard to the working staffs of the Oireachtas will, I hope, be considered by such a body as the Ceann Comhairle suggested, which might report to the Oireachtas as to the duties and responsibilities and the remuneration that should be paid.  From what I have been able to see, we are all ashamed of the information that is divulged in these Estimates, which show that the staffs&mdash;the staffs at the lower end&mdash;are paid so badly.  I hope that the staffs at the disposal of the members of the Oireachtas will be considered when the Estimates are being presented within a few days, and that provision will be made for a considerable improvement in the salaries of these staffs.</P>

Now there is no reference made to stationery supplies.  That, I presume, is because the cost of stationery forms portion of the Estimate for the Stationery Office.  I wonder would it be in order to raise a question which I brought under the notice recently of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that, so far as one may judge from the type of stationery, more particularly the envelopes, supplied in the other House, it is not of Irish manufacture.

I think that it is as well to say now that the people of Saorstát Eireann will, I am convinced, as soon as they realise that the attack upon the economic life of the country, the attack upon the communications of the country, the attack upon the general material structure, is designed to bring about a chaotic condition of affairs and political ineptitude&mdash;as soon as they realise that, they will do now as they were prepared to do two years ago, throw in every particle and every item of their economic, industrial and material resources to save the State.  I believe it is true to say that a large section of those who are inspiring the Irregular campaign hold that by a sufficient attack upon the material resources the State cannot maintain itself.  Yesterday and to-day we touched upon the Bill in favour of building a memorial to Arthur Griffith.  I want to say in respect of that that my sharpest and pleasantest memory of Arthur Griffith is that on one occasion, when everything was black, <Col N="2280" /> and there was a likelihood of an absolute smash of the railway system in this country, and when proposals were put to him, having in view that in every area in the country there should be set up a small local governmental institution which would take control of the economic resources of that area and invite all those living in that area to throw in all their resources into a common pool to maintain the stability of the State as they knew it, that he was lavish in his approval of such a proposal and encouraged the idea to the fullest extent.  That, I believe, will be repeated by the people of the State if they became possessed of the thought that the present attack is, in reality, an attack upon the social fabric itself.  I am moved to make these remarks because I think that sufficient attention has not been paid, sufficient understanding has not been given to the contentions of one of the leaders of the party in opposition to this State, when she threatened, or when she advocated and justified her advocacy by saying that the people will have to put up with duress to make them stay out; that as an immoral duress was imposed upon them which they accepted, a counter duress would have to be applied to make them stay out.  I believe the more thoughtful of the followers of that lady, while they may have, or pretend to have, a certain contempt for the mass of the people for accepting the Treaty, would have infinitely more contempt for the same people if they were prepared to abide by the duress imposed by a section of the people within the State.  I think it well to say that in the opinion of the Dáil, in the opinion of those of us on those benches, at any rate, and, I am sure, in the opinion of the Dáil as a whole, the attempt to break up the social fabric, once it is seized upon by the people, will mean that, at any cost and at any sacrifice, the country will rally to the defence of the State.  It is, as a matter of fact, because there is not that understanding, not that realisation that the present attack is more than a political move; that it is not realised that the attack is an attack upon the social fabric, the very idea behind society, that the present conditions have prevailed. I think it well to send it out from the Dáil that despite any increase in Estimates <Col N="2281" /> that may be called for, even though it is an increase multiplied one hundred times, even though the private resources of the people are going to be brought to nothing, still for the sake of maintaining society in this country the opposition to society must be resisted and overthrown.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I appreciate very greatly indeed the speech that has just fallen from the lips of the leader of the Opposition, if we might so call Deputy Johnson. This is an occasion upon which a statement of that sort, coming from a man occupying the position he does, a position of great trust and of great confidence in the minds of all those of the Labour movement that he represents, is something that is really needed.  We realise that during the last few years the people whom he represents contributed in a very marked and very patriotic degree to the continuance of the struggle which was maintained here in order that the people of this country might live and see what we have witnessed here for the last twelve or thirteen months, that is, the freedom and the liberty and the exercise of independence that we have got.  There has not been since this Dáil met, I think, any time whatever wasted in political harangues or political speeches.  The Dáil, to its credit, has got down to business and has done its business, giving a generous and a cordial consideration to every section that composes it.  In that connection I think this assembly deserved to be ranked with some of the best assemblies that ever met in this country during its whole history.  During the last 4, 5 or 6 years that the struggle has gone on in this country the mainstay of the opposition to oppression has been that that oppression was of a character that was unchristian, and was immoral.  We held, and held rightly, that foreign oppression in this country had got to be stopped, and we held that every law that was passed in order to strengthen it, and every new ordinance that was passed, and every new act of a coercive nature to cripple or interfere with the liberty of our people, was something that it was the duty of every man who had any civic courage to withstand. During that period every section of the people of this country, even those <Col N="2282" /> who in the ordinary way would send here men like Deputy Fitzgibbon, Deputy Alton, Deputy Thrift, and Deputy Sir James Craig, came with us in that contest because they would not stand for any of the immoral acts that were being perpetrated in the name of civilisation by those who were restricting our liberties and interfering with our manner of discharging our duties to the public.  During that period we had to withstand, as I explained here during the week, attempts to seize money which was to provide water for the citizens of this country, to cleanse sewers, to clean the streets, and maintain the public health services.  And what do we find now?  That those who are posturing as Republicans are breaking up waterworks, are interfering with railways, and doing these things in a far worse manner, and to a far greater extent, than ever those who came here to oppress this country did.  It is wise, and it is good, that at this moment Deputy Johnson should raise this question here and exhort the people of the country to put their hearts into the struggle to crush these vampires who are at present endeavouring to suck the life-blood of this nation. Every effort we have made to meet these men, every step that we took to meet them, has been one they plotted we should make, and that they should turn to their advantage.  Day after day we read in captured correspondence from them indications that it is impossible to plumb the depths of infamy to which they have sunk.  In one page you will read, from a lady: &ldquo;It is a pity our boys were not there to blow them to hell,&rdquo; and in the next page you will read a prayer.  That is the sort of mentality of people who have been driven mad by their pride and by their political nonsense. Those who are posturing as Republicans are now tied to the tails of a few old women, who say to them, as the savages tell their young men: &ldquo;Blood your spears; that is the way to show your patriotism.&rdquo;  For five or six years the Continent of Europe rocked with armed men, and every nation spent its treasure and spent its blood to maintain its position in the world.  We are just faced with the same position here, and we are prepared to spend every copper in our Treasury, to mortgage ourselves up to the hilt, and to spill the best blood of our <Col N="2283" /> country in order to stamp out this, the worst sort of oppression that was ever attempted in any country.  I believe we have the people of the country behind us, and it is for us, as the Government of the people, to carry it out.  We, on behalf of the Government, are willing to do it, and we welcome the statement of Deputy Johnson, who was speaking for his party. He has drawn the people's attention to <Col N="2284" /> the fact that this is not a war of politics, but a war to maintain the right of common society to its own position in the nation.</P>
