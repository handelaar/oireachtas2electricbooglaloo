      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, in view of the forthcoming Civil Service Commission Bill, what consideration, if any, is to be given men at present holding temporary clerical appointments, who repeatedly volunteered <Col N="1290" /> for service with the Army, but whose applications were turned down on the ground that their enlistment would lead to a dislocation of the public services, and who were requested to remain where their services were most needed; whether such men will be granted facilities in examination similar to those on active service, or will they be absorbed on the establishment of their respective departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>LIAM de ROISTE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that foreign slates are being used on houses under Housing Schemes throughout the country; that there are large stocks of Irish slates available, that the workers in Irish slate quarries are working only part time, and that while Irish slates are being so little used in Ireland they are being exported to France.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have been obliged to use imported slates owing to the inability of Irish Slate Companies to supply in sufficient quantities and sizes within reasonable periods.  The use of imported slates is not approved of, in any case, until it is definitely shown that suitable slates from Irish quarries are not available or likely to be forthcoming as and when required.</P>

      <NameTxt>DOMHNALL O CEALLACHAIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Goods Classification now in use on railways throughout the Saorstát results <Col N="1291" /> in a number of cases in goods being classed far and away above their value, as, for instance, in the case of common clay pipes, charged at the same value as more valuable ware; and whether he will have the proper value placed on these goods&mdash;viz., 5 per cent. above Class C.</P>

      <NameTxt>The POSTMASTER-GENERAL (Mr. J.J. Walsh) replying for Minister for Industry and Commerce</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of the goods is not the only factor determining their classification for the purpose of railway rates.  Other factors such as bulk and liability to damage in transit are taken into account.</P>
      <P>The rates on clay pipes are a matter which has already been taken up with the railway companies, who are not prepared to reduce the present classification but will consider applications for the grant of special rates at the places between which the traffic actually passes. I have no present power to compel reductions in the classification of specific articles, but the whole question of the future arrangement of railway rates will arise on the re-organisation of the railways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to ask the leave of the Dáil for the introduction of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923.  There are some words that could be said about the matter at this particular stage, without going into any discussion.  I find myself at a time when it is possible for me to introduce this Bill, and at a time also when I am forced to realise that there will not be sufficient time before the dissolution of the present Dáil to give <Col N="1296" /> sufficient consideration to a Bill of such length as this Defence Force (Temporary Provisions) Bill is, and a Bill of such importance.  I am between that situation on the one side, and the situation on the other that it is absolutely necessary for us to have legalised at once the position of the Army.  We have an Army at the present moment that only the necessity of the situation justifies or legalises us in having, and we are disciplining it under a code of regulations that only the necessity of the present situation warrants us in putting into force.  Actual justification for the maintenance of the Army, as it existed up to the present, and as it exists now, has been the necessity. The most legal sanction for its maintenance and its action has been the state of war which is now coming to a close.  With the approach of normal conditions, the accomplishment of the entire submission of the Army to the civil power has to be regulated in a proper manner, and all powers to establish, maintain, organise, discipline and control the Defence Forces must be sought from the Oireachtas in the ordinary way. I have, therefore, considered the matter to see how we had best meet the situation and I have framed the Bill to be a Temporary Bill, the intention being that the Oireachtas would be asked to pass the Bill as it stands, as a temporary measure, to run for, say, a period of twelve months, when actually the Bill or a Bill on these lines could be introduced either immediately that the new Dáil comes together, or preferably in my opinion, it might be left until the beginning of next year, when the present Bill, if it were passed by the Oireachtas, would have been in operation for a short time.  You would have plenty of opportunity to see the likely effect of the Bill in different directions, and we could approach the discussion of the Army Bill in the beginning of next year with sufficient time at our disposal to give it the thorough discussion it is due it would get.  From the point of view of the necessity of covering the existence of the Army at the present time and of disciplining the Army in a proper way, we are faced with the fact that if there were rather a condition of things in the country in a week or two, which cannot be held to be a state of war, we have practically no means of controlling the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five articles in the Constitution <Col N="1297" /> which deal expressly with the matter.  Article 45 provides that the Oireachtas has the exclusive right to regulate the raising and maintaining of armed forces, and that every such force shall be subject to its control.  Article 6 provides that no person shall be deprived of his liberty save in accordance with law.  Article 7 provides that no person shall be tried save in due course of law, and that extraordinary Courts shall not be established, save only such military tribunals as may be authorised by law for dealing with military offenders against military law.  Article 71 provides that a member of the defence forces not on active service shall not be tried by any courtmartial for an offence cognisable by the Civil Courts unless such offence shall have been brought within the jurisdiction of courtsmartial by any Code of Laws or Regulations for the enforcement of discipline which may hereafter be approved of by the Oireachtas.  Article 72 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge without a jury save <i>inter alia</i> in the case of charges against military law triable by courtmartial.  The consequences of these articles of the Constitution mean that if we have not an Army Act on the lines outlined in the Bill now put before the Dáil, and if the state of war passes, officers would have no authority over their men; the men need not obey their orders unless they choose to; soldiers could desert at will without fear of consequences, and mutiny&mdash;the gravest of all military offences&mdash;would be something like a mere trade dispute or insubordination. Desertion would merely be a breach of contract.  So the necessity for putting ourselves in a legal position from the point of view, particularly, of disciplining the Army will be apparent. The Bill in its present form will introduce transitory provisions which will legalise the position of the present national forces as defence forces within the meaning of the Bill, and it will give power to the Minister for Defence to make orders, rules and regulations to implement the Bill to the extent that is necessary at the present time.</P>
    <P>The question will naturally arise in connection with a Bill, so long and detailed as this Bill is, that it would be more satisfactory, perhaps, to pass a short Bill giving general powers to the Ministry in the matter.  But when you <Col N="1298" /> come to consider that the general powers so given must of necessity be very wide, that they are likely to be the powers that are set out in the Bill, it is much more satisfactory, I think, for all concerned that we should set out the powers that we desire to have in a temporary Bill, so that in the meantime and before the permanent Bill is introduced there will be set out plainly in one particular document the powers that we would likely be asking or that a subsequent Government would likely be asking for controlling the establishment and the discipline of the Army.  I ask for permission to introduce a Bill that will deal with the matter of organising and disciplining the Army, dealing with certain matters that determine and define the relationship between the army and the civil powers and the civilian population. I ask for permission to do it at a time when we know that the fullest and deserved consideration cannot be given to the Bill, but to deal with it as a temporary measure.  I would be in a position, I think, to have the Bill circulated to-night, and I would like to ask if possible to have a Second Reading, say, on Thursday.</P>

      <P>I do not rise to oppose the introduction of the Bill, as I am one of those who, right from the beginning of the sitting of this Dáil, urged that some such Bill should be brought in, as it was absolutely necessary, and because the Army required something that would regularise its standing and the actions taken by it. We recognise the necessity of the Bill, particularly from the disciplinary point of view.  I think everybody in the Dáil will recognise its necessity from that point of view.  But I do think it is rather a big job at the tail end of the session. There must have been great difficulties in the way, as the Minister says, it is a long and detailed Bill, and it must have taken a long time in drafting.  At the same time I think the Minister ought to have seen to it that the Bill was brought in long ago, because it is not fair&mdash;even though it is only a temporary measure&mdash; that a long and detailed Bill, and one of such great importance, should be brought in now when we will not have the opportunities for examining it that would be desirable.  The Minister has <Col N="1299" /> given us some light on it, but I would plead for a little more.  Some of us have observed recently that there has been a tendency in the new Army, that was not observable in the old Army, of sharp distinction between certain sections, or rather classes perhaps, in the Army.  Now, that may be necessary for reasons of discipline.  I do not know, but I would like if the Minister would tell us what is his own conception of the position the Army should occupy.  In particular in the old Army, the old Volunteers and the old I.R.A., there was not the sharp distinction between the officer and private that there seems to be in the new Army. There are armies, the old caste armies, in which that distinction is very sharp. There are others in which it is not nearly so sharp.  I do not know, and we will not know, until we have the Bill before us, what the relationship will be in the new army.  I would like the Minister to give us his conception, and the conception of those who are advising him, as to the relationship that will exist between the people and the Army.  The Bill, as he says, is a temporary one.  So far so good.  But even as a temporary Bill it will certainly be a head-line for any more permanent Army Bill of the future, and for that reason I would like to protest again against the lateness in the Session at which it is introduced.  I suggest that the Minister might have been better advised if, instead of the long detailed Bill that he is bringing in, he brought in a shorter Bill&mdash;one on more general lines, and not for twelve months.  The Bill could be of such a nature as would get over the legal difficulties in the way for the time being, or for a few months, until another Parliament would have an opportunity of considering in full detail the regulations for the regular Army.</P>

      <P>I am not rising to oppose the introduction of this Bill, because it has been accepted, by myself at any rate, as a sound principle that Bills of this nature should receive their First Reading.  I think, however, that one ought to point out that we now get the first revision of information which was given to the Dáil so late as only a week ago.  A week ago, in answer to a question I put to him, the President stated that amongst the Bills it was intended to introduce was the Army Bill. We are now informed by the Minister <Col N="1300" /> for Defence that the Army Bill, which we were promised a week ago, is to be postponed, and that a temporary measure is to take its place.  I think we have a fairly good conception of the matters that would be covered by an Army Bill. In concluding this debate I think it might be for the service of the Dáil, if the Minister for Defence could state, a little more in detail the matters that it is intended to cover in this Bill.  I am not sure if I remember him correctly, but I do not remember that in his opening remarks he stated how long it is proposed this temporary measure is to continue.  I think he should state how long it is to continue, and I take this opportunity of saying that the shorter its term the better.  I would like to know the heads with which it proposes to deal and wherein it would differ from the Army Bill, towards the drafting of which, I take it considerable progress must necessarily have been made.</P>

      <P>My proposal would be that the temporary Bill would last for a period of twelve months, or until such time shorter than that period, as the Army Bill proper would be passed.  I quite appreciate the necessity of making the Bill, passed under the circumstances under which I anticipate this Bill will be passed, last only for a short time.  To make a Bill of this nature last for a short time means that you would have to hurry the introduction of your permanent Bill, and perhaps hurry the discussion of your permanent Bill. There is no reason why the permanent Bill should not be introduced immediately after the assembly of the new Parliament, except that you might like to wait for a short time, and see the actual effect in working of some of the provisions of the temporary Bill, and you might like to take a fairly long time to discuss the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the Dáil now is actually the Army Bill as it was drafted for putting forward as a permanent Bill, with simply the introduction of a clause making it a temporary one, and the introduction of certain clauses dealing with the Reserve which it was intended originally to deal with in a separate Bill. It was anticipated it would be necessary for us in the meantime to have certain authority in connection with that matter. There is also the addition of a certain number of clauses dealing with transitory <Col N="1301" /> provisions, making the Forces that we have at present a National Army; making them under this Bill as a Defence Force even though they have not been recruited and attested under conditions outlined in the Bill itself.  So, for all practical purposes, you have placed before you the Bill which we had intended to bring forward and have discussed as the permanent Army Bill.  I will refer briefly to the matters which, it is proposed, the Bill will deal with, because I anticipate the Bill will be in the hands of members to-morrow morning.</P>
    <P>Part I. deals with establishment, organisation, administration, appointments and conditions of service, military education, service in time of war, the power of making statutory rules and regulations, and special powers in relation to the defence of the State, in relation to the maintenance of barracks, and other buildings.</P>
    <P>Part II. deals with discipline.  It sets out various offences against military law, the nature and degree of punishment which can be awarded, arrest of offenders, the investigation of charges. The summary disposition of charges in the case of minor offences, the constitution and jurisdiction of courts-martial, and the general principles governing their procedure, confirmation of their findings and sentences, and the execution of sentences.  It deals with the pay of officers and soldiers and with the power to make deductions from, and forfeit, the same by way of punishment or to make good damage.  It deals with prisons and detention barracks, for military offenders, the enlistment of recruits, appointments to corps and transfer to Reserve, billeting and impressment of carriages and offences and legal penalties in respect of the same with regard to officers and soldiers and to police and civilians.</P>
    <P>Part III. deals with the establishment, control, training and discipline of the Reserve, the calling out of the Reserve on permanent service in case of National emergency or in aid locally of the Civil Power.</P>
    <P>Part IV. deals with the transitory provisions necessary to cover the period (probably of a couple of months duration) between the passing of the Bill and the actual establishment of the forces thereunder.  It legalises the National Forces as at present in existence, provides <Col N="1302" /> for the exercise of the Commander-in-Chief, and the administrative and executive powers by the Minister for Defence.  It continues the liability of officers and soldiers to serve in accordance with existing appointments and agreements.  It provides for the application of Part II. of the Bill (Discipline, Courts-Martial, etc.) to the National Forces as existing at present, and brings them into line with the provisions of the Constitution.  It, finally, gives power to the Minister for Defence to make orders, rules and regulations necessary to implement this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These are the matters which the different parts of the Bill will cover. On the general question of the relationship of officers to men and of the Army to the people, the Army in any country must be a kind of crystallisation of the people.  Naturally they will be the people's servants and they will be the instrument of the Oireachtas.  The relationship between officers and men of the Army in any country must be a kind of crystallisation of the common sense of the people, and I have no reason to think that the relationship between the officers and soldiers in the Irish Army in 1923 and 1924 will be materially different from the point of view of the matters that the Deputy probably has in his mind from the relationship that existed between the officers and men in the Irish Army in the years 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921 and 1922.  Time only must show that.  The nature of the people must essentially be the same in the latter years as in the previous years, and if that is so, my theory is the relationship between the officers of our Army and the soldiers cannot be changed in any way.</P>

      <P>On this question of the period to elapse between the First <Col N="1303" /> and Second Reading, the Minister hopes to have the Bill in the hands of Deputies to-morrow morning.  He told us it was a long, detailed Bill, dealing with very important questions.  The Standing Order, it will be borne in mind, says that when a Bill passes its First Stage, and has been circulated, four days' notice of motion must be given before its Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister's desire for urgency, and that he is coming to the Dáil to ask for privileges, but I would like to find out whether, having asked the Dáil for that consideration, the Government of which he is a member is prepared to give the Dáil the same consideration, or whether we are to be treated with the same kind of consideration that we had last week.  If it is the intention, generally, to treat the Dáil roughshod, as was done last week, then, I think, that the Standing Orders should be complied with, and that there should be no breach of them in these circumstances.  If there can be consideration given to the Dáil, as was done pretty generally for the last six or eight months, until the last fortnight or three weeks, then I do not think there need be any opposition to the suggestion of the Minister, but I think that we ought to have an assurance that there is going to be some kind of mutual consideration.</P>

I only ask the consideration of the Dáil to have an early Reading of this Bill, because circumstances are driving pretty roughly and pretty hard in the matter of time, I understand, at present.  I find it difficult to think that any section of the Dáil has really been roughly ridden on the part of the Ministry, except in circumstances in which the Ministry have been very much pressed and roughly ridden themselves.  I am prepared to accept a Reading of this Bill on any date that will enable us to get it through.  It is a matter which is really urgent, and which it is most important should get through before circumstances would lead up to the dissolution of this Dáil.  I think the Ministry generally would appreciate very much if Deputies would meet them to the extent of allowing the Bill to be read a Second Time on Thursday.</P>

      <P>I would press that someone rather than the Minister for Defence would meet Deputy Johnson in the spirit in which the Deputy has shown.  We are, of course, as the Minister points out, all subject to circumstances of time.  We recognise the limits of time, and everything like that. But there are other things that the Minister who has just spoken does not realise as Deputies in the Dáil do, and that is that certain things have been done without as much as five minutes notice.  We have no desire at all to obstruct the Minister by sticking very tightly to the Standing Orders if he wants a little ease in that matter, but there has not been the least sign on the part of the Ministry to show that the regrettable things that happened before will not happen again.</P>

      <P>If Deputies mean that we should take the Dáil into our confidence with regard to the measures which we are pressing for consideration, I have no objection whatever to that being done.  Most of my time for the last couple of days has been taken up endeavouring so to accommodate the Dáil that due consideration should be given to the measures that have been introduced, and at the same time not to put too much labour on members of the Dáil.  We, on this side, feel just as much as members on the other side what long sittings mean, and I am prepared at any time to go into the question of the consideration of the business to be disposed of if members are desirous of seeing me about that.  If that be what is meant, I am prepared to see Deputies at any time from to-morrow morning. Members of the Dáil know exactly what the state of the business is that is pressing, and what the matters are that we wish to have settled and disposed of in the Dáil, and so on.</P>

      <P>The position is that we are prepared to facilitate the passing of absolutely essential Bills, which do not raise controversial issues, with reasonable consideration within the hours fixed in the Standing Orders for the transaction of ordinary business.  If we are to be presented with controversial Bills, they will need to be considered, and considered very carefully, and they ought to be considered within the hours <Col N="1305" /> that have been found necessary during the last six or eight months for the consideration of Bills.  If it is proposed to suspend Standing Orders and to have all-night sittings, and if it is proposed to move Closure Resolutions and the like, then of course there is not going to be that mutual tolerance that Ministers seek.  There are limits to the physical capacity of members, and the Dáil is entitled to have an opportunity of considering Bills which it is putting its seal to.  If the Minister is intending to introduce Bills of moment that raise controversial issues, they require at least a reasonable amount of consideration, and that consideration ought to be given within the ordinary hours of sitting. If the Minister tells us that there is no intention to propose long sittings or Closure Resolutions or the like, then I, for one, am quite prepared to accommodate the Ministers in the matter of this proposed short-notice motion for Second Reading.</P>

If it is pointed out that some of it is of a controversial character, and Deputies take exception to its being dealt with, I am prepared to give every consideration to that view and to recommend it to the Executive Council.  I believe that there is an opportunity of finding accommodation in the matter.  I think that Deputies will realise that it is our wish that the same cordial and harmonious relations that existed since we met here should be continued to the end.  Members of the Executive Council are particularly anxious for that.  I believe we will be able to make some arrangement whereby we can meet members of the various parties and see if we cannot arrive at some accommodation.</P>

      <P>This Bill is certainly belated.  I imagine that the chief criticism to be directed at it is that these Courts with which it deals have been disbanded by the Executive Council and <Col N="1306" /> by the Provisional Government before it for the best part of a year now, and that there has been hardship on people who were litigants in those Courts, or had cases pending in those Courts, by reason of the fact that steps were not taken sooner for the proper winding up of their affairs.  One can only meet that criticism by pleading the necessity for a sense of proportion in times like those through which we have passed, and by pleading also certain practical difficulties that arose in endeavouring to compile the necessary data for the Winding Up Bill.</P>
      <P>You had through the country an improvised system of justice which was forged more as a weapon against the British administration in exceptional times and exceptional circumstances than as a definite system which would meet and answer the needs of normal times.  It might be well that we would briefly survey that system and the Courts which functioned within it.  Taking the lowest type of Court first, you had Parish Courts, having jurisdiction in their respective parishes for the hearing of small civil claims under £10 in value, petty criminal offences, taking evidence and returning serious offences for trial to Circuit Courts, cases arising out of cottier tenancies and monthly and weekly tenancies. Then there was the District Court or Constituency Court, having jurisdiction in the following class of cases:&mdash;Appeals from Parish Courts, civil claims from £10 to £100 in value, title cases and cases exceeding £100 in value or damage where no question of law arose, ejectments and actions hitherto brought to the County Courts. Then there was a special sitting of that District Court at which a Circuit Judge attended, and when that Court sat in special session with a Circuit Judge attending, its jurisdiction extended to criminal trials, civil claims not within the jurisdiction of the ordinary District Courts, equity cases and relief, such as <i>certiorari, mandamus, quo warranto</i>, and appeals from ordinary sittings of that Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court had unlimited jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases, and also heard appeals from the Circuit Sittings of the District Courts. There is one matter that would need to be stressed when surveying these Courts and their jurisdiction; that is, that no one of those Courts, from the Parish <Col N="1307" /> Court to the Supreme Court, was given jurisdiction by the Dáil in licensing matters. That jurisdiction was explicitly withheld.  It was the unanimous and emphatic view of members of the Dáil Cabinet at the time that it was inadvisable and unwise to attempt to assume jurisdiction in matters of that kind.  I mention that because when these Courts reappeared during the Truce period they were not as careful and not as pure in their administration as they were in their first youth and enthusiasm.  They gave in many places, or purported to give, certificates to people to deal in intoxicating liquor.  They had no such jurisdiction. It was specifically and explicitly withheld from them.  The only course open to my Department was to refuse absolutely, and in all cases, recognition of those certificates on the grounds that the Courts which professed to have power to give them were acting <i>ultra vires</i> in giving them.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Provisional Government was set up, and when the ordinary Courts, with their complete machinery, had been taken over by the Provisional Government, it was considered unnecessary to have any further duplication of judicial work, and accordingly the Dáil Courts were abolished and a Committee was set up by the Minister for Home Affairs in October last to deal with the outstanding business of those Courts. Deputies will remember the period of dual jurisdiction&mdash;or dual lack of jurisdiction, to be more accurate&mdash;and all the abuses that grew out of that period. People going into one Court and finding the weight of evidence against them moved into the rival Court for an injunction to stay the other party to the litigation from proceeding further with his case in the Court which seemed likely to decide against them.  That anomaly could only be ended in the way in which it was ended, by a frank recognition of the fact that all the official Courts and all the official machinery of justice in the country had passed definitely into the hands of a representative Executive responsible to the Irish people, through their elected representatives in the Dáil, and the hastily improvised Courts that had been set up through the country to tide over an exceptional period were abolished, and the official State Courts were adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The Committee which was set up in October last had considerable difficulty in collecting data throughout the country, but efforts have been made to collect, as far as possible, the records and accounts of the Dáil Courts, so as to facilitate litigants and claimants whose business remained unfinished, owing to the prevailing conditions.  Owing to the fact that a number of Court Registrars and clerks adopted a hostile attitude towards the Government, it has not been found possible to obtain complete returns. In February and March last, it will be remembered that notices were published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiuil&rdquo; and in the Dublin and provincial Press inviting parties whose decrees remained unexecuted at the date of the abolition, to forward particulars, with a view to having their decrees registered for subsequent enforcement. A special form of application was prepared and supplied to such parties for the purpose of having their decrees verified by affidavit.  The total number of applications received from solicitors and litigants for these forms amounts to 10,000, and about half of the forms so issued have been returned and duly verified.  The Ministry has made some progress already with the task of serving notices on the parties affected by these decrees, so as to give them an opportunity of lodging properly grounded objections, if any, to the enforcement of the decrees.  The District Registrars and the Parish Clerks have, furthermore, been circularised to lodge final accounts and statements, and, excluding the Six County Area, about half of the District Registrars and about a quarter of the Parish Clerks have carried out these instructions. It will be observed that the Bill is drafted so as to enable the Judicial Commissioners to enforce delivery of these accounts in all cases.  It is thought that very little definite objection will be urged to the Bill, and that the principal comment or criticism will be that it has been over-long delayed.  Deputies will notice that it provides for the appointment of one Judicial Commissioner and certain Assistant Commissioners, to deal with different classes of business; to deal, in the first instance, with cases that were pending in the Dáil Courts, and Appeals from enforcement of decrees given in the Dáil Courts.  The Assistant Commissioners may hear: &ldquo;Any application for the hearing and the termination of a <Col N="1309" /> proceeding which was pending in a Dáil Parish Court or a Dáil District Court, any application for the hearing and the termination of an Appeal from a Dáil Parish Court which was pending in a Dáil District Court when the authority of such Court was withdrawn; any appeal from a registered decree of a Dáil Parish Court or an ordinary sitting of a Dáil District Court; any interlocutory application in any of the above mentioned cases.&rdquo;  There will lie an appeal from any one of these Commissioners to the entire body.  It is proposed to set up a Registry in which all decrees of the Dáil Courts that have not been executed will be registered, and after inquiry, and in the event of no appeal being made to the Commissioners, these decrees so registered will be binding on the UnderSheriff in the same way as decrees given by the ordinary State Courts, and will be executed accordingly.  Certain sums have been due in connection with these courts and their operations which it has not been possible to pay, pending the passing of this Bill, and there are provisions in the Bill dealing with the financial aspect.  Section 20 defines the general powers of the Commissioners: &ldquo;For the purposes of this Act, the Commissioners shall have full power and jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters, whether of law or fact, which shall be duly brought before them under this Act, and shall not be subject to be restrained in the execution of their powers under this Act by the Order of any Court.  The Commissioners, with respect to the following matters&mdash;enforcing the attendance of witnesses, the examination of witnesses orally or by affidavit, and the production of deeds, books, papers and documents; and issuing any commission for the examination of witnesses; and punishing any persons refusing to give evidence or to produce documents, or guilty of contempt in the presence of the Commissioners or any of them sitting in open Court; shall have all such powers, rights, and privileges as are vested in the High Court for such or the like purposes, and all proceedings before the Commissioners shall in law be deemed to be judicial proceedings before a court of record.&rdquo;  Section 18 deals with the accounts of the Courts, and takes power to make payments which are found to be properly due.  &ldquo;Every person whose duty it was to receive or pay out monies <Col N="1310" /> in connection with any Dáil Court, or who came into possession of any monies for which he was accountable to a Dáil Court, shall within one month after the passing of this Act deliver to the Accountant a full and true account of all such monies, and pay to the Accountant for lodgment in the Dáil Courts Fund the balance appearing on such account to be still in his hands.  Every person who has in his possession any accounts relating to the receipt or payment of any monies for which such person or any other person was accountable to a Dáil Court, shall within one month after the passing of this Act deliver such accounts to the Accountant.&rdquo; Then there is provision for default in rendering such accounts.  The Committee which sat, and which was set up in October last, consisted of one of the judges of the Dáil Courts, Mr. James Creed Meredith; Mr. Nicholls, T.D., acted on that Committee also, and Mr. Goff, who is now a District Justice.  The Bill is based substantially on the recommendations of that Committee, and it is hoped that it will be found to cover all the business that is outstanding from the winding up of that improvised system of administering justice.  There have been cases, unfortunately, where people holding a decree of the Dáil Courts had judgments entered against them in the State Courts, and these judgments were acted upon.  There was no remedy for that situation short of the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  Steps were taken to put every possible obstacle in the way of that kind of thing happening.  Solicitors were written to and urged to stay the proceedings, and were warned that this Bill was being introduced.  I think we succeeded in keeping down the anomalies or hardships to a minimum pending the introduction of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a curious coincidence that the Bill for the burial of the Dáil Courts should be introduced twelve months to a day exactly after the panic decision of the Dáil to kill the Dáil Courts.  I dissented then, and I dissent now, from that decision, which I think was of little credit to the Executive, and I am sorry that this Bill does not propose that these Courts should be continued and perpetuated for certain purposes.  I dissent wholly from the view that we have anything to be <Col N="1311" /> ashamed of in the Dáil Courts.  I dissent from the view that they were incompetent, and I dissent from the view that they ought to be buried.  I was sorry, in listening to the Minister, to hear no tribute paid to the men who ran these Courts in the face of great difficulties because they were loyal to the Government of the day.  Men often, who could not take part in the armed conflict, but who wanted to co-operate as best they could, came forward at very considerable risk to themselves and to their businesses, and played a very fine part in getting these Courts going, and in administering them, and the country knows that it was extraordinary to see the justice and the skill with which people unversed in judicial matters managed these tribunals and the cases that came before them.  It was a very great tribute to the common-sense of the people, as well as to the courage of those people, and incidentally the setting up of these Courts, which effectively smashed the British machinery except here in Dublin&mdash;smashed it and rendered it utterly useless&mdash;was one of the things which did most outside Ireland to make our name respected and to show up the fact that the English occupation was usurpation.  It was a thing that had not been done in other countries. It was a striking thing, a great thing, and a thing of which we have a right to be proud.  The Minister told us that some of these Courts engaged in licensing cases, and that they had no right to do so.  Well, I have heard of one Court that dealt with a divorce case. When you have people who are not trained to this kind of thing administering the law, of course there will be mistakes and abuses, but it would have been more generous not to call attention to small matters of that kind, but rather to register the fact that these Courts were something we had reason to be proud of, and that they did their duty manfully and well.  Of course they made mistakes, but in every case where you had men qualified&mdash;I do not mean technically qualified, but qualified as business men and men of common-sense, and qualified as decent human beings trying to do their best&mdash;wherever you had men not acting under personal or small motives, you did have a very large measure of success in these Courts set up by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I suppose it is admitted&mdash;I hope it is admitted&mdash;that at least until the Treaty was signed the only lawful Courts in this country during the fight with England were the Dáil Courts.  The only lawful, legitimate Courts were the Dáil Courts; and in a country where law has naturally and properly been a matter for contempt and suspicion because it was administered against the people, it was something to have Courts which were the people's own, and it would have been worth a great deal to perpetuate a system of that kind in so far as it could be perpetuated in conjunction with the more technical machinery we have at hand, and which could easily have been perpetuated for matters of ordinary commercial disputes and any agricultural disputes which do not require a great deal of law, and which require mainly common-sense.  It would have gone a long way to make the people feel the law was their own. Therefore I regret this Bill, designed as it is to abolish the last vestige of these Courts.  The Dáil is aware that during the past twelve months&mdash;I think I would be accurate in stating a longer period&mdash; there have been a number of criminals awaiting trial.  They have been waiting in prison until somebody would try them. I fancy it will not be disputed that they are still waiting in prison for somebody to try them.  The Assizes from Dublin Castle could not go out, but if the Dáil Courts had been continued they could have gone out and administered criminal justice, and they would have fulfilled during that particular period a very useful function.  Nobody can but regret that men charged with crime, however criminal some of them may be, should have to wait for a year in prison before their cases can be attended to.  I had hoped that the Minister would see his way to communicate to the Dáil the Report of the Departmental Committee which he set up some time ago on this matter.  After all, we are dealing with this Bill without much knowledge.  We are acting very much in the dark, because these Courts, scattered up and down the country, are Courts of which some member will know something here and another member will know something there, but of which we have no adequate data to enable us to judge this Bill properly.</P>
    <P>If one assumes, as the Minister assumes, that the Dáil Courts must go, this Bill may be in most respects a very <Col N="1313" /> admirable one; but we have not the data to enable us to judge that, unless we have in our hands at least the Report, which I believe was unanimous, of the men who were specially appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs to look into this matter.  The Minister admits that hardships have occurred.  This Dáil has no adequate means of judging whether those hardships are fairly met by this Bill, unless it sees what the men designated to report on the matter have to say about it.  I fear the bureaucratic tendency which we have observed so often will again prevail, and that the Minister will consider that in the highest interests of the public safety it would be better not to give to Deputies the Report compiled by a Departmental Committee of his Department.  If that decision is come to I regret it, but I do suggest that since it is the fact that persons have suffered, and perhaps suffered severely, because they obeyed the decree of the lawful Government of the day and went before Dáil Courts, it is our clear duty, if we claim to be successors of that lawful Government, to indemnify the people who suffered in that way.  I do not know if the Minister has particulars of the number of cases where persons holding Dáil decrees were subsequently compelled to respond in money or otherwise to contrary decrees made against them by the other Courts.  If there be only one such case&mdash;and there must be a number&mdash;it seems to me this Dáil cannot rid itself of the duty of doing justice to people who got into that trouble solely because they did as they were told by the lawful Government of the day.</P>
    <P>It may be that the amount involved is not much.  I hope that is so, and if it is so it will be all the easier for the Dáil to do the right thing and to see that these men at all events will not be penalised for doing what was right.  There is one Section of the Bill which I view with no pleasure, and that is Section 2, Sub-section 3, whereby the Dáil is asked to provide that every Commissioner appointed under this Bill may be dismissed or removed at the pleasure of the Executive. That provision is very reminiscent of the Appeal Committee under the Public Safety Bill.  What kind of justice will you get if you allow a Minister to appoint a Judge for a specified purpose, with the threat hanging over him that he may be dismissed at any moment?  I suppose <Col N="1314" /> these Judges will not last very long, but their functions might last for 12 months and it seems singular that they cannot be assured of their tenure during good conduct for that period.  I do not pretend to understand the reason for that Section, but I do emphatically say that the principle is wrong that any Judge, even though he be a Judge appointed only to wind up the Dáil Court business, should be liable to be dismissed at any moment by the Executive.  That principle is utterly indefensible.  The Minister, in Section 26, makes the important admission that it would be wrong to allow any proceedings to be brought against anyone, whether in the Dáil Courts or outside them, &ldquo;either or on account of or in respect of anything done or omitted to be done under the authority of the decree regulating the Dáil Courts.&rdquo;  In that connection I want to draw attention to a case which deserves more attention than it has received from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed that in this Bill there is no provision at all for those persons against whom decrees were given during the fight with the English by the English Courts because they did not attend those Courts to defend themselves.  In other words, persons who obeyed the Government, which told them not to go near the British Courts, and who said &ldquo;We will deal with the Dáil Courts alone,&rdquo; do not, as far as I can see, get any protection under this Bill in respect of judgments given against them in their business by the English Courts which they refused to attend.  The Minister said he was anxious to cover all classes of cases to which those Dáil decrees were related. There is one class of case&mdash;I do not know how extensive it is or how many people are in that category, but I fancy there must be quite a number&mdash;of people who have had decrees of some kind or another given against them by the British Courts because they did not attend and because they took the advice and followed the order of their own Government.</P>
    <P>I have here particulars of one case, which I say to the Minister is typical of others in this respect.  It is a case that has been dealt with by the Minister's Department with a cynicism which is really surprising.  In July, 1921, the Listowel Urban District Council received notice from a solicitor on behalf of a certain workman that he was taking proceedings in the usual way by way of arbitration in the County Court to claim <Col N="1315" /> damages for injuries which, as he alleged, he had received in the service of the Council, and which, therefore, the Council will be liable to pay.  The Council on the 31st July, 1921, had this notice before their meeting, and they unanimously decided that they would ignore the summons.</P>

      <P>The 31st July, 1921.  That, I fancy, would be a few days after the Truce.  The solicitor for the plaintiff was a gentleman who had been conspicuous for his advocacy of the Dáil Courts, and in the Dáil Courts he had, perhaps, more cases than any other practitioner.  Therefore it is safe to assume that his client, who proceeded before the English County Court Judge, was responsible for this curious proceeding, and that it was not the solicitor who was responsible.  The Council told the plaintiff that they would have nothing to do with the County Court, that they recognised the Dáil Courts only, because that was the order given to them by the Government.  The plaintiff went on, all the same, and he recovered judgment to the amount of thirty-five shillings a week, a sum which last January, when proceedings were taken to enforce this decree, amounted already to nearly £200.  It must be well over £200 now.  There was an insurance company in the case, and when the decree was given, in the absence of the Council, against the Council by the County Court Judge, the insurance company refused to pay, and added that the plaintiff would not have recovered one penny if the case had been defended.  The plaintiff did not try to enforce his decree for a long time.  But he appears to have thought that last January would be a proper time to see that he would go out and get it.  When he threatened to enforce this decree, got in defiance of the Government of the day from an English Court the Council very naturally wrote to the Government asking what they were to do.  They first wrote to the Minister for Local Government on the 24th January, and I do not think they got a reply.  They wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs on the 15th February a long detailed letter, setting out the case which I have summarised, and pointing out that they had <Col N="1316" /> acted throughout upon the orders given to them by the Government, which they recognised as the only lawful Government.  Briefly, what followed was the first reply from the Department of the Minister for Home Affairs regretting that under the law as it stands that the Minister is unable to interfere with the decision of the County Court Judge. The local body then appears to have taken up the matter with the Minister for Fisheries, no doubt as Deputy for the district.  The Minister for Fisheries extracted a memo. from the Minister for Home Affairs in which the amazing suggestion was made&mdash;and I invite the attention of the Dáil to this&mdash;&ldquo;that there is no power to order a re-trial, that the Urban District Council would be well advised in making an effort now to compromise the claim.&rdquo;  He calls it an effort.</P>

      <P>It is the 8th March, 1923, and is signed by the Minister for Home Affairs.  The Minister says: &ldquo;It must be admitted the present state of the law which penalises many who remained loyal to the Dáil Courts in troubled times is hardly satisfactory.&rdquo;  Then he proceeds to say: &ldquo;It should be noticed that the case in question is in a slightly different category.  To begin with, the Urban District Council was made a party to the arbitration during the period following the Truce, in July, 1921,&rdquo; and then he proceeds to suggest that &ldquo;the Council in question were not loyal to Dáil Eireann, and therefore not entitled to much consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was about to do so.  It goes on &ldquo;as to the best of my recollection during the more difficult period of the war the Listowel Council seemed to have remained politely indifferent to the very reasonable proposal of the Solicitor to have the case re-heard before the Dáil Circuit Court, it seems to me that their refusal to enter the Dáil Courts was inspired by motives other than purely patriotic motives.&rdquo;  The Minister cannot have carefully read the proposals for a re-hearing, because the proposals for a re-hearing <Col N="1317" /> were declined simply on the grounds that it was too late to get the Insurance Company in Dublin interested in the case, to defend it.  I think his information as to the conduct of the Council is very far from being accurate, as the Deputies from the District can testify.  However, I do not want to deal at any unnecessary length with this case, but I do want to emphasise it as the kind of thing which is completely left out of this Bill.  To conclude, there was a very effective answer from the Council.  The solicitor to the Council observed that the Minister himself who is now Minister for Home Affairs, in referring to the two courts functioning in the country, had said: &ldquo;Pending a settlement with the British Government, and pending the signing of the Treaty, they were not abandoning that fighting machine.&rdquo;  This was referring to the Dáil Courts.  Then he continues, &ldquo;and they would have been very foolish to do so.  Consequently, throughout that period they had people objecting to go into the British Courts.  The decrees of the Court during that period might deserve examination and inspection when and where a more ordered state of things prevailed.  It ought be open to the Minister to apply for a re-hearing of particular cases which occurred between July and December 1921, and for many months after.&rdquo;  That purports to be a quotation from the Minister himself. The Solicitor to the Council also observed that if it was right to reopen Malicious Injury cases, and to reopen them because the Courts that gave the Malicious Injury decrees were notoriously biased and partial and unfair, if that were right when no notice has been given, how much more is it right when a Government itself prohibits people from going into English Courts, that specific power should be given to reopen undefended cases where there is any evidence that they were undefended because the defendant would not disobey his own Government.  I ask the Dáil if that is not common justice.  We are the successors&mdash;make no mistake about that &mdash;of the people who gave that order to the country at large.</P>

      <P>I have at least the record I have just read out from the Minister's own mouth, that people would be very foolish if they recognised the English machine.  The Minister's Department wrote on the 29th May&mdash;this time it will be observed that a new stunt is discovered, a new reason against this unfortunate Council to prevent the Ministry from coming to the rescue&mdash;&ldquo;I am to observe that it is very doubtful whether persons or corporations who neglected to apply for protection to the Dáil Courts in the proper manner and at the proper time will come within the scope of the proposed Bill.  I should be glad to learn why in the case now under discussion application was not made to the proper Dáil Courts on behalf of your Council for an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from proceeding in the British Court.  Had such an injunction been sought your Council's claim for reconsideration of the case would be admitted without hesitation.&rdquo;  That matter was also dealt with very effectively in a long letter which, I think, it is unnecessary to read from the Solicitor to the Council.  The Dáil will observe that the case for the Dáil Government at the time was that these other Courts were usurpers, that they did not exist as real Courts, and that you must not recognise them.  If you take that stand you cannot in the same breath say if a case was brought against you in these legally non-existent Courts that you must go before the Dáil Courts and get an injunction, because the case of the <Col N="1319" /> Government is that it does not matter what a British Court says, it is invalid, it is nugatory&mdash;it is nothing.  Therefore, why ratepayers' money should be wasted by applying for an injunction it is rather difficult to see, and it is only at the last moment that this particular brilliant excuse for not dealing with the Council's reasonable request was thought of in the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The solicitor points out that never were people ordered by the Dáil Ministry to apply for injunctions which they considered both costly and useless, inasmuch as the injunctions when granted would have no effect whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need pursue that.  It is too obvious, and even the Minister can hardly now stand over that particular line against the Council.  This Council claims to have suffered more than any other public body in Kerry at the hands of the Crown during the period of the terror, and naturally were not favourable towards recognising British Courts or British Court summonses sent to them at a time when the Dáil Courts were sitting every fortnight.  I could, but I think it is unnecessary, say a great deal more about the record of that Council which is now frowned upon by the Minister, but which, from my information, did its duty and did it admirably.  Now, the last letter from the Ministry was dated 5th June to the solicitor, and in that letter, while repeating that the Council had been guilty of negligence because it did not apply for an injunction the writer of the letter says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Ministry is, however, prepared to admit that the question involved is one which deserves very careful consideration, and it is still possible that a clause may be added to the draft Bill which, if approved by the Oireachtas, will bring such a case within the jurisdiction of the Judicial Commissioners whom it is intended to appoint.&rdquo;  I will conclude that matter by reading the reply of the Council's Solicitor on the 14th June:&mdash;&ldquo;My clients say, and I agree, that the only instruction they got at any time was to refuse absolutely to recognise the British Courts, and this they did, and brought all their cases in the Dáil Courts as provided by the rules issued by the Home Department.  If, as is suggested, you require evidence to discriminate between persons who used the Dáil Courts and those who did not, my clients are prepared to prove at any time <Col N="1320" /> that the Listowel U.D.C. propagated and supported these Courts to an extent second to that of no public body in the country.&rdquo;  Be that as it may, what is clear is that if this Bill goes through in its present form without dealing with cases of that kind, of which there must be a good many, an injustice is being done to people who were loyal to the Government of the day.  I ask the Dáil, and the Minister, not to allow that injustice to be done, and to deal with the matter by a very small amendment to the Bill, for instance, an amendment in Section 26, where there is an indemnity to persons acting on the authority of Dáil Courts, or something of that kind.  I submit in any case that where a person can prove that he acted honestly in declining to go before the British Courts, and that a case was decided against him in his absence, it is our clear duty to see that that person is not prejudiced by having done as he was told by the Government of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter, which seems to me to be a question of principle, involved in the Bill on which, I would like to have some light.  It is contained in Section 27.  The title describes it as &ldquo;A Bill to provide for the appointment of Commissioners to dispose of cases which were pending in Courts established under the authority of Dáil Eireann, and to establish a Register of the decrees, and to make other provisions for the purpose of winding up the Courts aforesaid.&rdquo;  If Section 27 means what it appears to me to mean, anybody who had any cause of action, that he might have promoted in any Court at any time since December, 1918, and who has been barred by some Statute of Limitation, or something of that sort from proceeding with it, from the date on which this Bill becomes law will have a further period of three months to go ahead with his cause of action.  Whatever justice there may be in that it does not seem to me to have any connection with the winding-up of the Dáil Courts. It appears to me that the title of the Bill will require amendment in the direction of saying that it is &ldquo;a Bill to authorise people to promote dead and gone causes again.&rdquo;  Common sense has prescribed that many forms of action, assaults, breaches of promise and others of that kind, cannot be prosecuted after two years from the date on which the cause <Col N="1321" /> of action accured.  I do not go into the question of debts which are dead after six years, but there are a number of comparatively trivial actions which are not permitted to be brought after a lapse of two years, for the simple reason that people are supposed to have forgotten or forgiven, and also because people against whom actions might be brought would have lost all the evidence they might have produced in their own defence.  It seems to me extraordinary that in a Bill for the winding-up of the Dáil Courts such a Clause as this is included, which would enable anyone assaulted in January, 1918, to go on with that cause of action within three months after this Bill is passed.  In ordinary law the claim would be dead and gone within two years. What in the existence of the Dáil Courts during a period, I think, of two or two and a half years would justify extending causes of action of that description from December, 1918, to some date in 1924? I rather think when this Section was framed the draftsman had some other matter in his mind, and used language that was far too wide to effect his purpose. After reading this Section in the ordinary sense, it seems to me the effect is to enable any person who had any cause of action that he did not prosecute in some Court, or within the proper time, that he may now go ahead, within three months after the passing of this Bill. Surely if a person had a cause of action there were two sets of Courts open to him.  If he disapproved of the British Courts, the Dáil Courts were open.  He could have gone there, and the proceedings he took would be validated or invalidated as the case may be.  On the other hand, if he proceeded in the other Court he got his decree or got his action dismissed, and it was all over.  Why people should now be given leave to proceed with claims that they did not think it worth while to prosecute in one Court or another since 1918 I fail to see.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gavan Duffy regretted that the Minister in introducing this Bill at this stage did not utter a word of praise for the work of the Dáil Courts during the period from their establishment to their supersession.  I had to recall the great play that was made in the course of propaganda abroad out of the work of these Courts.  I think it is not too much to say, outside perhaps the military activities&mdash;and even outside <Col N="1322" /> the military activities if one is speaking of the educational value of the respective activities&mdash;no other activity had anything like the same effect on the minds of the people of other countries, as the institution of the Dáil Courts, their successful work, the courage of the people who instituted them, and the popularity and confidence that attended them.  Deputy Gavan Duffy spoke of this being the burial service, or used some words of that nature, of the Dáil Courts.  I hope that is not quite the intention.  I hope there will be, in the coming Bill dealing with the judicial system, some substitute for the Dáil Courts, certainly of the more popular Dáil Courts, which will encourage local confidence in local decisions, and encourage the idea that the Courts are enforcing popular law, with popular assent, and that the person who is administering the law is not someone imposed upon them from a central authority in Dublin, and to whom they must look as someone apart.  The Dáil Courts, certainly in the smaller cases at any rate, were considered to be of the people, and their judgments were respected and honoured, though no doubt they caused as much dissatisfaction to the injured party as any other Court.  Nevertheless, they were in the main accepted, and the decisions were fallen in with.  I took the popularity of these Courts and their success as the beginning of a real popular code or system of law that should be taken advantage of, and be continued. I do not think for a moment that the District Justice system takes the place of the popular Courts, and I would hope that in any new measure, intended to deal with the judicial system, we shall have something to follow the popular Courts that were established by Dáil Eireann, in the early years of the recent struggle.</P>
      <P>I had noted this particular Clause 27 of which Deputy FitzGibbon has spoken, and I had noted it in respect of a particular case that Deputy Gavan Duffy had cited, and, speaking as a layman knowing nothing, I am glad to say, about Court procedure, it seems to me to meet the case of the Listowel Council, and that it would give such a Council or such a litigant who had stood by the implied orders, if they were not the direct orders of the Government of that time, not to enter the British Courts, the opportunity of appealing against any decision of these Courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a small matter, but, perhaps, raising quite a significant point, that I would also like to draw the attention of the Dáil to, and that is in Section II. It is the phraseology of the first sub-section. It is not quite new of course, it is more or less the practice in some of these Bills.  It reads:&mdash;&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council to appoint a fit and proper person to be <Col N="1324" /> Chief Judicial Commissioner.&rdquo;  It shall be lawful for him to do that.  The phraseology rather suggests that it is optional, but reference to certain Australian Acts of this kind shows that the phrase is found to the effect that the Governor-General &ldquo;shall appoint,&rdquo; which puts him in his proper place.  Now I would urge upon the Ministry the desirability of not allowing enactments to fall into this habit, which would suggest that the Governor-General has the option of refusing the advice of the Executive Council upon such matters, and that we should, as a matter of common practice, if we have to introduce such a clause, recognise the position that that Officer of the State holds, and that we should say quite flatly that it is his duty to appoint such persons to an office that the Executive Council determines, and we should not suggest that he may do it and that it shall be lawful if he does it, which is rather to say it would be lawful if he did not do what he was told by the Executive Council.  I hope the Minister will consider that, between now and the Committee Stage, and be prepared to accept an amendment upon these lines.  In the main, I think, the Bill will probably meet the needs of the case, and that many of those people who have been seriously inconvenienced and more than inconvenienced, and have suffered a good deal, will have their grievances remedied, at least, to some extent by the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There was only one matter to which I wished to direct attention and Deputy FitzGibbon has already dealt with it, and that is Section 27.  I think on the face of it Deputy FitzGibbon has made a pretty strong case against the right to let people come forward now and say that at such and such a time it was really their intention to have brought proceedings. We do not know whether such intention did ever exist.  I think the <i>prima facie</i> case that Deputy FitzGibbon pointed out in regard to Section 27 is very strong, but lest it should be forgotten I want also to indicate that there is the opposite point of view.  There are cases definitely and personally known to me that have been put before me in the last three months of people who had not in certain parts of the country Dáil Courts in which to proceed and who acting <Col N="1325" /> out of loyalty to the Government of the time and which they recognise as their Government did not proceed in the other Courts available for them and who, not having availed of these other Courts, now find their cases statute barred. While I think the Section might with advantage be tightened so as to be less liable to abuse than it appears now to be, I should be sorry that the Deputy's great influence in this Dáil would cause the clause so far to be tightened as to exclude every case however definite and genuine, and the definiteness and genuineness of which could be and should be investigated by terms somewhat the same as those, though possibly less stringent.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Gavan Duffy that abolition of the Dáil Courts was unwise or unnecessary. My view on that is that the only unwisdom in our treatment of the Dáil Courts lay in the fact that we delayed overlong in abolishing them, and that we allowed the country and the commercial interests of the country to plunge about for many months in the chaos that was created by the dual jurisdiction, or the dual lack of jurisdiction, of two sets of Courts and two systems of justice.  The Dáil Courts were, of their nature, occasional and provisional.  They were a weapon forged, and hastily forged, in a special set of circumstances to meet the needs of a particular time.  The British Petty Sessions Courts collapsed when their Executive arm withered, when the R.I.C. were compelled to withdraw from outlying stations throughout the country to the larger towns, and become in the fullest sense, an armed garrison, and when they ceased to be in any sense a police force.  Then the Courts which were based on them crumbled.  People resigned the Commission of the Peace, some of them voluntarily and out of sympathy with the popular struggle, and others under a certain suasion from Sinn Fein or the Volunteers, and the Petty Sessions Courts collapsed.  Now that period was certainly a period of great restraint on the part of the people, of great selflessness, of great exaltation, and crime and minor abuses were at a minimum <Col N="1326" /> through the country.  But it was necessary to provide some kind of rough and ready tribunals where people could get the minor disputes that are inevitable from every day life settled in a spirit of neighbourliness and equity, rather than in a spirit of strict law, and these Courts for a period did very useful service.  That period I place in the summer of 1920.  I have not statistics and I do not know how many of these Courts could be said, in any sense, to have survived the intensive campaign that began in the autumn of 1920, and lasted pretty well until the Truce.  I know as from September, 1920, we who were here in Ireland heard very little about these Courts.  I do not know what may have been heard by our representatives abroad, and I do not know to what extent that which they had done was useful in foreign propaganda.  I have no doubt it was very useful, but, as I say, from September, 1920, we heard very little of these Courts until after the Truce.  But after the Truce we would have preferred not to hear many things that we heard about them.  These Courts, which had certainly a useful record when they appeared first and had won a good name and their meed of praise from professional people appearing before them, reappeared after the Truce only to be made the channels and the vehicles of corruption and abuse, and only to be used by people not in search of justice, but as an obstruction to justice.  The system of plunging from one Court into another, seeking injunctions according as one thought the case was going to go, started about that time.  It then became evident to any person with his eye on the signs of the times, and particularly evident to people in commercial circles, that if there was to be security for business enterprise in this country, If there was to be security for debt collections, and for these things on which all trade and commerce are based, that that period of dual jurisdiction would have to come to an end soon, and it became a question of how it was to end. There were really two ways by which it could end, the elimination of one or the other system, the elimination of the State Courts, or the formal adoption as State Courts of those hastily improvised tribunals that had functioned for a <Col N="1327" /> period throughout the country in opposition to the British Courts as they were at the time, or the elimination of these occasional improvised Dáil Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil Courts had certain inherent defects.  They were formed by a process of selection, and those who were selected to function in them were selected because of the prominence or the eminence which they had attained to in a revolutionary period by reason of the leadership which they had attained to in the Volunteers, perhaps, or in Sinn Fein.  That fact gave them a hold over their communities and an influence in their communities which was useful for a period, for a period during which their communities were knit together by the bond of common resistance to British administration.  I submit that these Courts had within themselves, by their very nature, the elements of dissolution. They were essentially occasional, and they could never have been adopted or adapted to meet the requirements of a normal situation.  Further, you had this, unfortunately, that the movement which threw these Courts up was split from top to bottom; you had the poison and the bitterness of that split circulated into every hamlet and into every home in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was better in all the circumstances to let these rough and ready, improvised, tribunals which had done good work in a certain period go, with that record, like other weapons that we had to improvise for that particular struggle, and to face the fact that they had not within themselves the elements of a useful future for the country, or for the requirements of the people of the country. No man with any proper appreciation of the position through the country, the way the personnel of the Courts had gone, some one way and some another, would dream of trying to hold them together or to reforge them into any tribunal to meet the real practical requirements of the people with regard to the administration of law and administration of justice.  Distance, they say, lends enchantment to the view.  Deputy Gavan Duffy fighting, as I heard his colleague, Sean T. O'Kelly say, the battles of the Republic on the Continental front, <Col N="1328" /> may have formed a highly idealised conception of these Courts.  I did not.  I was close up to them, and I did not form a highly idealised conception of them.  I realised that they were essentially occasional, and I face the fact, and I ask the Deputy to face the fact, that when they reappeared after the period of terror that they did not reappear with that same high morale, or with that same disinterested spirit that did characterise them in their beginning. There is nothing like standing up to things, and there is nothing to be gained by simply being a <i>laudator temporis acti</i> and saying that they were the most wonderful things in the world.  They were not.  They were faulty, and, in their later stages, many of them were corrupt. They were not wonderful things for the ordinary requirements of the people in their everyday life; they were far from it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy dealt with the case of the Listowel Urban Council.  I do not think, except that it be taken as a test case, or a typical case, that a detailed discussion of that particular case is relevant, but I want to say this, that I happened to be in the Dáil Department of Local Government and I could tell the Deputy&mdash;I do not propose to take the time of the Dáil with it&mdash; that the excess of patriotic fervour which prompted the Listowel Urban Council on the 31st July, 1921, to refuse to be represented as defendant in a case, because the Court was British, is certainly very surprising to me, in view of the things that I know of its record in earlier times.  I even suggest to the Deputy that the considerations which prompted the refusal were not entirely foreign to the fact that the plaintiff, Carroll, had some personal and purely local unpopularity. Let him, to use a colloquialism, &ldquo;put that in his pipe and smoke it.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this to the Deputy that there was not an emphatic or a definite prohibition issued against going into the British Courts.  The Dáil Courts were set up to provide an alternative <Col N="1329" /> tribunal for people who were unwilling to give any recognition to the British system, or the British administration. The Deputy knows, or ought to know, that throughout that whole time cases were heard in British Courts. People did go in and the objection was rather to initiating or to being responsible for initiating proceedings in the British Courts than appearing as defendant when others had initiated proceedings.  The Deputy knows too that there was a certain class of business which the Dáil Courts did not attempt to assume jurisdiction in; they left the thing, in a kind of tacit way, to be dealt with by the other system of Courts.  Generally, there are things with regard to that whole period about which the Deputy ought to furbish up his memory.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to stating clearly the difficulty about putting in this Bill a provision to the effect that people who were not represented in British Courts, and who had decrees given against them, ought now to get an opportunity of appealing. I have no objection to stating that.  If we put in, and we have not finally decided not to put in, such a provision it will bring to the surface all kinds of bogus cases, because for the most part the people who had proceedings initiated against them in the British Courts, and who did not appear or take any steps whatever to be represented, or to put a counter case, had no counter case to put.  It is something that the Law Adviser is very reluctant to recommend that now, at this stage, after many months you are going to turn around and say that all decrees given during that period in which only one party was represented are to be reviewed by this occasional Commission which is being set up to wind up the business of these Courts.</P>

      <P>The question is: can the Deputy give me genuine cases? Has he personal knowledge of half a dozen of these cases?  We have not definitely closed our minds on this point. I am open to consider the matter further between this and the Committee Stage, but I am inclined to be quite conservative <Col N="1330" /> about it, and to warn Deputies against such a step as deciding to call into question decrees that were given so long ago and deciding that, without any particular data before them.  I wonder how many Deputies have had it brought under their notice that it would be necessary or advisable to take that step.  We have examined the matter very carefully in all its bearings, and we are not at all inclined to the view that it is wise, or that it is necessary to insert such a provision. This course of calling up things that were finished and done with and proposing to review them is always a doubtful step and a doubtful precedent to set. Deputy FitzGibbon commented on Section 27.  Section 27 had this relevancy to the matter in hand, that recollecting the circumstances of the time &mdash;this conflict of jurisdiction, and the fact that the writ of any Court, if it was running at all, was running with a bad limp&mdash;it has to be faced that it is quite possible that people with quite a good case refrained from going into either set of Courts during that period fearing that the writ would not run.</P>

      <P>We were so impressed with the aspect of things, so impressed with the fact, that to the ordinary quiet kind of person, who perhaps was not very partisan, it seems a useless expenditure of money, useless cost, to go into Court, and get a decree which was unlikely to be executed, the odds being 10 to 1 against.  Neither the wheels of the British machinery, nor the wheels of such machinery as the Dáil could be said to have at its disposal, were turning very smoothly or very steadily, and we do think that many people refrained from litigation though having quite good cases during that period because of that particular condition of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Section provides:&mdash;(1) If and whenever the time limited by any statute for instituting any proceedings in any Court of law or equity would, but for this section, have expired on any date between the 31st day of December, 1918, and the 16th day of April, 1922, such time shall be and is hereby extended for three months after the passing of this Act, and any such proceedings which shall have been instituted after the expiration of the time so limited by such statute and before the passing of this Act, or which shall be <Col N="1331" /> instituted before the expiration of three months after the passing of this Act, shall be deemed to have been instituted within the time so limited by such statute.</P>
    <P>(2) This section shall not apply to any limit of time which can be extended by a District Justice under Section 6 of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 (No. 6 of 1923).</P>
    <P>It provides that during a certain period, when the conflict was at its height, the operation of the Statute of Limitations shall be suspended, and it prolongs the time for entering suits.  We have had considerable evidence, I can assure the Deputy, from the country of the necessity for some such extension, coming mostly from business people whose rightful claims are in danger of being statute barred by reason of the disturbed conditions during certain years.</P>

Except for a small matter of wording, that he seemed to dwell upon for a length of time out of all proportion to its importance, Deputy Johnson dwelt mostly on his hopes with regard to the coming Judiciary Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a discussion of that kind would be more relevant on the Judiciary Bill.  But I want to simply stress the fact that the Dáil Courts had a period of glory and a period of usefulness, but that glory and that usefulness sprang very much from the self-imposed discipline of the people at that time, from the exaltation of the people of that time, from the selflessness which permeated them.  I think it would be a very unsafe thing to say, judging from that entirely different set of circumstances, that such Courts, set up now in a different set of circumstances, would have the same success <Col N="1332" /> or the same utility.  Let us face it, that a good deal of the high morale, a good deal of the elevating effect of that movement, has run out of the bucket within the last 12 months and that you have a different people and a different outlook in the country, that you have demoralisation, that men who collected tens of thousands of pounds in 1919 could not be set to that task now, for a sufficient reason.  We need not delay going into the question of responsibility for that, but let us not shirk the fact here.  Legislating for the people of the country and in the interests of the people of the country, it is our duty to take cognizance of what are relevant facts, and it is a relevant fact that you could not set to the work of administering justice equally, impartially and impersonally between man and man, many who did that work and did it well in the early months of 1920.</P>

      <P>I am a member of the Committee on Procedure, but I got no expressed instructions with regard to that particular Report.  I moved one some ten or fifteen days ago and it was referred back.  However, I will undertake the task of trying to pilot this Report through.  The first six proposed new Standing Orders deal with the procedure upon the opening of a new Dáil, and as we now seem to be in a clearly moribund condition it is eminently desirable that we should make provision for what is to happen when our successor comes into his own, and there will be the necessary procedure, after the election has been held, for the opening of a new Dáil.  The Committee on Procedure have endeavoured to frame rules that will meet the situation that will then arise.  The first of the new Standing Orders provides that when all the returns for the writs have come into the hands of the Clerk he sends the notices to all Teachtai who have been returned <Col N="1333" /> and notifies them that their attendance is required here on a day or days which will be set out in the notice, and it will be before the actual hour at which the Dáil will assemble for the transaction of business.  The object of that is that those Teachtaí that have been elected may get through the preliminaries, the signing of the Roll and the making of any declarations that they may be required to make in the office of the Clerk before the duly nominated person who has to look after that part of the business. Then the Dáil itself will be in a position actually to tackle the work of the day and at the hour at which it has been summoned to commence business, and there will not be, as there was at the beginning of this Dáil and as there is in Parliamentary assemblies elsewhere, a waste, in some cases as much as two days, before the Dáil can be got to do the business for which it has been summoned to meet.  I do not know whether it would be better to take these Orders one by one or to deal with them in groups.</P>

He will be in the Chair and then people will be able to consider and turn over in their own minds who would be the best available Deputy as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and notice of motion can be put down to elect a Deputy.  It may be that more parties than one would like to nominate a Deputy and therefore due notice would have to be given, which will be the ordinary two days' notice provided for by the rules, I suppose.  That will go out and if there is a contested appointment an election will be held at a later date, but it was not intended the moment the Dáil had elected the Ceann Comhairle that it should then aljourn and do nothing else.  It would go on with whatever business it has been summoned to deal with, after appointing the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>A difficulty might arise which I do not think is provided for if this rule goes through.  It might happen that a certain person whom the Dáil would wish to be Ceann Comhairle might not be present, might be ill on that day.  Of course, somebody might be appointed temporarily to take his place.  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle cannot be elected on that day a certain difficulty might arise.  Of course, some body could be appointed temporarily but there is no provision actually in the Standing Orders for a temporary appointment, and some kind of a way out will have to be found.  On the other hand if we did not require notice for the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle it would certainly be got over.  It would not be so likely that both would be unable to be present to carry on the procedure.</P>

      <P>The difficulty put forward by the Minister is a practical one, and it is tied up with a larger one still, as I conceive it.  We do have cases now where we have An Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and neither one nor the other happens to be in the chair at the particular time, still we go on with the business, and they are still not acting as Chairman.  Some other Deputy is taking the place of An Ceann Comhairle.  If that is a practicable procedure now, it could still be a practicable procedure, but the larger difficulty I am indicating now is&mdash;I believe it is the case in other places by the precedents of which we need not necessarily be tied&mdash; that either the Speaker, as he would be called, or An Ceann Comhairle, as we entitle him, or Leas-Cheann Comhairle, either one or the other, must be in the Chair, and a third party can only take the presidency while in Committee.</P>

      <P>The point made by the Minister for Local Government seems to depend entirely on the last sentence of Order 5, that the Ceann Comhairle shall immediately on election take the Chair. If that is deleted, then the point does not arise, and its inclusion is not at all necessary. If a Deputy were elected, and the Dáil agreed that that Deputy, who may not be present, should be the Ceann Comhairle, there would be nothing to preclude <Col N="1338" /> his election, provided that the last sentence were deleted.  If he were present, on that Standing Order, it would be the most obvious thing that he should take the Chair immediately.  If not present, he would still be elected to be the Ceann Comhairle, and the Dáil for the time being, within the Standing Orders, could appoint a Chairman or Deputy-Chairman.</P>

        <i>Group B.&mdash;Motion to Proceed to the Next Business.</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  At any stage of a debate, other than a debate on any Stage of a Bill, a Teachta may rise and claim to move: &ldquo;That the Dáil proceed to the next business,&rdquo; and this motion shall take precedence of all amendments to the original question: Provided that this motion be not made more than once during the discussion on any question.</P>
      <P>2.  This motion cannot be made where the original question is one relating to the ordering of public business, or the meeting of the Dáil, or in Committee.</P>
      <P>3.  If the Dáil resolves this motion in the affirmative the original question is thereby disposed of, and the Dáil shall proceed to the next business on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a group of three Standing Orders dealing with what is usually known as &ldquo;the previous question.&rdquo;  The object of this is to enable the Dáil when a discussion is going on, and the view of the majority of the whole Dáil is that it would be better not at the moment to come to a definite decision on it one way or the other, to shelve the matter for the time being.  It is usually described as moving the previous question. The form in which we propose it should be dealt with here is if &ldquo;At any stage of a debate, other than a debate on any Stage of a Bill, a Teachta may rise and claim to move: `that the Dáil proceed to the next business,' and this motion shall take precedence of all amendments to the original question: Provided that this motion be not made more than once during the discussion on any Question.&rdquo; The object of that is to prevent its being used for mere obstruction.  The effect of that would be, that if in the Dáil there are two sides which are extreme <Col N="1340" /> one way or the other who want to get a decision on a point, and the moderate majority think it should be left alone for the present, it would enable them to say: &ldquo;we do not want this matter decided here and now, let it wait for a better opportunity,&rdquo; and they would be able then to go on with the next business on the paper.</P>
      <P>The Second Order provides that this motion cannot be made where the original motion is one relating to the ordering of public business, or the meeting of the Dáil or in Committee.  The effect of that would be to interfere with the carrying on of public work or with the meeting of the Dáil.  The reason that it cannot be made in Committee is that if you go on to the next business while in Committee on the Bill, all that would be wiped out altogether for the time being.  In the consideration of the Committee on Procedure, it would be improper and might be used for the purposes of mere obstruction.  The third order is that if the Dáil resolves this motion in the affirmative and the original question is thereby disposed of, the Dáil shall proceed to the next business on the Order Paper. I beg to move those three; they are so connected that they form one.</P>
      <P>Orders agreed to.</P>
      <P>GROUP C.&mdash;1.  It shall be an instruction to all Committees to which Bills may be committed, that they have power to make such amendments therein as they shall think fit, provided such amendments be revelant to the subject matter of the Bill; but that, if any such amendments shall not be within the title of the Bill, they amend the title accordingly, and report the same specially to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The next is merely a formal Standing Order dealing with the amendment of Title of Bills. When a Bill is in Committee at present no amendment can be brought in which goes beyond the Title of the Bill.  This is intended to give Committees a little more freedom in dealing with matters of that kind.  Theoretically when we are in Committee we are naturally a Committee considering a Bill referred to us; therefore the Dáil is not supposed to know what a Committee does until the Committee makes it report.  If a Committee is instructed by the Dáil to deal with a particular Bill, and it introduces an amendment in that particular Bill which goes <Col N="1341" /> beyond the provisions of the Bill as it came to them from the Dáil, they shall report the fact to the Dáil and the Title of the Bill shall be amended so that there will be a record of what the Committee has done.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be pernickity inany criticism, but I feel there is a certain difficulty resident in this; perhaps I had better call it a contradiction rather than a difficulty.  It says that in Committee the amendments must be relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.  If the amendments are not relevant, obviously they cannot be considered under this Standing Order.  If such amendments, having been adopted, go outside the title of the Bill, the Title of the Bill has to be revised so as to cover them, by which it appears that the subject matter of the whole Bill and the title are not coincident in terms.  I had always conceived they would be.  If an amendment is outside the subject matter of the Bill would it still remain within the title of the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem which arose several times recently and this is the British Standing Order on the matter.  I think our own experience proves it is a very practical one.  It gives the Chairman of Committees more liberty than he would have if all amendments offered would have to be within the Title of the Bill.  It would be quite possible that a Committee when considering the Bill would find that a certain amendment might meet with the approval of the majority, or even with the general approval, and that the amendment would be a little outside the Title but that it would be relevant to the subject matter of the Bill; that is to say to the Bill considered as a whole.  In that case under this Order the Chairman could accept the amendment, could put it to the Committee, and if the amendment were passed the Title could be altered accordingly and then a special report made.  In view of our experiences of this kind of thing, and we had two or three cases recently, the Committee on <Col N="1342" /> procedure thought that this Order would be suitable and it is an Order which has been found practicable in another place and the wording is the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a case this very day in Section 27 of the Dáil Courts Winding Up Order.  If that clause had been altered by way of amendment and while the Bill was in Committee I should have thought you would have no hesitation whatever in deciding the amendment was out of order because it went beyond the Title of the Bill. This very Standing Order which we now propose would enable the Chairman of that Committee to improve the Title of the Bill by adding &ldquo;and for the purpose of winding up the Courts aforesaid and for extending the time for taking proceedings herein.&rdquo;  It is equally clear such an amendment would be relevant to the subject matter although it might be outside the Title.  To-day's instance seems to be the most perfect type of case that would be covered by our proposed Standing Order.</P>

      <P>The second financial order enables the Dáil in Committee on Estimates, if it considers the whole estimate is unsatisfactory, to send it back to the Ministry which prepared it in order that they may bring it forward again, having considered any recommendation that the Dáil thinks fit to attach.  It <Col N="1343" /> enables the Dáil to try and get the Ministry to revise the Estimate by reducing it or increasing it or making provision for something not already in it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask whether the words &ldquo;before entering on the discussion of the items &rdquo; are exclusive and imply that a motion to refer the estimate back cannot be made after beginning the discussion of the items. Because it occurs to me that often it would only be during the discussion of the items that there would be a wish to refer the matter back.  It might be only when the Dáil came to consider an item that what was involved in it would be discovered, and that then only the possibility of its being desirable to refer the Vote back would arise.  If the inclusion of these words would preclude this, I think a change should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that if you are in Committee on a particular Vote you might have an amendment moved to reduce sub-head (a).  There would be a discussion and the amendment put and carried or defeated.  Another amendment to sub-head (b) or (c) or (d) would be put and then it would be considered that it would not be proper to have a motion to refer back the whole Vote in consideration of the fact that the Committee would have already spent time in discussing particular items and actually perhaps have taken divisions.  It was therefore considered that before we went into a discussion on the items on the Vote we would have a general discussion and that a Deputy who desired to have the whole thing referred back should have his mind made up in the beginning before the Committee went into discussion on items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not quite answered my point.  My notion was this:&mdash;We might be quite prepared to accept the Estimate as a whole at first with the information before us, but our views might alter altogether during the discussion of the items, and it might be desirable to have the whole matter re-considered by the Minister responsible for the Vote.  I do not want to press the matter, if the deliberate opinion of the Committee is against me, but I think a case might easily arise when the Dáil would wish these words were not in the Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point should be made clear that, in practice, in the British Parliament the method has been, if you want to refer back for consideration an estimate, to vote for a reduction of the salary of the Minister, or if you want to increase the Estimate, you cannot do so simply because you are precluded from adding to the expenses except by a motion of the Minister. The procedure of trying to get reconsideration of Departmental policy by moving to reduce the salary of the Minister is not thought by the Committee on Procedure to be the proper way of doing it.</P>

      <P>You might have a most perfect Minister&mdash;as perfect as the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and you might not want to dispense with him or reduce his salary, but you may want him to change his policy, especially when you are dealing with Ministers who are appointed by the Dáil, responsible directly to the Dáil.  The Dáil may say that the policy of the Department should be revised, and may, by virtue of their more perfect control of that Minister, influence the Minister for Finance.  The procedure is, I think, much better than the other, and I do not think the point that the Deputy raises is a very valid one, because Deputies are supposed to have read through the items before they deal with the main question.  It may be quite true that in the course of a discussion respecting an item in a Vote information might be divulged, but it is still competent to move for a reduction of that item or the amendment of that item may be taken without asking for a reconsideration of the whole Vote.  I think the proposed Order as it stands covers the whole ground of those questions raised by Deputy Thrift.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter that occurred to me and I waited to hear other Deputies before raising it.  It seemed to me that it would be possible for an Ceann Comhairle to rule on this Order that a general discussion on the whole Vote may not arise except upon such a motion to refer back the Vote, and that it has been our procedure in the past to permit such a discussion before entering into the details of the <Col N="1345" /> items.  The procedure that way has been very useful and valuable, and we ought to preserve it.  It would appear from these words: &ldquo;It shall be in order, before entering on the discussion of the Items in a Vote, to move that the Item in question be referred back to the Minister in charge of the Department for reconsideration, with or without a specific recommendation,&rdquo; that my interpretation is giving the only way in which the whole thing could arise before entering upon the items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know really whether there is any necessity for this Standing Order at all.  The passage of such a motion would be in the case of a member of the Executive Council.  The dismissal of the Executive Council, or a member of it, if such a motion were passed, would ensue.  In the case of an outside Minister, I do not know whether it would mean the dismissal of the outside Minister or the dismissal of the Executive Council, or both.  That would be the only effect of passing such a motion. The Executive Council could not remain in office if a Vote on one of those Estimates were referred back.  Whether there is any necessity for this rule is doubtful, because, if the Dáil desired to have a change of Executive Council, that change could be produced by refusing or reducing the Vote.  By moving a motion it is possible, say, to move to have the total Vote reduced, and you get absolutely the same result as you would get from this, and you will get it probably in a clearer way.  I do not see the necessity for it at all.</P>

      <P>I think the last Member of the Executive Council who should object to this Order would be the Minister for Local Government.  He has on many occasions changed his mind and acceded to applications from various Deputies.  Cannot you conceive the possibility of a suggestion submitted by a Member of the Executive Council being subjected to criticism here so much that the very parent of it would have thought <Col N="1346" /> it not unworthy of reconsideration?  That would not put the Dáil to the very objectionable course of defeating a Minister upon his own Estimate.  The object in this Order is to enable the Executive Council to yield gracefully, and without doing any harm to themselves or the country, or the Government, to the criticisms which have fallen&mdash;well-founded criticisms&mdash;and it would be open to the Minister or Government to move that the Estimates be referred back.  I conceive that, in the future, we would have amendments of that description accepted by the Executive and reconsidered, instead of saying &ldquo;This is what we choose, and if you do not accept that, put us out.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGibbon's statement, of course, makes this rule one to be discussed more carefully than we would have been inclined to discuss it. It seems to me to give grounds for actually refusing to pass it without further consideration, because it is very doubtful whether anything should be done that would weaken the responsibility of an Executive Council in regard to matters of finance.  It is certainly not contemplated in the Constitution that matters of finance shall be in the same position and shall be dealt with in the same way in the Dáil as ordinary matters of legislation. There is nothing in the ordinary way of legislation to prevent any Deputy under the Standing Orders bringing in any sort of measure.  There is an express provision to prevent a Private Deputy of the Dáil bringing in a motion for the expenditure of money.  There is special responsibility and special care and stewardship cast upon the Executive Council, both by the Standing Orders and the Constitution.  Now, anything that would weaken that responsibility and make it possible for a play of forces in the Dáil, on the principle of mutual concessions and mutual support, to play with the finances of the country without responsibility, seems to me to be very undesirable. While I had really no feeling against the Order before Deputy FitzGibbon spoke I feel now that it is one that certainly ought not to be adopted without very serious consideration indeed.</P>

      <P>I think I am interpretating the feelings of the Committee correctly when I say that what the Committee wanted was to find some alternative <Col N="1347" /> for the method in England of moving that the Minister's salary be reduced.  Under the Constitution here you cannot move that a Minister's salary be reduced, and I think if the Minister for Local Government would suggest an alternative which would be in accordance with the Constitution and which would enable the Committee on Finance to discuss the general policy of a Department on some definite motion or amendment, that it would meet the views of all parties. It was exactly because it was not possible to follow the procedure of moving to reduce the salary of a Minister that the Committee cast round for some such form as this.  If any form were suggested which would accomplish the end of enabling Deputies in Committee to challenge by a motion the whole policy of a Department I think that would solve the difficulty.  That is all that was in it at the Committee.</P>

      <P>Two totally different interpretations of this Order have been put before us.  It seems to me that if you leave out anything about recommendation there is less possibility of it being used in such a way as to defeat the provisions of the Constitution or to get round them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the interpretation that it is for the purpose really of having finance dealt with by the Dáil in precisely the same way, or very nearly the same way, as ordinary legislation, and there is the other interpretation, that it is simply to take the place of a motion to reduce a Minister's salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, if this Order were passed we should be in this position.  If there were a definite opposition challenge to the Ministry the motion would be to reduce the estimate. That would be the means of challenging the Ministry, of deciding that the Ministry had not the confidence of the Dáil in that particular respect.  But if there was no desire to challenge the Ministry in that emphatic sense, but only to criticise and suggest changes&mdash;such changes being possibly accepted, possibly resisted; if resisted the Ministry could take it as a vote of no confidence&mdash;surely it is possible that the Ministry may be effected by the sense of the Dáil in regard to the financial <Col N="1348" /> provisions for the succeeding year, that a larger sum might be desirable.  They might include that in those estimates rather than bring forward a supplementary estimate.  If they were influenced by the arguments of the Dáil to reconsider the Vote it would preclude any possibility of feeling that it is a Vote of no confidence and enable them, as Deputy FitzGibbon says, to accept a criticism of the Dáil in regard to a particular Department, or one section of a particular Department's work.  The proposition here &ldquo;with or without a specific recommendation,&rdquo; does allow Deputies who want to raise a point to raise it in respect of a specific part of the work of a Department.  I think that is desirable because it helps to confine the debate to that part of the Department's work.  If there is no specific recommendation in the motion for referring back, then the whole of the Department's work may be discussed under the Vote.  There are two propositions: to discuss the whole of the Department's work without a motion to reduce and to discuss a specific portion of the Department's work, thereby confining the discussion to that portion.  I think that the method adopted here does rather favour the position that the Minister for Local Government has taken up in favour of fixing the Ministerial responsibility, because if there was a desire to vote no confidence in the financial policy of a Department the motion would be to reduce the estimate.  This is of a different character and, therefore, simply enables the Dáil to express itself in a general way without any attempt to condemn the Department's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had instances of almost every one of these things within the last few days, particularly because we are in a different position here on account of the peculiar sanctity attached to the Executive Council.  They of course, stand or fall as a whole, but then there are the outside Ministers who have more or less control of their own Departments.  When we were dealing with the Ministry of Fisheries, which I think is one of the Departments that is not attached to the Executive, Deputy McBride on the estimates raised a question as to the inadequate provision of protection for the fishermen on the Western Coast.  If we had this Standing Order it would be open to refer back the estimate with the recommendation to the Minister <Col N="1349" /> that he should endeavour to provide protection for the fisheries on the Western Coast.  He would then go back and would return here with the estimate in two or three days and he would say one thing or the other: either that he had got provision in his new estimate or that the Minister for Finance refused to provide the necessary money. Then you would have the issue knit at once as to whether there would be a vote of no confidence in the Government or not, because you would then get to a question of finance, and the Government would say &ldquo;this is money we cannot produce.&rdquo;  On that estimate you would get a decision as to whether the policy of the Executive was or was not to prevail. They would have the full support of all members of the Dáil who desired to maintain the Government as a whole in office and the question of the recommendation would be withdrawn.  If it was intended to go on and defeat the Ministry and put them out as a whole, you could come to an issue on that, and they would be put out.  It does seem to me that while we have a division of Ministries into two classes&mdash;those who are on the Executive Council with collective responsibility and those not on the Executive Council but who are responsible for their own Departments&mdash;it is desirable that some form of recommendation should be available in the case of those Ministers who do not stand or fall with the Executive, and who run their own Departments, and that the will of the Dáil should be capable of being manifested in some such form as this Standing Order suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really clear to me that this matter is deserving of a good deal more consideration than it has got. and Deputy FitzGibbon has convinced me that the Order should not be adopted.  If it works out in any way such as he suggests, it would give people, other than Ministers, the means of proposing a Money Vote.  It would work out virtually in that way.  Take the case of the Minister for Fisheries.  His estimate is sent back with a recommendation that more money be provided for some particular object.  That is an indirect way of forcing the hands of the Executive Council.  It is all very well for the Executive Council to say that money can be or cannot be afforded for a certain thing before the Dáil has expressed its opinion, <Col N="1350" /> but when the Dáil has expressed its opinion that such money should be found, the position of the Executive Council is very greatly prejudiced in saying that it cannot be found.  I think that would be a most undesirable procedure. Either, it would mean that the Executive Council would have to make it a case of confidence in the first instance and resist any reference back of such an estimate with a recommendation, or else they would have simply to resign the immediate and direct responsibility they have over finance and that it was felt necessary when framing the Constitution to give them over finance.  I do not know if something might not be drafted to meet what some people feel to be necessary to take the place of a motion to reduce a Minister's salary.  I think it ought to be further considered.</P>

In my opinion the Minister for Local Government is a year too late. He should have raised that question when we were dealing with External Ministers. His opposition to paragraph 2 is really opposition to the idea of the External Ministers.  It is opposition to the idea of the Dáil having control of the Ministers. It is practically an assertion that the whole of the Ministry, whether Executive or not, must stand or fall together.  It is a denial of the Clause in the Constitution which appoints External Ministers. It is, Deputy Figgis will be proud to know, a really of the Minister for Local Government to his banner.</P>

      <P>I think there must be, at least, some opportunity for the Dáil to express its views on an estimate and I think that is more or less reasonable. A point I would like to understand about this matter is: is it a recommendation for further information, or is it to be looked upon as a vote of want of confidence? I take it that it is not a vote of want of confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we will have to have something in the nature of a motion of want of confidence, and it might be that some of these Standing Orders might be so interpreted.  I see no objection to it, if it be simply to put back an estimate for further information or for further consideration.  If the Dáil does not approve of the policy of a Minister I think it is reasonable, and that there is no great danger in it.  What I do see dangerous is this: if the Minister for Fisheries put up an estimate for x£ and it came before the Dáil, and that the Dáil was of opinion that a sum of x cubed pounds should be spent, and that in the particular year in which the Dáil made that recommendation the cost of that service would disturb the balance between receipts and expenditure, then it would be a bad recommendation.  It would unbalance the receipts and expenditure. To that extent, I think there would be weakness.  I am half inclined to think <Col N="1352" /> that the Minister's interpretation of it was that it would be a vote of want of confidence rather than what the Committee's intention was, to get more information or to influence to some extent the Minister's policy.  Personally I prefer a little flexibility with regard to recommendations, so that when Minister's recommendations come forward they would not be the last word and might be rejected if the Dáil did not agree with them.  As long as it is clear that a motion should come forward for a vote of want of confidence, and that this does not mean that, I see no objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>Our whole object was to avoid the use of words which could be considered as meaning a want of confidence.  If you want a vote of want of confidence you must do it in a specific way.  If the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; is wrong, and if any other word can be suggested that is less strong I think the Committee will be anxious to put it in. It was not our desire that the Committee when dealing with an estimate should dictate in any way to the Minister in charge of it.  It was rather that they should seek for information and put forward suggestions.  If the word &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; is preferred to &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; I think it would meet the views of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps an instance might be given.  Last week there was a discussion on the Education estimates. The form it took was to refer back for reconsideration and the subject matter discussed on that proposition was the position of Secondary teachers.  The matter was discussed and the Minister did not make it as he might have done a vote of confidence.  As a matter of fact he made a statement which led to the withdrawal of the motion.  It was satisfactory. The alternative proposal would be, if something like this did not appear, to move the rejection of the Vote.  That would be taken as a vote of no confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But supposing the case arose that the Minister for Local Government, or the President makes : that an External Minister proposes an Estimate, and Deputies specially interested in that Department propose a reference back with a recommendation, it is within the province of the Minister for Finance, or of a member of the Executive Council, <Col N="1353" /> to say that this matter immediately raises a matter of Executive policy, and the vote in these circumstances immediately becomes a vote of no confidence.  Then the whole issue is changed.  But, without any such motion, the desire to refer back is wholly and solely intended to avoid the necessity for that vote of no confidence. It is something which is very much in the category of &ldquo;the previous question&rdquo; that we discussed.  We do not want the motion to be construed into a vote of no confidence, or to raise the issue that the Executive would stand or fall by it. It is put forward in this manner by way of having a general discussion, and of allowing an opportunity to the Dáil to express an opinion on the general question or the question of the administration of the Department.  It is, as a matter of fact, our desire to meet the points that have been raised.  We do not want to have occasions periodically through a Session when there may have to be changes in the Ministry every year because the Ministry was going to stand or fall by a particular vote, or that the Dáil must not express any view upon a particular item because it may mean the fall of the Government.  The whole intention is that we want to make it possible for the Government to continue in office, and to be responsive to the wishes of the Dáil.</P>

The referring back in the case of an External Minister is a different question to a recommendation for an increase, because that can only be dealt with, either as a vote of no confidence, or else the Executive must yield.  It has a particular responsibility of knowing the Dáil's view in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a recent incident which I think rather alters that.  Under the existing Standing Orders notice must be given to raise a matter on the adjournment and it may be discussed for half an hour but the Dáil shall not divide on any question after 8.30 p.m.  Another order prescribes that without notice a Motion may be moved before 6.30 that the Dáil sit later than 8.30 p.m., and I was asked recently, when a Motion of that kind was made, to declare under the Standing Orders whether a division could be taken later than 8.30.  I ruled that it could, because if it is possible to make a Motion to sit later than 8.30, it ought to be possible to transact business after 8.30 and that might mean taking a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question that a division should be taken after 8.30 ought not to be pressed.  Of course the Dáil could suspend any or all the Standing Orders, but I put it to private members that when questions are raised <Col N="1356" /> on the adjournment&mdash;there may be a heated discussion or there may be an ordinary discussion&mdash;usually such questions are raised without much notice. Let us take it that there is a disturbance in a certain part of the country; Deputies say that the Executive or officers of the Executive or some persons employed by the Executive did not do their duty, and the question is raised.  Now if you are to divide after 8.30 the question is whether or not you could beat the Ministry&mdash;it comes to that&mdash;and the Ministry regard it as that, and the man aggrieved regards it in the same way; whereas if there is to be no division the question is raised and persons can be reprimanded.  The Executive may not perhaps give all the satisfaction the Deputy wishes, but the Deputy may say that at least he has impressed upon the Executive the necessity of dealing with the case and it will be dealt with.  Now this Dáil is free from a good deal of the carping criticism that distinguishes other assemblies both in this country and in others, and to that extent there has not been any attempt to score. Now, if a Deputy raises a question which the Executive is not able to meet fully, and there is a division upon it, the Executive will naturally get a majority against that particular Deputy and then there is no reason for the Executive meeting it in any way, and I do not think that if questions are raised upon the adjournment and a possible vote taken, the private member will find himself in any better position than he is at present.  I do not think it is wise to alter that particular Standing Order just at the moment because I regard it as a certain sort of safety valve.</P>

      <P>On the last day on which this Vote was under consideration, I moved that it be referred back, but in consequence of a statement made by the Minister for Education, I withdrew that motion.  That statement was satisfactory, so far as it went, inasmuch as it contained a definite promise that further provision would be made to meet the claims of the secondary teachers. I would like, however, if the Minister would give us more detailed information with regard to the promise which he made. I would like, especially, a statement as to the particular form which this increased grant will take&mdash;whether it will be simply an increased interim grant, whether it will be made by means of grant, such as has been the case for the past few years, or whether he, in fact, proposes&mdash;as I sincerely hope he does&mdash;to provide a definite scale of salaries for these teachers. I am sure it will relieve the minds of those most interested if he is able to give the Dáil an outline of his intentions in that particular direction.  During the course of the discussion the last day, some remarks were made as to the value which the country is getting for the money which it spends on education. It has become fashionable of late to say that the country is not getting value for the amount of money being spent on education.  It is extremely difficult for even those who are most intimately connected with the administration of education to express an opinion on this question.  Education is not like other services, in which the results are immediately <Col N="1362" /> apparent.  It may take years&mdash; and it does, as a matter of fact, take years&mdash;before the full effect of a particular system of education is shown.  It is not when the boy is leaving school that the results of his education are apparent.  That should be quite obvious to anybody who gives the matter a little thought.  If people are not satisfied with the condition of education in the country at the moment, I would like that they would remember that they are getting now the results of the policy that was carried out ten or fifteen years ago in educational matters, when the provision made for education was very much less indeed than what is made now. The Minister for Education himself, on a former occasion, made it quite clear that it is not this year or next year, but in six, or seven, or ten years hence we will be in a position to say whether or not the country is getting value for the money now being spent on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey, in his statements with regard to the position of the particular teachers referred to in this Estimate, suggested the policy of what somebody called &ldquo;Robbing Peter to pay Paul.&rdquo; Deputy Gorey would not be so free, I suppose, in applying that same policy if Peter happened to be a farmer and Paul happened to be a labourer.  He would not propose that those who had a small share of land should be provided for by taking a share from those who had a larger amount.  I do not want to deal with many of the points raised by Deputy Gorey in that debate, because, like a good deal of what the Deputy says when he deals with matters of this kind, I think they were more or less irrelevant to the particular question at issue.  I do, however, deprecate the statements made and the distinctions which were attempted to be drawn between one particular type of education and another. I have protested on many occasions&mdash;I think those who spoke from the other side of the Chamber, and the Minister for Education especially, generally agreed with my statements in that direction&mdash; that it was wrong to make distinctions as between what was called primary and what was called secondary education. It is quite impossible to make any such distinction and it follows that it is equally impossible to make any distinction or to draw any comparison as between the work done by a particular class of teacher <Col N="1363" /> and the work done by another particular class of teacher.  The work done in the primary schools is not, as one Deputy stated, less onerous or less important than work done in the secondary schools. As far as the question of importance is concerned, if a comparison were to be made, it might be pointed out that, inasmuch as the great majority of our children never go to any other school than the primary school, and never have any other education provided for them, it is of the highest importance that their education in that department should be of the highest quality possible.  But I deprecate any such distinctions.  I do hope that this is the last time that we will have two distinct votes&mdash;one for primary and one for secondary education.  I hope that when the Minister comes before the Dáil again to ask for an Estimate of this nature, that he will ask for an Education Vote which will include all the various types of departments and schools for which provision should be made&mdash;not alone so-called primary and so-called secondary schools, but also technical schools, industrial schools, and schools for defective children, and all the various types of schools that are thought to be essential to the carrying on of the work of education in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thought I would like to give expression to, and it follows upon the statement of the Minister for Education himself.  He pointed to the fact that private bequests to education had not been the fashion of recent years, or perhaps of recent generations, and he urged that it might well be considered by those who are thinking of departing this life that in their wills they should take note of the needs of education and make provision accordingly.  It would be a pleasant speculation, no doubt, to enquire into the causes of that change in the habits and thoughts of the rich.  But I suppose one may say with truth, whatever the causes may be, that for a generation or so past people have come to think of the provision of education as being a communal responsibility, and that because of the very necessity for a general diffusion of education for the whole population that the responsibility ought to be a common and not an individual one. When bequests for education were general, the proportion of the population that had <Col N="1364" /> anything like an education, or that were considered to be fit for an education, was comparatively small; and I think it is one of the items that may count to the credit of modern society that there has been a recognition of the need for a minimum of education for every citizen. I suppose in the heyday of the mediaeval period it was not very common for every peasant to have a literary education, and I think some advantage is gained by the fact that the public have come to consider that a general diffusion of education is desirable and necessary, and as a consequence the trend of thought has been towards making the nation generally responsible for providing the means for education, and not relying upon private bequests.  It occurred to me when the Minister was speaking that in the absence of that practice of making private bequests for education in the wills of the wealthy a device has been invented which he might take advantage of.  I suppose it is the practice of the Minister for Finance to take credit for Death Duties and to collect those duties.  I suggest to him that he might enter into a compact with the Minister for Finance and, even at the cost of increasing those Death Duties, he might arrange for ear-marking such a proportion as he thinks the rich ought to provide for educational purposes.  He might earmark that proportion of Death Duties for educational purposes.  Then his public object would be achieved, even though the private benefactor may not obtain the pleasure that writing a will bequeathing certain sums for education might provide him with.  The end would be obtained perhaps, though the means might be different. I commend that suggestion to the Minister, and hope that he will succeed in persuading the Minister for Finance to act in that direction.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Connell, it is not my intention to propose at this particular stage a definite scale of remuneration for secondary teachers.  What I did hold out was an improvement of the grant or grants in aid of the remuneration of the secondary teacher.  The other question of setting up a definite scale for the remuneration will have to await some more fully considered measure than the bringing forward of this addition to the amount already proposed in the Estimate.</P>

      <P>I hope that the definite announcement of this, as it deals really with a money grant, will be made in due form by the Minister for Finance.  With regard to the other point raised, I am glad to see that Deputy Johnson does not misunderstand me, as I have been misunderstood, through the indistinctness of my voice, by persons in other quarters, as having suggested that the improvement of the position of secondary teachers should be cast on private benevolence.  I never suggested anything of the kind.  I think, however, the Deputy's rather historical sketch on that subject is not quite accurate.  If you go back to the Middle Ages to which he referred, I think you will find that very few of the great and the wealthy, who represented the rich of the present day, were able to write their names.  They were not educated at all, and they did not think of education; and the foundations, the endowments made by benevolence in those times went mainly to the education of the poor.  Nearly all the celebrated names of educated men which have come down from the Middle Ages to this enlightened and industrial age in which we live ourselves, are men without family history, men whose history began with themselves, the children, for the most part, of poor men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform us, as the matter is very interesting, whether the education given to these persons was very widely diffused?  Was it general, or was it selected youths that were taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was not so widely diffused.  The idea of universal education did not exist at that time.  At all events it was not carried out. It was more or less a matter of accident of locality, and so on, what particular number or section of the public these benefits reached.  No doubt we have come to a time when it is accepted among all countries and among all peoples that education up to a certain stage, or an uncertain stage, should be made universal; and when we accept an idea like that it <Col N="1366" /> is necessary for us to avoid confusion and to suppose that education has ceased to be an individual duty because it is placed on a communal basis.  That, at all events, is an idea to which I find myself radically and incontrovertibly opposed.  I hope to see, in the future that we have to look forward to, the responsibilities of the individual in education very much more recognised than they have been in the recent past.  One thing more I add.  I take this opportunity of adding that I hope to see the activity of the State, and especially the controlling activity of the State, in these matters at all times kept to the necessary minimum.  I do not know that there is anything that I have to add.  As I said at the commencement of my remarks, the actual proposal in due order to provide for the increase, in whatever form it will take, must come before you in due course from the proper quarter.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat unfortunate that Estimates of such surpassing importance as these should come before a jaded Dáil of some twenty members.  There are a great many very important questions, which I for one should be very glad to pass over, but it is utterly out of the question that they should go unnoticed in the present Debate.  For me, as a representative of the National University, <Col N="1367" /> there are at least three outstanding questions of great importance, though not of equal importance.  The first is the position of the National University, the second is the question of the building debt, now pressing heavily on University College, Dublin; and the third, last but not least, is the question of the remuneration of the staffs of the three constituent colleges of the University, the College in Dublin, the college in Cork, and the College in Galway.  With your permission, I will deal first with the National University.  It is not mentioned at all in the Estimates; no provision is made for it.  Now, on all hands I find an extraordinary lack of knowledge as to what the nature of the National University as an Institution is, and what the relation is in which the constituent colleges stand to it. Many who read these Estimates come to the reading with the impression already formed that University College, Dublin, is the National University. Others speak to me about the position of the staffs in the University of Galway, and I know in Cork that 99, if not 100 per cent. of the citizens refer to the college there as the University.  I think that, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, it is right that I should indicate why the National University exists, and is left out of these Estimates, because the question has a very material bearing upon the second, and in comparison with it, the more important point, the building debt on University College, Dublin.  Deputy Johnson spoke of the Middle Ages, and that rather gives me an excuse for going back a little into the earlier periods of history. An attempt was made to establish a University in Ireland for the Anglo-Irish as far back as the 14th century by the Archbishop of Dublin at that time.  There had, as we know, been great Universities in the Gaelic period before the coming of the Norman, but it is a strange coincidence as regards the figure 4 in this history, that in the 14th century the attempt was made by Pope Sixtus IV. to set up a University here, just as Universities were set up by the Papacy in Scotland. Edward IV.  attempted to create a University for the Norman settlers in Drogheda, and his attempt would have been successful but for the Wars of the Roses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I mention this because I want to show history repeating itself as regards the building debt of University College, the effect of a great war to dissipate the efforts for the creation of Universities in Ireland.  Owen Roe O'Neill, who was not only a great general but a statesman of very conspicious ability, had a project for setting up four Universities in Ireland.  There is the possibility of four Universities being set up in Ireland, as in Scotland, again; I do not want to go into contentious matters. Deputy Figgis draws my attention to the figure 4 on the Orders of the day, as a further item in this coincidence</P>

      <P>It used to be. The college of the Holy and Undivided Trinity was founded by Queen Elizabeth and an amended Charter was given by Charles I.  That became modern history when the attempt was made by Mr. Bryce, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, to meet the demands for higher education on the part of Catholics by setting up what appears to have been contemplated by King Charles, a second College in the University of Dublin.  This became a problem of living interest only a few years ago.  There were advocates for Mr. Bryce's schemes, which the late Professor Mahaffy, afterwards Provost of Trinity College, always denounced as the sprawling University system that is known as the Federal University system.  According to Mr. Bryce's scheme, Trinity College and the Queen's College in Belfast, the Queen's College in Cork, and the Queen's College in Galway, and the new College to be created for Catholics in Dublin, notwithstanding the geographical distribution being so obviously against such a thing working academically with any good result, were all to constitute the one University.  Fortunately for education and for Trinity College, not at all two antagonistic things by any means, Mr. Bryce's scheme was defeated; but what was hoped to emerge from it did not result, the second college in Dublin University.  We had always asked on behalf of Catholics for a College with University powers similar to Trinity College.  The result of our agitation was that the Presbyterians of Ulster got a College with University powers, although <Col N="1369" /> they had protested they wanted no change, and the sprawling university was created for the Catholic majority. The federal system was set up for us, with the result that we have the National University which is really constituted by the old Queen's College, Cork, renamed the University College, Cork, also the Queen's College of Galway, renamed the University College, Galway, and the new College set up in Dublin, University College, Dublin.  In addition there is the college of St. Patrick's Maynooth, which the Dublin College recognises so as to bring it within the scope, partially however, of the University work.  The National University is a sort of clearing house, if I might borrow the expression from banking, for those constituent colleges, but there is this obligation that the degrees for which all or most of the lectures in the constituent colleges are preparatory are degrees of the University&mdash;the examinations for degrees are University examinations and are conducted in each constituent college by the Professors of the college.</P>
      <P>Now, the endowment of the National University was nearly £10,000, and the Charter of the University imposes on it, as regards its examinations for Degrees and University distinctions, that for every examination in every subject included in a Degree Course there should be employed an external examiner.  The result is that while it imposes a heavy financial burden upon the very limited resources of the University, it at the same time, I must admit, has raised the value of the College universally, and the Degrees of the University, because&mdash;and this holds good, not merely in Medicine, but in all the Faculties&mdash;only the most distinguished scholars, sometimes from Trinity College, sometimes from other Colleges or Universities of the same standing in Great Britain, are engaged for the work.  I brought the figures with regard to this because, after all, it comes down to figures in the end, no matter how interesting the past history may be.  The endowment of the National University is £10,000 a year.  The cost of fees for external examiners was £4,428 last year; in round figures one might say £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another limitation, if I may call it so, imposed by a Statute upon the University.  No programme of studies, no course for examination, no arrangements whatsoever bearing upon examination, <Col N="1370" /> can be made by the Senate, which is the Governing body of the University, until reports have been received, first from the Academic Councils of each constituent College, and then from a body called the Board of Studies.  Now this Board of Studies is a little Parliament. In point of members and representative character it represents the Academic Councils of the Constituent Colleges. Travelling and hotel expenses have to be paid for the members of the Board of Studies when they carry out their work in Dublin as a University Faculty Committee, and the cost last year for the travelling and hotel expenses of provincial Senators and members of the Board of Studies was £1,076.  Then the printing of examination papers was over £2,000.  You will not be surprised when I add to these figures a statement of the amount of the overdraft of the University at the Bank.  The overdraft has been steadily increasing, and it stands at the figure of £7,000.</P>
    <P>That is the position of the National University of Ireland, with an endowment of £10,000, with a duty imposed on it by its Charter of employing the highest scholars&mdash;and consequently at the highest rates that rule in academic circles&mdash;and with the charge of providing for the examination work of all the Constituent Colleges.  It is in debt, and it cannot possibly get out of debt by any contrivance whatsoever.  In the Estimates for University Education it does not appear at all.  I am glad to see Dublin University or Trinity College has not been treated with that neglect.  Only a few weeks ago the Minister for Finance came to the rescue, in a small measure, no doubt, of Dublin University by transferring to it the fruit of a sum which had accumulated under the Land Act and which had been originally provided to free it from whatever losses might accrue through depreciation in its properties and land in Ireland.  It has got a small Vote in addition in those Estimates. I remember, when the Land Bill was introduced, Deputy Thrift made a hurried calculation that the effect of it upon the Institution, which is honoured by having him as one of its representatives, would lose some £5,000 a year.  The representatives of our University are not terrified by the passing of Land Acts.  We have no land; we have no accumulated capital. That holds good more particularly of the <Col N="1371" /> new college which was created in Dublin. We began at zero.  We had no land, no buildings, no equipment, nothing only the annual grant, and we are to compete in friendly rivalry with an Institution that goes back to the days of Elizabeth, with a rich foundation, and an accumulated capital that some of us calculate&mdash;though I am sure it will be contested&mdash;as worth over £300,000 or something like £350,000.</P>
    <P>So much for the University.  That University is of the federal type, and it is notorious to anyone acquainted with the history of University development that the federal University has always been a sort of cocoon arrangement out of which should develop newer University Institutions.  In recent years in Great Britain you have seen developed what are called the Civic Universities.  You have University Institutions in Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield and Bristol, of the same type as University College, Dublin.  Some of these merged from being constituent Colleges of a common University.  That was the incubated stage which they passed.  It is common knowledge here that University College, Cork, has long aspired to become the University of Munster.  Many of us who belong to the University College of Dublin would like to hasten the day of that evolution.  There is no more reason why Munster should not have a University of its own than that Manchester or Sheffield or Bristol should be provided with one.  I notice the Minister for Finance smiles.  The Minister for Finance is so pre-occupied with great questions of State that naturally he has not had time to give to the consideration of University development, and he has not had the opportunity, naturally, of seeing how much of late the truth has been borne in upon the British mind that it was the State devotion to the University development that almost gave the victory to Germany in the great war,.  John Bull woke up and realised that unless he devoted a large amount of his public treasure to the development of higher education, he would be beaten in the next encounter, beaten not in the field so much as beaten in the great war of commerce and industry and development upon every line of modern progress.</P>

      <P>I could if it were relevant, but for the moment I am merely the beggar-man.  Afterwards, perhaps, I may suggest where the begging is to be done.  Now, the building debt of University College is a war debt, and I must apologise for the almost sordid details, as they call them in the newspaper accounts, of domestic budgeting that only ends in bankruptcy.  When the Irish University Act was passed creating University College, Dublin, a Constituent College of the National University and providing that the hitherto Queen's Colleges should likewise be Constituent Colleges of the Common University, a sum of £150,000&mdash;mark the munificence of this&mdash;was voted to building and equipping &mdash;not to build merely&mdash;the two new institutions.  At the time, the College of Science and Government Buildings for housing the Department of Technical Education and Agriculture, were being put up at a cost of £450,000.  For a University College and its proper equipment as a College to develop scientific study upon modern lines, a sum of £150,000 was provided.  We had to divide that sum between the two institutions. I have tried to indicate the character of the University by speaking of it as a clearing house for the Colleges. £40,000 only was allotted for the purpose of the University.  That left £110,000 for the building of the University College, in a year in which the University of Edinburgh was spending £200,000 on one chemical laboratory for four hundred students.  The public in Ireland do not realise what it costs to build a modern laboratory.  The equipment for electrical engineering in the building alongside of us&mdash;a building from which it could not be removed&mdash;represents more than a quarter of a million of money.  The effort to remove it from where it now stands would, it is estimated, depreciate it by at least £30,000, and that is a very small estimate.  It costs from £28,000 to £30,000 to equip one ordinary laboratory in the University of Berlin.  What did we get along with our £110,000?  In consideration of the £40,000 given for the building of a University building, which has never materialised, we were given the old premises in Earlsfort Terrace, which were erected in the 'sixties for Exhibition buildings.  They blot the site.  We were able to remove only portion of them.  The remaining portion, which we could not <Col N="1373" /> afford to remove, stands within twenty feet of our principal laboratories at the back of the new buildings in Earlsfort Terrace.  They blot the light and the air and spoil the planning of any future developments, yet we cannot afford to take them away.  There they are, an incubus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not bad enough that we should have a site to clear and £110,000 with which to build a new University College. When we got out plans, conceived on a very moderate scale indeed with a view to what we thought would be the limit of our expansion educationally&mdash;a limit beyond which we have gone in recent years to an extent that none of us could have dreamed of&mdash;the Architect's plans for such a modest institution were such that it was calculated between £165,000 and £200,000 would be required.  Whereupon we cut our coat according to our cloth. We arranged to build about £68,000 worth believing, as prices then were, that we could make some sort of equipment with the remaining portion of our £110,000.  That stage was reached at a very unhappy moment when the great labour strikes of 1913 were raging in the City.  We found it difficult to get the work proceeded with, and we had barely got portion of our building up when the great war of 1914 broke out.  As many of you remember, there was emergency legislation introduced that allowed contractors to escape from their contracts if they were not able to carry them out without loss.  We were put in this unhappy plight, that with a large part of one block of our buildings already erected but not roofed, and the contractors demanding increased remuneration, and threatening&mdash;I use threatening not in any sense of finding fault with them; it is a shorthand phrase for what happened&mdash; to remove the great plant which it would cost enormous sums to take away, and more enormous sums to put back again, we had to agree to a new contract on much more onerous terms.  To cut the thing short, the small portion of building that we have already erected has cost us up to the present £155,000.  In that we have provided not one inch of space for anatomy, nor for the great sciences that underlie the science of medicine at the present hour, with the sole exception of the small laboratory for physiology. This is a thing which I am satisfied the public would not credit, that while those <Col N="1374" /> charges for building increased, the British Treasury, that came to the rescue of similar institutions in England that were suffering material loss to recoup them for their losses, ordered us to supply the additional charges out of savings, if you please&mdash;out of economies from our endowment.  The Minister for Education knows quite as well as I do how feasible it was to make economies out of the annual endowment for University College, Dublin.  The Minister and I became colleagues in the University College at that period, and both of us were strongly of opinion&mdash;I do not know as regards the Minister, but I am still of the same opinion&mdash;that it was our duty to the people of Ireland to have proved up to the hilt the contention that we made at the time, that the endowment was so ludicrously meagre that it could not be worked with, and that our proper policy should have been to run the College straight into bankruptcy.  However, I think we were a minority of two.  What was the result?  We paid our Assistant Professors year after year the munificent salaries of £180.  There has been a good deal of talk here in the last few days&mdash;and I myself have joined in it&mdash;with regard to the remuneration of secondary teachers. But think of the position of Assistant Professors in the National Institution! University College supplies the educational need, not merely of the City and County of Dublin, but of a large area extending into Ulster and across the Midlands, even encroaching upon Munster itself. Our Professors were paid from the beginning on a lesser scale than the Professors in the College of Science. Those salaries we were told were only initial.  Mr. Birrell said at the time that no doubt the endowment was insufficient. We were to show what we could do, and more money would be forthcoming.  The first little increase we got was 10 years after the first institution of the new College, and then we got it through the Universities Grants Committee at a time when all the University Colleges in England and Scotland were having their condition inquired into and relief was being given to them.  At the present time in Queen's University, Belfast, there are 18 whole-time Professors, and each of these has a salary of £900 or upwards.  In the University of Liverpool the University Lecturer has £700 per year.  I need hardly say that the <Col N="1375" /> National Institutions in Ireland have to be satisfied with far less.  What is the result?  Only men who, for patriotic or other motives, are devoted to work in Ireland, can be retained in the services of the College.</P>
    <P>I mention that, in connection with the building debt on University College, to point out that we could not possibly, at a time when those of our Professors who were well enough off to have Life Insurance policies were selling them&mdash;two of my colleagues to my own knowledge were selling their furniture in order to meet their bills&mdash;come to the assistance of the building debt.  Meanwhile, the Bank overdraft was piling up interest, and the Treasury callously told us that it had warned us if we went on with our building in the war period we should meet the extra cost ourselves.  Had we done the other thing and left the College without a building, or the portion of the structure already erected to the mercy of the weather all these years, we should have been accused of wanton extravagance. We should have been told by the Minister for Finance, possibly, that we were bad business men.  Now, the building debt on University College, at the present time, is between £20,000 and £30,000.  I maintain, and my colleagues maintain, that that properly should be regarded as a war debt to be borne by the British Exchequer, and that in whatever settlement is being effected as a financial settlement between Great Britain and Ireland, it must be so dealt with by our representatives. We cannot carry on as a first-class institution as fully as we are in a capacity to do&mdash;except as regards limitation of material resources&mdash;with the building we have.  It is utterly impossible. We have outgrown, even as regards the Departments to be housed, the existing buildings.  I have some figures here which the College made out and presented to the Minister for Finance.  In our first year we had a total of 530 students.  At that period we looked forward to some day having 700 students.  Then we had 695, 765, 888, 871, 939, 953, 1,017, 1,086, 1,147, 1,332, 1,317.  The cost of running the College is particularly small.  I think it necessary to inform the Minister for Finance and the Dáil of that fact.  We have not been bad business men in the carrying on of the work of the College. If he compares the figures and the cost <Col N="1376" /> per head per student of administration in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol, or even in the parsimoniously administered University Colleges of Oxford and Wales, he would find that ours is the most economical.  Our administration costs £5 per head.  The cost by way of salaries expended upon the teaching staffs runs up to £90 per student in some of the English Civic Universities.  With us it is below £50.  I do not like, as it is so late, to keep on with details on this question, and yet I feel that it is my duty, and one not to be shirked, to the University and to the Colleges to give the public some slight idea of what the financial position is.</P>
    <P>Professors are supposed to be men with no needs, no ambitions, no place in life whatsoever, and that any sort of remuneration is good enough for them.  That was not the idea in the great expanding countries of the Continent, and in the eastern side of the United States.  Not by any means.  We have in University College, Dublin, a staff of 53, full-time, that is, 33 full-time Professors, and a certain number of lecturers, and a certain number of assistants.  During the great years of strain no bonus was paid to anyone in University College, Dublin, except to the laboratory porters and the women who sweep and wash the corridors. The Civil Service officials of high and low degree had received their third bonus before that little sum I speak of came to us through the Universities Grants Committee, when we had been working on our meagre endowment for fully ten years. We realised, as every institution did, that the pressure of the higher cost of living and depreciated value of money came more upon and was harder to endure by those in receipt of smaller salaries, and so we devoted our attention to raising the income of the assistants and lecturers. We have joined in the scheme which has been adopted in similar institutions in Great Britain as to the initial salary for assistants and for lecturers.  Every Deputy here has received from University College, Galway, a printed document; and if he were to take the trouble to study it without relation, as it must be studied in relation, to the prevailing scales of remuneration elsewhere he might come to the conclusion that those men are paid abominably in University College, Galway, and University College, Cork, and that they were paid remarkably well in University <Col N="1377" /> College, Dublin.  Now I have dwelt upon the wrongs of University College, Dublin, first, in order to put the thing in a better perspective.  In these tabulated lists you are given in University College, Galway, three whose salaries do not exceed £300; one whose salary does not exceed £400, and these are the assistant lecturers.  There are two lecturers in Galway who do not exceed £400; in University College, Cork, there are only two lecturers that are between £400 and £500.  In University College, Cork, there is only one professor with between £300 and £400; two between £400 and £500; twelve between £600 and £700, and five that have over £800; these are in professional subjects.  Now I have already dwelt upon the fact that University College, Galway, has always found it very difficult to retain the services, for more than a few years, of highly qualified men.  University College, Galway, has been used merely as a stepping-stone for younger men on the road to advancement in the British or Dominion Universities. That is not good for education.</P>
    <P>Now as regards the subject of science&mdash; those great agencies of modern expansion that are as necessary to the development of the country to-day as petrol is to the driving of a petrol-propelled engine.  It is impossible to think that when a student in one of these institutions has obtained high university distinction and looks about him that he will refuse&mdash;say one of our chemists&mdash;that he will refuse the offer of a great steel manufacturer in Sheffield who desires his services and would say &ldquo;No, I desire to give my best years in the service of my college on half or one-third of the income that I might derive elsewhere.&rdquo; You will not get sacrifice of that type from more than a very infinitesimal fraction of the men brought up in the university colleges.  Now the Minister says where is he to get the money.  There is money for everything&mdash;millions of money to buy out the landlords and transfer the ownership to the tenants, which is a most admirable and commendable thing.  There are millions of money for all sorts of services.  But observe the symbol of the thing as here visibly before you to-night. It is the University Estimates that come last; always the University last.  But in any other civilised country in the world the University comes first and as a prior charge.  How are we, I ask this Dáil, to carry on University work year after <Col N="1378" /> year with the public authorities telling us that we must be satisfied with the meagre endowment that we have and the wretched equipment; that there is no money for us?  Money can be got; money would be got.  I do not believe that the Irish people here or beyond the seas have any idea of the way in which their country's future is being defeated, unconsciously and unintentionally, but none the less genuinely, being defeated by the attitude taken up by those who ought to be interested in the educational expansion of the country.  We spend nearly four millions a year on what is called public education. I would not propose to diminish that by one penny, but what I want to do is to get the public in Ireland to realise that they are going the wrong way about creating an educational organisation in this country.  It is a fallacy that I encounter everywhere; I am tired dealing with it for the last 20 years.  We are told about the foundations being laid, and the walls raised and the house roofed.  That is the most misleading illustration or metaphor ever advanced.  That is the order in which instruction is imparted to the child and the growing youth who get a certain initiation at the primary stage, as it is called.  When he eventually reaches the University, if he does ever reach the University, the work there is to build upon the work done in the secondary and the other schools, and if that has been bad it is impossible for the University to do its work.  But when we are creating an educational fabric for the nation we do not begin, no one would dream of beginning, at the lower stage. We begin with organising the University because from there must come the teachers and must come the influence that will create the programmes, courses, methods, and everything in short, of policy in education.  And here we are year after year listening to these&mdash;I will not use the adjective I was going to&mdash;wretched fallacies that we are doing great service to our people when we are providing them with a knowledge of the three R's.  What we have stood for here is for the provision of education.</P>
    <P>I shall, of course, be told, as it is the custom to tell a professor talking about any subject, that I am a visionary.  But, there are visionaries who know nothing of the facts, and who have not made themselves acquainted, and are not in a position to make themselves acquainted, <Col N="1379" /> with the facts of what is done for higher education in other countries.  The Minister for Education, speaking on the Intermediate Estimates the other day, spoke of the pious founder.  Look at what the pious founder has done in America!  The John Hopkins University. Look at what the pious founder has done in our own day, and in the Minister's own lifetime, in Bristol, where Mr. Wills, the tobacco manufacturer, has given princely sums to convert what was a small College into a great Institution.  But what happens in Ireland?  A man is on his dying bed, trying to make his peace with God in his last hour, and is asked by those with some authority to leave his money to&mdash;what has been irreverently spoken of as fire insurance&mdash;paying his premium on his policy very late.  But among all these charities there is never presented to him for his generosity the great nation-building charity of education.  Why?  Because it would never occur to anyone, except a professor perhaps, in this country that education was a charity, or that education was a great national concern, a thing of great national benefit and a great constructive force.  I daresay it is the last time I shall ever speak here on these estimates, and perhaps that will be my excuse for being so long.  I must say that I would have been much longer if I could have taken the opportunity of beginning earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to raise the question of which I have given notice.  It is to propose that all political prisoners and internees be afforded an opportunity to vote at the coming elections.  I raise this matter for two reasons.  The first is, that I have been requested by a very influential body to bring this question <Col N="1380" /> before the Dáil, a body that represents perhaps half the electorate of the country. That body is the Executive of the Irish Farmers' Union within the Saorstát, which met last week, and passed a resolution unanimously to that effect.  The Executive demanded the right that all political prisoners, and those in internment camps, should be given the right to vote at the coming elections.  The second reason is, that if those prisoners and internees are allowed to vote it will stop a lot of controversy, both before and after the election.  We shall be told by many sections and many parties that if those internees and prisoners are not allowed to vote it will not be a free election.  For that reason I would in press upon the Government the necessity of granting to these people the right to vote. If they are given that right it will certainly have the effect of stopping a lot of talk afterwards.  If they are allowed to vote, no one can gainsay the fact that the election was a free and unfettered one, whereas if they are deprived of the right to vote, that will be used as a handle by many sides and sections to declare that the election was not a free and an unfettered one.  I do not want to labour the question but I just wish to put these two points before the Government in favour of their allowing all political prisoners and internees the right to vote at the coming election.  We are not making a very large demand; we are not asking for any releases or anything of that sort, but simply the right for these people to vote at the coming elections.  I suppose many of them are untried and uncharged prisoners, and hence I think they should be allowed the right to vote.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> I should like to support the point of view put forward by Deputy Doyle. There is, so far as I can ascertain&mdash;and I have been to some pains to  out&mdash;a pretty general feeling in the country that prisoners and internees should be allowed to exercise their vote in the Election; that is of course those of them who have got votes.  I do not suggest, and I do not think that Deputy Doyle suggests, that those who have not got votes should be allowed to exercise the right of voting.  It is a desirable thing from every point of view that no excuse should be put in the hands of any section of people to create disturbance.  It may be answered that the argument of an un-free election is all nonsense.  On the other hand, depriving prisoners who have votes of the right of exercising them, will undoubtedly create a certain amount of bitter feeling, and feelings of bitterness have been dying down. We are accustomed to political somersaults of one kind or another&mdash;we have seen one or two within the last week&mdash;and should not be influenced by such things, but we should endeavour to take out of the hands of everybody the slightest excuse for disturbance at a time like this.  Personally, I think that the number of prisoners who would be likely to exercise the vote would not be very great.  Even if all the internees had votes and even if all of them exercised, or were allowed to exercise their votes, spread all over the country, they would not very materially affect the general issue of the election, or the issue in any particular Constituency. But the other and the bigger thing remains, that the giving of the right to exercise the vote would be a decent contribution to a clean, straight, open, and so far as it is possible in these times, peaceable Election.  For that reason I support the point of view put forward by Deputy Doyle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. ALFRED BYRNE Mr. ALFRED BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALFRED BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the case made by Deputy Doyle and Deputy O'Shannon.  I certainly think the Government ought to do everything that lies in its power to see that when the elections are over, nobody will be in a position to say that they were unrepresentative, or that the Dáil then elected was un-representative as a result of the prisoners being deprived of their votes.  I certainly think that the interned men should be allowed this right.  There is <Col N="1382" /> no Act so far that deprives interned, untried men of that right.  Somebody might ask: How can they vote without getting out?  Possibly some of them could vote on a temporary Postal Voters' List, prepared for this purpose.  I make that suggestion to the Government.  I do not think it is impossible.  Therefore, I support the views put forward by the Deputies who have spoken, and I sincerely hope that by the time the elections are on, or if not, very shortly afterwards; the Government will find itself in the position that they will be able to say the condition of the country is such that they can release the majority of the prisoners.</P>

      <P>The statement by Deputy Byrne rather suggests difficulties. I see quite clearly that there will be no possibility of meeting the points that have been raised, which I support emphatically, except by a one-clause Bill putting internees in the same position as soldiers; but I suggest there is a very much better way to meet the grievances, and that is release; not to wait until after the Elections, but to release before the elections. I think the demand that is made for the right to exercise the vote, which they have been conceded in the Constitution and through the Electoral Law, is one that they are perfectly right in demanding, not as a privilege and not as a matter of mercy, but as a right that has been given to them and which has not been taken away by any proved act of an unlawful character.  I do not suppose that one constituency would be affected by the results, very few at any rate. Nevertheless, if we are going to encourage the idea that the vote is a matter of importance to the voter, and that he should look upon the vote as something valuable, as symbolic of civic responsibility, then I think we should take this opportunity of adding to the force of that lesson.  I think that the plea that is put forward by Deputy Doyle is a reasonable one.  If men and women must be interned and continue to be interned over the Elections, then they should be granted the opportunity of exercising their right. If that can only be done by a Bill, then a Bill ought to be brought in, and they ought to be given the opportunity to exercise the franchise by post.  A much better method of meeting this grievance is a very general release.</P>

      <P>This matter is not one of prime importance, and it is one which is at present being looked into. Deputy Doyle has said that he had two reasons for raising this matter.  It seems to me, however, that his two reasons simply boil down into one.  He says that he believes it would save controversy if some arrangement were made to enable the internees to vote, and that his Association thinks it would stop controversy. I think that is a bit optimistic.  Some cause of complaint will be found by those people.  Last year they made a great deal of fuss about the Register, although it was a sufficiently good Register to get the general opinion of the country.  If arrangements are made for them to vote, no doubt they will complain that they were not allowed to speak to the people and to carry on their campaign, so that we will have the controversy anyhow. There is no question of depriving them of their right to vote.  Those who are on the University Register and would normally vote on the postal register will certainly be allowed to vote, no matter what may eventually be done about the others. What is proposed actually is that we make special arrangements to allow those people to vote when otherwise they would not be allowed to vote by post.  There is no real reason for that, except the desire to shut mouths.  The ordinary prisoner who is convicted of a crime is not thereby disfranchised, unless it is an Electoral crime. But we do not put him on the Postal Voters List to enable him to vote.  Even <Col N="1384" /> in the case of a man who is remanded, and who may be found not guilty and discharged, there is no provision to enable him to vote by post.  It comes down to a question of whether it is worth while trying to stop controversy.  A Bill would have to be introduced, and I do not think that it could be so simple a Bill as Deputy Johnson suggests.  We cannot put them in the same position as soldiers.  We cannot allow them to choose the constituency in which they would be registered. It can only be given to people whose names were on the Register for their own area.  It simply means that they be struck off there and be put on the absent voters' list in that constituency, and that they would vote in respect of the area in which they had been first registered. It would also be necessary to make some provision about the carrying on of the vote.  The law and the Constitution provide that the vote be by secret ballot. Anybody who knows these camps knows that unless certain provisions were made the voting would be far from anything in the nature of a secret ballot.  We know very well the bullying that goes on inside camps, and that there would be no freedom for the individual.  Consequently it would be necessary to have a Bill that would be more complex and more extended in character than a simple one-clause Bill, putting the internees in the same position as soldiers.  The matter is under consideration at the moment.</P>
