      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is aware that on June 19th a Sergeant of the Civic Guard ordered James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy, working a private unlicensed ferry with privately owned boats, to ferry cattle from Feighmane Farm, Valencia Island; whether, on the refusal of the ferrymen, the cattle were ferried across in their boats by the Civic Guard and military, and the two ferrymen were arrested and conveyed 50 miles to Tralee; whether the ferrymen and John O'Driscoll of Valencia, arrested next day, were charged before a Special Court for conspiracy and were remanded, the ferrymen being required to give an undertaking to ferry cattle in the meantime; and whether the Civic Guard have any authority to interfere in this way with the working of a private ferry.</P>

      <P>In February last John O'Driscoll was arrested and brought before a District Justice, charged with illegally removing cattle from the lands of his mother, Mrs. Ellen O'Driscoll. He was allowed out on bail on giving an undertaking not to interfere illegally with the land again.  It is reported that since that date O'Driscoll continued to conspire with others, including James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy with a view to preventing Mrs. O'Driscoll from using the land, or from having her cattle conveyed to and from the mainland.  Burke and Murphy are boatmen plying for hire between Valencia and the mainland; and while conveying the cattle of others, they refused to convey those of Mrs. O'Driscoll.  In consequence of this refusal they were warned that if they persisted they would be arrested and charged with conspiracy.  On the 19th ult., they again refused to convey Mrs. O'Driscoll's cattle, while accepting for conveyance the cattle of other people.  They were then arrested and with John O'Driscoll, were brought before a District Justice who allowed them out on bail on their giving an undertaking that they would not again interfere with Mrs. O'Driscoll in the management of her farm, and on a further undertaking by Burke and Murphy to convey her cattle at the usual charges when required to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to explain to the Deputy that a conspiracy against Mrs. Ellen O'Driscoll was on foot in which her son, John O'Driscoll was the prime mover, and in which James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy were participants.  The refusal to carry cattle from the island to the mainland while carrying the cattle of others was merely one phase of the conspiracy. Supplementary information which I have here, makes that, perhaps, clearer.  In February last John O'Driscoll was arrested and brought before the District Justice, and charged with the illegal removal of cattle from the lands of his mother, Ellen O'Driscoll. He was allowed out on bail on giving an undertaking not to interfere with the land again, and not to make any further claim thereto except by due process of law.  Since that date John O'Driscoll has been boycotting his mother, and is believed to have conspired with others, including James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy to prevent Mrs. O'Driscoll from using the land and having her cattle brought to the mainland.  James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy own a boat in which they ply for hire between Valentia and the mainland, and in which the cattle of the Islanders are carried.  These men, while conveying the other cattle, refused to convey the cattle of Mrs. O'Driscoll on several occasions.  The Civic Guard were instructed to warn them if they persisted they would be arrested and charged with conspiracy. On the 19th June a fair was held in Cahirciveen, and while James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy accepted for conveyance the cattle of others on the Island they refused to convey Mrs. O'Driscoll's. This is part of the conspiracy.  They were arrested, and along with John O'Driscoll who was also arrested, they were brought before the District Justice. They were allowed out on bail after giving an undertaking that they would not again interfere with Mrs. O'Driscoll, in the management of her land, and Murphy and Burke undertook to convey her cattle to and from Valentia at the usual charges.  These steps were necessary to break the conspiracy against Mrs. Ellen O'Driscoll in the management of her land.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that in a large number of claims for Unemployment Benefit in Newbridge Branch Office of the Labour Exchange no payments have been made yet, though some of the men have been signing up for eight or nine weeks, and, as a result, are suffering much privation and hunger; whether this delay in dealing with claims is due to the understaffing of the local office, only one clerk being employed; and further, whether the Minister will give orders to expedite payment to all claimants affected and take such measures as may be necessary to prevent such delays in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>ASSISTANT MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. J.B. Whelehan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given me ten cases in which delay has occurred.  In nine of these cases certain facts came to light which have rendered necessary an investigation of the claims in question. These investigations are not yet complete, but efforts will be made to bring them to a speedy conclusion.  Meanwhile, benefit cannot be paid on the current claims of the persons concerned.  The delay in payment is due to this cause and not to the under-staffing of the Local Office as suggested in the question.  In the tenth case there has been a question of the refund of contributions paid in error, and consequent on the refund the rights of the applicant to benefit which are dependent on the contributions remaining to his credit have had to be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a second clerk was appointed yesterday morning to that particular office?  Therefore, I think that the office was understaffed.  I would also like to bring under notice of the Minister that there are complaints coming in about that office for the last twelve months.  I would wish that he would see that the payments of claims are speeded up better than they were in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to point out to the Deputy that the ten cases in which he is interested, and which he has submitted to me are cases where investigation has been found necessary because of alleged certain practices on the part of persons making the claims.  The payment of these claims consequently cannot be due to want of staff in the local office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Intelligence Branch, the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his introductory statement yesterday, gave us a certain amount of information with regard to the existence of such a branch as this.  I do not know if I correctly interpreted him, but it seems to me that the chief service of the officers of this Branch in the Ministry would be to render information to traders as to the opportunities available in other countries, and that such intelligence would be most effectually made available by way of a trade journal, and that certain recommendations had been made by the Department to the Ministry of Finance that such a journal should be established.  I think it will be a matter of general agreement that a journal of this kind would be of the very greatest service to the trade and commerce of Ireland.  It would be of service, not merely to the traders in this country, but to those in other countries because we have always, in matters of this kind, to remember the fundamental rule that whatever exports occur have to be paid for by imports.  Therefore, if we cannot <Col N="986" /> encourage imports we are not in a position adequately and most economically to encourage an export trade.  Intelligence of this kind is as valuable to people outside this country who desire to do business with us as it is for people inside the country who desire to do business with nations outside.  Therefore, it would be agreed that the inception by the Department of such a trade journal is a very important one and one that cannot help to prove to be of the greatest possible value to this State.</P>
      <P>Yesterday when the matter was mentioned, we had not the opportunity or the advantage of having with us the Minister for Finance, who is in charge of the Department to which the proposal was put.  That advantage, which was denied us yesterday, has been made available to-day and perhaps opportunity might be taken by the Minister for Finance to let us know how his Department considers this proposal.  Deputy Johnson yesterday, somewhat mordantly but with plenty of justification by recent history, suggested that the formulation of such a project as this was one thing, but its fruition was entirely a different thing.  Therefore, I urge, in the first place, that somewhat full information as to the exact purpose of this Intelligence Branch may be furnished to the Dáil, both in the event of such a journal being established and in the possible event of its not being established&mdash;what then is the Intelligence Department to exist for, and how best can this information be made available to this country and outside countries?  In the second place I desire to inquire if the Minister will throw any light regarding the possibilities of such a journal being founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, in making a general statement on the Estimates, I referred to the Intelligence Branch of the Ministry, and it is hardly necessary to point out to Deputy Figgis that an Intelligence Branch is an Intelligence Branch, that its business is to collect information useful for the citizens and to distribute that information, when collected, to the best possible advantage. A method of doing that is at the moment under consideration in the Ministry of Finance, and I have no doubt that it will receive very full consideration at the hands of the Ministry.  I do not think that I can add anything to that statement at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring yesterday to get some information with regard to this branch of the Department.  I cannot congratulate myself that I was very successful in getting much or any information in a very knowledgeable form, but it was definitely stated that Consulting Engineer's salary, whatever it was, did not appear in this Department's Estimates, and it was suggested that it was a matter for the Ministry of Finance, and when I desired to get the terms and conditions of his appointment I was also referred to the Ministry of Finance.  Now, that is a little remarkable.  It is perfectly clear that no salary figures in these Estimates, and it is also quite true that no salary figures in last year's Estimates, but there was a Supplementary Vote attached to last year's Estimates, and in that Supplementary Vote appeared these words, &ldquo;a Supplementary Estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31st March, 1923, to pay.&rdquo;  Then is set out a category of various items that are to be paid and amongst those items is this:&mdash;&ldquo;to pay the fees and expenses of the Consulting Engineer to the Government.&rdquo; That is in the Supplementary Vote last year of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  We are informed now that the fees and expenses are not now under this Department, but they were in this Department, apparently from those words, so late as a Supplementary Estimate that had to cover expenses up to the 31st March of this year.  It is very definitely and distinctly stated that the fees and expenses were the fees and expenses of the Consulting Engineer, whereas we were informed yesterday that he was not a person, but a firm.  That, I think, is another change that requires a certain amount of explanation.  I wish just to emphasise that before I pass on. Last year the fees and expenses of an individual, who has since become, apparently, a firm, were charged in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that is now no longer the case, and it was indicated yesterday&mdash; I want to be perfectly just to the Assistant Minister that he did not say so, but, at least, to my interpretation he suggested&mdash;that these fees and expenses that appeared last year under the Ministry <Col N="988" /> of Industry and Commerce, this year are to be found under the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>I looked through the Vote for the Ministry of Finance, and I failed to find there any such Vote at all.  I am, therefore, moved to inquire whether any fee is paid to this firm or individual at all, and, if so, if such salaries are being paid, what they are and where they appear, and on what scale they have been framed.  If it should be the case, as I think very possibly, that no salary is paid, and no fees appear anywhere, then I think we ought to be informed in what way the Consulting Engineer gets his remuneration. I am bringing this matter forward here as a Deputy, and it is not a very pleasant duty.  I have been urged to do so because I am authorised to say that the position of Consulting Engineer has aroused a great deal of perplexity in the profession as a whole, and the matter has been receiving the very earnest attention of the profession. It is a remarkable fact that the Consulting Engineer, acting as a Civil Engineer, advising in matters of very great importance in Civil Engineering contracts, is not a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers.  That is an unfortunate occurrence.  I believe it should be asserted as a principle that a firm or individual acting as Consulting Engineer to the Government should be required to be a member of the Institute, or that particular branch of Engineering for which he is called to give his specialised advice.  There is a reason; it is not a question of <i>amour propre.</i>  It is not a question of asking him to fall into line with his brothers in the profession. There is an earnest desire for this.  I will read the rules framed by the Institute.</P>

      <P>There is a certain difficulty about the Vote. This is a Vote for money for the office of Consulting Engineer to the Government. Deputy Figgis is going into the question of the Consulting Engineer himself, and it seems to me to be a matter for arrangement whether we are to take the whole thing here as if the Consulting Engineer's salary were here or take the whole thing in another place, <Col N="989" /> where the Consulting Engineer's salary may appear.  Does it appear anywhere else in the Votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephWhelehan" hpid="Mr. WHELEHAN Mr. WHELEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Ministry for Finance bears all charges in connection with railway compensation and reconstruction and fees for advisory work in connection therewith, and the Supply Department will bear any costs arising under purchases, and it is in connection with the Vote for those matters that a Consulting Engineer's salary will arise.  I do not know what way he is paid.  Deputy Figgis alluded to the provision made in our Supplementary Vote last year for the fees of the Consulting Engineer.  It will relieve the Deputy's anxiety to know that at the time the Supplementary Estimates were compiled we were not sure that our Ministry would not have to bear the expenses of the Consulting Engineer, and consequently that provision was put in.  Eventually it turned out that we have to bear only the expenses of the clerical workers in his office.  Our Vote does not carry the salary or remuneration of the Consulting Engineer.</P>

      <P>In this matter I am speaking distinctly and clearly to book and at request.  It is a matter of indifference to me under which Vote I raise the question.  It did distinctly appear on the Supplementary Estimate that it was a matter for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I desire now only to know where I may raise this matter, which it is proper to have raised, if I may use the expression, to know under which particular thimble I am to find my pea.  The matter ought and requires to be raised.  If I can be told exactly how and where I can raise it I will raise it in that connection. But I do suggest it is not very candid to be posted from one place to another, and finally not to be allowed to raise a matter which is of urgency to people outside.</P>

If the Deputy wishes me to proceed further and be more candid I shall do so.  I have said that our Vote does not bear <Col N="990" /> or carry the salary of the Consulting Engineer.  It does not, and I hope the Dáil will agree with me that I am quite candid in the matter.

      <P>I am perfectly prepared, and I intend, to refer fully to the matter to which the Assistant Minister has referred.  It was my intention to have done so in order that the Dáil might know exactly where I stand in the matter.  I think the right procedure from me in the matter would be to move now, as I formally do, that the Vote be reduced by the sum of £807 in order to raise the question, on which no information is now available before the Dáil, and I desire to ask you, A Chinn Comhairle, whether I would be in order in raising this question now by moving a motion for the reduction of the Vote, and if I am permitted to do so the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce will find that there will be no lack of candour.</P>

      <P>This is a Vote for the office of the Consulting Engineer to the Government.  It seems to me that relevant to this Vote the question might be raised as to the necessity for a Consulting Engineer, as to what his duties are, and as to why he should be provided with an office.  But certainly if a Consulting Engineer receives, as we presume he does receive, fees or salary, the question of the Consulting Engineer himself should be raised where the payment for his services comes in.  Deputy Figgis will be quite in order to move to reduce the Vote by £807; that would certainly enable him to go into the question of the duties performed by the Consulting Engineer and the necessity of his having an office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I move the reduction of the Vote by the sum of £807.  If there is any necessity for such an office it can only arise, I think, by the necessity for having a Consulting Engineer, and if there is necessity for a Consulting Advisory Engineer then I lay it down as what would be recognised by the profession as a principle that that Consulting and <Col N="991" /> Advising Engineer should be a member of the Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not merely a question of professional feeling upon the matter; more is involved.  I will read out the regulations and the by-laws of the Institute, from which it will be seen exactly what protection is afforded to clients of such an Engineer by his belonging to such an Institute.  The first regulation is:&mdash; (1)  He shall act in all professional matters strictly in a fiduciary manner in regard to any clients whom he may advise, and his charges to such clients shall constitute his only remuneration in connection with such work.  (2) He shall not accept any trade commission, discounts, allowances, or any indirect profit in connection with any work which he is engaged to design or superintend or with any professional business that may be entrusted to him.  (3) He shall not, while acting in a professional capacity, be at the same time, without disclosing the fact in writing to his client, a director or member or shareholder in, or act as agent for, any contracting or manufacturing company or firm or business with which he may have occasion to deal on behalf of his client, or have any financial interest in such business.  (4) He shall not receive, directly or indirectly, any royalty, gratuity or commission on any patented or protected article or process used on the work which he is carrying out for his clients.&rdquo; The first three objects are a matter of some importance, and if any Consulting Engineer be so employed by any client, be they a Government, a firm, or an individual, they have the protection of the Institute that these regulations shall be observed.  That is why the profession has felt that it would be very desirable in the event of any Consulting Engineer being engaged by the Government that that Consulting Engineer should be a member of the Institute of his profession and of that particular branch of his profession in respect of which he is called upon to give professional advice.  We do not know what salary he is receiving.  It has been suggested outside that there is no salary; that his remuneration does not arise in connection with salary at all, but in connection with contracts, and therefore it is only right that the Dáil should know fully and clearly if the Consulting <Col N="992" /> Engineer has any direct contract with contracting houses or firms or whether all the contracts are contracts that will be placed by a Contracts Committee outside the direct interposition of any such person or anyone who acts with him.  We know, for example, the very large powers that are placed in the hands of such persons under the railway agreement, the memorandum of the heads of which has been placed in our hands.</P>
    <P>I read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Railway Company concerned shall furnish to the Government's Consulting Engineer such particulars as he may reasonably require, and he shall forthwith furnish a certificate showing the amount which he considers represents the expenditure reasonably necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All through this document, in fact, this person is appearing in a very necessary way, because if any person is to occupy this position he should have the large powers that are entrusted to him, but if those large powers are to be entrusted to any individual, if those very considerable authorities are to be entrusted to any individual, surely it is not too much to ask not only that he should be a member of the Institution of his profession, and that branch of his profession in respect of which he is asked to give his advice, but, furthermore, that he should be adequately remunerated by the State on a clear and recognised basis, and that he should be a whole-time official having no other connections, and should not be connected with other enterprises.  I do not know, but I believe it is true, that the firm or individual that is now acting in this capacity has no peculiar qualifications in the Civil Engineering branch, although it is perfectly true that he has the very highest possible qualifications that might be required in electrical matters, but it is not in electrical matters that the chief part of his advice is needed.  Several engineers are anxious to know, and have asked me to elicit, why it is that an electrical engineer should be called upon to give this advice, and not only to give this advice, but to follow this advice with regard to contracts. That is contrary to the procedure generally recognised as correct by the profession. I was told yesterday the name of the firm, and I would like to know if it is an English or an Irish firm.  The <Col N="993" /> firm was stated to be Messrs. Crowley and Partners.  Who are the partners?  I think I am correct in stating that the partners in this connection are an English house.  That is not perhaps a very considerable matter, because I believe we should take advantage of the highest possible information available to this State, and if information is not available from those of the requisite standard, from those who are citizens of the Free State, we should be free to go outside, but we should at least make an attempt to get those who have the necessary qualifications in the Free State.  Now, the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce charged against me that I was not, in bringing forward this matter for the reduction of this Vote, wholly disinterested. That is perfectly true, but it does not alter the fact that I have been asked to mention these matters here by those who are wholly disinterested.  What is the degree of my interestedness in this matter?  I will state it perfectly frankly, and put my position and the position involved before the Dáil.  I am connected with a certain company.  The Minister referred to that company when he was dealing with this Vote in his introductory statement.  I am interested in that company, and I have the honour to have as a colleague in that particular enterprise a Senator who is our greatest Irish engineer. We met the Government, and put the entire facts concerning that enterprise before the Government.  We informed the Government that there was no information at our disposal, no matter what it cost and no matter what experience it involved either with regard to finance or with regard to engineering, that we were not willing to put before the Government in all its details, and if the Government had required of us that we should put that information before it in all its details we should at once have said that the Government was doing only what the Government of a country should do, namely, to require of an enterprise that it should put its cards down upon the table, and we were prepared to do that.  But since that happened the Government's Consulting Engineer has promoted a company with a similar intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

      <P>And there is the rub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes says that is the rub.  That is the rub so far as a legitimate enterprise <Col N="994" /> is concerned, and I will deal with it, but let me say before I do so that before that situation had occurred I had been asked to raise this matter in the Dáil.  I had not intended to go into the other matter, except on reflection feeling that others might be tempted to say that is the rub.  I had intended to go into that matter and to put my cards on the table, which I now do with the fullest and completest candour.</P>
      <P>Let us see what is involved.  A company, never mind for the moment that I am connected with that company, is asked by the Government to put its information, which has cost it considerable expense to acquire, before the Government. The Government's Consulting Engineer is acting, however, in competition in the promotion of another company. Any information, therefore, that this first company puts before the Government, information which has cost it a great deal of expense, is at once rendered available for the rival company, and I think that is a situation that is not desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I spoke with interestedness in the matter, whatever my interest is, I frankly and honestly confess to it.  I nevertheless say that, on its merits, it is not right that a Government, going to any one company, should ask information of that Company when it has, as its Consulting Engineer, a person who is engaged in an enterprise of the same kind, so that the information which that Government reasonably asks is made over normally, naturally to its competitors. I do not believe that will make for commercial wisdom in the future of this country.  When I raised this matter, I want to say quite frankly, that I did realise, very fully and fairly realise, that during the past year there has been a very great deal of improvisation, necessarily.  No one could blame any Government for having improvised in matters of this kind and gone ahead as rapidly as it could, and I am not blaming them.  What I am saying is, if it should subsequently be found that the improvisation leads to commitments that are not natural, not right, not in the interests of frankness, not in the interests of industrial development or professional rectitude, that then the Government should say: &ldquo;We do not recognise this commitment, and as it appears to have been involved in our original arrangement, <Col N="995" /> made in the very best possible interests, we will end an arrangement that has resulted in such a situation.&rdquo;  Therefore, I do urge&mdash;and I think I am only urging what will appear to everybody, not only to engineers, not only to those who might be, as I have frankly said I am, interested, but to all parties as recognised principles in such appointments&mdash;that any person acting as Advising and Consulting Engineer to the Government ought to be a person who is amply recompensed, and being amply recompensed, however widely that word &ldquo;amply&rdquo; may be judged necessary, that the individual acting in that capacity should be removed from the industrial sphere and from the contractual sphere and should be a whole-time official of his clients&mdash;in this case the clients being the Government.  Then it would be possible to fulfil this regulation of the Institution of Civil Engineers&mdash; that his charges to such clients should constitute his only remuneration in connection with such work.  I have raised this matter, but I frankly confess to the Dáil that I had not been looking forward to it with any particular relish.  I did not desire to do so.  I have had a fair amount of experience as a speaker in various capacities, good and bad, and I am not very much afflicted with nervousness, but I have been to-day, because I would very much rather not to have undertaken the task to-day that I have done.  But the matter has been brought before me in such a light&mdash;whether it be interested or disinterested&mdash;that it is no longer evadable, and I have now discharged what I have conceived to be my duty by raising it in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephWhelehan" hpid="Mr. WHELEHAN Mr. WHELEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just to repeat that the Vote for the salary or fees of the Consulting Engineer does not appear in our Estimates, but in justice to the gentlemen who fill the office of Consulting Engineer to the Government, I think I should intervene here and say that the Consulting Engineer to the Government is a Consulting Engineer; he is not a whole-time Engineer. Who ever heard of a Consulting Engineer being a whole-time Engineer? Drop the word consulting, if he is a Government Engineer, if he is an official, but the Consulting Engineer to the Government is not an official.  The Government consults him, and from certain <Col N="996" /> experiences which I have had in consultation with him, has consulted him to the advantage of the common purse of the State, running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, in connection with one public company alone. He is a Consulting Engineer.  I have yet to learn that a Consulting Engineer must be a whole-time official of the Government.  What I do feel most about this is, that any Deputy in this Dáil will stand up and read out a code of regulations, setting out in detail the professional code for an Institute of Engineers, and by implication, for there has been implication, leave it to the Dáil to suggest that the Consulting Engineer to the Government has not observed that code; by implication suggest that the very thing which the code makes it incumbent on members of the Institute not to do, are done by this Consulting Engineer to the Government.  Now, I think it would become Deputy Figgis as a man, not to speak of him as a gentleman, better if he would repeat outside the Dáil, or in the public Press, a statement on similar lines to that which he has made here, under the privilege of the Dáil, about the Consulting Engineer to the Government. I, here and now, invite him to do so, and I promise him, when he repeats it outside the Dáil, I shall take the matter up, and see that the Consulting Engineer deals with it, or we shall deal with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is practically new matter to me, but I think the Minister has not dealt with the case made by Deputy Figgis in a manner the Dáil has a right to require.  Apart from the question of the status of the Consultant in his profession&mdash;that is, in the professional organisation&mdash;there is a statement made by Deputy Figgis that I think should be met.  That was, that the Consultant is not a Civil Engineer, but an Electrical Engineer.  If the Ministry have called in as consultant, to deal with civil engineering work, a man who is not a Civil Engineer, and are paying anything at all for that service, I think they are misusing public funds to that extent.  At least, I think they are spending the funds unwisely.  The second point that seems to call for attention is the statement that the Consultant is a promoter of a company, and that the rival company was asked&mdash; and this I want to have made clear, <Col N="997" /> whether it is true or not&mdash;to submit particulars relating to their proposed undertaking to the Government, so that the Consulting Engineer to the Government, who is promoting a rival business, will be able to read and take what he can out of them.  If that is true, then I think it is a misuse of the position, and I think the Consulting Engineer himself ought not to accept any such responsibility.</P>
      <P>The third point that was raised, not quite so directly, by Deputy Figgis was that the Consulting Engineer was rewarded through the medium of contracts which have been given, or may be given, such contracts being upon specifications that have been approved or drafted by that Consultant.  I hope I am not misinterpreting what Deputy Figgis alleged, but that is the allegation implied as I heard it.  If it is a correct summary of the allegation, it ought to be met.  The Minister in his opening statement did, as a matter of fact, claim credit for having called in, or rather having given assistance to firms or companies that were interested in the promotion of electrical supplies for the City and County of Dublin.  The kind of assistance that was given is not made known.  Whether it was the same kind of assistance to each of the companies concerned we do not know.  Was it engineering assistance? Was it consultation respecting finance, or respecting public rights or respecting the Government's attitude towards the schemes that these companies are promoting?  In view of what has been said and hinted at here, both by the Minister, in his reference to the consultations with these companies, or by Deputy Figgis, in his reference to the Consulting Engineer, I think the Dáil is entitled to a fuller statement from the Minister in charge of this Vote before we decide to vote for or against the proposed reduction.</P>

      <P>Deputy Figgis, I think, has asked who are they.  If he will put down a question to the Minister <Col N="998" /> for Finance he will have an answer, I am sure.  There is no foundation whatever, for saying that Deputy Figgis, or the company of which I understand he is a director, has been requested to submit schemes to the Government, nor that the Government would ask a firm stated to be interested in another rival scheme to consider it; none whatever.  In my opening statement I did refer to the services the Ministry had rendered to certain parties interested in electrical development. One was the Dublin Corporation, and another was the Company of which Deputy Figgis is a director. Both have had exactly similar advice from us, and I told Deputy Figgis, at the interview which he had with me in the Ministry, what exactly my attitude was.  The part of the Ministry was to render assistance in pointing out, so far as possible, what the procedure should be in regard to the promotion of any scheme of electrical development, and this assistance was given to anyone who approached us.  There was, perhaps, a third party.  People who are interested in hydro-electrical development, combined with peat, had the same facilities placed at their disposal.  That is the attitude of the Ministry.  That is all we have had to do with it.  Deputy Figgis was told that at any time at all it was open to him to promote a private Bill, and for the Dáil to pass that Bill or reject it.  The final approval of whatever scheme is put does not rest with the Ministry, does not rest with the Executive Council, but rests with the Oireachtas. I hope I have answered Deputy Johnson's points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I went into a number of matters, and I am sorry that all of them have not been dealt with as I think that they might have been dealt with.  I think it might have been accepted as a principle that if any person had been appointed as a consulting or advising engineer to a Government, and that person happened not to be a member of the institution in respect of that branch of engineering for which he was called upon to give advice, he should reasonably be required to get such membership before being continued in his position.  I stated that I had failed to find anywhere any method by which the consulting engineer was rewarded for his services.  I adhere to that.  It is obvious. <Col N="999" /> I have yet to find where he was to be rewarded as he should be rewarded, as any person occupying his position should be rewarded.  When I stated that he should be required to be a member of the institution, I did state that there were certain bye-laws and regulations which all members are required to fulfil, and I read all these bye-laws.  It is perfectly clear that any person who is a member of the institution is required to fulfil these regulations, and may be charged before any such institution if he fails to adhere to the principles it lays down.  The Assistant Minister states that I charged a failure in these regulations because I read out what the institution requires.  I fail to see how that construction could be put upon my words I have asked, however, and no answer has been provided, if contracts given, either in connection with this agreement with the railways, or any other large engineering tasks, were being given directly by this gentleman in connection with his duties; whether it was part of his duties, or whether it was not part of his duties, or whether all those contracts had to go to the Contracts Committee in the same way as all other contracts, and that the present Adviser had nothing whatever to do with the contracts in respect of which he advised.  That information had not been provided.  Deputy Johnson did not quite accurately interpret my words, which I chose very carefully, with regard to the schemes in the matter, where I frankly confessed I am an interested party.  I would like to say my being an interested party in that connection does not in any way reduce the position revealed by that interest. What I did say was that we had offered to give all information that might be required, and we are willing to give that information because we conceive that a Government should justly require such information.  But we also do say that a Government whose Consulting Engineer is the active promoter in the industrial sphere of a rival scheme does not hold that same justification for the demanding of the information which we so frankly tendered, and that is very obvious. In the interviews to which the Minister has referred he told us, with his ordinary, customary frankness, that it was the intention of the Government to observe as between all competitors in enterprise, <Col N="1000" /> either this or any other, an attitude of absolute impartiality.  We welcome that, and I am perfectly sure that it is the intention of the Department and of the Ministry to keep that attitude of absolute impartiality.  But I suggest that if a consulting engineer employed by the Government is to enter that sphere, that impartiality automatically becomes impossible, and therefore I suggest that the Government should do something to ensure that these engineers should be full-tone officials, with no other interests or activities.  The Assistant Minister formulated a challenge.  Most of the matters that I have referred to to-day have also been discussed between himself and myself, and I have forwarded him a letter to-day in which that information was put in writing.  He is at liberty to make any use of that letter, or the one that preceded it, that he judges desirable.  If the result of that correspondence should be that legal proceedings should be instituted, we shall be very glad indeed.</P>

I invite <Col N="1003" /> him also to tell us whether he expects any payment from the &ldquo;Daily Mirror&rdquo; as an advertising fee.  There was a total amount of £1,000 agreed to, and the final half of the expenditure, chargeable to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is to be paid out of this Vote.  I think it would interest the members of the Dáil and other people, particularly other newspaper people, to know what value may be expected from the Fair, and whether the &ldquo;Daily Mirror&rdquo; has assisted the finances of the State as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the expenditure on this Fair.</P>

Thirteen Irish firms exhibited there, and the report from those firms indicates that numerous enquiries were received from prospective customers during the Fair.

It was during the time the railway service between Dublin and Cork was dislocated, and we undertook to be responsible for any losses, to the extent of £1,000, that might be entailed in running the service between Dublin and Cork.  As a matter of fact, none of that money will be required. The service very probably made more than the expenses of working it. The Estimate was made out before the sum could be removed from it.</P>

I would like to have some statement from the Minister respecting the payment of these fees&mdash;whether <Col N="1005" /> there is any encouragement being given to firms in the Saorstát to accept these licences for the purchase and importation of dye-stuffs, and whether this £100 is merely an estimate or if it could be increased.

If it has, I think the Dáil would be interested to have a statement from the Minister as to whether any decision has been come to respecting the free importation of dye-stuffs from Germany, which have been prohibited under British legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present Session to amend the law relating to the occupation and ownership of land, it is expedient that the authority mentioned in the resolution on this subject adopted by the Committee on Finance on the 3rd inst., be extended so as to cover</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of a sum sufficient to pay to the Land Bond Fund in respect of Sinking Fund 5s. per cent. per annum on the nominal amount of all bonds issued for contribution to price and for the Costs Fund;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  the temporary advance out of the Central Fund of any sum that may be required for making good any deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund for payment from time to time of an amount equivalent to the purchase annuities accruing due in respect of advances made or to be made in pursuance of purchase agreements under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act. 1891, or any later Land Purchase Act other than the said Act of the present Session.</P>
      <P>A further Money Resolution has become necessary in connection with Amendments Nos. 5 and 8, which appear on the printed list which has been circulated. Paragraph (a) covers the charge on Public Funds that would be involved by the adoption of Amendment No. 5.  The Bill, as originally drawn, omitted to enact precisely how the money would be provided which was necessary for the Sinking Fund on bonds issued for contribution to the price and for the Costs Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) in the Resolution has to be read in connection with Amendment No. 8.  Since the Bill was drafted, further consideration has been given to the procedure which ought to be followed in dealing with purchase annuities arising from the Land Acts.  The responsibility for the collection of these rests with the Government, but the amount of the annuities, whether collected or not, requires to be paid over to the British Government for the purpose of meeting the interest and the Sinking Fund on the various Land Stocks.  On further consideration, <Col N="1007" /> we came to the conclusion that the provisions of the Bill did not provide an adequate working machinery for the purpose and the suggested amendment will meet that.  We provide for it by this Resolution.</P>

It would be for the Land Commission to say whom the rights would be let to.  If a farmer is a genuine fisherman the Land Commission would treat him as such and let him the fishery as the landlord did.

      <P>I am talking of a landlord letting to a tenant.  Will the State step in and prevent the tenant from buying?  There are several cases to my knowledge in which fisheries have been rented as part of the farm.  Am I to understand that these fishing rights will be acquired by the Land Commission? What will be the result?  Will the rent be reduced accordingly or will the tenant be deprived of these rights altogether, or can the tenant step in and buy?</P>

      <P>We want to be clear about what the Deputy means.  He does not suggest, does he, that any judicial or present tenant has any tenure of fisheries similar to that which he has of his holding?  I can imagine a present tenant or a judicial tenant getting yearly lettings of a fishery appertaining to his land.  The present tenant would have no tenure.  The landlord would take the rights up at the end of the year and, as far as I know, there is no case in existance where the present tenant has a certain amount of rent appropriated to fishery rights.  There is no holding that I know of or that exists where the rent of a holding is, say £50, and where the landlord of a present tenancy, or where the Land Commission has fixed £10 of that in respect to fisheries.  The rent of a present or judicial tenancy is purely in respect of land, and the tenure of fisheries is a separate thing.  The landlord who owns the fisheries lets them to anyone, not necessarily to the tenant, but often to fishermen and outsiders, such as rich men who like to come down to fish.  He may, in an odd case, rent them to a tenant, not by reason of owning the land but on conditions on which any outsider would take them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will be vested in the Land Commission and paid for separately by them, and it will be for the Land Commission to say who is best entitled to those fishing rights afterwards.  Take the first and usual case where fishing rights are appurtenant to land on the Shannon, or on any other big river and are being let to fishermen, and not to men who own the adjoining river at that spot.  In that case the Land Commission will let them to men who are making their living out of them.  Take the case Deputy Gorey suggested where the tenant took them as a separate letting.  It will be open to the Land Commission to consider his <Col N="1012" /> title as against any other man in the neighbourhood making his living out of them.  In that case the tenant will have no grievance because he never had any tenure.</P>

      <P>I never heard of a case of that sort.  It would be most unusual. If such a tenant were a present tenant and went into Court the only rent that could be fixed would be purely and simply the bare rent of his holding.  If the Deputy takes the case he has in mind and traces the matter to its origin he will find that the inclusive rent now had a distant origin.  Part was rent of the land and part of fishing rights, and it is a matter of convenience to pay all the rent on one receipt.  I am perfectly certain no one has the same tenure of fishing rights, as he has of a present tenancy. These fishing rights would be paid for separately.  If you have a case where a very small farmer is making his living <Col N="1013" /> out of fishing it will be open to the Land Commission to let the fishing rights to him when he makes application for it.</P>

      <P>We are at cross purposes. I am sure Deputies know cases where tenants have the right to fishing. My point is if they have the right to fishing, they have it as a separate taking. They might have a holding adjoining the river and might also have got from the landlord, fishing rights, but they have not it in connection with the holding; it is a different tenure.  There is no difference between the case of a man having fishing rights and having his holding near by, and the case where a man has fishing rights on the river, and lives 20 miles away.

      <P>In moving my amendment now I only propose to deal with this particular one and I leave the others to their merits, because they are all minor matters or side-issues of the same question.  I ask the Minister to accept this new sub-section because where it has been the custom between landlords and tenants for both mutually to agree to an abated rent, or a first term, then that rent is held to be the second term rent, or if the first and second term rents are fixed and afterwards a mutual arrangement is made and an abated rent is agreed by both parties, then that stands as a third term rent.  So, in the case of non-judicial tenants where the owner thought that the tenant would not go into court and where the landlord and tenant mutually agreed to a reduced rent, that reduced rent had to be the basis of purchase, and also with regard to arrears, purchase, and abatement in lieu of rent. This is quite a reasonable and sensible business suggestion.  On any properties that I know of, and I know several, especially the estate on which I live, the abated rent was the basis of purchase; the landlord never questioned it; it was a non-judicial estate where the tenants received substantial reductions on the condition that they did not go into court as a supplement to getting a fair rent fixed.  That abated rent was the basis of purchase, and in every case I knew it has been the basis of purchase, and the landlords having agreed to it through the abated rent, are not going back to the original rent as the basis of purchase or arrears or in lieu of rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to deal with the amendment as it stands, and to deal with it in connection with the clause to which it has reference.  At present we are dealing with arrears and payments in lieu of rent, and we will come to the question of prices afterwards.  The Deputy's intention is to ensure that where-ever there was a genuine agreement for an abated rent, that that shall be the rent, but his intention is defeated by his own amendment.  His amendment reads: &ldquo;For the purposes of this Part of the Act and of the Schedules attached to the Act, rent, whether on a judicial holding or otherwise, shall be understood to mean any abated rent accepted by a landlord for a period of at least 5 years previous to the first gale day of the year 1921, provided that such abatement was not given by way of payment for services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, apart from the question of payment for services, I suppose any number of specific reasons could be given as to why a landlord reduced a rent and gave an abatement.  The landlord gave an abatement, as the Deputy pointed out, for services rendered.  A tenant's holding perhaps may have adjoined a piece of untenanted land, and a landlord may have come to the owner and said, &ldquo;If you drive in my cows every morning, I will allow you a shilling in the £ off your rent.&rdquo;  That, I hold, is not a genuine abatement of rent.  Then, there might be a case where you had a reasonable landlord who had been on good terms with a tenant.  Let us suppose that the tenant died, and that the landlord went to his widow and said, &ldquo;I will allow you a 50 per cent. reduction on your arrears if you try and pull up a bit.&rdquo;  That, I hold, would not be a genuine abatement either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case it would be quite impossible to cover, by any general rule, the reasons or circumstances under which abatement of rents are given, and it will be quite impossible to provide directions for the Land Commission which would enable them, without having recourse to a judge, to say, in every case, whether abated rent was the real rent or not. Deputy Gorey's amendment states that an abated rent &ldquo;shall be understood to mean an abated rent accepted by the landlord for a period of at least five years previous to the first gale day of the year <Col N="1020" /> 1921, provided that such abatement was not given by way of payment for services.&rdquo; The five years to the first gale day referred to in the amendment would cover the years 1916 to 1921.  There were very few abatements in these years; in fact I think abatements were taken off during that period.  On the other hand, a man might have got an abatement for 10 years, and yet his rent would not be a real rent; there might be a case of a man who only got an abatement for one year, and in that case the abated rent might be a real rent.  It all depends, I say, on circumstances, and whether there was an agreement between the landlord and the tenant for a new rent, an agreement based on the value of his holding for rent purposes.  Deputy Gorey's amendment would rule out hundreds of genuine cases, and would let in hundreds of bogus cases. Amendment No. 18 on the Order Paper, in the name of Deputy Hennessy, covers the point much better than Deputy Gorey's amendment, and covers it in the only way in which it can be covered.  I am accepting Deputy Hennessy's amendment. Before I read the amendment, perhaps I ought to read the Section. The matter is dealt with in Section 20, Sub-section (3): &ldquo;Any question arising between a tenant and a landlord regarding the accuracy of any particulars furnished pursuant to this Section shall be determined by the Land Commission in accordance with rules made by them, save that in the case of a holding subject to a judicial rent the record filed in the Land Commission shall be final and conclusive in all matters appearing thereon, except that where the judicial rent was fixed before the 1st day of April, 1899, the adjustment provided for by Section 54 of the Local Government Act, 1898, shall be taken into account in determining the amount of rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy's amendment, dealing with the matter, reads:&mdash;&ldquo;In Section 20 (3), page 8, line 58, after the word `rent' to insert the words `and save that any question as to whether an agreement for an abated rent was in fact an agreement for a new rent or any question as to the amount from which the deduction of 25 per cent. is to be made in ascertaining compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent shall be determined by the Judicial Commissioner, whose decision shall be final.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>That enables the High Court Judge to <Col N="1021" /> take the circumstances into account, and to see whether in any particular case the abatement was given by reason of services rendered, or was given gratuitously by the landlord, or as an admission of the fact that the old rent was too high, and that the new rent should be fixed.  This is the only possible amendment that would cover all the cases, and that would do justice in all the cases.  It would be quite impossible to provide a form of words in an Act of Parliament that would cover all cases, some of which may be extremely complicated and varied.  There is no way of doing it except to leave it to a judge to say whether the rent is an abated rent or a real rent.  I am accepting Deputy Hennessy's amendment.  I could not accept Deputy Gorey's amendment, because it does not carry out the intentions which both of us have in mind, that where there is a genuine agreement for a new rent, that that shall be the new rent.</P>

      <P>This is not a question of a genuine agreement.  There are cases where you might have genuine agreements without at the same time having them in writing.  You could, for instance, have an agreement that had become the practice between the landlord and the tenant for years, and although there was no written document to show that such an agreement was in operation, the agreement would none the less be a genuine agreement.  Deputy Hennessy's agreement does not meet my point, because, in my opinion, it is a bit too technical.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey's amendment reads that the abatement granted in each of the five years preceding the year 1921, is to be taken as the abated rent, and to be the rent of the holding.  In one year the abatement might be twenty per cent., in another year fifteen per cent., and, perhaps, in another year twenty-five per cent., but suppose the landlord had, in fact, accepted the abated rent, but that the amount of the abatement had not been the same in all of these five years, the tenant, under Deputy Gorey's amendment, would not be entitled to get any abatement in the rent at all, because there would have been no abatement that would have lasted over the entire period of five years.  Under Deputy Hennessy's <Col N="1022" /> amendment it would at once become open to the Land Commission to fix what was a fair rent, and the proper abatement to be granted in such a case as that.  If Deputy Gorey's amendment became the law of the land, I am afraid the Court that would have to decide a case would say that there had been no abated rent for five years, and, therefore, would refer to the original rent and say &ldquo;We cannot deal with it in the equitable manner in which we would be entitled to do if Deputy Hennessy's amendment had been accepted.&rdquo;  Therefore, to meet Deputy Gorey's view, it seems to me that his amendment would require some alteration in the wording if it is to carry out the intentions he has in mind.</P>

      <P>The real trouble is that Deputy Gorey thinks no one but himself has the interest of the tenants at heart. I am not accepting this amendment, because it would be unfair to the tenants. I am not accustomed to exhibit my particular love for them in the Dáil.  Anyone who thinks about this would see that the five years from 1916 to 1921 would be obviously unfair to choose, as practically all the abatements were taken off.  There are hundreds of cases where you would have a genuine agreement, and the Deputy should not jump to the conclusion that the agreement must be in writing.  These agreements are never in writing.  I venture to say there is not one single agreement in writing in Ireland.  The new rent <Col N="1023" /> agreement is on the face of the receipt That is the only evidence of an agreement that you have.  I should not say evidence of an agreement, as it is not the only evidence, but it is the only writing in connection with this question that you have got.  There is never an agreement in writing in these cases.  The only writing in connection with the abatement would be on the face of the receipt.  So it is not a question of an agreement in writing.  As I said, there are a great many reasons for abatement peculiar to every landlord and every tenant.  There are a very large number of tenants who have got genuine abatements by reason of the fact that the landlords admitted that the rent was too high, not by reason of the fact that they had performed some service was continuing, or by reason of the fact that a man had met with some misfortune.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This would cover it. There might happen to be decent landlord who would say that he would let the tenant off forty or fifty per cent. of the rent for the next five years.  It would be most unfair in a case of a decent landlord with a good tenant who had met with some misfortune, and whom the landlord let off with fifty per cent. of the rent for the next three or four or five years, that we should come in and purchase on the basis of the fifty per cent.  It would be most unfair and unjust.  It would be punishing decency and good treatment. There are hundreds of cases where an abatement for five years went on for a number of years, and it was not a genuine abatement.  There are hundreds of cases where an abatement could have only been given for the first time last year, where it was a genuine abatement, and where the tenant would be entitled to have the abated rent regarded as the new rent. The Deputy in putting down these five years, and confining it to any abated rent within that time&mdash;except the abatement is in consideration of services&mdash;would do gross injustice between tenant and tenant and would rule out a very large number of tenants who would be entitled to come in.  I am refusing this amendment, because it would be most unjust to the tenant, and, incidentally, to the particular <Col N="1024" /> decent landlord who gave an abatement in the sort of cases I have mentioned.</P>

Such a thing may have happened, but I have not heard of it&mdash;not since before 1921.  It is really an exception if it has happened.

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;In Section 17 (2), page 7, line 19:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the figures `25,' and to substitute therefor the figures `35.' &rdquo;  This amendment deals with the question of arrears. An amendment has been put down on the part of the Government later on, adding one-half year's rent to the purchase money in cases where three years' arrears are due.  It is only in exceptional cases that there is three years' rent due. Of the 70,000 unpurchased tenants there might not be 2,000 in that position.  The men who owe two and a half year's, two years', one and a half years', and one year's rent have paid their rents up to these periods.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of the tenants all over the country, the provisions of the Bill in this respect are grossly unjust and unfair. The man who owes three years' rent ought not to be put in a different position from the men who owe two and a half or one year's rent.  There is a bigger reason.  Certain of the representatives of the unpurchased tenants&mdash;myself principally&mdash;gave an assurance to the unpurchased tenants, when this Bill was being discussed, that the terms would be raised either by giving a direct cash reduction <Col N="1026" /> or by adding so much to the purchase money as would have the same effect as raising it from twenty-five to thirty-five. When I gave that assurance to the unpurchased tenants, I had very definite reasons for doing so.</P>

The Minister's distinct and emphatic assurance was that this 25 per cent. was not his last word at all; that he would be forced up on amendments from our party to 35 per cent., either as a direct cash reduction, or by adding so much to the purchase money, that it would have the same effect.

      <P>I have made a certain definite statement.  I went to the Unpurchased Tenants' Convention, and on the strength of an assurance, I assured the Convention that these terms would be carried out.  On the strength of that assurance the Bill was accepted by the Unpurchased Tenants.  They now find themselves, and I find myself, in the position that what I believed to be a definite assurance, and what the tenants believed from me, has not been carried out.  That is one reason, but the main reason, apart altogether from this promise, is that of justice and equity. It is no reason because a man has paid two years' rent during the last three years, and only owes one year's rent, that he should be deprived of this benefit.  It is also no reason because a man owes 2½ years' rent that he should not get this benefit, while a man who owes three years should have a half a year added to the purchase money.  People who owe <Col N="1027" /> three years' rent and who get a half-year's rent added to the purchase money are thanking the Minister for little or nothing. It is really only throwing dust in their eyes in an attempt to seem generous when he is not generous at all.  The Minister has denied that he made this statement or gave me to understand as much.  He says that it is inaccurate.  I say, distinctly, that the Minister's statement is inaccurate.</P>

      <P>Apart from this promise or otherwise, of which I know nothing, as I got no promise, the Bill on these terms I say is unjust to the tenants.  Considering the present state of agriculture, the Minister should do all he could in the case of these arrears. Where the amount of rent owing is one year or two years, such tenants should receive some benefit under the circumstances. As to the inaccuracy or accuracy of the statement that has been made, I know nothing.  I heard it from no one else.  It may be true or it may be false, but as far as the majority of our party are concerned, we know nothing about it.  Apart from that I believe myself that the Minister is entitled to give 35 per cent. on the present arrears, people do not find so much fault with any other part of the Bill as with this.  They consider such tenants should be dealt with more liberally under this Section, and that at least 35 per cent. of the arrears should be allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and would ask the Minister to change the figures from 25 per cent. to 35 per cent.  If the Minister agrees he will be doing a generous turn to the people on behalf of whom the change is urged.  Since the last Stage of the Bill, in parts of the country that I visited, and where the tenants were not able to pay rent for the past three years, they seem to be completely up against the Minister of Agriculture on this point. Probably if the Minister accepted the amendment it may do a little justice to such tenants, over and above the justice that the Bill does to the landlords.  Take the case of a small farmer who is in possession of an uneconomic holding, the landlord of which requires a really excessive rent.  At a time when everybody else in the Free State was fighting for freedom, such tenants adopted the <Col N="1028" /> only means they could of fighting the landlords, by ceasing to pay the rent that was demanded.  Where some of these people are not able to pay, the Minister could advise the Minister for Defence to send down military who will probably seize the stock that may be grazing on the holding.  That was done recently near Mullingar where three cattle belonging to Mr. Flanagan of Tyrellspass were taken away and sold for £2 a head.  I take it that the object was simply to recover the amount that was owing, but as a result this man lost all his stock.  Every Deputy is entitled to his opinion on these matters, but it is nearly time that something was done for tenants who are asked to pay excessive rent.  As Deputy Gorey has pointed out, the acceptance of this amendment will mean a little justice to the tenants, and I can assure the Minister for Agriculture that the people will be satisfied with it until such time as they will be able to compel the Dáil to give them perfect justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for this reduction is that there will be a reduction in the rent of 7/- in the £.  Having regard to the bad times agriculture has had for the last two years, and to the tremendous disturbance that occurred in various parts of the country, the people were deprived of markets and it was impossible for them to pay their way or turn their produce into cash.  The amendment will place, for the last two or three years, those who owe rent in the same position as the Bill will place tenants in the future.  That is the whole object of the amendment, and if the Dáil wishes to do justice to the landlords, or enable them to pay their debts, perhaps the Minister for Agriculture would apply the 10 per cent. bonus retrospectively for these two years, in order to enable them to settle this question. That is the sole object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise what Deputy Wilson has said.  The actual terms of the Bill and the question of annuities for the future are not the questions that are exercising the minds of the unpurchased tenants at all.  They view that more or less with equanimity, but the fact remains that in many cases they owe three years' rent at the moment, or two and a half, or two years' rent. There is also the fact that annuities under <Col N="1029" /> the Bill will be due immediately, or soon. This question of arrears is a greater stumbling block at the moment, seven times greater, than the question of purchase and of annuity.  I could not, if I were speaking for half an hour, emphasise it sufficiently, because the people are more or less agreeable to the terms&mdash;at least I cannot say that they are agreeable, but they accept them, more or less &mdash;but I have heard nobody yet accept the arrears.  This is a burning question, a much more burning question than the question of annuity.  It will inflict more hardship upon, and will bankrupt the people at the start of the Bill, and in fact it will shake the stability of the State.</P>
      <P>It may be that the time is approaching when the State will have to shoulder the responsibilities that they are inflicting in the Act.  I think that the State and the Government will be wise to be a bit more just to the tenants on this question of arrears than they have been.  It may, perhaps, be a hardship on landlords, but not on many.  There may be a small percentage of the landlords who owe mortgages, and owe interest on mortgages, but they are a small number.  But you inflict a hardship on a big body of the general community by this question of calling up three years' arrears now.  If it could be made something like the terms of the Bill I think the people would meet it agreeably, but if it cannot be met I see nothing but trouble in front of the Government.</P>

      <P>I said with regard to the tenants who owe three years' arrears. The Deputy always suffers from the disease that he is not able to listen.  That is the cause of a great many misunderstandings and of confusion on his part. With regard to the tenants who owe three years' arrears, these are better off under this provision of a half year added to the purchase money than if their rent were brought up to 35 per cent., that is to say, that they pay less down.  Let us take an example.  Take £100 rent; deduct 35 per cent., which is £65, and that leaves it £195.  That is what would have to be paid.  The other is £187 10s.  By reducing the rent by 35 per cent. instead of 25 per cent. the tenant has to pay £195 on his £100 rent, and a half year's rent added to the purchase money.  But the payment down is £195.  By reducing it by 25 per cent. and adding half a year to the purchase money he has only to pay £187.  Let us get to business on this question and drop politics in regard to it.  I would like this question to be discussed strictly on business lines, and not with a view to the next election.</P>

I want this discussed as a business proposition, and I point out here and I challenge Deputy Gorey, or any other Deputy who has a knowledge of mathematics&mdash;and I believe there are some great mathematicians here&mdash;to show that I am wrong, that the payment down by a tenant who owes three years' rent, the payment in cash, if we give him a reduction of 35 per cent. instead of 25 per cent., would be £195, whereas the payment down in cash, if we gave a reduction of 25 per cent. and add half a year to the purchase money, is only £187 10s.

      <P>Let us drop this nonsense. I hope the time has come when we can discuss land purchase, like any other problem, without going back to the old days of the seventies and the eighties and the nineties.  The proposition that was put up was to give a 35 per cent. reduction.  Now, I am pointing out that as far as the particular tenants who owe three years' arrears are concerned my proposal is better, and I want to hear any answer to that, and that will give the Dáil a measure of the sincerity of all this thunder.  That is number one. Based on my proposition it is £187 and on Deputy Gorey's it is £195 for third year tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, it is open to the Land Commission to give time to a tenant in any case.  They have an absolutely free hand.  If a tenant for any reason is unable to pay they can give him such time as they like.  Take those two circumstances together and tell me whether my proposal for the tenant who owes three years is better than Deputy <Col N="1032" /> Gorey's in regard to this amendment. That is the man who owes three years. Now, there is, no doubt, a hardship, an unusual hardship, in regard to the tenant who owes two years' arrears. The Dáil should, I think, approach this in some responsible way.  If a landlord is not entitled to rent for these three years, say so.  It is open to the Dáil to decide that the landlords should not have got rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one Deputy who is quite honest about that.  There are other Deputies who think that no one should get rent except in a few cases where there are landlords who are extremely anxious to have arrangements made in this Bill by which the people of their own class who happen to be landlords in the old sense of the word, should be purchased and their rents should be redeemed, and the State credit should be used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing is a joke.  In any event, to come back to the point, let the Dáil decide decently that the landlord should not get rent, and that he is not entitled to it, and that he should not have got it for the last three, five, ten or fifteen years, and go and take his land off him. But do not, in any casual, irresponsible, haphazard fashion, decide that the landlord is entitled to a certain amount of rent, looking at it from the point of view of the tenant solely, and say it does not matter twopence about the landlords; &ldquo;we will put down this figure.&rdquo;  If the landlord should have got any rent he has certain rights in the matter.  If he should have got one penny rent he has certain rights, and these rights should be respected. That is not politics, I know, but I find myself saying a lot of things for the last three weeks which are not good politics, and it does not give me much trouble.  If the landlord has any right to the land at all this right should be respected, and the question should be decided after examining the whole proposition in a business way, and taking the circumstances on one side and the other into account.  In the case of the tenant who owes two years' arrears, it is not as easy for him, as I have pointed out, to pay this two years' rent down as if he paid his rent every year, but we all have to suffer a certain amount of hardship, more or less.  Also, the tenants who owe 2½ <Col N="1033" /> years' annuity have to suffer a certain amount of hardship.  I am just wondering how many tenants withheld their rents for the same reason as the tenant purchasers withheld their annuities.  The real objection against the arrears question is not from the small tenant, but from the big tenant.  Everyone knows that it was the farmer of 60 or 70 acres who did not pay his rent.  He knew the value of money and was doing well.</P>

      <P>Take the farmer whose rent is £20 a year, and that is much above the average of the farms we are dealing with.  It is a nice farm, a good, economic holding.  The valuation of a £20 holding would be anything between £25 and £30.  He has to pay two years' rent, and he gets 25 per cent. reduction, that is a reduction of 5/- in the £ or £5. He pays £15 down, and he has paid nothing for two years.  I put it to the Dáil&mdash; was there ever such a farce as to pretend that the farmer with a holding of £20 valuation is going to be broken because he makes a payment of £15, and in view of the fact that he made no payment for two years?  Is there any reason why there should be all this heat about it, in view of the number of big problems we receive here with a certain amount of quietness and equanimity.  It is a farce.  To put £15 on the man who has a £30 valuation holding, and who has not paid any rent for years is not a hardship, and no one knows that better than Deputy Gorey.  He has another year, or a year and a half, to pay the other £15, and I suggest it would be no trouble to such a tenant to pay £20 down, and he will only have to pay £10 then.  These are the reasons, you see, why this is not such a hardship as is pretended in regard to people who owe two years' rent.  It is nothing like the hardship that is predicted for the small farmer, and certainly not like what it is for the big farmer, for the bigger the farm the bigger the hardship, but to the big farmer also the hardship is not anything like what is pretended.  I have dealt with the case of men who owe three years' rent and I have shown as far as their case goes that my proposal is better than Deputy <Col N="1034" /> Gorey's, so far as paying the money down is concerned.  That is the hardship to the tenant.  I have only one other thing to add with regard to this; we all remember people six months ago who owed 2½ years' annuity, and they were under the impression they need never pay anything again.  They took the first opportunity of withholding their annuities, but they did so knowing perfectly well they were making it impossible for us to complete land purchase.  But when the Enforcement of Law Act was passed it was not necessary to send the Sheriff to two per cent. of them.  There was hardly a case in each county.  They all paid it right away, and none of them, so far as I know, got into the Bankruptcy Court. The Farmers' Party, of course, have made a tremendous case of the terrific hardship which existing tenants are suffering as compared with tenants who have purchased. They point out that the purchased tenants were better able to pay. Let us take our old friend with the £20 valuation holding again.  I do not know whether the Farmers' Party are interested in that, but let us take the man with the £20 valuation holding.  That man was paying £20, and his rent was reduced by £5 a year from 1914 to 1920.  This was the year of the strike.  His neighbour who did not purchase was paying £20, and he had the same sort of holding, a difference of £5 a year during the war.  This difference of £5 a year during the war, to a man who would spend it on pitch and toss at the cross-roads, was supposed to be the terrific hardship they suffered.  I want the Dáil to approach this question in a business-like way.  These are the figures.  Tall talk is easy, but these figures give you the measure of the reality there is in this campaign about the arrears of rent.  That is one side.  Before I leave that I have this to point out; the Dáil will agree with me that the Land Bill is a contentious Bill, a measure that interests the country pretty largely.  I have not seen a Press campaign against the arrears, not even in the local Press.</P>

      <P>The landlords, someone said.  That may be the reason, I do not <Col N="1035" /> know as much about the Press as Deputy Gorey, but that may be the reason of it. I have got the local papers, everyone of them, and the Deputy knows as well as I know&mdash;he has been more around the country&mdash;that there is not an honest tenant in Ireland who would not jump at these terms.  The only letters I have seen are in regard to this question of arrears. There are, I understand, two Unpurchased Tenants' Organisations.  You will find a letter one day in the paper abusing the Land Bill, and abusing the Farmers' Party for not getting better terms for the farmer, and if you think a little you will know where that comes from&mdash;from a gentleman, I will not mention his name, who is running the League of Unpurchased Tenants.  A few days afterwards you will find another letter coming from the opposite source, pointing out that the arrears terms and the price terms were not as good as if the Farmers' Party were in power, but that at the same time they had done their best to make it better. I am serious about this.  These are the only classes of letters I have seen.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the Dáil knows the Land Bill is contentious, that all the small tenants of Ireland are interested in it, that all the local papers are interested in it, and if there was to be this tremendous campaign about arrears or prices, then we would have the papers filled with letters.  We have had none; we have had no protests. It was admitted by the Deputy, in a moment when he was off his guard, that the price was right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenants' reduction is 35 per cent., bringing the amount to £65.  There is a ten per cent. contribution to the price, and that brings the landlords' income to £67 14s. 0d., just exactly two-thirds of his former income on his second-term judicial rent.  Of course any man who has any sense of <Col N="1036" /> responsibility would not think of bringing it lower than that by reason of the fact that the Trustee Acts empower Trustees who hold money and who have to invest it, to invest it in Irish rents up to two-thirds of the amount.  That is the amount the Trustee Acts set out, which is considered to be absolutely safe.  We have gone to the very border line.  I need not argue the case, because the tenants admit that it is fair.  I am tired pointing out that the landlord will get his purchase money in bonds.  Say, for instance, he gets £10,000; he will get interest on that at four and a half per cent.  That will be 67 per cent. of his previous income, roughly two-thirds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be.  There is the point again.  The reason the Trustee Acts and other Acts prevent a Trustee from investing money without being covered up to the full value of his security, is that they make allowance for things of that sort&mdash;for cost of collection in the case of rents, and allowances for any possible expenses and anything they cannot forsee in the way of cutting down the rents either by purchase or otherwise. Take it that the purchase money is £10,000; the landlord gets four and a half per cent. on that.  His income, therefore, is 67 per cent. of his previous income. That is the price.  In the event of £5,000 worth of that, representing the redemption price of the mortgage, on that £5,000 he receives four and a half per cent. and he pays, probably, five or six per cent. or more.  As I explained before, he gets over that difficulty the minute he gets his purchase money by paying off the mortgage.  Until he gets his purchase money he must pay his five or six per cent., and if he only got 67 per cent. of his rents he would be only able to pay four and a half per cent. on his mortgages.  I think that is perfectly clear.  Hence, if the price is fair, we must give him some more.  If the price was calculated at £65 in the £100, a reduction of 35 per cent., and if the payment in lieu of rent and arrears were the same, the Bill would be, on the face of it, unfair and unjust.  If the price is <Col N="1037" /> right, we must give better terms to the landlord in regard to arrears, because until he gets his purchase money, he is paying a higher rate than 4½ per cent. on his mortgages.  How much higher are we giving him?  We are giving the tenants a reduction of 25 per cent.  We are collecting the rents and stopping the cost of collection, which takes five per cent. or thereabouts on an average from the landlord.  We are bringing him down to £30, so that the only margin left to him is the difference between £30 and £33.  That is the business side of the proposition and I invite the Dáil's attention to it.  I invite the Deputies, in the first place, to examine the real size of the problem from the tenants' point of view, and see what difference there would be between my terms and the terms the Farmers' Party suggests.  If they do, I think they will find there is nothing in them which would put them into the Bankruptcy Court.  I invite them to look at the other side and if they do I think they will find we could not have left a smaller margin, in justice, to enable the landlord to pay the extra interest.  Under no circumstances can I accept the amendment, and I will not accept it.</P>

      <P>The Minister refrained from mentioning the material part of the only figures we have had&mdash;the figures in connection with what the landlords owe.  The Minister for Agriculture has always held that no money-lender lent, or should have lent, on an Irish rental more than two-thirds of that rental, that anybody who lent more than that was taking considerable risk.  He has never given us any figures in connection with the landlords who had their property mortgaged.  I have asked before how many of these landlords had their <Col N="1040" /> property mortgaged, how many landlords there are whose rent is in trust for the moneys they owe.  We never got these figures.  But because a few do happen to have mortgages, the whole body of landlords, who represent the richest element of the community, is going to be paid money that may cripple and bring misery and starvation to a big proportion of the 70,000 tenants. These may be the Minister's figures, but they are not my figures, and they do not fit in with my sense of justice.  It is all very well to talk about recovering three years' rent and two and a half years' rent.  The Minister can talk very glibly about it.  The Minister has other means of living besides the land, and he has not to live on a £16 or £17 valuation. I am glad of that, but it is quite a different case with the men with these small valuations, and I will promise the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Defence and all the rest of them a pretty stiff job in recovering these arrears&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am accepting this amendment.  In the congested districts especially there are amongst smaller tenants a large number of hanging gales. That is to say that for years, even from the time of the tenant's father, the rent is paid half-yearly, but appropriated two or three years back.  You may have a man paying three years' rent during 1920, 1921 and 1922, and yet he owes three years by reason of the fact that the payments during these years were appropriated to a period before 1920.  That state of affairs exists in the Congested Districts especially and amongst small tenants, and it is to meet that, that this amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: To delete Section 17 (3), page 7, and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Compounded arrears of rent shall be discharged as to so much thereof as does not exceed 75 per cent. of the annual rent, by the addition of same to the Purchase Price, and as to the balance, if any, by payment on such date or dates before the appointed day as may be prescribed by the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which seeks to give justice all round.  It is not a big demand, but an attempt to go some way, at least, to specify the time of the people who have paid rent and who owe rent. It means the adding of one year, or if a lesser amount is owed, the adding of it to the purchase price.  It was not an extraordinary thing at all under the previous Acts that a certain amount was added in voluntary purchase agreements, to the purchase money by agreement. This Bill only provides in a later clause for the adding of one half year, and in its first draft it did not provide for the addition of any at all.  For the last twelve months a good many landlords have accepted voluntary reductions of 50 per cent., 45 per cent. and 40 per cent., and if it was a question of a voluntary agreement again between landlord and tenant there would not be any hesitation on the landlord's part in <Col N="1043" /> adding that year's purchase price.  I think it would be done voluntarily. Therefore I ask the Minister to make this small concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept the amendment, and I will not comment on the statement that landlords have accepted voluntary payments of 50 per cent. during the last year.  There is an amendment already down in the Bill providing that half a year be added to the purchase money, and, secondly, that any rent payable within the period 1920 and 1923 shall be appropriated to that period, even though the receipt on its face sets out that the rent was to be paid for the previous year.  That does not interest Deputy Gorey, because this concession will not affect large farmers; it will only make a difference to the small tenants in the congested counties.  All <Col N="1044" /> over the congested districts in counties like that of Mayo and elsewhere the small tenants owe for a long time.  There are hundreds of cases where the small tenant pays his rent half-yearly, but gets his receipt dated back for two or three years. This relieves him straight away, and provides that any payments made shall be appropriated.  That is as far as I will go. That meets the equities of the case.  The Deputy himself stated that previous Bills added two years only.  We are adding a half-year.  We are making this concession. There is no question about it, the non-payment of rent during the last three years was due not primarily to the tenants not being able to pay, but as a protest against non-purchase.  That is the distinction between the question of arrears we have now and the arrears owed in 1881 and subsequently.</P>

That operated under the Wyndham and Birrell Acts. Where there was money to be paid in lieu of rent until such time as the vesting order came along one-quarter per cent. more was charged for the money than on an actual annuity under the Wyndham Act.  The same also applied to the Birrell Act.  There is a bigger distinction made under this Bill, and I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  Deputy Gorey knows this is not interest in lieu of rent.  There is no interest-in-lieu-of-rent period under this Bill, because from the date on which an agreement to purchase is entered into the tenant is deemed to be paying for the redemption of his holding.  I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to this, that Deputy Gorey apparently adopts the 1903 Act where it suits him but that he does not adopt it where it does not suit him.  Under the 1903 Act on a £100 holding, the landlord gets £2,200, and under this the sum he gets is £1,500.  If the Deputy would be at least logical and suggest that we should still give the landlord £2,200 and should make this difference, that we <Col N="1049" /> should have an interest in lieu of rent period, and only make a difference of a quarter per cent., I agree.</P>

      <P>This amendment has already been discussed, and I need not waste any further time in discussing it.  I put down the amendment because I understand there are many cases in which agreements have been arrived at between the landlord and tenant and abatements have been offered to the tenant in his rent. They were not exceptional abatements. They were granted by the landlord, as he saw there were sound reasons for doing so.  I want such tenants to get the full benefits of the present Bill when it becomes law, irrespective of the period.  It may be forty years or two years ago when the tenants got those abatements.

I was hopeful that it was one of the amendments which the Minister is prepared to accept, and that it was in fulfilment of one of the promises that he might have made. Apparently Deputy McGoldrick has not the assent of the Minister in formulating this amendment.  Nevertheless, I think he was well advised in the latter part of it, and I would like some assurance that within the Bill it may be possible for public authorities to obtain portion of a holding, where it is required for public purposes&mdash;for building or otherwise&mdash;at a price in conformity with the price fixed by the Bill itself.  Perhaps Deputy McGoldrick would explain more fully the purpose of the amendment as originally intended, and that then the Minister would explain why it would not be accepted.</P>

      <P>I put this amendment on the Paper on account of my knowledge of conditions in a great many cases around large and small towns with regard to lands like these.  I was under the impression that the word &ldquo;holding&rdquo; in Sub-section <i>(d)</i> meant that if there was a small holding convenient to a town, or even if there was a holding a considerable distance from a town which might abut upon a road which ran from or to the town, and which could be alleged to have potential building possibilities, that holding thereby became a holding that could not be vested in the occupier by the Land Commission on account of Sub-section <i>(d).</i>  I came to the conclusion that some town tenants and a good many other small people in towns who occupied or had a little bit of land convenient to the town by which <Col N="1052" /> they supplement their scanty earnings and bring up their family and help themselves in that way, were going to be placed at a disadvantage by this Sub-section. I knew that for the last thirty-five or forty years those people have been the backbone of the land war.  It was they who fought, or enabled us, in the North at any rate, to keep up an official organisation of any kind to fight the battle of the farming classes.  On that account I did not want to see them ostracised by any section of the Bill and prevented from becoming the vested owners of their little bits of land.  That was the specific reason for which the amendment was put down.  But the Minister has given me to understand, after a critical consultation, that what is set out in Sub-section (d) does not mean that that portion of a holding which is not regarded as eligible for building purposes is going thereby to be ruled out of court, but that it is going to be purchased and vested the same as if it had not any building possibilities. The other proviso as to land becoming useful and necessary for the development of towns and for local sanitary purposes was meant to be fair to all parties.  It should be really the agricultural value of the land to the landlord and the tenant that should be taken into account when local authorities want to obtain land for the development of a town or to improve the sanitary condition of the town.  The reason I put down this amendment was to serve these two objects. I am led to believe by the Minister in charge, and I assume that the Land Commission will interpret these things in a fairly friendly spirit, although when the trained judicial mind comes to interpret these things it is generally guided by the literal legislation.  Such officials interpret Acts of Parliament very strictly, and if this came before a very conscientious official there is a liability to have the legislation interpreted in a way that was not the intention when it was passed. We must trust to the assurance that is being given.  With regard to the second part of the amendment, perhaps we might hope that the new Land Commission, in dealing with such matters, will do so in a spirit that will give satisfaction that was not given in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>Deputy Johnson wants to provide that a local authority which already has power to take land compulsorily shall take it at a certain price.  That is <Col N="1053" /> the only effect of the amendment from his point of view.  I find it difficult myself to understand the amendment, but I think that is the point of view that the Deputy put forward.  The Bill already provides that building ground shall be excluded, or land suitable for building. That is only right, as any other course would be a grave hindrance to the development of towns.  It is only right, and I think will be admitted that land suitable for building should be excluded, that no tenant should be made owner of it, and especially a future tenant, who is, in 75 per cent. out of 100 cases, a big shopkeeper in the town who has taken the land any time for the last 20 years up to the last three or four years and who is merely a future tenant should not become owner in fee-simple. It would be grossly unfair if he did.  The only purpose served by this amendment is to ensure that if the local sanitary authority want this land afterwards they shall pay for it the value of the land as agricultural or farming land.  I do not want to express any opinion whatever on that subject.  This is a Land Purchase Act.  It professes to deal with agricultural land, and I think it will be generally admitted that the definition of agricultural land and agricultural tenancy is pretty wide.  We deal with all agricultural land except certain specified exceptions which we have put down in writing.  We have left nothing in general or vague terms. We deal with all genuine tenants, whether present or future, judicial or nonjudicial. This Bill is to deal with agricultural land.  It is to take land from one party and give it to another.  Where land is not agricultural it is excluded. If it is building ground, or ground suitable for any other purpose, appropriate legislation directed to dealing with that particular problem will have to be invoked. I could not undertake in this Bill, which is intended to deal with the price of land as agricultural land and to exclude land used for other purposes, to lay down a price at which such land shall be taken later on in the event of its being taken under existing legislation, or in the event of an Act being passed to take it for some other purpose. It would not be a sound principle to act upon.  I think we have done our duty in this Purchase Bill by excluding such <Col N="1054" /> land.  We will have to leave it to the laws regulating the acquisition of property compulsorily by a local authority to say what will be the price paid for it. Where land is taken for building purposes the local authorities do not take, I should say, 25 per cent.  It is the private owner who does it.  This not only safeguards the local authority, but safeguards the private owner who is going to build, which is a matter of policy and good for the State and good for the towns.  I see no way out of that position.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any glebe, as defined by the Act of 38th and 39th Victoria, Chapter 42, which now is, or hereafter shall be, held or occupied by any &ldquo;ecclesiastical persons&rdquo; as by the same Act defined.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that this particular class of land was probably omitted from the exceptions through an oversight. The reason of it is this.  Under the Church Act, when the Church was disestablished, the Representative Church Body was allowed to purchase back from the State a limited quantity of land to be attached to the residence of the person who was called an &ldquo;Ecclesiastical person.&rdquo;  He could be a person or a curate or a dean or a bishop, but a strictly limited amount of land was permitted to be purchased from the State as an attachment to these ecclesiastical residences.  Cash was paid to the State for it, and that land is occupied now by persons who hold it under leases, and therefore it is plainly tenanted land under the Act.  But the present tenants would be put into perpetual occupation of their holdings and would be compelled to purchase under this Act&mdash;these particular ecclesiastical persons who happen to hold this land on lease, from their own ecclesiastical superiors.  It is extremely improbable that any of them desire to purchase, and it would be very hard, if any of them desired to give up their present callings and take up farming, that they should be allowed to take up these holdings, subtracting them from the Representative Church Body, which holds them more or less in trust for the whole Church, and to take away whatever ecclesiastical residence there was on the holding.  I think that this matter was plainly omitted there and is an oversight, and I suggest that this should be accepted.</P>

Supposing <Col N="1056" /> that the particular person who happened to occupy some glebe land were to die or to resign to-morrow, that land would again be let to his successor, and would then again become tenanted land.  There is also some of it which may be untenanted land at present owing to a vacancy, and which will be let, as soon as the vacancy is filled, to the future occupants, and therefore, you see, it is pretty clear that the words &ldquo;hereafter may be&rdquo; are necessary.  They are also taken from the exceptions in the previous Land Acts, and they cannot apply to any land except glebe land, defined by the Act, 38th and 39th Victoria. That glebe land was defined as the land that was bought by the Church Body from the State at the date of Disestablishment.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely clear that mill holdings are purchased.  Clause <i>(b)</i> excepts &ldquo;any land which is not at the date of the passing of this Act substantially agricultural or pastoral or partly agricultural and partly pastoral in character.&rdquo;  The usual mill holding is <Col N="1057" /> generally bigger than the average-size holding.  It was let originally as a mill holding, and at the time it was let milling was a profitable business, and a very large percentage of the profits made out of the whole letting came from the mill, and it was decided that it was not agricultural land.  At present milling is not such a good business.  Mills are, without any question whatever, agricultural, but they were ruled out by reason of a previous decision, and in order to meet it we simply put in &ldquo;any land which is not at the date of the passing of the Act.&rdquo; I think I am perfectly safe in giving the Deputy an undertaking that that will cover the case.  Of course, it would not cover a mill which was in a backyard in a town.  We assume it is a mill holding in the country.</P>

All the buildings were erected by the present tenants who are the owners of the mill, but although they have been in occupation for 100 years, they are still holding as yearly tenants.  They are very anxious to extend a certain local industry, but because of the inability to get any permanence they are precluded.  That is one case. I am told it illustrates a considerable number, and the assurance is desired that such holdings may be bought under this Bill, even though they are quite small.</P>

      <P>I got this amendment from Deputy Doyle at the last moment.  It could not be moved, of course, in the form in which it stands. It would have to be changed if it were to have any force.  The word &ldquo;grabbers,&rdquo; I think, would have to be changed to &ldquo;persons.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the matter is not in itself too vague for any reference in an Act of Parliament, but I will let Deputy Doyle explain himself.</P>

      <P>My object in moving this is where a farm is in the landlord's possession unlet, that the <i>bona fide</i> evicted tenant should, in every case, be restored to his own holding.  I think the object is quite plain, that where a landlord has evicted a tenant some years ago for non-payment of rent and he still holds that tenant's holding on his own hands, and it is there to be disposed of under the several provisions in the Bill, I do not see any reason why the original owner should not be restored. I know many cases such as I am talking about, where the original holding is in the hands of the landlord, and where if a provision was inserted in the Bill to get back that holding, it would be only a slight concession in the Bill in favour of evicted tenants.  The <i>bona fide</i> evicted tenant's holding is in the possession of persons who never paid any compensation to that original evicted tenant or paid anything for the holding.  Perhaps it might be five, six or ten years in his possession, and it is still in his possession, and he has had a few fat years out of it. I do not think it would be any hardship to disturb such a man.  It was persons such as these grabbing farms who created the land-war, and I do not think they are entitled to any consideration whatever under the Bill.  I have, therefore, pleasure in moving the motion.</P>

In the Bill land can be taken compulsorily for the relief of congestion, and there is priority for that purpose; we might be taking that land for the relief of congestion, taking it compulsorily, and it must be made clear whether it is the evicted tenants' claim or the congests' claim is the first to that land.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this amendment, even though in my opinion it does not go far enough.  I think, still, notwithstanding the arguments that were put forward against the case for evicted tenants, that those who were evicted from their lands for non-payment of rent when the land fight was on, have the best right to the land they were evicted from.  In many of these cases, as is well known, where tenants were evicted from their holdings, the land from which they were evicted was held for centuries by their people.  Now, if the opportunity is there for us to do it, the persons who are best entitled to any of that land are the persons who were evicted from it.  They have, I submit, a prior claim, even to the congests, for in their own view, and the general view of the country and of the farming community, they are the persons who have the best title to the farm. In other words, they were the owners. I think that principle ought to be admitted that they have the first claim as they were the original owners of the ground, and they were disturbed owing to the laws that operated at that time, and owing to the rack-rents they had to pay, and to the general system of landlordism. If there is any justice in the case these are the persons who should be put back into their own holdings. Deputy Doyle's amendment only deals with a certain number of those cases where the land is still held by the landlord, but there are other cases, and the Minister has not accepted the principle of putting any of the evicted tenants back on them. This is only a small portion of the matter, but in these particular cases where there will be practically no disturbance he should accept the principle that the persons who were evicted from their farms owing to the landlords of the past and various other causes should be restored to their holdings.  These cases could be inquired into by the Land Commission, and their claims met in justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is everything in the amendment, especially with the altered wording, that should commend it to the Minister and the Deputies. <Col N="1062" /> When speaking the other day on the Flogging Bill, or the Public Safety Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs said he was making a law to meet confiscation with confiscation.  I think everybody will agree that the cases of many of the tenants who have been evicted from their holdings were nothing short of confiscation, so that the argument used by the Minister for Home Affairs on that occasion could be applied by the Minister for Agriculture in these cases.  I have received communications from evicted tenants, and I will trouble the Dáil by reading an extract from one which I think is provided for under the terms of the amendment, if accepted by the Minister.  This is from a man who I believe is a member of Deputy Gorey's union, and in whom in the ordinary course of events I would not be interested, as I do not know the man personally:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our families were evicted (but prior to '80).  I remember the eviction myself, from over 200 acres.  Firstly, the rent was raised as the then landlord thought my father would not pay the rise, and when he paid the rise of rent at November he was then ordered to leave as the landlord wanted it for himself, and on the 15th of the following month, December, he was on the road without owing even one penny rent, and no compensation whatever, and about the same time my father's father, and brothers, were evicted from another farm after building every house on the place from the ground, roofing and slating; they are there to be seen still within about 12 miles from&mdash;&mdash; not owing one penny rent, nor never got any compensation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister, even in his wild moments, would admit that is a reasonable case that should be provided for under the terms of this Bill.  I just quoted an extract from a letter to show that it is one of the cases that should be met under the terms of the amendment moved by Deputy Doyle.  There may be, and I am sure there are, many other such cases.  The evicted tenants who have been looking forward to justice under the first Irish Land Bill, will be glad, I am sure, to hear from the Minister that he will make provision for cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has <Col N="1063" /> said, in my wild moments I might accept the amendment, but in my sane moments I would not think of doing that.  There has been some change of words in the amendment, but as it stands we know the meaning of it.  There were more evictions in the congested districts than in any other place in Ireland.  We know there were far more.  At the present moment, as everyone who takes a real interest in land purchase knows, our difficulty is to find land in the congested districts to relieve congestion.  We find thousands of holdings on cut-away bog all over Mayo and Leitrim and every other county which has its congested districts, without any land in the neighbourhood to make them economic, except a certain limited amount of untenanted land.  It would be very difficult to get the people to migrate. You can only pick and choose when you are migrating.  You have no way in which to deal with the greater number, except to find land in the neighbourhood or the adjoining county.  Will anyone suggest that a man living on a holding with a £3 or £4 valuation, who is trying to rear a family and to support his wife and that family, has not a prior claim in equity and justice to anyone else in the neighbourhood?  I am surprised at Deputy Davin making such a suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted an extract from a letter for the purpose of proving that the person who lost a holding has the first right.  It is not a case of a person with 200 acres.  There are many cases of people with very small holdings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy supported the amendment.  I am pointing out that under the amendment as it stands the suggestion is that if there were no other land than 200 acres of land in the hands of a landlord, and a farmer had been evicted out of that 30 or 40 years ago, we are to bring back that person now instead of dealing with the congestion that exists in the district. How anyone in his saner moments, not to speak of his wilder moments, could make a proposal of that sort, beats me. That is one aspect of the matter.  To take the other aspect, does the Deputy suggest that the man evicted from two <Col N="1064" /> or three hundred acres should be put back upon that holding now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies put down amendments having certain specified cases in their minds, and they are utterly oblivious to the fact that the amendments cover cases for which they were not intended. I know, and Deputy Davin knows, of cases of men evicted from two or three hundred acre holdings.  Such cases occurred at Leix.  It is suggested that those people are to be put back on their holdings, not withstanding that the whole policy of the Bill is to take any land, even tenanted land if we want it, for the purpose of relieving congestion. If these men were never evicted we might be taking the holdings off them under this Bill.  These are the practical difficulties against this amendment.  First we would be putting tenants back into the only untenanted land available for the relief of congestion; secondly we would be putting them back into holdings of two or three hundred acres.  That is what would happen under the amendment.  We never intended to, and we never could, right all the wrongs done under the aegis of English rule for the last 30 or 40 years.  It could not be done and the Deputies know it.  If farmers are entitled to have righted all the wrongs that they suffered, then the same would apply to other sections of the community. I admit there is a special case with regard to evicted tenants, and we will go a certain distance to meet it.  We have provided that tenants evicted since 1878 should be dealt with, and where there is land available, an evicted tenant who does not come under those provisions will be considered as a suitable person. That is doing more for the farming class than is done for any other class, shopkeepers, <Col N="1065" /> labourers, or any others.  Now it is suggested that because they or their fathers suffered under English rule, we are to right every such case at the expense of the State.  That is the issue.  Now as regards evicted tenants, I met a few deputations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those evicted tenants put forward the suggestion that was put forward to-day in this amendment, and the suggestion put forward by Deputy de Roiste.  One was that any man who had left his holding for any reason whatever whether ejected by the landlord or sold out in any other way should be regarded as an evicted tenant.  That is to say if a man were too dishonest to pay for his tea and sugar and was sold out by his creditors that that man was to get a holding at the expense of the State.  He was to be regarded as a patriot, a wounded soldier of the Land War.  Another suggestion was made. An amendment was produced, and it was to the effect that any evicted tenant whatsoever should be brought in. He deleted the words &ldquo;twenty-five years, before the Act of 1903,&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;heretofore.&rdquo;&ldquo;Heretofore&rdquo; was to be inserted to provide that people could go back to the time of Brian Boru.  In addition, if any evicted tenant or his representative preferred to take the money to getting the holding that he or they should be paid the money.  This would have meant that the Bill would cost about one thousand millions, of which five hundred millions would go to New York and Chicago.  I met recently a body of evicted tenants and they put forward these suggestions (1) that they are to go back as far as they liked; (2) that anyone who was ejected from his holding for any reason, should be regarded as an evicted tenant, whether he lost the land as a result of being evicted by the landlord, or that the farm was sold out by creditors or anybody else; (3) that they should get back into their full original holdings.  The man who put forward the points I have just mentioned, when questioned by me, admitted to me that he was evicted out of his holding, that there was a certain sum due under a family settlement.  He refused to pay this money, and as a result of his refusal his relations took action against him and on his refusal to pay he was finally sold out.  The next case was the case of a man who told me that his grandfather had <Col N="1066" /> lost something like 300 acres and that he wanted that back.  I asked him &ldquo;did you apply under the 1903 Act&rdquo;?  and he said &ldquo;I did&mdash;my father did.&rdquo;  I asked him if he got a holding.  He said he did.  I asked him &ldquo;where is it&rdquo;?  and he said &ldquo;We sold it.&rdquo;  The fact is that 50 per cent. of the reinstated tenants under the Act of 1903 have sold their holdings.  Everyone knows it.  We can do no more for the evicted tenants than we are doing, and we could not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us of his experiences about evicted tenants. I am not asking one-eighth of that.  I am only asking what comes under the twenty-five years.  If the Minister is so fond of the congests I leave him the congests and ask him to apply the amendment to the outside districts.  I leave him the congests as they are.  I do not believe you will have a single application for any 300 acres or 200 acres, or even for 100 acres.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who moved the amendment had so much confidence in the Minister that he was prepared to leave the wording of the amendment to the Minister himself, if he accepted the principle of it.  I quite <Col N="1067" /> agree that the word &ldquo;grabbers&rdquo; as it was in the original amendment is not Parliamentary and would not in any circumstances be accepted by the Minister. Therefore, that is one reason why Deputy Doyle was going to trust the Minister to re-draft the Clause.  However, the Minister has placed a good deal of stress upon the position of people in the congested districts.  I put it to him that the evicted tenant or representative of the evicted tenant who has a just claim is in a far worse position than the people in the congested area, and that is the real case I put up to him to make provision for such men as I have cited. There are many others I know who were tenants and who have been evicted during a certain period.  That is the reason why I ask the Minister to accept the amendment moved by Deputy Doyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that the representatives of the evicted tenants are in a worse plight than the congests living in the congested areas.  That is probably because he does not come from the congested areas and does not know anything about their privations.  Anyone who knows anything about the question knows that that is not so.  With regard to the suggestion to apply the amendment outside the congested areas, I cannot do it.  There is congestion outside the congested district areas and there would be plenty of cases cropping up.  If the evicted tenant gets State credit and an equivalent holding, he is well done for.</P>

      <P>Anybody who had any sympathy with the grabber in this country was never any good and I do not think that he is any good in any country. If there is any sympathy or fair play for evicted tenants, as there was under previous Acts, they would be restored as far as possible in their own holdings. The whole case has not been met.  Land could not be found for them before, but now you are finding land for them.  I know the Minister's difficulty in congested areas, and in fact it would not be fair to press him on that matter.  The evicted tenants are on a different plane from the congests, because these people have had property taken from them through no fault of their own.  It was taken because of a certain system and because of the stand they took.  I think the genuine evicted tenant ought to be put back, as far as possible, on his own land, whether it is in the hands of the landlord or grabber.  This is nothing new to us under the English Acts&mdash;to see grabbers taken from the land they grabbed and the original owner planted on that land. Men were taken from county Wexford and put on land in my own county. I do not see why this Government should not do the same.  It is only copying from previous Governments, and they did it.</P>

      <P>I think one thing is forgotten by the mover of this amendment.  If this amendment were strictly adhered to it would put men back on congested and uneconomic holdings. Would that be an indication of sympathy with the evicted tenant?  Would it not be better to put him on an economic holding somewhere else?  That, I take it, is the procedure which the Minister hopes will be eventually carried out. I think it is unfair to charge him with lack of sympathy towards the evicted tenants.</P>

      <P>No, but it has been <Col N="1069" /> implied.  If the problems that this Bill purposes to be a solution of are to be met in some sane, effective fashion there will have to be some procedure to find the best economic methods of dealing with them. As was indicated by the Minister at a previous sitting, his procedure was, after the land had been vested, to deal then with the question of congests and after that with the evicted tenants, in so far as can be done.  Also an amendment to Section 29 was put in which indicated that the claims of persons to special treatment could go beyond the year indicated in sub-section (c) of Section 29.  It is simply a question of dealing with this matter in a business-like manner and doing justice to all, but obviously if this amendment were carried into effect it would be a stumbling block to the securing of that objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The frequent reference to the justification of the word &ldquo;grabber&rdquo; is rather interesting.  I think probably if those who attempt to justify the use of it are right in this, they would be prepared to substitute the word &ldquo;scab&rdquo; or &ldquo;blackleg.&rdquo;  It has the same meaning that Deputy Gorey holds in regard to the grabber which other sections of the community hold in regard to the scab or blackleg.  I want to ask the Minister&mdash; I think this may help to make more harmony on this question&mdash;whether the alphabetical order of persons to whom advances may be made under this Section is intended to indicate the order of preference, and is the unit of consideration to be the whole country or to be the estates? For instance, are we to consider that the first persons to be considered through the whole of the area are congests, and only after all the congests have been made holders of economic holdings will the persons under paragraph <i>(c)</i> be considered, and so on?  Is the order of preference to be followed by the Land Commission to be in districts?  Is the same order to be followed in certain districts or will the people who come under the letter A in one county not be transferred to another county; or will the people who come under <i>(d)</i> in one county have to wait until all the A's throughout the country are fixed in holdings?  I think, if that is not the interpretation, there is general agreement. Even Deputy Doyle, I think, has conceded the point that congests ought to <Col N="1070" /> be first considered, but, having done that in general and having dealt with those under B, surely it is not to be refused that where it is possible, where there is an evicted tenant to be reinstated or to be given a holding, he should be given a holding on the estate, at any rate, or in the holding where it is possible he was evicted from?  You may be evicting the present tenant, but I do not think it would apply universally at all.  Personally I would say that some fitness for the job would have to be taken into account, but preference should certainly be given to the evicted tenant for reinstatement in the place he was evicted from, if that place were available.  If there can be arrangements made of any kind, even with compulsory eviction of the present tenant if that tenant is not doing full value to the holding, the evicted person ought to be put back into that holding.  The claim for the reinstatement into the tenant's old holding is a good one.  Where it is possible without doing greater injustice it ought to be conceded, and I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to consult with the Minister for Home Affairs, and to consider whether something in the nature of the Tenants Rent Act, about the greater injustice or the greater hardship, might not be possible in this respect.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first point it is stated that congests have the first claim, and that is right.  The Land Commission must be sure that they have enough of land to relieve congestion before they give land to anybody else. Immediately congests are dealt with then the other parties come in and there is no particular order of priority.  It would vary in every estate according to the special circumstances of each case.  A labourer might get a holding as a landless man before an evicted tenant and <i>vice versa</i> on other estates.  There is no priority whatever.  That meets the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second point we could not, of course, put back an evicted tenant on a holding of 100 or 200 acres of land.  We could not do it.  It is never done and I take it the Dáil does not wish it to be done.  Secondly we would not put back the tenant on a congested holding.  That also would be the effect of the amendment as it stands.  Thirdly, we would not put a tenant back on a holding whether <Col N="1071" /> it was inside or outside congested districts if the particular holding was vacant and needed for the relief of congestion, because if the tenant himself were there we might be taking it from him.  Deputies must remember where any land exists for the relief of congestion we are to take it.  For those three reasons we could not accept that amendment as it stands.  It would compel us to do three things which I do not think the Dáil or the Deputy making the suggestion thinks ought to be done. That is No. 1.  With regard to the grabber, I know just as much as anyone about him.  There have been more evictions in the County Galway than any other county. I know it.  There was probably more land law made there than anywhere else. You would have cases like this where a man has been evicted 30 or 40 years ago, and a man came in and took his land.  His grandson might be there now with his family and it would be a grave the hardship to make him suffer for his grandfather. I make a present to any Deputies of that argument.</P>

      <P>No.  I would like there would be more people like that bred.  Before I go from those general statements it would be a grave hardship in a great many cases to put out a man like that, a man whose grandfather had <Col N="1072" /> taken the holding under circumstances which we cannot picture now.  There have been cases of genuine grabbing where holdings have been taken under shocking circumstances, but other cases which are rather on the border line we must examine.  However, when you are talking about the land question for any reason except business purposes you talk about grabbers.  Anyone knows that the twelve Apostles would evict some percentage of the tenants.  I do not expect Deputy Gorey will admit that but I am in a position to admit it.  Every responsible person knows that there is a small percentage St. Peter would evict. What would happen?  A very large percentage of the evicted tenants reinstated in 1903 sold their holdings.  You would have a case where a man was evicted 30 or 40 years ago and someone took his holding in circumstances more or less deplorable, and his grandson may be there now.  He may be a married man with a family and perhaps as good an Irishman as the next.  He would be put out and the evicted tenant brought back from New York and put in.  He would probably sell the holding after a while&mdash;there have been plenty of cases of that sort&mdash;he would sell the holding immediately, and, one of the neighbours of the tenant ejected would buy it, and you would have the unfortunate man bred, born and reared there, in some other holding in the neighbourhood, looking out at his holding which is now not in the hands of the evicted tenant but of some other person who had never any claim upon it.  It would be grossly unfair and unjust, and I for one see no case for it.  I will not have the amendment at any cost.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question I put respecting the arrests of two men at Valencia, Co. Kerry, the Minister gave an answer which I think rather discloses a state of things in the mind of the authorities in that district which calls for some attention.  I hope I am right in believing that they have gone further than the Minister would approve. The case dealt with is something as follows:&mdash;There has been a family dispute, lasting as long as five years over the ownership of a farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The eldest son is not a farmer.  Since he was eighteen years of age he has been employed in the Western Union Cable Company and he is now 53.  The second son, aged 44, committed the crime of getting married in July, 1918, and that was a grievous offence in that family.  The circumstances of the courtship and marriage I know nothing about, but it was such as to give offence to the father, and the father made a will in favour of the elder brother, who had never worked on the farm and who knows nothing whatever about farming.  For five years back no work has been done on the farm and no cattle have been sold off the farm.  The quarrel has continued up to date.  I am assured that there has been for five years past a regular refusal to ferry cattle from the island to the mainland.  There has never been any interference by the R.I.C. or the military during that time, and there has never been a breach of the peace in connection with the dispute.  It is important to note these facts.  It is a family quarrel and the people of the district, the labouring people at any rate, including the ferrymen, have taken the side of the brother who was the farmer, and who was dispossessed of his expectations. The father died about a year ago and, presumably, the brother with the grievance thought there was his opportunity to press his claim and take advantage of the fact that he was the only farmer in the family.  At least he was a farmer, but the ostensible owner, the legal owner, was not a farmer.  However, there has been some family quarrel.  In the early part of this year&mdash;and I take this from the Minister's answer&mdash;the son who claimed the land, because he had farmed the land under the father, was arrested and charged with illegally removing cattle from the land of his mother.  The Minister says he was allowed out on bail on giving an undertaking not to interfere illegally with the land again.  Then the Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;It is reported that since that date O'Driscoll continued to conspire with others, including James Burke and Jeremiah Murphy, with a view to preventing Mrs. O'Driscoll from using the land or from having her cattle conveyed to and from the mainland.  Burke and Murphy <Col N="1075" /> are boatmen plying for hire between Valencia and the mainland; and, while conveying the cattle of others, they refused to convey those of Mrs. O'Driscoll. In consequence of this refusal they were warned that if they persisted they would be arrested and charged with conspiracy. On the 19th ultimo they again refused to convey Mrs. O'Driscoll's cattle, while accepting for conveyance the cattle of other people.  They were then arrested and, with John O'Driscoll, were brought before a District Justice who allowed them out on bail on their giving an undertaking that they would not again interfere with Mrs. O'Driscoll in the management of her farm, and on a further undertaking by Burke and Murphy to convey her cattle at the usual charges when required to do so.&rdquo;  These ferrymen are unlicensed ferrymen; they own a boat which they use for conveying cattle and passengers to and from the mainland.  The contention of the authorities in that area, as described by the Minister's answer, is that they must be obliged under threat of arrest to convey cattle in their boat whether they wished to or not; that they have no option to refuse customers or accept customers; they have no option whether to accept employment or refuse employment by a particular customer or employer. If the Civic Guard say they must, well they must, or be arrested.  That strikes me as rather serious and an exhibition of arbitrary power that ought not to be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two ferrymen who have constantly refused for the past five years to convey cattle from this farm were taken into custody by Sergeant Connolly of the Civic Guard, Valentia, and their boats commandeered although they were private property and the ferry an unlicensed one. The cattle were loaded into the boats by the military authorities and ferried across by Commandant Griffin and his men.  The two ferrymen were conveyed to Tralee, 50 miles away, and were put into prison.  The Minister expanded his reply and stated that the men were charged with conspiracy, and that this refusal to accept employment from Mrs. O'Driscoll, or the refusal to convey Mrs. O'Driscoll's cattle in their boat from the Island to the mainland, was merely a part of the conspiracy.  I know nothing about any other activities, and the Minister has given no information as <Col N="1076" /> to any other activities, of these men or of any conspiracy.  It is stated that they interfered with the working of the land. I know nothing about that.  I take it from the Minister's own answer that they were arrested for refusing to convey cattle belonging to Mrs. O'Driscoll from the Island to the mainland.  I believe, and I hope my belief will be justified by the statement the Minister will make, that the Sergeant acted beyond his authority; that it is not the policy of the Ministry to compel people under threat of arrest to work for others for whom they do not wish to work, or to hire out their boats to convey cattle or passengers that they are not prepared to hire their boats to. If these men had interfered with the owner of the farm when taking her cattle to the mainland I could have understood the attitude of the Civic Guard, but why there should be a new policy inaugurated in regard to this domestic quarrel, at this stage, I cannot understand.  As I explained it is an old-standing family quarrel.  One section of the public sides with one son and another section sides with the other son.  The quarrel has continued for five years but these boatmen have never acted as ferrymen for this woman's cattle during that time. The Civic Guard comes along and says, &ldquo;henceforth you must,&rdquo; and because they refuse they are arrested, taken 50 miles away, and put into prison.  They are charged with conspiracy and released, having given an undertaking that they will do what the Civic Guard tells them they must do.  I think that requires some explanation, and I hope the Minister will disavow the action of the Civic Guard in that locality, and make it clear that there is no compulsion to be imposed upon a man to work for another man or for another woman, when he does not wish to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson may make his mind quite easy on this. There is nothing in this case which menaces the right to strike.  He asks why after five years a new policy should be inaugurated with regard to this family quarrel.  I trust he does not suggest that illegalities, by virtue of the fact that they have continued for five years, acquire a sacrosanctity that raises them above the intervention of the law, or the agents of the law.  With regard to this case I want to clear the ground.  I do not admit <Col N="1077" /> the Deputy's suggestion, that these two ferrymen were entitled to discriminate between cases of the same kind, solely on the basis of the identity of the owner of particular goods.  I do not admit that.  I am not joining issue on it at the moment, but I do not admit it and I want to mark that.  There is a case on record of a man who simply occasionally hired out a barge, and who was held liable by the courts for damage to goods in transit, through no fault of his own, the basis of the decision being that by long custom and by constantly holding himself and his boat out for hire he had become in law and in fact a common carrier, with all the obligations that that implies. Now, it may well be&mdash;I do not state it positively&mdash;that these two ferrymen, Burke and Murphy, by virtue of constantly plying between Valencia and the mainland, had become by custom common carriers and are not entitled to discriminate, in the manner they have been discriminating, against Mrs. O'Driscoll.</P>
      <P>As I say, that is not the point I am joining issue with the Deputy on, but I want to clear the ground and I want to mark the fact that I do not accept his contention that that discrimination was perfectly lawful.  I am afraid that I will have to inflict on the Deputy a certain amount of technicality and it will be a consolation to him to know that he has more or less brought it on himself.  I have looked up a definition of criminal conspiracy and I have gone to the highest authority available.  I have found that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Criminal conspiracy consists in an unlawful combination of two or more persons to do that which is contrary to law, or to cause a public mischief, or to do that which is wrongful and harmful towards another person, or to do a lawful act for an unlawful end, or by unlawful means, or wrongfully to prejudice a third person.  The offence is at common law a misdemeanour. The gist of the offence lies not in doing the act, or effecting the purpose for which the conspiracy is formed, nor in attempting to effect such purpose nor inciting others to do so, but in the forming of the scheme or agreement between the parties.  The combination to injure a third party without just cause or excuse is a criminal conspiracy, although the wrong intended, if done by one individual, would be a wrong and not a crime.  To refrain from <Col N="1078" /> dealing with a person is lawful; but an agreement between several to so refrain and to induce and compel others to so refrain is a criminal conspiracy.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I really want to stress is this, that these ferrymen were arrested and tried, not for the act of refusal to convey Mrs. O'Driscoll's cattle, but for criminal conspiracy with John O'Driscoll to injure his mother in the conduct of her business, the act of refusal being in itself evidence, and very material evidence, of the offence of conspiracy.  The ferrymen were arrested, legally arrested; they were brought before a District Justice; they were remanded on bail, I think on certain conditions.  They were arrested and, with John O'Driscoll, were brought before a District Justice who allowed them out on bail on their giving an undertaking that they would not again interfere with Mrs. O'Driscoll in the management of her farm, and on a further undertaking by Burke and Murphy to convey her cattle on the usual charge if required to do so. There was a fair in Cahirciveen on the 19th ultimo; the ferrymen were conveying the cattle of the islanders; they discriminated against Mrs. O'Driscoll and that was held to be material, almost conclusive, evidence of the existence of a conspiracy between these ferrymen and her son John to injure this woman in the conduct of her business.  Now, the five years.  We all know what the five years have been.  It brings us back to 1918. One can well understand that in the situation which existed in this country between 1918 and 1923, the rival authorities, conflicting for jurisdiction in this country, had very much more on their hands than matters of this kind.  I regard it as a good sign that a situation has come in which it is possible to deal with the illegalities that have existed for five years.  I regard it as a sign that the situation in the country to-day is promising, and possibly, in areas, more normal than it has been at any time for five years. As for the length of time, there is no prescriptive right to crime.  The Deputy is mistaken if he thinks that I do not stand over, and stand over very fully, the action of the police in this matter.  One point I will yield to him and that is this, that if it were the police who took the boat belonging to these ferrymen to convey <Col N="1079" /> Mrs. O'Driscoll's cattle they were exceeding their duty.</P>

      <P>The military have certain broad powers and discretion in the existing situation in the country, so broad that the courts do not hold themselves at liberty to enquire into the legality of their acts.  If the police, in the first instance, moved in taking the boats from the ferrymen, and themselves convey the cattle from the island to the mainland, they were doing something that exceeded their duty and their jurisdiction. One other point I want to make is with regard to common carriers.  If these men have in fact and in law become common carriers they are rot entitled to discriminate between the goods of one person and the goods of another.  It would be, of course, for the aggrieved person to move against them.</P>

      <P>In the courts.  I want to say all that I am conceding to the Deputy.  Possibly there was an excess of duty if the Civic Guards used the boats themselves to convey Mrs. O'Driscoll's cattle from the island to the mainland.  If the military did it is another matter.  They have very broad powers in the existing situation in the country, and they have been charged with the restoration of order.  If they considered it was part of their duty in the task of restoring order to interfere in the matter, we are not entitled to enquire into the legality of their act. If the Civic Guard did it they were exceeding their duty, and their right. Also I want to yield, on the common carrier point, if that is so that it would be for the aggrieved person to move in the Courts, but I am not standing on that leg.  I am standing on this, that the charge on which the two ferrymen <Col N="1080" /> were arrested, and the charge which was formulated against them before the District Justice was the charge of conspiracy. They were not charged with the act of refusing to carry these cattle but with criminal conspiracy and joining with John O'Driscoll to interfere with his mother in the conduct of her business, and the fact of refusal was very clear evidence of conspiracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the statement of Deputy Johnson and it did strike me, knowing nothing of the facts beyond what is stated, that it was fairly clear these men were common carriers, and if so they committed an actionable wrong in refusing to carry the cattle.  The persons who did that wrong laid themselves open to a civil suit at the prosecution of the person whom they had aggrieved.  It seemed to me from the statement of Deputy Johnson that it turns upon the question whether they had committed any crime.  I understood that they had been arrested for refusing to carry the cattle of the woman in question.  I do not think they could have been lawfully prosecuted for that, but when the other side of the case was heard it seemed reasonably clear that there was a fair ground for charging them with the criminal offence of conspiracy to injure Mrs. O'Driscoll, and it seems to me there was justification for arresting the men.  It seems perfectly clear on the statement of the Minister that they could not have been arrested for the mere offence of refusing to carry a particular person, but the law is quite clear that a common carrier has no right, if he has room in his conveyance, to refuse any passenger or goods tendered to him for conveyance with the ordinary freight that he charges for it.  The fact that this ferry was unlicensed does not to me seem to affect the matter at all because it is an arm of the sea, and any person who chooses can ply backwards and forwards for carrying goods and passengers.</P>
