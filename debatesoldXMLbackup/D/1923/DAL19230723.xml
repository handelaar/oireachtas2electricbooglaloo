      <P>This Bill has been considered in Committee and on Second Reading, and it had a number of amendments inserted in it.  The reception in the Dáil has been somewhat mixed, but at least it has gone through to this Stage, and I presume there will not be very much delay in the passing of this Stage, judging by the absence of those most interested.  I would like to say with regard to this Bill, that when it came on for Second Reading, there was some hesitation as to whether I should support the Second Reading, in view of the principle that was involved, that the landlords were entitled to the purchase by the State of their interests in the way it was proposed to do.  The Minister's speech in introducing the Bill helped me to make up my mind, and I concluded after hearing his speech, particularly, that in view of the precedent that was being set in this Bill, in view of the arguments that were put forward by the Minister, that it was desirable to support the Second Reading.  The principle that I referred to was the principle that the landlords having a certain legal right to draw rents for an unlimited number of years back, that legal right having been acquired under this Bill by the State through the issue of bonds bearing interest at 4½ per cent, the enunciation of that principle and its embodiment in the Bill led me to think that the same principle might well be adaptable to <Col N="1228" /> every section of the community.  I remembered that there is by virtue of long practice, custom as well as law, a right on the part of the individual citizen where he is hard-pressed and needy, to come upon the public funds for sustenance and maintenance, that when the alternative is starvation or sustenance, he must not choose starvation, because the public funds are available to maintain him.  I realise that the precedent set by this Bill might well be applied to the people who are at present entitled to call upon the public purse for maintenance in time of need.  I thought, perhaps, that the same idea that is embodied in this Land Bill might be applied, and that those citizens who were duly entitled by the law to come upon the State for a certain maintenance, could come to a new Dáil and claim the same kind of treatment as the landlords were claiming and were receiving. They could sell their rights to the State on the same terms.  They could calculate that, for themselves and their families the maintenance costs would run to about twenty to thirty shillings per week, and that those rights to maintenance could be sold to the State, at the same price at which the landlords' rights to draw rental are being sold under this Land Bill, and Bonds could be issued to them entitling them to draw four and a half per cent. interest for ever, as compensation for the sale of their right to maintenance.  Then it would be quite a useful method of treating the cases of so many thousands of people who are really needy, and people could, as a matter of fact, save up for a time of need the interest charges on those Bonds which they would receive in return for the sale of their right to draw sustenance from the public Exchequer.  I think the parallel is a fairly good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the adoption by the Dáil in the case of landlords' rights and as a possible headline for another Dáil which the Land Bill would set, it is well worth supporting.  I can imagine people asking whether the Ministry would be good enough to introduce a similar Bill to purchase their rights on the same terms as the landlords are being entitled to sell theirs.  The cost no doubt would be heavy, but I venture to think that it would be well worth the experiment. No doubt people would be selling something that is valuable, but they would <Col N="1229" /> be getting for it an immediate return, a guaranteed return for ever.  The landlords are, undoubtedly, being put in a position to draw upon the public for maintenance in exchange for the sale of their rights to draw rents.  If the idea can be embodied in future legislation and the example that is set by this Bill can be quoted, and Deputies of this Dáil or succeeding Dáils will be consistent in their view of the way one section or another of the public should be treated, then I think it would be a very good bargain for the community as a whole, and on those grounds I have no compunction in supporting the final stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to start a controversy on the particular point which has been raised by Deputy Johnson, partly because I do not know what he is driving at.  I do not think he developed his point, or made it quite clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to suggest that he should try again.  That was rather a mistake of mine, if my words pointed towards such a suggestion, and I hasten to withdraw them.  Seriously, I do not know what point he wished to make.  I do not see the parallel.  I am anxious to see it, but I do not see the parallel.  There is a certain amount in what the Deputy says, but only a certain amount, and we will never get anywhere unless we get right down next to the facts of the case and see how far they take us.  One of the facts of the case is that we are taking over what has been regarded as property.  It is no use if Deputy Johnson shuts his eyes to the facts.  Up to the present, and at the present, the rights of property are recognised and regarded in the country. Before we can get much farther along the lines that the Deputy developed we must make up our minds that we recognise the rights of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Parliament recognises them.  It is paying for the landlords' interest in the land, and it is from that point of view that the Dáil is approaching the question. It is for those reasons the Dáil is paying a certain amount for the property that is being taken.  That is the fact.  It is open to the Deputy, or to any other Deputy to persuade the Dáil that the rights of property should be abrogated in the country; but that has not <Col N="1230" /> been done yet.  I think the Deputy's suggestion was that we were really taking away certain moneys which these landlords employed to support themselves and their families, and that on those lines we should give certain moneys to workmen to support their wives and families.  I am not clear as to what his point was.  If there is any parallel that is the only parallel that I can see.  Of course, there is all the difference in the world, quite apart from the point of view of property.  In the one case you are taking away rights recognised by law&mdash; the rights of the landlord to get rent out of the land every year.  He parted with the land without compensation, and he gave it to a man who considered he was taking it as a good bargain, and he provided a certain consideration for the handing over of the land&mdash;namely, the right to get rent yearly.  You are taking that from him.  On the other hand you would be handing over rents to people whom the State does not recognise as being entitled to annuities.  I want to understand the Deputy's point, and that is the only parallel I can see.  However, this is not the time to discuss that matter.  We will never get any further in this direction, or nearer a solution of any of the problems which the Deputy raised now, if he does not face the facts and come down to business, and if he does not meet the real difficulties that are there, and not be attempting to meet the difficulties that are not there.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words on the Final Stage of this Bill.  Deputy Johnson remarked that those most interested in the Bill were badly represented.  That may be quite true, but neither is the Labour Party, nor any other Party in the Dáil, well represented.  As we of the Farmers' Party mentioned on the First and subsequent Readings of the Bill, we give the Government credit for making an honest effort towards settling this question. We realise that the Government had great difficulties, and that they are making an honest effort to overcome those difficulties.  The amendments that have been accepted, and passed by the Dáil, have certainly improved the Bill. There is, however, one point that is not satisfactory, and that is in connection with arrears.  All over the country resolutions are being passed, letters and telegrams sent, and every form of protest <Col N="1231" /> being made, in regard to those arrears. We have received our full share of those. Except the Seanad can improve the Bill in respect of the arrears clause, I take it nothing can be done, as I suppose it has passed from our jurisdiction.  On this, the Final Stage of the Bill, I would like to register, on behalf of the Farmers' Party, a protest.  We are not satisfied with the arrears Clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that Deputies have not altogether lost the memory of the Christmas pantomimes that they attended in their earlier days. It was the fashion at the end of the performance for those who had taken the principal roles to line up before the footlights, and each of them repeated some small little tag of what had been in the main portion of the stuff allotted to him. No doubt, the Bill has been considerably improved in minor regards since its first introduction, but the Bill was so admirable a Bill in its conception and in the spirit and practical character of it, that there was very little room for improvement. I think the Farmers' Party who represent those most interested, but not those who alone are interested, are willing to admit that.  The final protest against the Bill was merely with regard to arrears.  I notice that there is a proposal in some of the papers that as an act of gratitude towards the Labour Party for the support it gave to the Farmers' Union representatives in the Dáil on this Bill, a new party shall arise. a coalition or combination of Labour and Farmers.  I presume the first item in that new party's programme would be the settlement of the dispute in Waterford. On this question of arrears, it might be heartless to remind Deputy Rooney of the famous sentence in the play of Richard III., &ldquo;After sentence, plaining comes too late.&rdquo;  The point at which the attack should have been delivered was the stage at which powers were being taken to empower under-sheriffs to deal very severely with those in arrears.  Now, Deputy Rooney has forgotten one thing&mdash;namely, that this protest, though belated, was met very amicably by the Ministry, for an undertaking was given that those arrears that have not been collected, though steps were being taken rapidly to collect them. should be stayed.  A further concession was made, and that was to take off portion <Col N="1232" /> of the arrears where these amounted to three years, and spread that over the annuities, in part.  Another feature of the Bill which surely should commend itself to the Deputy, was the alteration that was made in favour of leaseholders. A very new thing, and a thing for which many people in the country were desirous, was the relief of leaseholders, who, because of the terms of the original instrument, were regarded as mill-owners, or as in possession of residential holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the amendment which the Minister for Agriculture has inserted, it does not matter what the character of these legal instruments may be.  The point is simply&mdash;what is the character of the holding?  Is it mainly an agricultural holding, for example, at the time of the passing of the Bill?  This has brought relief, not to a very large number, but still to a number whose omission from the operations of preceding Acts left a considerable sense of grievance.  The finance side of the scheme, somehow, has escaped admiration and praise.  Very few stopped to eulogise the genius with which what was once considered by the British Government, because of the British Treasury, an insoluble problem, has been solved with practically no expenditure of money, but merely by the judicious use of bookkeeping entries on opposite pages of a ledger, assisted by the issue of bonds.  If there was nothing else in this Bill than its ingenious finances it would require praise at this stage, and when I say it is ingenious I do not use the word in its modern sense, which is somewhat opprobrious, but in the earlier, 18th century sense, of exhibiting genius and ability of an exceptional sort.  What amazes me is that the people at large, and, of course, the country Press is somewhat to blame for this, are so greatly unaware of what a great revolution this Dáil has created in land tenure, so quietly and so effectually.  The people are not aware of it.  It is a curious thing with regard to historical matters generally. The people are not aware, when the thing is happening under their eyes, that something very exceptional is occurring.  They take up a history of past events, and they read about transformations of the social order and the setting up of absolutely new relations between man and man, say, in the 15th or in the 17th century, and they marvel at these.  But here is a revolution.  There is no application <Col N="1233" /> more appropriate for the term &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; than this, by which the land of the country is transferred to the people of the country and all the landless men and labourers who had lost employment through the operations of previous Acts and all the tenants with uneconomic holdings and men deprived of access to turbary are all relieved.  Why, there are, in the operation of this Bill, so many reforms that touch upon the future of Irish progress in so many different points that, in fact, without exaggeration one might almost say that it is because of the extraordinary number of reformatory items that the people are not aware of the Bill's importance.  The outside critic, if he were told of one of these things, if he received one at a time, would probably make it a subject of conversation for at least the nine days over which proverbial wonders extend, but when a full dish, in the classical sense, is presented it would look as if the imagination were staggered by the multiplicity of good things.  I must say that I have been quite surprised at the small amount of attention with which so great a Bill was received through the country.  When it was promised one might have said, &ldquo;it is too good to be true,&rdquo; but now that it is leaving the Dáil, so far as this Chamber is concerned with it, completed, and now that this extraordinary progress has been made with it in so short a time, the listlessness and lethargy of the people in regard to it are amazing.  I am old enough to remember the passing of the first Purchase Act, and I recollect the ferment of discussion and the enthusiasm that the prospect of its introduction into Westminster occasioned.  Either we have become deadened in these later years by so many sensations of another kind, or we have so increased the scope of our aspirations and demands that a great measure like this seems little to us.  At any rate, I think it my duty, as one independent Deputy, to say just this much in praise of the enterprise of the Minister who introduced the measure and the extraordinary capacity that he displayed, the minute knowledge of every detail in it and the masterly attention he gave throughout the long days of the most fatiguing discussion. He kept his mind clear and his statements equally clear in the discussions, and carried this thing through successfully.  It seems to me, if I may pose now as one of the older members, <Col N="1234" /> older, I mean, in point of years, as a very happy augury for the future of Ireland when one of the youngest of the Ministers in this young Parliament was able to undertake and carry through such a great achievement.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to mar in any sense the pantomime illustration that Deputy Magennis just gave to the Dáil.  I think he was the last, although I think it will be in general agreement that he was certainly not the least of the figures who had contributed to certain portions of a very profitable entertainment during the course of the passing of this Bill through the Dáil.  I had not taken any part in this Bill except, with commendable restraint, to exercise a vote in its favour whenever it went to a vote.  I am only moved now to participate because of certain comments made by Deputy Johnson.  I think that the chief virtue of this Bill has been an element that, I believe, will be of very great virtue to us in the future if we remember it rightly, and that it signalises in a statesmanlike achievement a very happy compromise profitable alike to both parties that participated in the compromise.  I know that there is much to be said at all times against the spirit of compromise, that there are doctrines to be ridden, and sometimes ridden to the death, but this Bill has certainly proved to the Dáil, and, I believe, in spite of apparent agitation, has proved to the country that that spirit of compromise is an excellent spirit, and that it has been very finely exemplified in the provisions of this Bill.  What one may refer to, perhaps, as the mitigated praise that it has received from both sides is a proof of the nearness and justice of that compromise.  Claims have been made by those who possess land, and claims have been made by those who desired to be the possessors of land.  It is a recognised principle in Ireland, and it has been accepted, and it is not the least virtue of this Bill that it should have been accepted during the course of the Bill, by all parties in the Dáil, that it was desirable to set up no national doctrine, but a nation of peasant proprietors.  I remember Deputy Johnson's statement to that effect, and I think it was a statesmanlike statement on his part that the country will remember in the future. But in accepting that essential principle, in spite of the acuteness with which <Col N="1235" /> certain phases of it have been addressed and attacked, that claims made by one side, or claims made by the other, might or might not be very excellent outside as a doctrine, this Bill sealed a settlement in respect of a very vexed question by a compromise that was as near justice as it was possible to achieve, if one estimates the justice by the fact that each side have had their criticisms to make, and each side have accepted the general principles of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I speak in this matter with very sincere feeling.  I believe a very great achievement has been done in this Bill, and a very great landmark has been passed in the passage of this Bill through all its stages.  Since the occasion has been the moment for adorning what Deputy Johnson imagines to be the doctrine of the Bill by emphasing certain features of it that he regards to be the most important, I have merely risen on this occasion to emphasise what I regard to be the most important feature of this Bill, and that is when two sides in a national dispute, a dispute of many generations, have been put forward with a great deal of emphasis from each side that it is the nation's business to seal that settlement as far as it is possible in what is a just compromise.  It is because that compromise has been so just and has been defended with a great deal of critical ability and acumen by the Minister that I would like to join my voice, speaking now for the first time on the Bill, in praising the achievement that has been made by the Minister and amended by the Dáil, and which when passed into law, I believe, will be for the very considerable benefit of the country.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now passed.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Rooney in reference to arrears, fifty per cent. of the arrears are paid already in accordance with the terms of the Bill&mdash;fifty per cent at least of the arrears.  I think that is the clearest evidence as to the justice of the particular terms in the Bill in regard to arrears, that even at the present moment before the Bill is law, at least fifty per cent of <Col N="1236" /> arrears are paid in accordance with the terms of the Bill.  With regard to the Bill itself, I want to say this, it aims at the completion of land purchase. Deputy Johnson made a point some time ago when he said that when the Bill was definitely through Ireland would be divided into two watertight compartments. On one side, we would have the owners of land and on the other the labourers and professional people, and he asked that some arrangements should be made in the Bill to enable a more fluid arrangement to be come to by which a man could be gradually made the owner of his land.  That is, of course, the real danger.  We know that in other countries, like France or Germany, where land is subdivided, and where you have peasant owners on the one side, each man owning his own holding, that that type of country develops an aggressive antisocial type of individual.  That is the real danger in this country, as in every other country of small proprietors.  I have endeavoured to meet that in the Bill as far as it could be met, and I think there are arrangements in the Bill to meet that case, provided the landless men and workmen do a little bit of hard thinking on the various methods of holding land, and the various organisations, which possibly might become the owners of land.  People have been discussing what is the most revolutionary part of the Bill.  In my opinion it is Section 31 sub-section (f), which says that the Land Commission may make an advance to any person or body to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, the advance ought to be made.  When we were drafting the Bill we had to face the fact that you had to sell their holdings to tenants. They were the owners, as they practically held the fee-simple of them already. They had the habit of ownership and you could make no other arrangement. You had to sell to them their holdings. Where the holdings were uneconomic you had to make them economic for them and give them these holdings as the absolute owners.  The same does not apply to the landless men.  The most they are getting is a loan on State credit for the purpose of purchasing holdings. They have no particular right to State credit any more than any other class has for any other purpose, and the fact is that <Col N="1237" /> there is not enough of land in Ireland to deal with all the men who are expecting land.  Some way will have to be found out of the difficulty.  There will be no land to divide amongst landless men for the next two or three years. It will take at least two years to deal with the tenants&mdash;probably more&mdash; and as I have said there will be very little land divided among landless men for at least two years.  By that time I think it will be found that you will have at least three or four applicants for every possible holding.  It will be for the Land Commission, and if I might say so, for the Trades Unions to find some way out of the difficulty by that time.  My suggestion, for what it is worth, unless a better suggestion is made, is that some such organisation as the National Land Bank perfected should be made use of and improved, so that advances would not be made to individual landless men, but to societies of landless men.  That would get over the first and the big difficulty, namely, that you have not enough of land to go around, and it will get over the second difficulty that you will not be giving the holdings to men who merely want them to sell, and then clear out of the country.  At any rate, there are immense possibilities, and it is for the Trades Unions to make use of them under that clause.  I have only to thank the Dáil generally, for the way they have received the Bill, and for the helpful criticism I have received from all parties, Labour, Independent and Farmers, in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It is doubtful whether the object stated here will be attained by this amendment.  The intention is, of course, to ensure that persons detained under an Order cannot be detained beyond the period for which the Act is timed to expire.  I suggest that it would be much more likely or much more certain to achieve the object aimed at if some such words as these were inserted in addition to the amendment &ldquo;for any period not extending beyond the period of the duration of this Act&rdquo;&mdash;if these words were inserted after the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in line 12.  It will be noted that there is a provision in the Bill which will certainly detain people longer than the period during which the Act is continued. There is provision in the Bill for sentences for 12 months or longer.  Now, there is no provision in the Bill which says that the Executive Minister shall not order for any period longer than six months.  If perchance an Executive Minister were to order the detention of a prisoner or an internee for 9 or 12 <Col N="1239" /> months stating the period in his order, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent him doing so.  The suggestion I make is that some such words as I have mentioned should follow the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in line 12.  It would then read:&mdash;&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Executive Minister subject to the provisions of this Act, to order the detention in custody for any period not extending beyond the period of the duration of the Act,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>This object, the Minister explained in moving the amendment, would be safeguarded. Otherwise there is nothing in the Bill to ensure, even after the introduction of these words, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; that the Act shall only prevail for a period of six months in respect to detained prisoners.  In view of the declared intention of the Minister I think the amendment, in the form I suggest, would more thoroughly secure the end he seeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the statement which the Deputy has made shows his failure to appreciate the difference between &ldquo;internment&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprisonment,&rdquo; because the difference lies just in the fact that internment is not ordered for a period.  There is no period specified.  It is detention by the Executive in the interest of public safety, and no period is stated for that detention.  It is not proposed to arrest people and order one man to be detained for a period of a month and another for a period of six weeks, but it is simply a decision on the part of the Executive that the public safety requires that A.B. be detained, and the powers, under which such detention takes place, will be the powers conferred by this Bill, and will, I submit, expire automatically with this Bill.  I do not hold, and neither do the officials of my Department hold, nor does the Attorney-General, nor the draftsman, that this particular amendment, which has been moved, would be necessary to secure that a person would not be detained for a longer time than six months&mdash;that is the life-time of the Bill. But Deputy Gavan Duffy professed uneasiness on the matter, and it was a small thing to soothe his mind by inserting the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; and that is simply painting the lily.  Deputy Johnson goes further and speaks of a period that it would be lawful to order the detention&mdash;<Col N="1240" /> for a period not extending beyond the period of the existence of the Act.  I think that takes away from the whole point and purpose of detention.  A decision is come to that the public safety requires the detention of A.B. and when a decision is come to that the public safety does not require the detention of A.B. then A.B. will be released.  It is inadvisable to speak of periods of detention. The Bill gives power to the Executive to detain for a period of six months, any person whose liberty they believe to endanger the public peace, and the public safety, and that power of detention would not survive the Bill.  No other lawyer, I believe, but Deputy Gavan Duffy, would suggest that a Bill giving special powers of this kind, brought in in an emergency situation, and conferring special powers upon the Executive, would confer these powers for any longer period than the lifetime of the Bill.  The draftsman and the Attorney-General were completely satisfied with the wording of the Bill as it stood, but it was a small cost to soothe Deputy Gavan Duffy's mind by inserting these few words which we believed, and still believe, to be absolutely superfluous.  No one would think of quoting in nine months' time, as a reason for the detention of persons without charge or trial, the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act which expired three months before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word on this amendment.  I accepted <Col N="1241" /> an amendment moved by Deputy Morrissey on the Committee Stage which provided that a person should not be interned without a certificate from a particular officer to the effect that he believed that, for reasons which he would set out, the arrest and detention of A.B. was necessary.  I accepted that amendment in a purely lay-minded way, and having accepted it was later informed by technical and professional people that, where in an Act it is set out that something is to be done for stated reasons, the use of these words makes it competent for a Court to inquire into the reasons, and to pronounce on their validity or sufficiency. That entirely altered the complexion of the amendment to my mind, and also altered it in the view of my Department, because, on that basis, the amendment would be contrary to the spirit of the Bill which confers extraordinary power on the Executive, the power of detention without trial.  To say that the Court may inquire into the sufficiency of the reasons for A.B.'s detention, was to say something which would be equivalent to making it competent for the Court so to inquire as to be a departure from the spirit and purport of the Bill.  I could not, therefore, with safety, I am advised, accept that wording of the amendment which Deputy Morrissey moved, making it by the Bill itself incumbent on the officer to state the reasons for detention, because once you insert that provision there is no means by which you could make it outside the jurisdiction of the Court to inquire into the sufficiency of these reasons.  But I do give this undertaking, on my own behalf, and on behalf of the Executive Council, that in all cases the reasons will be insisted on, and will be certified, but I cannot agree to the insertion of this provision in the Bill for the technical reasons I have stated. I think the main object Deputy Morrissey wished to secure was simply that such a precaution would be taken, and that in practice the duty should lie on someone to set out clearly the reasons why a particular citizen's liberty was being interfered with; and he accepted my view that that ought to be merely a departmental, confidential record.  He went further and stated, that there was no intention whatever of laying a trap, and no intention whatever of inserting in the Bill something that would, in fact, enable the Court to try the whole question of the rightness or wrongness of A.B.'s detention, <Col N="1242" /> or the whole question of the sufficiency, or otherwise, of the reasons for it.  Therefore, I think on that basis Deputies will agree that I am not departing from the spirit of any promise or undertaking I have given, in asking that these words be deleted from the Bill, because I do undertake that in all cases a record of that kind, a confidential departmental record, will be insisted on, and that in all cases the duty will lie on the officer who is taking on himself a responsibility for interfering, or recommending interference, with a citizen's liberty, to set out clearly and fully for the information of the Minister concerned, the grounds for that recommendation.</P>

      <P>The section in question deals with the continued detention of those at present in custody.  The Minister has not given us an assurance that there are in the archives of his Department, or in any other Department, written reasons why A.B. or X.Y.Z., are in detention.  In that case, if these words are removed it will be within the competence of the military authorities to continue the detention of persons, if they are of opinion that the detention of these persons is a matter of military necessity.  In that case no reasons will have been stated even confidentially to the Department, and no one will have had imposed upon him the duty of finding out whether there was a reason for the detention of any prisoner or internee.  The object of the amendment, which was accepted on the last occasion, was to ensure that somebody at least would have imposed upon him the duty of considering whether A.B. or C.D. ought to be detained, even though the reasons to be stated were only to be submitted for the Departments concerned; that at least somebody would have to consider the question, and give some reasons to a superior authority.  Now, the Minister desires that that duty, which was imposed upon the military authorities on the last Stage of the Bill should be removed, and that no such liability should lie upon the military for their continued detention of prisoners.  The Minister again tries to persuade the Dáil that because he gives an assurance that their intention is to do a certain thing, that there is no need to insert in the Bill a requirement that such a thing should be done. One could imagine such a plea at the <Col N="1243" /> beginning of a Parliament, but one can only smile when one hears such a plea at the end of a Parliament.  Suppose Deputy Gorey were to be Minister for Home Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, but this Dáil has imposed upon it the responsibility of making law and the new Dáil will have to be responsible for introducing new measures.  If all the Acts that have been passed, or are proposed to be passed, have to go through the small tooth comb during the first weeks of the new Dáil to correct any mistakes that have been made or any injustices that have been inserted in Bills passed by this Dáil you will be putting upon that body an impossible task.  It is much better, I submit, to avoid the necessity, if you possibly can, for those mistakes being corrected.  The Minister gives us an assurance, and as he says he can only give an assurance respecting his own conduct, or the conduct of the Executive Council, of which he is a member. But we are now asked to pass a Bill, and that Bill will be the law, and it is under that Bill, or Act when it becomes the law, that the military authorities will exercise their option.  If they are of opinion that military necessity requires that a person should be detained this Bill, if it passes in the form in which the Minister desires it, gives authority to these military powers to detain those persons simply by virtue of their opinion that such a person should be detained.  They are not even to be asked to put down in writing for future reference why such a person is to be detained. The Minister explains his change of front in this matter because the phraseology in the amendment which he then accepted seems to carry with it certain legal liabilities.  When the amendment was proposed there was no hidden reading or understanding of legal technicalities of what was embodied in the words &ldquo;for stated reasons.&rdquo; But it should be, I think, plain <Col N="1244" /> commonsense that if an officer of State has to have power to detain a citizen for such time within six months as he desires, that at least he should have imposed upon him the responsibility of writing down to somebody, or setting down in a book or in a document, reasons why he thinks such continued detention is necessary.  The Minister asks us to trust whoever may be the responsible Ministers for the next six months.  When we are dealing with Acts of Parliament I think it is very unsatisfactory to be asked to trust to the wisdom and discretion of Executive Officers or Ministers for Defence, or even military captains.  If the military authorities are of opinion that a person should be detained then they may detain him.  I do not think there is any definition of military authority.  It may even be that a subordinate officer would be deemed to be a military authority, and unless his act was brought before the notice of his superiors then he would be acting quite lawfully in detaining without reason.  Somebody would have imposed upon him or her the responsibility of reporting the fact of the detention of a prisoner to the higher authority of the Army before the subordinate authorities of the Army could be brought into question.  Subordinate officers are not to be asked to state any reason even for the information of their superior as to why a prisoner is to be detained.  The explanation given by the Minister that the insertion of these words would bring the whole question of military detention under the purview of the Courts no doubt is serious from his point of view, and it is a credit to the law that that is the case.  It shows how much more sane the law is than the mere opinion of a military authority.  I am sorry that I cannot suggest any other method of ensuring at the very least before a citizen is detained that somebody would have imposed upon him the duty of saying, even to his superior officer, the reason why such a person is being detained. If the civil power is to have control of the military powers, and that is the justification that was originally adduced for the introduction of this Bill&mdash;that it was an attempt to bring the civil power into complete authority&mdash;surely it ought to be provided that the military authorities should say why they are detaining a prisoner and that they should have some <Col N="1245" /> reason for detaining a prisoner, and not merely be acting upon an opinion or a spite or a spleen or a grudge, as might well be under this Section.  I submit that it is the smallest demand that the Dáil should make upon the Ministry, that the reasons for a prisoner's detention should at least be written down by the person primarily responsible for that detention.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, allow me to retort that it is not the benevolent intentions of the mover of an amendment that counts, but the legal effect of the amendment that is moved.  I have pointed out that when, by the provisions of a Bill, a legal duty is imposed on any person to state reasons for the course he has taken, that it thereupon automatically comes within the competence of the Courts to inquire into the question of the sufficiency or insufficiency of those reasons.  Because of that, I am unwilling to accept an amendment placing the legal duty upon an officer to set out the reasons for the arrest and detention of any person under this Bill. I submit that to bring within the purview of the Courts the question of the necessity or otherwise for the detention of a person is contrary to the spirit of the Bill I did undertake that, as a matter of practice, in exercising the powers conferred by this Bill, such a precaution would be observed.  I undertook that on my own behalf and on behalf of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy in considering this amendment should advert to Amendment 6, which proposes to substitute for the words &ldquo;in the present emergency or&rdquo; the words &ldquo;arising out of the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion, whether local or general or.&rdquo;  In point of fact, the change is not material because action cannot be taken <Col N="1246" /> based on military necessity otherwise than in a condition of war or armed revolt.  Action cannot be justified as a military necessity save in those conditions. The power of arresting persons without charge and without reason stated is inherent in the military when conditions of war or armed revolt prevail.  If we were to set out in this sub-section that reasons should be stated, then you would have a two-fold result.  You would have the result that, as I have stated, you would place it within the competence of the Courts to enquire into the sufficiency of those reasons and you would have the result that you would be hampering, or attempting to hamper, the military in the exercise of powers which are inherent in them by virtue of a state of war or armed revolt.  This Bill was introduced largely to deal with a situation that would arise when the Courts refuse to take the view of the military authorities that a state of war or armed revolt prevails.  We were simply facing the fact that you have throughout the country the elements of serious trouble.  The question of releasing the very large number of internees that are on hands at the moment must be approached guardedly and cautiously. To hold any of these the day or the week after the Courts decide that a state of war or armed rebellion no longer exists, it is necessary to obtain powers to hold all, and then proceed to use that discretion, that judgment, that knowledge of the situation which an Executive Council presumably possess as long as they hold the confidence of the representatives of the people.  I have, with regard to this amendment, no concession to make.  We have not been able to devise any form of words that would at one and the same time impose a legal duty on people to state their reasons for a particular course and at the same time exclude the consideration of those reasons by the Courts.  Consequently, I have no alternative but to take the line set out in Deputy Duggan's amendment and to ask for the deletion of those words, on the understanding and on the undertaking I have given, that as a matter of practice, in the exercise of the powers which this Bill proposes to confer, that precaution will be taken of insisting that officers responsible for the arrest and detention of citizens will, in point of fact, be asked to set out their reasons for such recommendation.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Dáil, unlike the Minister, will not go back on its acceptance of the amendment that was introduced in Committee, but that it will insist on keeping those words in the sub-section.  The Minister this evening, and repeatedly has shown what may be, from his point of view, justifiable distrust of the law, or rather of the Courts.  That is not a position which I think the Dáil should take up.  If there is a conflict between the legislative assembly and the military arm of the Executive, ordinary citizens, except there is something very extraordinary in it, should support the legislative assembly. One is tempted, when one hears a Minister arguing as he argued this evening, to wish that there were more professorial Deputies in the Dáil, because one feels that it would be good for the Dáil, occassionally, to be told that there are certain relations between the different branches of legislation&mdash;between that branch which makes laws, that branch which administers laws, and that branch which interprets the laws when so made, and whose function is to keep a check on the administration.  The Minister, I think, has made it as clear as it can be that his intention really is to subordinate the Courts to the military arm.  That is not a position which we, as a legislative Assembly, can support or ought to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking frankly, and from experience, I do not trust the general body of officers in whose hands will really lie the decision on matters such as are dealt with in this sub-section.  I have in my pocket a reply from the Military Authorities, dealing with a prisoner whose case I took up five or six months ago along with two others. While they agreed two or three months ago to release one or two of those prisoners, they still detain the third, and they tell me now that arrangements will be made for the release of the third.  People who carry things over so long as that have got a peculiar conception of their duties in matters of that kind, and are not to be trusted when they merely express an opinion.  No matter how much we appreciate the Minister's intentions it is not enough.  We must have something more than Minister's intentions.  Even his apparent concession in inserting earlier in the Bill, in the first Section the words &ldquo;Arising out of the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion whether <Col N="1248" /> local or general,&rdquo; does not go far enough. It does not go as far as to be satisfactory, because this sub-section deals with people who are at present in military custody. Now, if he gets the declaration from the military that in a certain area, there is a state of war or of armed rebellion, and, on that, confines or continues to keep in confinement, certain prisoners, what about the prisoners who are not from that area?  What about the prisoners who are from the area in which there is not a state of war or armed rebellion?  He can still keep them in spite of this provision about a state of war or armed rebellion locally.  He can keep prisoners drawn from areas in which there is no state of war or armed rebellion recognised even by the military, not to speak even of the Courts, and he can do that without any stated reason being given by the military. The Bill does not require that reason to be given at all.  It merely requires an expression of opinion on the part of the military.  If there is anything like logic in the position, of course there would be nothing for him to do but to release all those who did not happen to hail from that disturbed area.  He will not do that. He does not want to do that.  Merely on the opinion of a military officer of certain rank he is going to detain them.  The Dáil, I think, should not accept that amendment. It should insist on the position accepted by the Minister on the previous occasion, and agreed to by the Dáil, and leave these words as they were passed on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry these words have been left out, because I do not share the apprehension of the Minister that they could be used in the way in which he fears they could be; but as he has been so advised, I would certainly like to say that I am quite clear he is not going back in any way on anything that he said on a former Stage of this Bill.  When he did intimate that he was prepared to consider the acceptance of this amendment, he made it perfectly clear, to me at any rate, and I think to everybody else, that he could only do so on the assurance that the certificate which he agreed should be given, should not be capable of being investigated, and the reasons should not be advanced by anybody except himself or the military authority, or, in certain ceses, the tribunal that would deal with the case <Col N="1249" /> later on if it happened to come before them.  If this amendment is pressed to a division I would consider myself bound to support it, because the amendment is giving effect to the undertaking the Minister himself gave, and he is carrying out the bargain made between himself and the Dáil when he said that he would consider whether this amendment <Col N="1250" /> could be introduced or not, and that he would only agree to it on the understanding that the certificates could not be used in the manner in which he is now advised they might be.  If he has that apprehension I think that he is perfectly entitled to have it removed. although I think it is ill-founded.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment is to shift the onus of proof in the matter which the Section covers from the person who was suspected of having acquired the property wrongfully to the Executive.  It would substantially alter the effect of the Section and it is not acceptable.  This particular Section is, as I explained on the Committee Stage, an extension and adaptation of provisions that already exist in the Dublin Metropolitan Police Acts and the wording is taken from these Acts.  It provides that application may be made by &ldquo;An Executive Minister to a District Justice alleging that land, investments or other property in the possession or control of any person was bought by such person with, or otherwise represents, or is directly or indirectly derived from any stolen property or funds, or any public funds, or funds which ought to be in the custody of a Minister or a Government Department.&rdquo; It goes on to say that in such an event &ldquo;The District Justice shall, unless the person having possession or control of such lands, investments or property satisfies him that such allegation is untrue, order the transfer of such property in so far as it consists of land, to the Irish Land Commission, and in so far as it consists of investments or other property to the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; The Deputy may consider that this amendment is a small matter, that it simply has the effect of putting the matter <Col N="1254" /> positively rather than negatively, but in point of fact, it does definitely shift the onus of proof.  In times like the present, when there has been so much promiscuous robbery and looting as there has been within recent months, it is not a hardship to provide that an individual may be called upon to clear himself of the suspicion of having come by certain property wrongfully, and that is the aspect that we wish to preserve, that it is within the power and within the province of the Executive to put an individual citizen on proof of having come by property within his possession honestly and rightfully.  The <i>prima facie</i> case will be placed before the District Justice. The onus of rebutting that suspicion is placed on the individual citizen, and this provides that in the event of his failing to rebut the suspicion on which the Executive moves, that the District Justice shall order the transfer of such property, if it be land to the Land Commission, and if it consists of investments to the Minister for Finance.  Further on, Sub-section 5 provides for an appeal from the District Justice to the County Court Judge, and it provides that &ldquo;an order of the County Court Judge on the hearing of any such appeal shall have the same operation as a like order by a District Justice.&rdquo;  The Deputy's wording puts on the State practically the burden of proof, and practically demands that conclusive evidence, evidence with which a District Justice will be entirely satisfied, shall be produced by the Executive.  What is asked is that where reasonable suspicion rests, the onus should lie on the citizen to clear himself of that suspicion, and to show, in fact, what it ought to be easy for any citizen to do, that the particular piece of property in his possession came honestly and justly into his possession.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be simply to place the onus on an individual to show that certain money belonged to him, that, in fact, he could operate on it and might lodge it to his credit, and that he could draw on it and exercise all the prerogatives of proprietorship.  The whole object of this Section is to enable stolen property or stolen funds to be traced and forfeited to the Ministry of Finance. The Section says: &ldquo;Any stolen property or funds, or any public funds, or funds which ought to be in the custody or under the control of a Minister or a Government Department.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There have been robberies on the grand scale inside the last ten or twelve months.  Banks were held up and large sums of money stolen; Post Offices have been raided and valuable property has been looted throughout the country.  If these, or any considerable proportion of them, are to be successfully traced, we must have power to ask more from an individual than simply to show that he has actual possession and control of money and can operate with it.  He must be in a position to show that it came honestly into his possession, and that it is not stolen property or funds or the proceeds of stolen property.  That is the power that is asked for.  It was difficult to find the exact form of words to cover that.  In a Bill of this kind power is to be given, and power is to be asked for, with some appreciation of the fact that it will be used with due discretion, and used in such a manner that hardship will not ensue.  The Minister for Finance, if he is to be at all successful in tracing all or any of the large sums that are being stolen throughout the country, must get more power than the Deputy's amendment leaves.  He must get power of following up stolen property, and of asking an individual, reasonably suspected of having property or funds wrongfully in his possession, to show that these are not the proceeds of robbery or the proceeds of theft, and not merely that they belong to him, but that he came rightfully and lawfully by them, and that he is not merely a middleman or an accomplice in the robbery of property or of funds which are not his.  If you had no power of tracing funds after they had actually passed from the hands of the robber, then the Executive would be in a very helpless condition; if you had no power of tracing the proceeds of property after the robber would have succeeded in liquidating it, then you, would be practically helpless, because it is not to be supposed that people having committed a robbery, or people having conspired to plunder, will remain for any very long period in actual possession of the proceeds of that crime.  They will take steps to pass it on, to have it in someone else's name, as has been done to our knowledge with the proceeds of bank robberies in Cork and elsewhere. The powers asked here are not excessive, if we are to have any hope of achieving the end at which the Bill aims, the end of following up and, as far as possible, restoring to the lawful owner property or funds that have been stolen through the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember that this Bill has a life-time of only six months; that it is intended to deal with a very special set of circumstances, to deal with a situation in which we find ourselves emerging from a war-period, and in which we cannot afford to ignore the possibility of local recrudescences. The Deputy does us too much credit if he thinks we have so far succeeded in our task that such a thing as intimidation of jurymen would not be possible in any county at the moment, or would not be possible in the near future.</P>
      <P>This Section faces the fact that conditions might well exist in a particular area, or might well even grow up about a particular place, which would render a fair and impartial trial of the case impossible in that particular area, and it asks power that the venue may be changed when an application by or on behalf of the Attorney-General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the presence of all these elements which are calculated to weigh in the minds of jurymen and calculated to deter them from the proper and responsible discharge of their duties, the Executive itself is the best judge of the conditions in a particular area, and when the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Executive, enters his certificate to the effect that in his belief a more fair trial and a more impartial trial can be secured elsewhere than in the particular area and venue of the crime or of the case, then we see no reason why power should not be given by the Dáil for a change of venue of that kind.</P>

The difficulty in dealing with some of these amendments is that it would be perfectly right and perfectly proper to accept them if we could feel that all citizens are as responsible and as conscientious as the people, say, who move the amendment; but we know they are not, and we know also there is far more physical courage in this country at the moment than there is moral courage and that jurymen, in deciding on particular cases, are subject to local influences, local passions and prejudices of one kind or another that do amount to and constitute an impossibility of securing a fair and impartial hearing of certain cases, at any rate in the areas in which these cases arise.</P>

      <P>Yes, I realise it. I am not speaking on this matter without the book.  I do know that recently, even within the last few months, cases here and there in particular counties have been considered by juries, and have been decided upon in direct conflict with the evidence tendered to the juries.  That is rather a painful admission.  It shows that we have yet some way to go before we arrive at proper standards of civic responsibility and proper standards of civic duty, the duty that lies towards the State from the citizens, corresponding to the duty that lies from the State towards the citizens.  In the times through which we are passing, this provision in the Bill is absolutely necessary if justice is to be done within our territory.  The suggestion in this particular amendment <Col N="1262" /> is that the matter be one for the discretion of the Court, that the Attorney-General merely puts forward particular representations, or puts forward a particular case, and that the Court shall discuss and decide that.  That is objectionable. From the very nature of his position the Attorney-General is the responsible officer of the State.  His cerficate to the effect that a fair trial of the case cannot be held within a particular area ought to be final and ought to be accepted by the Courts.  Very often all the reasons which render it difficult or impossible to secure a fair trial within a particular area cannot be fully stated, or are of such a nature that it would not be in the public interest to state them fully. I have a particular case in mind, a case arising in the Midlands that certainly ought not to be tried in the locality in which it arose, and it would be difficult and inadvisable to state here or to state publicly in the Courts all the reason for that.  It is not excessive in a Bill of this kind which deals with a special period, and a special emergency, to ask the Dáil to say that when the highest Law Officer of the State submits a certificate to the Courts that a particular case could not be fairly or impartially tried in a particular area that that ought to be final for the Court, and that the Court without any further discussion or deliberation should order a change of venue for that case. In considering these and other powers conferred by the Bill I merely want to repeat and to stress that it depends upon the spirit in which Deputies think that these powers would be wielded and exercised. If Deputies consider that this particular power could be made an instrument of tyranny I say that practically every power conferred by this Bill could be made an instrument of tyranny But if Deputies do sincerely believe that an Executive responsible to them, responsible through them to the people, is of such a kind that it would be certain or likely to use these powers in that way, then there certainly ought to be a change of Executive.  You are not dealing now with arbitrary Government imposed upon the people by force from elsewhere.  You are dealing with an Executive responsible to the people through their elected representatives, and if we were a body that could not safely be entrusted with this power, or with other powers conferred by this Bill, then we ought not to be in <Col N="1263" /> our present position at all and the representatives of the people ought to elect to this position people more worthy.  The difficulty I have had in dealing with amendments to this Bill, and in defending the provisions of this Bill, is just that difficulty that I do realise the Bill, in its nakedness, in the letter of its provisions, could be made a vehicle of tyranny, and I have had repeatedly to ask Deputies to remember that its powers had to be exercised by an Executive responsible from <Col N="1264" /> day to day to the people's representatives here and if in the interest of the common weal and of the public safety we were thought to be people to whom these powers could not be entrusted then it would be better that there were a change and that people were selected who could be entrusted with drastic and far-reaching powers, in full confidence that they would be used with discretion and used only in the public interest.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell's amendment is covered substantially by the official amendments that have been inserted, Numbers 17 and 18.  The only portion of it that is not so covered, I think you will agree with me, is the portion providing for visits by members of the Oireachtas&mdash;&ldquo;The visiting of any person therein by any member of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That is the only portion of Deputy O'Connell's amendment that is unacceptable, and that we propose to contest.  Deputies can visualise for themselves the effect it would have on the discipline and control of places of detention if any member of the Oireachtas could visit any prison, and Deputies can imagine too, most of them from their own recollections, the amount of material that would be awaiting each such visitor, the amount of false propaganda that would be awaiting such visit, and if Deputies lack that degree of imagination that will enable them to visualise the conditions, I am afraid I can contribute very little towards helping them.  It is always the same thing, that one could imagine visits by certain Deputies to these places of detention as absolutely innocuous, and one could imagine visits by other Deputies as extremely injurious to the discipline of these places, and calculated to provoke nothing but mischief, and mischief of a particularly futile kind, yet one cannot discriminate.  When confronted with an amendment containing a provision of that kind, there seems to be no alternative but to take a stand strictly on this, that it is not possible to make a concession of that kind.  In discussing an amendment by Deputy Gavan Duffy we had before us the question of <Col N="1266" /> admitting certain medical members of either House of the Oireachtas, and that amendment was discussed and defeated.</P>
      <P>This probably goes even further and says that any member of the Oireachtas, any Senator or any Teachta should be free to visit any detained person and presumably every detained person.  Now I do submit that there is no more case for that than for allowing, let us say, Deputies to visit and inspect every Department and see just how each department is run, how each official is doing and generally to overhaul the whole Executive machine.  That is not among the privileges of Deputies.  The Executive machine is judged by its results and if these results are unsatisfactory to Deputies then Deputies take the obvious and proper course.  This provision is pretty much upon all fours with that.  The proposal that any Deputy, and even any Senator who is not in a representative capacity&mdash;the Seanad being constituted as it is at the moment&mdash;that any member of either House should be free to visit detention camps, and to interview any and every prisoner is something which we hold to be improper and a challenge to the proper position and proper function of the Executive, and something which I believe would not be admitted or accepted by any Executive Government anywhere.  I have no desire whatever to mention names of Deputies, but with the knowledge of the situation existing in this Dáil and the relation between the Government and certain Deputies one can well imagine endless mischief being created by a provision of this kind&mdash; futile fractious mischief&mdash;and one can imagine the interest and anxiety with which each visit of certain Deputies would be awaited and the amount of frivolous material that would be piled up in anticipation of his coming.  I do not believe that any Executive could with propriety accept an amendment of that kind and I do not believe that Deputies who are moving, or Deputies who will vote for it, if they were in a position of primary responsibility for discipline and proper control over places of detention, would entertain a suggestion of this kind.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Section 15, as it stands in the Bill, is to preserve the Common Law powers which vest in the Army by virtue of military necessity, and by virtue of the fact that the restoration of order in the country has been entrusted to the Army.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to put an end to that Common Law power, at least where it overlaps the powers given by this Bill, and probably to put an end to it altogether.  I am advised that that in fact would probably be the effect of the acceptance of the Deputy's amendment.  Now in a transition stage between war and peace, between a condition of anarchy and armed revolt and settled conditions, the Executive feels that it must have both the Common Law powers arising from military necessity, and the Statutory powers which this Bill proposes to confer, so that we could pass gradually and easily from the former to the latter, pass from the former to the latter not for the whole country simultaneously, but for areas as order is progressively restored throughout the country The Bill applies to the whole country, and if the Statutory powers are to be substituted for the Common Law powers, that substitution would take place simultaneously for the whole country, whereas what is wanted is the gradual transfer from the one to the other, the Common Law powers gradually, easily and naturally giving way first to the Statutory powers conferred by this Bill, and subsequently at the termination of this Bill to the ordinary rule of civil authority. We have tried to visualise the situation that will exist in the country, probably during the next six months.  It is not contested that, if the improvement of the last three or four months continues, and continues progressively at the same rate as has been maintained, say, since January or February, that it will be possible to rely less and less on the plea of military necessity, and to confine the actions of the troops more and more to strict Statutory limitations.  But in the conditions that exist, and with all the elements of trouble that still exist, and exist so largely through the country, we could not, by the acceptance of this amendment, derogate, or seem to derogate, from the Common Law powers of the military that are vested in them when a military situation arises.  It is conceivable that we might have a patchwork situation in the country; and it is conceivable that there will not be <Col N="1269" /> general acceptance by those who have been in revolt against the Government, for the termination of hostilities which was so recently announced by one who may or may not prove to be their leader. But it is not a matter in which you can take risks; it is not a matter in which you can afford to have your troops taking certain action which, to them, seems necessary to cope with the military situation, and the Courts later saying that by reason of a particular wording in this Bill we have, in fact, excluded the use of such powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> There is overlapping between the powers which this Bill proposes and the Common Law powers of the military, and I am advised that by the acceptance of this amendment, in fact by any change in the wording of Section 15, I would be running serious risk of encroaching, or seeming to encroach, on the powers which the military have, and which the military ought to have, to deal with a situation of war or armed revolt.  I regret therefore I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>There is evidently a division of opinion between the Wicklow Deputies as to the exact rank the responsible officer ought to hold.  I prefer the view of Deputy Everett that &ldquo;Commandant&rdquo; ought to be the rank of the responsible officer mentioned in the Bill, and I am inclined to agree that it was proper to raise the rank from that of Captain.  I propose to accept the next amendment (22) but not the amendment moved by Deputy O'Callaghan.  It is not an amendment that one could have much controversy about but the area that is in general charge of a colonel is rather too large to allow direct personal contact with every case.  As that is advisable, we have thought that the Battalion area, normally commanded by a Commandant, is about as large as one man could be made directly or personally responsible for.  We incline to the view that arrests made by the military under the provisions of this Bill ought to be made on the authority and on the personal responsibility of a Commandant commanding a Battalion area, rather than on that of a Colonel.  After all, the rank of Colonel attaches normally to the second in command of the entire area commanded by <Col N="1271" /> a G.O.C.  That is rather a large jurisdiction to put in a personal direct way upon one man for the purpose of this Bill.  I think the Deputy ought to reconsider his amendment and to agree with the official view that a Battalion area is quite large enough within which to impose a personal responsibility for arrests under the provisions of this Bill, and to agree that the rank of Commandant <Col N="1272" /> is sufficiently high to secure a discreet and responsible discharge of duty.</P>

      <P>If Deputies will refer to Section 1, sub-section (1) (a), they will find that the Bill provides that it &ldquo;shall be lawful for an Executive Minister to cause the arrest, and, subject to the provisions of this Act, to order the detention in custody in any place in Saorstát Éireann of any person in respect of whom such Minister shall have received a report from a responsible Officer that there is reasonable ground for suspecting such person of being or having been engaged, or concerned in the commission of any of the offences mentioned in Part I. of the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to Part I. of the Schedule we find that the offences set out are &ldquo;armed revolt against the Government of Saorstát Éireann; threatening, coercing, assaulting or intending to threaten, coerce or assault any person in furtherance of any such revolt; destroying, damaging or removing, or attempting to destroy, damage or remove any property in furtherance of any such revolt.&rdquo;  I cannot agree that the crimes set out in Part I. of the Schedule are outside the scope or province of members of the Civic Guard or Dublin Metropolitan Police, and turning again to Section 2, sub-section (1), the Bill states that &ldquo;it shall be lawful for a responsible officer to arrest and detain in custody for any period not exceeding one week any person found committing or intending to commit, or <Col N="1273" /> whom such officer suspects of having committed any of the offences mentioned in Part II. of the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo; In Part II. of the Schedule twelve offences are set out, all of a rather serious nature, both intrinsically and in their effects on the peace and order and general wellbeing of the State.  I cannot agree that <Col N="1274" /> the offences mentioned in Part II. of the Schedule are outside the scope or province of members of the Civic Guard and Dublin Metropolitan Police, and for these reasons I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment, which provides a definition of the expression &ldquo;military forces.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Section 16, page 9, line 34, to add at the end of the section the following words &ldquo;the expression `military authorities' includes the Army Council for the time being of the National Army, General Officers commanding districts, and other officers having executive command of troops.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I had a conversation with Deputy FitzGibbon about this amendment, and he asked me to move it in his absence.  It is merely a verbal change, which, I think, will commend itself to Deputy Duggan.  It is to make the wording of the definition &ldquo;military authorities&rdquo; coincide with the wording of other definitions in the same Section. The amendment moved by Deputy Duggan indicates that &ldquo;military authorities&rdquo; includes so and so.  The amendment I have to move in the name of Deputy FitzGibbon is to substitute the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; for &ldquo;includes&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; between &ldquo;Army, General,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; for &ldquo;and&rdquo; after &ldquo;districts.&rdquo;  The changes are entirely verbal, but they have the effect of giving a definition which is in line with other definitions.  As the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; stands at present, it is not an exclusive term.  This alteration I suggest would make the definition quite definite.</P>

      <P>In that connection I think that Deputy Duggan ought to accept the slight verbal, change recommended by Deputy Thrift, and therefore I think it would be an improvement to the definition to have it read as follows: &mdash;&ldquo;The expression `Military Authorities' means the Army Council for the time being of the National Army, or a General Officer Commanding a District, or any other officer not being below the rank of a Commandant, having Executive Command of troops.&rdquo;  We have just dealt with an amendment which defines that the &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; mentioned throughout the Bill shall be an officer of not less than Commandant's rank.  The question might arise hereafter as to what <Col N="1275" /> officers, and of what rank, might be said to have executive command of troops. Possibly a Lieutenant might be correctly said to have executive command of a certain number of troops, and I think, in defining &ldquo;Military Authorities,&rdquo; we ought to keep the rank as high as &ldquo;responsible officers,&rdquo; mentioned in other portions of the Bill.  I would, therefore, ask the leave of the Dáil to substitute for Amendment 24 as it stands the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;The expression `Military Authorities' means the Army Council for the time being of the National Army, or a General Officer Commanding a District, or any other officer not being below the rank of Commandant having executive command of troops.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I contest this amendment on the grounds that it is not necessary.  It is superfluous to the Bill. Section 17, Sub-section (2), provides that this Act shall continue in force for six months after the passing thereof, and <Col N="1276" /> shall then expire.  If before six months, the lifetime of this Bill, the Dáil is of opinion that the situation is such that the Executive no longer require the powers conferred by the Bill, and if the Executive persists in its view that those powers are required, and persists in exercising those powers, then the Dáil, to which the Executive is responsible, can defeat the Executive, and can in that way press its view that such powers should not be exercised. But it is wrong to embody in your legislation a provision of this kind&mdash;that, in fact, the exercise of the powers conferred by the Legislature may be annulled, not by an amending or repealing Bill, but by a resolution of the Dáil. Every Parliament has in its power the changing of the Executive and the removal of its mandate.  It is a simple thing to formulate a resolution of no confidence on this issue, or on any other issue, and to cite in support of it, not merely abuse or misuse of power arising from a particular Bill, but to indict the Executive generally for all or any of its misdeeds.  It would be a bad principle to start inserting in legislation a provision that that legislation can be held up or suspended by a resolution of the Dáil. The Executive considers that these powers which are asked for in this Bill may be necessary for six months.  If they are not necessary for six months, then the Executive, if it acts in a responsible spirit, will not exercise them; and if it exercises them contrary to the judgment of the Dáil, the Dáil will, no doubt, find means of expressing and enforcing its view; but I do not think that we ought to insert such an amendment as the Deputy suggests, and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

      <P>One of the things that it is almost impossible to prove is knowledge&mdash;the condition of a man's mind.  It is very hard to produce evidence regarding that.  Always in the case of stolen property a person is charged with being in possession of it, and it is for him to establish what case he can to the effect that he was not aware that he was in possession of that property, and the Court will take all the circumstances into consideration, and decide whether it is at all likely that the property concerned could be in the place where it was discovered unknown to the owner of the premises or the person charged with the offence of having that property in his possession.  But it would simply be stultifying ourselves to put on the prosecution the onus of actual proof that the person knew that the property was there. If a revolver is found in a man's trunk, he is charged with being in possession of the revolver without lawful authority.  If he is able to satisfy the Court that he was not aware that the weapon was in his trunk or in his possession, then the Court, no doubt, will consider that, and consider the case which he is able to put up towards that.  I may be told I am taking an extreme case&mdash;the case of a revolver in a person's trunk.  I may be reminded that arms are dumped throughout the country, and that necessarily and naturally they are dumped upon someone's premises, and that it could well happen that they were so dumped unknown to the owner of the premises. Well, each case will have to be taken on its merits, and the Court will have to decide whether, in all the circumstances, it was at all likely that the dumped arms or ammunition or explosive of some kind could be put in a man's yard, or about his premises, without any guilty knowledge whatsoever upon his part.  But I submit that any Executive authority would be stultifying itself by taking on the onus of proving guilty knowledge.  It is for the man in whose possession, or on whose premises, prohibited articles of this kind are found, to put his case to the Court that they were there without any knowledge or connivance or complicity whatever on his part.</P>

      <P>I beg to move an amendment in the Schedule, Part II., page 10, paragraph 6, to delete the words &ldquo;offensive weapon or instrument,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;lethal firearm.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to change the definition of robbery under arms.  In the Schedule robbery under arms is defined as robbery, or attempted robbery, with arms or any offensive weapon or instrument.  The Deputy wants to remove the words &ldquo;offensive weapon or instrument,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;lethal firearm.&rdquo;  The gist of the offence of robbery under arms is the physical fear that is brought to bear upon the mind of the victim it is proposed to rob, and it is not material to the offence that the fear should be fear of having a piece of lead propelled through his anatomy by means of an explosive.  The offence lies in the threat to do physical violence in default of money or property being handed over. We cannot discriminate between the use of a 32 automatic and the use of a sandbag or an iron bar, and the offence does not lie in the use of a particular weapon or a particular instrument, but in the fact that physical fear is brought to bear upon a man to induce him to hand over his goods, and that he is offered the alternative to handing over his goods of undergoing serious physical violence, with probably the handing over of his goods in any case as a follow up.</P>
      <P>As I say, there was some consideration given to the question as to whether robbery with violence of this kind, or with a threat of grave violence, ought not to be made a capital offence in all the existing circumstances in the country and in view of the prevalence of the offence.  It is almost certain that the man who goes out to rob in this way, whether he has a revolver, an iron bar, or a sandbag, is prepared to kill, if necessary, and the partition between that particular crime and the crime of murder is of the slightest.  However, it was felt that in normal, or even semi-normal, times the public conscience would be against the taking of life except in cases where life had been taken, and we have substituted the other penalty&mdash;drastic, no doubt, but not fatal or final.  I cannot agree to accept the Deputy's amendment.  It would simply be to put a premium on the use of one particular weapon rather than on another, and to say that the man who robbed with a gun will suffer the penalties of this Bill, but that the man who robs with a crowbar, a pitchfork, a scythe, a hatchet, or a sandbag, will get off better. It is the crime of robbery&mdash;the crime of robbing under threat of a grave physical injury&mdash;that is aimed at in this Bill, and we cannot agree to cover by this provision only the crime of robbery with the use of firearms.</P>

I regret I cannot meet the Deputy in this matter. The poteen traffic has become a serious <Col N="1281" /> evil in many counties.  I pointed out some time ago that every brutal and unnatural crime practically that has been committed in the country has been committed within the zone of the illicit still, and that this offence has spread to people of all ages and of both sexes.  I was speaking some time ago to a young Civic Guard who had been on duty in a certain area in Sligo.  He told me that he had seen children reeling drunk along the roads coming home from school, drunk from poteen.  I know that over Christmas time and the New Year there was a large tract of country in the West of Ireland where it would have been difficult to find for a week a sober man or woman.  This crime menaces order, progress, and decency in the life of the country.  If the country is to live and flourish, that particular traffic will have to be stamped out ruthlessly.  It is a fact beyond all question&mdash;a scientific fact&mdash;that its results will be found in succeeding generations, that the children born of men and women addicted to the use of poteen will be deficient.  It is not an amiable eccentricity. It is a degrading, demoralising vice that, in the interest of the State, present and future, must be grappled with and must be stamped out at all costs.</P>

      <P>Before the motion is put I desire to call attention to two or three matters which were not dealt with, or dealt with at any length, on the last occasion.  The Minister on the previous Reading very frankly agreed to put in words which would specifically show that internment could not continue <Col N="1282" /> beyond the period of the Bill.  He has made an effort to carry out that undertaking in Section 2 by putting in the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; as governing the power to order internment.  Those words were already in the Bill in Section 1.  I take leave to differ from the Minister's advisers if they think that the phrase, &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; will necessarily and certainly be interpreted by the Courts as meaning that internment cannot continue beyond the period of this Bill.  As this Bill has still to go before the Seanad, I think it is worth while drawing attention to the fact&mdash;the Minister will have plenty of time to consider the point&mdash;so that some other words stating more specifically what is meant should be put in.</P>
      <P>I desire to draw special attention to the same point in Section 4, Sub-section (4) (b), in which the Minister has forgotten that it was necessary to put in words restricting the power of internment to the period of this Bill.  That section enables the Minister to intern a person who has appealed during such period as he considers that the public safety would be endangered by such person being set at liberty.  I think everyone will see at once that it is necessary there to put in some qualifying words.  I do very strongly urge that better qualifying words should be adopted than the phrase, &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  I should like the same phrase used in the two places&mdash;where this matter occurs already and in Section 4&mdash;some phrase such as &ldquo;During the continuance of this Act,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so long as this Act remains in force&rdquo;&mdash; something that will be absolutely clear. I think the Dáil will see at once that to give the Minister power to intern an appellant during such period as he thinks necessary enables the Minister to order, let us say, internment for life, internment for ten years, internment for two years.  It is during the period that the Minister considers necessary.  I gathered from the Minister on the last occasion that that was not at all his intention, and I ask for an undertaking that that matter be put right by putting in words which will make the intention clear&mdash; namely, that this power of internment, in every case where it exists, stops with the Bill when the Bill ceases to have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may point out, in connection with the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this <Col N="1283" /> Act,&rdquo; that that phrase would be unfortunate and meaningless if put in in Section 4, as, if you were to use that phrase where you expressly state that the Minister can intern for as long as he thinks necessary, obviously there would be the greatest danger and likelihood that the interpretation of the clause would be that &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; merely means obeying the forms prescribed by this Act; that inasmuch as the Act gives the Minister power to fix the period, the period is not limited by the length of the Act any more than a period of penal servitude or imprisonment in another section.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to Section 3, Sub-section (2), and to protest against this Dáil passing a law whereby persons are to serve their sentences either unexpired or undischarged on the assumption that those sentences are properly awarded when we have no information whatever about those sentences.  I think that this Dáil, to do itself justice, before it purports to sanction sentences that have been given, should have before it a schedule of the cases to which the section will apply.  We have no such thing. We do not know how many people were sentenced; who were sentenced; what they were sentenced for.  In fact, we know nothing about this matter on which we are purporting to legislate.  We are saying that men who have been sentenced by Military Courts must carry out their sentences.  We should not say that without knowing exactly what we mean. None of us knows what that means.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it seems to me that that clause amounts to an indirect Act of Indemnity to the military who took part in the functioning of those tribunals.  It is common knowledge that a number of Military Courts have sat in the City of Dublin and the County of Dublin since Christmas.  It is also common knowledge that the Constitution provides that special Courts shall not sit even in time of rebellion in places where the ordinary Courts are capable of sitting.  It is, therefore, to put it at the very lowest, extremely arguable that a good many of these Courts have been sitting in an illegal way, and that their sentences have been illegal, because they were sitting here in Dublin when the ordinary Courts were sitting.  If this Dáil ratifies sentences about which it knows nothing, <Col N="1284" /> passed in secret, at a moment when we know that under the Constitution some of those Courts ought not to have been held because there were civil Courts sitting in the same place, it is doing a thing which cannot be defended, and that particular section is one against which I must very strongly protest.</P>
    <P>One word as to the Preamble.  The first part of the Preamble deals with the crimes committed by the Irregulars.  I raise this matter, not by way of recrimination, because I could say a great deal more if I wanted to raise it by way of recrimination. But I am anxious to see the time when recriminations will cease. I do think that there is too much of this &ldquo;killing Kruger with your mouth.&rdquo; The Ministry cannot stand up in a white robe of innocence, as if no crimes have been committed on their side.  It is not a question of the truth or untruth of what is said here.  I venture to think that a short time hence the Ministers themselves will regret that they were parties to putting on the Statute Book statements which make reconciliation more difficult.  The Bill would be every bit as effective if all that first part of the Preamble were left out.  I do not think these statements, however true, can give any particular satisfaction to anybody, and they are yet another block in the way of coming to terms, coming to agreement, or making some kind of reconciliation such as must be made sooner or later.  Is there any particular object in it, more especially when we realise that many of these allegations can be made, not on one side only, but on the other also?</P>
    <P>The President is reported in the papers as having made a speech yesterday, the tone of which we all should welcome. He said he wanted to forget and forgive, thus evincing a spirit which we all like to see from the head of the Executive&mdash; a spirit breathing reconciliation.  The bringing in of a Bill like this is a little difficult to reconcile with that spirit, but the introduction to the Bill by re-hashing all these charges that we see here is surely not consonant with that spirit. I ask Ministers to think it over and see whether they will not themselves realise that it is better the Statute Book at least should be free from these particular charges which are set down here at considerable length in black and white.</P>
    <P>Lastly, it is, perhaps, too much to <Col N="1285" /> hope that we could get a direct statement on the Constitutional question, as to which Ministers have been a little shy. I have tried to ascertain whether or not it is the Ministerial view that this Bill is an amendment of the existing Constitution. Not one word has been dropped from anyone on the Ministerial side suggesting that there is any intention to amend the Constitution.  The Ministers have not said, on the contrary, that there is no such intention.  They have left the matter open for anyone to put his own interpretition on.  I take the view, and I think many others will take it, that this Bill is unconstitutional in many respects I think the Dáil, when it is asked to pass a Bill of this kind, is entitled to know exactly in what light the matter is put before it by the Minister.  Are you or are you not purporting to ask us to change the Constitution?  I do not want to say any more about the other matters, which have been dealt with fully.  I see no reason to repeat the objections that I made before.  The Dáil knows that I feel strongly on this matter.  I do ask that attention be given to these matters to which so little attention has been given, and also to the other points to which exception was taken on the previous Reading.</P>

      <P>I would like Deputy Duffy to know that we have no intention in this Bill, or in any other legislative proposal we have brought forward, to amend the Constitution.  I might also direct the Deputy's attention, as he has thought fit to give us a little lecture, to a speech which he delivered a short time ago, in which he made some joy out of a funeral.  I never heard that done before.  Perhaps the Deputy was a little excited, or perhaps his associations before it were a little bit exhilarating. But it was not a happy phrase.  I never saw a funeral I enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any statements I have made, either here or outside, I do not think I have departed from the one attitude&mdash;the desire to see an end of this bitterness.  I do not think it is not possible to see an end to this business and at the same time have the truth.  Whatever there is in the Preamble to that Bill is, unfortunately, the truth.  I regret it is.  Deputy Gavan Duffy knows as well as I do that last year for six months we acted in accordance with the recommendation he is giving us now&mdash;exactly the same sort of <Col N="1286" /> toleration and the same sort of magnanimity. We know how it was treated.  We know that in the whole history of our country there never was a more deplorable period than there was from January to July.  We had then to take strong action.  I have yet to hear of any war which has been carried on free from excesses by one side or the other or by both sides.  I have dealt before with the manner in which our troops dealt with the war.  Anybody who examines their conduct will say that they acted with remarkable forbearance.  When the occasion did arise necessitating action on our part for breaches of order or discipline we instituted inquiries at once and took necessary action.  The same cannot be said of the other people when they were faced with excesses on their side. There was no repudiation, no apology, and no expression of regret.  That is not the spirit in which we can come to agreement. They are fanning themselves eternally and trying to fan the country into the belief that they are the greatly wronged people&mdash;I might say the great unkissed, because I am sure, from what I see of them, that there are very few who would be inclined to give them the chaste salute.</P>

      <P>I want to move that the Bill do now pass, and, in moving that, to draw attention briefly to some misconceptions that exist with regard to the Bill.  There has been in connection with this Bill just the same kind of loose, ill-informed criticism that there was, say, about the Rent Restrictions Bill.  It has been represented to me that it is the intention under this Bill to turn around now, and apply the lash to people who burned property or robbed with arms within the last ten or twelve months, and who are now in our custody. Deputies here, I trust, understand that that is not the position, and the provision of the penalties under this Bill are not to be applied to any offences save offences committeed after the passing of the Act&mdash;after the Bill becomes law. There is fair warning for every prospective robber and every prospective arsoneur in the country with regard to <Col N="1287" /> the penalty he may expect to meet if tried and found guilty before a jury of his fellow-countrymen.  There is also at least a misunderstanding with regard to the question of holding prisoners.  I pointed out again and again in this Dáil that to hold any prisoners for a single day after the Court decides that there is not in this country a state of war or armed revolt you must get legal power to hold the prisoners, and proceed then to use with judgment that discretion which the Executive Council which retains the confidence of the representatives of the people may be presumed to have.  The Bill was not conceived in any spirit of vindictiveness, or in any desire to do anything but to secure the safety and wellbeing of the people to whom we are responsible. I move that it do now pass.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask that a verbal amendment be inserted in Section 4, Sub-section (4) (b), to add the words &ldquo;so long as this Act continues in force&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in line 4. In other words, to make it plain that that sub-section, like Sections 1 and 2, is not intended to authorise internment beyond the period of this Bill.</P>

      <P>It might astound and even alarm the Deputy, but I am not accepting the amendment.  Neither I nor any of my officials, nor any of the legal advisers of the Government, take the view that the power of detention which this Bill proposes to confer could be exercised for a single day after the expiry of the Act.  Neither I nor any one of my advisers take the view that in nine months' time an Executive could plead, in defence of holding in its custody a person uncharged and untried, an Act which had expired three months before.  I do <Col N="1288" /> not propose to cater for the mentality which puts up that amendment.  It is ridiculous, and to accept it would bring the Executive, which is standing over this Bill, into ridicule.  The power of detaining persons without trial arises from the Bill and dies with the Bill, and no executive in the world, not even an Executive numbering the Deputy amongst its numbers, would stand over the holding of a person without trial in nine months time, and say they derive that power from a Bill which had expired three months before.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he has consulted his legal advisers on the general question as to whether internment could continue beyond the Act. I ask him to consult them with respect to this particular section, in which he has power to detain persons in custody during such period as an Executive Minister considers necessary.</P>
