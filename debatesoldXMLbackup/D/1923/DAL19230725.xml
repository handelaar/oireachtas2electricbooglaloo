      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to reply to this question, which properly concerns the Defence Department.</P>
      <P>Several communications were received by me indirectly through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and also directly from Mr. Dalton on the subject of employment for persons employed by British authorities at the Ordnance Depot, Island Bridge.  They received due consideration. I think eleven such men have been employed by us on Ordnance work.</P>
      <P>As regards the letter from the Minister of Industry and Commerce referred to, I am afraid that this was issued under a misapprehension.  It was intended that as opportunities for employment arose the claims of former Ordnance workers for re-employment would be kept in mind. These services have, however, with us been run by military and not by civilian personnel, and only such persons, therefore, as could be accepted for Army service could be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of re-instatement in the proper sense of the term does not arise. <Col N="1389" /> We are under no obligations in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to entertain any suggestion of granting pensions or gratuities. That would be a matter for the British Government who, I understand, have given gratuities in certain cases.</P>

      <P>I ask the leave of the Dáil to have printed and circulated a Bill to establish in Saorstát Eireann, and regulate a Police Force to be called &ldquo;The Civic Guard.&rdquo;  The necessity for a Bill of this kind will be obvious to Deputies.  The disbandment of the R.I.C. necessitated the raising of a Force for policing the Free State territory outside the boundaries of the Dublin Metropolitan Police area.  A committee was appointed by the Provisional Government early in 1922 to inquire into and advise on a form of Police Organisation, most suited to the needs of the country.  On the broad basis of the recommendations which that committee made, the Civic Guard was established as a force.  The only statutory authority for the Civic Guard at the moment is contained in a Section of the District Justices' Bill.  What is sought now in this Bill is full statutory authority for raising, training, equipping and paying of the Civic Guard.  It has been found possible to embody all that is thought to be really essential in a Bill of 24 Sections. and I ask leave now to have that Bill printed and circulated to members.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That leave be granted to introduce the Civic Guard Bill, 1923,&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President (Minister for Finance) The PRESIDENT (Minister for Finance)">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill which is now in the hands of Deputies.  In England the Civil Service Commissioners hold their office during the pleasure of His Majesty, and are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister who is the First Lord of the Treasury.  Here the appointment which is proposed in the Bill is by the Executive Council, on the principle that the Commissioners are functioning under the authority of the Government.  The Executive Council being the executive authority of Government, charged with the responsibility of administering the service and so on, must be given the powers to select its own instruments who will be responsible to the Executive Council.  The second section of the Bill <Col N="1392" /> deals with the duties devolving upon the Civil Service Commissioners.  They will not be whole-time officers.  Just now there are some arrears of work, and there are certain examinations in the immediate future which must be carried out, but when things settle down the duty of the Commissioners will not be of such a character as would necessitate whole-time occupation.  It is intended&mdash; and I gave notice to some Deputies&mdash;to ask the Commissioners to hold examinations for County Surveyors before the Bill passes.  It appears that there are four counties without a County Surveyor, and in one case the work of the county is to some extent interfered with by reason of the fact that no examination has been held for a very long time.  An examination is necessary in order to secure that the person or persons who would be candidates would be qualified for the work of surveying.  Recently many representations have been made to us, from one county in particular, and I undertook, in order to avoid the possibility of a person being appointed who would not be competent, that I would inform the Dáil, and in the absence of any objection, say that I would request the Civil Service Commissioners in addition to the examinations that they intended to hold for Customs officers to hold this other examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 3 the first Sub-section makes it imperative that every person holding a permanent situation shall have a Civil Service Certificate.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 prescribes conditions for the Civil Service Certificate similar to the conditions in the Order in Council of 1910 with regard to the British Civil Service. Sub-section (3) of Section 3 is an important provision.  It is to the effect that promotion in the customary course is a matter for the discretion of the Minister in charge of the Department and not a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners. Section 4 lays down the principle of open competitive examination. Sub-section (3) is necessary for examinations such as the Customs and Excise examination for army candidates and further examinations in which, in the public interest, it may be desirable to reserve appointments for persons who have served in the Army.  Section 5 is the governing Section for these appointments in the public service for which competitive examinations are either inapplicable or unnecessary. It deals with such cases as engineers, solicitors, architects, etc.  Section <Col N="1393" /> 6 enables the Civil Service Commissioners to issue their certificates for such appointments as the professional and technical appointments referred to above.  It also enables the Commissioners to deal exceptionally with individual cases in the public interest.  Section 7 is necessary because of the provisions of Sub-section <i>(b)</i> to the effect that no person shall be appointed until a certificate of qualification has been issued.  It might happen in the case of pressure of work that an officer selected for an appointment might be required to take up his duties immediately and in order to allow for that this Section will provide the necessary machinery.  Section 8 deals with what I have mentioned about County Surveyorships.  I suppose it is unnecessary to say anything further about that.</P>
    <P>It is a question, of course, for the future as to what extent the Civil Service machinery might be utilised for the holding of examinations for appointments under Local Authorities and the Bill does not provide for anything more than enabling the Commissioners to hold these examinations.  It is not mandatory. A great number of people hold the view that the sooner Local Government officials will pass through a Civil Service door the better it would be for the administration of Local Authorities. However, there is nothing binding in the proposal; it is simply an enabling Section. I think that deals generally with the matter of the Bill.  It is advisable that this Bill should receive the earliest consideration of the Dáil and I hope that its passage will be facilitated.</P>

      <P>I received this Bill yesterday and read it with some care and also with some disappointment. I am opposed to the general principle of the Bill.  I agree heartily that there should be a Civil Service Commission and agree equally heartily that all Civil Servants should be required to pass a public examination before they are entitled to serve in the Civil Service of the State.  On those introductory matters there can be very little disagreement.  My disagreement with the Bill is on a general question of principle dealing with the powers and functions of the Civil Service Commission itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> This is not the first time that this question has been touched upon in this new State we have established.  It has been passed through in a number of States, and the tendency of late has been in a certain direction, which is not the direction taken by this Bill.  Before I define the difference of principle which I believe myself&mdash;having been interested in this matter for some time&mdash;that a Civil Service Commission should adhere to, as distingushed from the principle that it does set forth, I would like to say at the very outset with perfect candour, that I should be the very last to suggest that the point of view I am now going to put forward has all the merits, exclusive of any other point of view.  I know there are two opposed systems by which Civil Service Commissions should work Neither system has all the merits.  I do suggest that the principle of the system adopted in Canada, South Africa, and by a number of States, increasingly of late, is the system that is best suited to the conditions here.  Speaking on this matter once before in the Dáil I suggested that the position of the two systems might be put under two heads&mdash;the British system and the Canadian system. I just use those as an illustration of the point to which I desire to draw attention. According to what I have spoken of as the British system, which is the system adopted here, the responsibility of the Commission is subject in all matters to the responsibility of the Minister for Finance who happens as time goes forward to be appointed by the political majority of the Dáil.  In England the results have been very beneficial, but in England there has been a very long and historic lineage behind that system which we cannot boast, and which Canada found, because it could not boast of such a lineage, did not produce the same results.  The system has not produced the same results in other countries as we know it has produced satisfactorily in England.  I do not believe it will produce the same results satisfactorily in Ireland that it has done in England, any more than it has done in other countries, of which I take Canada as merely an example.  What I call the Canadian system, for the sake of simplification&mdash;it is not a Canadian system, being merely the system that Canada and other States have adopted&mdash;has established a Civil Service Commission that is an independent body directly responsible <Col N="1395" /> to the Legislature as a whole.  That is in sharp distinction to the system prevalent in England&mdash;the system set out in this Bill&mdash;by which the Civil Service Commission is placed under the control of the Minister for Finance, who happens to be the chief, and probably will always be the most important and most powerful, Minister of the dominant Party of the day, whatever Party that may happen to be.  In Canada not only are examinations of Civil Servants decided by the Commission, but they undertake a number of other matters as well.  They arrange for Civil Service Examinations; they issue certificates of qualification; they arrange for interdepartmental transfer of officers in the service; they also make such provision as is required for recruitment on short notice of a temporary staff for purely temporary work.  I will later set out exactly why these decisions were come to in Canada, and I think the results are very remarkable results and well worthy of attention in this country.</P>
    <P>The essential principle of that system is that the Civil Service Commission holds exactly the same relation to the Legislature as the Comptroller and Auditor-General does in our Constitution. Any proposals that the Civil Service Commission desires to have adopted it lays before the Legislature as a whole. I am prepared in that matter to hear the opposite argument put forward perfectly fairly that a system of that kind is not consonant with the financial responsibility to the Dáil, of the Minister for Finance appointed by the Dáil.  My answer to that is that, although that may appear to be so at first sight, on a little examination it would be found that that is not the case; that the financial responsibility of the Minister for Finance under either of these two systems, the British or the Canadian, comes to exactly the same thing.  But whereas under one system it is indirect responsibility, under what I have called the Canadian system it operates in a different way.  Supposing, let me say, that the other system had been the one adopted in this Bill, supposing an independent Civil Service Commission, responsible directly to the Legislature as a whole, had been the system adopted, in that case the Civil Service Commission would put forward certain regulations that could not be given effect to until they had been adopted by <Col N="1396" /> the Dáil.  They would make recommendations which might involve expenditure of money which could not become effective until they had been adopted by the Dáil.  But before they could be adopted under the Constitution the Minister for Finance would have, if they involved expenditure of moneys, to make a recommendation to that effect.  Otherwise they would lie on the Table and continually remain nugatory, as the necessary steps had not been taken to put them into effect.  So far as the financial responsibility is concerned, the two systems are practically on all fours.  The advantage gained in appointing a Commission, whose responsibility is more independent and put directly under the control of the entire Legislature, is, and has so proved to be in the Canadian experience, such as leads to the confidence of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>It is proved there, and in England, and it must prove&mdash;it is not a necessary allegation to say that it is also proved here since the establishment of this State that Civil Service appointments bear, rightly or wrongly, the colour of being influenced by party reasons and made with a view to the rewards of what has been generally known, in the discussion of this subject, as the &ldquo;spoils system.&rdquo; At the present moment the case in Ireland is, that all appointments have to be confirmed by the Establishments Office of the Ministry of Finance, and appointments have been made that have aroused a great deal of dissatisfaction both in the service and outside the service. I am not going into that now.  I am not concerned with that at the present moment.  I want to keep perfectly clear of that because I desire that this case should be put forward without being brought into politics of the day because I believe it is a case worthy of the most careful examination upon its merits.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the present Bill and see exactly how it works.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 states &ldquo;The Minister for Finance shall appoint such and so many persons as he may consider necessary to be Officers of the Commissioners, and such persons shall hold office upon such terms and be remunerated at such rates, and in such manner, as the Minister for Finance shall determine.&rdquo;  In other words the Commissioners, their <Col N="1397" /> terms of office, and conditions of service are all to be decided by the Minister for Finance for that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Officers of the Commission; those who are largely dealing with the entire service of the Commission.  The persons dealing with the Commission are persons who remain all the time and are appointed subject to the control of the Minister for Finance of the time.  In that connection let me refer to Section 6.  Section 6 states that the Minister for Finance and the Minister in charge of a Government Department shall consider</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(a)</i> that the qualifications in respect of knowledge and ability deemed requisite for any particular situation to which this Act applies in that Government Department are wholly or in part professional or otherwise peculiar and not ordinarily to be acquired in the Civil Service and the Minister in charge of such Government Department shall propose to appoint to such situation a person who has acquired such qualifications in other pursuits, or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And this is so very important a Sub-Section that I am extremely surprised to see it in this Bill because whatever system we adopt surely this is a questionable provision;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(b)</i>  That it would be for the public interest that the rules in regard to age and the whole or any part of the examination for such a situation as aforesaid should be dispensed with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very remarkable provision.  It may become, at any particular time, a very sinister provision.  If that happened to be the case, &ldquo;the Commissioners may,&rdquo; the Bill says, &ldquo;if they think fit, grant their certificate of qualification in respect of such situation upon any evidence which is satisfactory to them that the person proposed to be appointed to such situation is fully qualified therefor in respect of age, health, character, knowledge and ability.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if the Ministers who <Col N="1398" /> are appointed by the Party of the day decide that it would be for the public interest, as they may hereafter interpret the public interest, that the rules set up by the Civil Service Commissioners may in whole or in part be set aside they shall make that recommendation to the Civil Service Commissioners, and the Civil Service Commissioners may, if they think fit, grant their certificate, although the terms of that certificate may not have been fulfilled.  A very eminent Irishman spoke at one time of driving a coach and four through any Act of Parliament.  I think a whole team of coaches and four could be driven through the provisions of this Act.  But now, note Section 10. Section 10 depends upon the Schedule. In the Schedule to this Bill certain offices and functions are withdrawn as being inappropriate for the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commissioners, and having read through these six paragraphs in the Schedule, I think most of us would be in agreement that they could all safely be withdrawn with one possible exception. But now turn to Section 10, and see how it affects the Schedule.  Section 10, Sub-section (2), says &ldquo;the Commissioners may by order made on the application of the Minister in charge of any Government Department and with the consent of the Minister for Finance add any situation in that Department to the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  In other words, if the Minister for the day&mdash;it may be the Finance Minister, and I do not suppose that we shall always get Ministers quite so immaculate as those we now have the good fortune to possess&mdash;desires to withdraw, and he may be urged by his party that certain positions be withdrawn and placed in the Schedule, then they may be so withdrawn and placed in the Schedule, and persons may again walk through the loophole in the Act into the Civil Service, although they have not fulfilled the conditions of the Civil Service. I do think these are faults in this Bill.  But I am now dealing with what I think is even a more important matter, and that arises out of the consideration put forward.</P>
    <P>I do urge it would be for the satisfaction and confidence of the Civil Service as a whole if appointments to the Civil Service hereafter in the Free State were put into the control of an independent Civil Service Commission directly responsible to the Legislature as a whole, and <Col N="1399" /> that the Commission should have much more extended powers than the powers allotted to it here.  The powers given to it under this Bill are very largely under the influence of the Ministry for the day and of the Minister for Finance.  They are powers which, if this Bill is to embody a principle hereafter to be adopted, may be exerted by the Minister for Finance on many occasions, on the overwhelming number of occasions, for, let us say, purely financial reasons, but which may be often exercised, and which it is possible may be exercised, for reasons which shall not be financial, but purely political.  I am not now stating my own gloomy prognostications for the future, which the future may not fulfil; but this has proved to be the experience of other States, as I will show later.  The reason why Canada adopted the particular form of Civil Service Commission that I am now urging the adoption of was because that has proved to be the case there, although they have been working for over sixty years now. In Canada these evils have proved to be the case from experience, and they have had to work out of the kind of Commission outlined in this Bill into the kind of other Commission that I am now recommending&mdash;an independent Commission&mdash;a Commission holding the same relation to the Legislature as the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Commission there is entirely responsible to Parliament as a whole for all Civil Service appointments, transfers, and arrangements; and if some of those transfers should happen to be suggested by the Ministry as being desirable by them, they may be suggested by the Ministry and are considered by the Commission; but for the transfers themselves it is the Commission that is ultimately responsible. Now, having had occasion to give this matter a good deal of thought for some time, I believe on its merits, not merely as a logical principle, but merely on its merits as arising from the experience of others, that that system would be very much better in this country under any circumstances.  What I now desire to bring before the Dáil is the further consideration that in the circumstances&mdash;the peculiar and the particular circumstances of Ireland&mdash;this form of Civil Service Commission adopted by Canada is the one that will most wisely <Col N="1400" /> answer our difficulties and meet some problems which we will certainly have to face in the very near future.  It is a matter of public knowledge&mdash;all know it as a matter of historic knowledge&mdash;that in Canada there are religious difficulties which are also present in this country, and we know that there has been very keen and very fierce party strife over a large number of years.  The spoil system, such as prevailed in the United States, prevailed in Canada.  In 1908 the Liberal Premier of that time established a Civil Service Commission on the lines of the English Civil Service Commission, but it was found more and more necessary to work away from that principle. The Premier of the opposite party, the Conservative Party, Sir Robert Borden in 1918-19 adopted the system that I am now recommending, with the result that the Civil Service Commission since then has become a settled body, which has not been raided by the political party of the day.  Now, I wish to draw attention to a matter of very considerable importance, because since Sir Robert Borden, the Conservative Premier, adopted the principle in full that I have defined and am now urging, there has been a General Election.  The Liberal Party was brought in, and was urged by its supporters during the whole course of the election, and even gave pledges to that effect, that the Civil Service system adopted by the outgoing Premier should be overthrown in order that the new Liberal Party should be able to reward its party with Civil Service appointments.  The party came in upon that pledge.  It came in and found the Civil Service with such a sense of confidence in the Commission that had been set up that although it has since been urged, and may at this very moment be urging, that the achievement of the Civil Service Commission on the lines I have stated should be put aside in the interests of party appointments.  Mr. MacKenzie King has so far refused to listen to any of the interested advice that he has received, because he has found that an independent Civil Service Commission&mdash; a Commission responsible, not primarily to his Government, but to Parliament as a whole&mdash;gave a security and confidence that he desired to see maintained in the needs of the efficiency of the service.  I would like to read just a few words from a quarterly magazine in which this matter, <Col N="1401" /> by chance I found, has been dealt with.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It happened, however, that the Liberals had been the last victims of the patronage system; after the 1911 elections thousands of Civil Servants who had been found guilty of Liberal politics had been ruthlessly dismissed from their posts.  In Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, where the purge had been particularly drastic and the desire for revenge had burned deep in many bosoms, Liberal candidates in 1921 had blithely assured the electors that the abolition of patronage had only been one of the many monstrous follies of the Coalition Government, and that the fine old system of `spoils to the victors' would be restored as soon as a sane and intelligent Liberal administration was seated in power in Ottawa.  But after this day dawned, the passing months brought no sign of the great restoration which would open the doors to the faithful.  Angry deputations descended upon Ottawa and Liberal members became afraid to visit their homes.  When they explained that the Civil Service Reform Act barred any reward for faithful partisanship, they were bidden to destroy the hated thing.  Driven to despair they applied pressure upon the Government, and the latter in face of the opposition of most of the Conservatives and Progressives secured authority for a parliamentary committee which was charged with the duty of examining the workings of the Civil Service Reform measures and the Civil Service Commission and suggesting improvements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that that Committee is now sitting but that it is unlikely that any change will be made because of the benefits that have been conferred by the kind of Commission that has been adopted.</P>

      <P>All the articles in that magazine are unsigned, it is well known.  The writer is a writer who communicates from Canada.  In any case these are historical statements. The result has proved so satisfactory that other countries, including the Sister Dominion of South Africa, have adopted the system that they have adopted there.  For these reasons <Col N="1402" /> I urge that a Commission established upon the lines I am now recommending would, owing to the acute controversy which we must take over from the past between different political schools and unfortunately, if we are to hope for the unity of this country, religious schools also, that it would be desirable that no opportunity should be given to anyone aggrieved partly to suggest&mdash; rightly or wrongly&mdash;I am not going into the rightness or wrongness of any such allegation&mdash;that the provisions, especially the provisions to which I have referred, of Section 6 (b) and Section 10 (2) of this Bill are being perverted for the appointment of political adherents, but that owing to the existence of an independent Commission there may be that security given.  It is well known to the Minister and to the Executive Council as a whole that the principles that I am now bringing before the Dáil are those which the Civil Servants themselves desire to see adopted.  I do not urge it for that reason.  I urge it from long conviction of my own that they are the principles that the Service as a whole would desire to see adopted, because they feel that they are the principles under which they would be able to serve all parties alike with equal confidence. That should be the aim in the appointment of any Civil Service.  One recognises in a Bill of this kind that it is dealing with what is perhaps the most important matter in any country.  Governments come in and Governments go out, but the Civil Service remains.  Very often the person who is to sit in the Ministerial chair&mdash;more often than not&mdash;is merely the spokesman of those who understand the machine which he is presumed to administer with such masterly skill.  If we can secure an efficient Civil Service we will have secured in this country an instrument of the very greatest importance to the future.  And in order to secure an efficient Civil Service it is of the very essence that we should secure in the first place a satisfied and confident Civil Service.  I believe that such a Civil Service would best be secured by the appointment of a Commission that is not under the control at any time of the Government of the day, but is directly responsible, as an independent body, to the Oireachtas as a whole in exactly the same manner as the Constitution has decided in respect of the <Col N="1403" /> Comptroller and Auditor-General.  If it was right in his case&mdash;and it was decided it was right in his case, because of the required impartiality of his administration in regard to moneys&mdash;I urge it is right also in the case of the Civil Service Commission because of the required impartiality in its case in regard to personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express general agreement with the view put forward by Deputy Figgis, that the form of Civil Service and the power of the Civil Service Commission that is applicable to England is not equally applicable to Ireland, and that the form which has been adopted in Canada, Australia and South Africa&mdash;in some cases after trial of the British system they reverted to the system which Deputy Figgis has spoken about&mdash;is the form which should be operating in this country.  The Minister, in his opening statement on the First Reading, said that they had made a careful survey of the Dominion Civil Service arrangements, and had decided to reject them.  The Bill shows that all distinctive features of the Dominion arrangements have, as a matter of fact, been rejected, and that the provisions of this Bill merely set up by statute precisely the same kind of arrangements and machinery as exist in England under Orders in Council.  I hope that that is not intended to be made a permanent enactment, and that we shall have fixed, without proper consideration, this system on this country.  It is well, perhaps, to acknowledge that in this Bill, whether deliberately intended or not, there has been effected, or will be effected, a revolution in the status of the Civil Service.  Hitherto British Civil Servants have remained in legal status what they were by historical evolution&mdash; domestic servants of the head of the State.  Their status was accordingly regulated by Orders in Council, Treasury Minutes, and acts of the Executive.  But this Bill marks a new departure, and is the beginning at least of a process of making the Civil Service a matter for legislation and not for the prerogative of a royal person or anybody acting under the authority of a royal person. That, I think, is a matter of congratulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery of the Bill and the provisions contemplated by the Bill ought not to be fixed upon the State without <Col N="1404" /> very full discussion and consideration. I would urge the Minister to assure the Dáil that he is prepared to accept on Committee Stage a provision limiting the operations of this Bill to a few months, so that there shall be of necessity due consideration given to the permanent arrangements under which the Civil Service shall be governed.  Otherwise there shall need to be demands made to amend this Bill, and, as we all understand that the Minister is desirous of not having too many contentious points raised during the next few weeks, I look for an assurance from him that he will accept an amending Section or paragraph limiting the operation of this Bill to a period of, say, six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular objection to the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson that the Bill should last only for six months.  It is really necessary now, but it may possibly get more consideration if the Bill be again introduced after six months, although personally I do not see any necessity for it. I must say that Deputy Figgis did not convince me with regard to his side of the case.  He said that there was a tendency recently in a certain direction, and he did not say in what direction.  Whether he was speaking about salvation or about other things I do not know.  What he meant to convey by &ldquo;a tendency&rdquo; I could not gather either.</P>
      <P>He said that appointments had been made which were giving great dissatisfaction inside and outside, and then said he did not wish to go into that.  I think it is rather a matter of some importance that if appointments have been made which give great dissatisfaction, either inside or outside, they ought to be mentioned. This is the time for mentioning them, and I certainly have heard nothing of them.</P>

      <P>I am sure if we are here much longer the Deputy will make the statement so often that he will <Col N="1405" /> probably convince himself that he is right, but I do not know that he will convince anybody else.  The spoils system is not being introduced into this Bill. The particular clause to which he takes exception is Clause 2, which is a clause practically on all fours with a similar power which was taken, I think, in 1920 by a British Order in Council.  I understand that the whole Irish Civil Service was reorganised as part of a general scheme of reorganisation, and certain unestablished officers who had held posts for many years before the war were placed on the establishment and received Civil Service certificates.  There is no reason why the same thing should not be open to be done again if the necessity should arise.  The objection made to Section 2, Sub-section (2) is an objection that I fail to understand.  If the Minister for Finance does not appoint these officers, who is to appoint them? Is it Deputy Figgis?</P>

      <P>Even the Comptroller and Auditor-General does not do that.  In tabling a scheme for the Comptroller and Auditor-General we table something in excess of the powers which the Comptroller and Auditor-General has.  Now, I have only one thing to say with regard to the criticism of appointments. There have been no new permanent appointments in the Civil Service, with the exception of the Dáil staffs, since the change of Government, and I have no recollection, except of one case or of two cases that have been mentioned by the Deputy, that he took any exception to them.  I think it is very invidious to raise this question without going into them.  I will defer dealing with it until some other time.  I am not at all satisfied with the case that the Deputy has made, that the system that he has propounded is one that would be more suitable here.  &ldquo;Responsibility of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  In what fashion, and by whom?  Are the Commissioners to be brought here to the Table of the Dáil in the event of any dissatisfaction arising from the performance of their officers? How is the Dáil to get any information <Col N="1406" /> from them?  They are to be independent, and I suppose that there is no such thing in the matter of the spoils system of utilising the services of such officers in order to prevent them being criticised in the Dáil.  I think that if the Deputy had as much information about the administration as those of us who have put up this Bill he would be satisfied that the system he himself has recommended is a system which in this country might be open to very much graver abuses than the one we are recommending here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It deals, as I have already explained, first of all with the Dáil Civil Servants, and places them in a pensionable service, that is those who were in the service of the old Dáil Departments previous to the Truce. The Truce is taken as the dividing line. The Dáil Civil Servants appointed after the date of the Truce are eligible for appointments to the Civil Service in the ordinary way, the same as other temporary Civil Servants in the Government employment.  Sub-section (2) is an exceptional provision.  The Superannuation Act of 1914 abolished the provisions <Col N="1407" /> previously obtaining, which permitted of the addition of a certain number of years in the service.  That occurred mainly, I think, in the cases of persons in the professions.  Some of the officers of the Dáil were advanced in years, and power is taken there to add a certain number of years' service in such cases. Another question that has been before us for some time is the case of victimised Civil Servants during the last few years.  It is necessary to provide that Civil Servants so victimised would not lose their pensionable rights, and we are providing for them in this Bill.  There is another class which is not provided for in any of our Superannuation Acts, members of the C.I.D., the C.D.F., and the Protective Force.  Some of these have been killed and some have been badly wounded, and we are proposing to take power to deal with them in this Bill.  There is also provision for dealing with the pensions of certain pensionable National School Teachers.  Another Clause deals with some cases of officials who have come over from the British. It means that where an officer is transferred from the British Civil Service he is granted on his ultimate retirement from the Free State Civil Service a pension based on his total service, a financial contribution in respect of this being payable by the British Government in respect of the period of service under the British Government.  I beg to move the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that I have not given much consideration to this Bill since it was circulated, but there are two or three points that I think ought to be considered before it passes even the Second Reading.  Section 1 deals with the position of persons transferred from public departments of Dáil Eireann of the pre-Free State days, and it provides for the transfer of such officers and the granting of pension rights to such officers, but makes no call for any question of competence to be raised. While I do not want to cavil at all at fixing the status of those men and women, I think that some consideration should be given to their position with respect to the older Civil Servants, some of whom are senior in service and, I think, probably in experience, and possibly if not probably, in some cases in general efficiency.  It occurs to me that <Col N="1408" /> there ought to be provided for at least some certificate of competency, and that the Civil Service Commissioners might be asked to say whether these officers are qualified to continue the offices in which they have been placed.  Of more importance, I note that in Section 4 we are introduced officially to some organisation of which we have never heard officially. They are now introduced to the Dáil with the view of putting them into a position of being the recipients of pensionable rights.  We have heard of the Criminal Investigation Department.  I think we have even passed Votes for it, but we have not heard officially of the Citizens' Defence Force, and we have not heard anything of the Protective Force.  The Protective Force, I think, was described to us as a body which was set up for the purpose of protecting citizens at a time of very great crisis, but the Citizens' Defence Force, I think, has not been referred to at all.  I have no knowledge of such a Force.  I do not know whether it is part of the Army or part of the Police Force, and I do not know whether the Dáil generally knows anything about this Force, but it is introduced in this Clause, which provides for the granting of pensions to members of those departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is due to us that we should know something about their work, their constitution, who their officers are, or at least, if that is thought unsafe, that we should get some information about their constitution and their activities.  It is not reasonable to come to the Dáil and tell us that pensions should be granted to persons who have been wounded who belong to those armed organisations specially raised by the Minister for Home Affairs, when we only now hear that there are such organisations.  Can any Deputy of the Dáil tell us what the duties of the Citizens' Defence Force were or are?  Or can any Deputy tell us what the different duties of the Protective Force were or are?  Do they still exist? Out of what Vote have they been paid? One would have thought that the Criminal Investigation Department would have comprised all that was necessary for the maintenance of order and the protection of the persons and property.  But now it seems that there were other forces acting under the authority of the Minister for Home Affairs of whom and of which we knew nothing.  I, for one feel that it is <Col N="1409" /> quite necessary that we should have some more information with regard to those forces before we go very far with this Bill.  One might ask also is it the intention to include this force in the Civic Guard Bill?  If not, are they to be legalised?  What is their position?  What is to be their position in the future with regard to legalisation?  I invite the Minister to give us pretty full information as to the constitution and activities of these forces, particularly the Citizens' Defence Force and the Protective Force, which organisations were specially raised before the introduction of this Act by the Minister for Home Affairs for the maintenance of order and the protection of persons and property.</P>

      <P>The remarks that I have to make at this stage refer particularly to Section 5 of this Bill, which provides certain increases for pensioned teachers.  It is only fair to say at the outset that the provision in the Bill does, so far as I can see, carry out the promise which was made twelve or fourteen months ago by the late Minister for Finance General Collins, even to the extent of making whatever sum is payable, or will be payable, retrospective as from the 1st April, 1922, the date from which the late Minister for Finance promised such should be payable.  While saying that, I must again express my regret that the cumbrous machinery of the Pensions Increases Act of 1920 has been retained in this section, when it has been pointed out on more than one occasion to the Ministry that that system of distribution, or the system of distribution adopted under that Act, was not a fair system and not an equitable system.  I do not wish to go into details again, except to point out that the increases are on a percentage basis so that a man who has a pension of £50 may get an increase of £25, while the man who has a pension of £20 can only get an increase of £10&mdash; 50 per cent. also.  That does not seem to be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was made, and urged very strongly on the Minister, that the basis to be adopted should be the basis of service given by the person who has the pension and that for each year of service given a definite sum, say £1 per year or 15s. per year, or whatever would use up the amount that would be available under this particular provision. should be the basis adopted.  That did <Col N="1410" /> not mean that a greater sum than is at present available would be needed.  That was not the suggestion.  The only suggestion was that a different, and in our opinion a more equitable, system of distribution should be adopted.  I regret very much that that system was not adopted.  I have looked into the regulations which were made under the Pensions Increases Act, and they are almost as complicated as income tax forms.  All sorts of queries are asked and expected to be supplied with regard to the means of the pensioner and with regard to various other matters.  The other system would be much simpler in administration, in addition to being more equitable to the general body to whom this Bill applies. I do not know whether it is still too late for the Minister to look into the suggestion which has been made.  If it is not, I do hope that he will give it consideration.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters in this connection that I would ask the Minister to give attention to.  There is one body of pensioners&mdash;I do not know how many of them exist now; they would be very few indeed&mdash;who will derive no benefit whatever from this provision. They are those who retired before 1900. I do not know whether there are many of them left.  Of course, if they retired at the full age limit they would be over 80 years now.  But some of them may have retired on disablement pensions or in some other way.  I believe there are a dozen or so of these left, and they do not benefit under these provisions, inasmuch as the rules of 1914 were made retrospective only to 1900.  They shut out all who retired before 1900.  I think it would be only right if the Minister introduced some provision whereby those few would get some increase under this special provision.  There is another class, too, that I would like to see brought under the provision of the Bill.  Some time ago, before 1900, there was a provision whereby a teacher could commute his pension for a lump sum.  In some cases when there was extreme necessity or some special demand had to be met, men took advantage of that provision. There are some of these left still.  Perhaps they were pushed by necessity to take advantage of getting a lump sum. but they have been blessed with long lives, and they are shut out, of course, under the provisions of this section.  If <Col N="1411" /> it were possible I would like to see these, too, brought under the provision of this section.  As this is a general Pensions Bill, or rather a Bill applying to various classes, there is just one point which I would like to point out to the Minister for his attention.  All the teachers are paid their pensions quarterly, while, if I am not misinformed, the pensions of other public servants are paid monthly. If that is the case, I would urge that provision should be made whereby these payments, and they are very small, should be made monthly instead of quarterly. It is too long to wait three months for this small pension.  If it could be arranged that these pensions would be paid every month it would be a very great benefit to those pensioners.  That, possibly, is not a matter for legislation, but administration, but I take this opportunity of calling the Minister's attention to it.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Johnson's questions, I may say a provision is in the Estimates, on page 87, for dealing with one of the forces referred to in this Bill, the Protective Force; and in the case of the other force, speaking entirely from recollection, it was organised to protect property which was believed to be in danger during the recent incendiary period.  As far as I know, the Estimates had been prepared, and there was no Estimates out of which the expenses of that particular force could be met, and the expenses have been met out of the Secret Service Vote. I think they have done their work very well, and certainly, in one case, I know one man was killed by an explosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the questions raised by Deputy O'Connell, they were four in number.  One dealt with a different method of distribution; the second with bringing in the people who are drawing pensions since 1900; the third with persons who had commuted their pensions; and the fourth dealt with a different period of payment.  The way the Deputy introduced all those cases left me under the impression that he was making only one case, but it appears there were four, and to them may be added another, the undertaking given by the late General Collins.  I am not in a position to make his mind easy with regard to any of those matters, but I will undertake to <Col N="1412" /> look into them.  I think in the case of persons who commuted their pensions, they probably got good value for their money at a time when money was at a very much higher price than it is at present.  With regard to the distribution of this money on a different basis to the one adopted in the Bill, I went into this matter very closely with the Officers of the Ministry of Finance, and I was satisfied, from the explanations given to me, that any other distribution than that mentioned, or even the alternative mentioned by Deputy O'Connell, would scarcely be fair.</P>
    <P>There were cases in which small pensions have been granted by reason of certain short services, or dismissals, or something else of that sort.  To bring those amounts up to something in the nature of an economic pension, might be drawing more from the amount of money it was intended to spend on these services than would be fair.  After examining the cases very closely, I thought the method recommended under the Increases of Pensions Act, 1920, was the fairest.  Before the matter is finally dealt with I would be willing to see Deputy O'Connell and some of the officials of the Ministry of Finance, and we will see if we cannot settle the matter. I am not at all satisfied that the suggestion he has put up is a better one than what we have suggested in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I desire to refer to the statement made in the Dáil by the President a week or two ago.  It may possibly be the case&mdash;I do not know &mdash;that the part of that statement in which the President told the Dáil that he had skilfully closed the mouths of the <Col N="1413" /> representatives of Trinity College for three years, in so far as asking for more is concerned, was the pleasantest to the Deputies of the Dáil.  Even though that is the case, and I do not intend to depart from it in any way, I am not going to be pessimistic, like Deputy Magennis, and not hope that after three years I may be able to give vent to what has been pent up for so long and that the Minister for Finance may be there to receive the benefit of the pent-up flood. In the statement which the President made to the Dáil, he said that the arrangement made with Trinity College was accepted by the authorities of Trinity College, and I want to make it quite clear that it was accepted by them not grudgingly, but with appreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They said that they thought, under all the existing circumstances, the Government had made a fair attempt to meet the claims of the College.  I supported that, and I do so still, and I want to make it clear that I do so.  I will even go further and acknowledge the very patient consideration that the Minister for Finance gave to the claims of the College, and express my belief that if circumstances had been different his reply to that claim would have been very different too.  While I am not going to detract from that appreciation in any way, I do think it is important that the Deputies of the Dáil should recognise exactly what the arrangement that has been made means for Trinity College both in its present position and in its future position for the next three years.  Realisation is very far from expectation. In 1918 the Commission appointed to go into the affairs of Trinity College recommended that in view of the increased costs of modern University education as compared with what was required some few years ago, an additional revenue of £49,000 was required by the College if it was to carry on its work properly. The British Government, considering that recommendation, made arrangements in a way which I will leave the Deputies of the Dáil to criticise for themselves.  It secured, at any rate, to Trinity College £30,000 a year at the expense of somebody else.  When the political change came, I am not suggesting that it was not very right and proper for the Irish representatives to say they must have a perfectly free hand in dealing with that suggestion.  The net upshot <Col N="1414" /> of the arrangement will be this, and we cannot hope it will be more from our point of view: the revenues of the College will not be substantially less than they were in pre-war days.  It is quite true, I dare say, that in the existing circumstances the Government could do no more.  We shall, I believe, be in the proud position of being the only University in Great Britain and Ireland which for three years will have to subsist upon a revenue not substantially greater than it was in pre-war days.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor Magennis made some references to Trinity College, and I think it is quite clear from the way he made the references that he was not basing his case for the National University upon the treatment that Trinity College had received. If he had been doing so, what I have said would make it clear that he would have no case at all.  I do not want to make any comparison.  I think it would be a great pity if this subject of University education were approached from the point of view of making comparisons. But I do want to point out that it is very difficult to compare in any way a residential University with a nonresidential University so far as costs of running are concerned.  Apart from that, we cannot compare University with University without at the same time taking account of the constituent Colleges.  Deputy Professor Magennis referred to the munificent endowment&mdash;I use the word sarcastically&mdash;of the National University of £10,000 per year.  Now, the University of Trinity College, Dublin, has no endowment at all either in the way of revenue or capital.  All the endowments are concentrated in its one College. Therefore, you cannot pay attention to the endowment of the National University of £10,000 without at the same time paying attention to the revenues of its Colleges.  Whilst I am on that point I think it is necessary to refer to the fact that, as compared with its pre-war revenue, the National University is in the favourable position as compared with us of having its pre-war revenue increased by a statutory grant amounting to £64,000 a year in addition to a nonrecurring grant amounting to £19,000, and to a certain share of other grants&mdash; not that I want in the slightest way to minimise the claims which the National University has to further State aid. Their claims are the same as our claims. <Col N="1415" /> Both Universities require all the State aid that can be given.  The needs of modern Universities are great as compared with their needs even 20 years ago. Deputy Professor Magennis referred to Trinity College as a rich foundation.  It may have been so 50 years ago, before my time, but I do not think, if he was aware of the facts, that he would call us a rich foundation now, with our pre-war revenue.  As was stated by the University Grants Committee, Universities cannot be financed under modern conditions on anything like the scale which was acceptable in the past.  The same quotation goes on to point out what kind of an increasing revenue was required, indicating something like 100 per cent. increase of revenue as being necessary in view of the requirements of modern science.  Both our claims are not to be set off against one another, but they are both claims which require, as I have said, all the aid that the State can give if either University is to do the work for the country which is laid out for it to do. Perhaps the Dáil may say, &ldquo;If you think all this, why on earth did you accept the proposition which was made to you?&rdquo;  I think I used the words before in this Dáil that Rome was not built in a day.  The State comes first, and I think we were public-spirited and said to ourselves that when things settle down it will be time enough to press our claims, that we could afford to wait until then to let the Government take up this question in the generous way that I believe they would like to do.  We are content to carry on as best we can until that day comes.  I do want the Dáil to understand that it simply means that many developments, at any rate, which we would like to carry out for the benefit of University education in the country, and for the benefit of the country, must be delayed until that favourable time arrives.</P>

      <P>I speak, not to disprove what Deputy Professor Thrift has said, but for other purposes.  A school teacher that was trying to instil the rudiments of English composition into a class found particular fault with one of the pupils, who repeatedly used the vulgar form &ldquo;a'int.&rdquo;  Eventually the teacher lost patience, and exclaimed, <Col N="1416" />&ldquo;How often have I told you that there a'int any such word as a'int.&rdquo;  Last evening I spent considerable time in trying to distinguish two institutions that in the public mind are repeatedly confused&mdash;the National University of Ireland and it's principal constituent college, University College, Dublin.  In one of the principal morning papers&mdash;perhaps I ought to name it; I name it with all respect, the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo;&mdash;all that I said is put down to the discredit of the Minister for Education.  The onus and the odium of all the mistakes with regard to this institution, fortunately, fall upon him; but as I am instrumental in bringing him into contempt for ignorance of the elementary facts with which he ought to be acquainted, I think it is due to him from me that I should make a further attempt to say what I desire to make clear.  The National University of Ireland, according to the newspaper report, has a heavy building debt of over £30,000, a load under which it staggers into inefficiency.  The National University of Ireland has no building debt whatever, not even one penny of a building debt, for the best of reasons, that it has no buildings and never had.  It occupies offices in Merrion Square&mdash;two private houses rented at a yearly rent.  The heavy building debt is on University College, Dublin, by virtue of the necessity of creating a building for lecture halls and for scientific research.  The building in Earlsfort Terrace is the building which cost £155,251 9s. 3d., although we cut down the buildings as far as the scheme was concerned to what could be built at the time we gave the contract for £68,000, so as to leave us the margin between £68,000 and £110,000&mdash;the amount given by a generous British Government for building and equipment&mdash; for equipment.  I tried to show clearly what is the absolute truth about this matter, that that building debt, for which we are paying £1,750 5s. 6d. interest, is not a thing for which University College ought to be held responsible. It arose inevitably out of war conditions, and is a war debt.  Yet we have to approach the bank managers from time to time, explain, beseech, entreat  and do all sorts of things that debtors have to do with bankers, and out of our feeble resources pay, when we can, the interest on the overdraft.  Now, it is not University College, Dublin, which has <Col N="1417" /> an overdraft of £7,000, as the newspapers said.  The overdraft of £7,000 is the indebtedness of the National University of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the Minister for Finance will rely on either statement, as I have had the disadvantage of being a member of a deputation to him recently on behalf of University College, Dublin, and I know the attitude he took up&mdash;a resolute and determined attitude.  I am trying to reach the public through the Press, because I believe sincerely that if the people of Ireland were aware of the true facts of the situation they would not tolerate its continuance.  It is not for the sake of being reported, it is for the sake of the facts being reported, that I am speaking to-day.  I believe that this ignorance about the financial situation ought to be dispelled.  I am not speaking on behalf of education as education; but, let me add, I tried to expound this doctrine which needs no exposition in any civilised country of the world beyond our shores, that commercial expansion, industrial expansion, all the life material of a nation, depends to-day more particularly upon the scientific laboratories of its Universities.  In those centres of research are brought into being the embryo of the future prosperity.  I am saying nothing whatever about civilisation, about the spiritual side of life that comes from higher studies.  There are two functions in every University College&mdash;the function of research and the function of teaching.  Research is a costly thing. Every progressive nation to-day has realised that while it puts millions into its submarines and into its big ships of war, and into its militarism, that all that is to protect its commerce and its industry, and that these for their existence and expansion are dependent upon the money it invests in scientific research. That is why all these countries are putting so much money into University Colleges. I gave you the example of Edinburgh University, whose Professor of Chemistry before the war had a salary of £1,750.  In 1918 they began to set up a chemical laboratory for 400 students at a cost of £250,000, whereas we were provided <Col N="1418" /> with £110,000 with which to build and equip, not a chemical laboratory, but a chemical laboratory, a physical laboratory, a biological laboratory; a physiological and all the other laboratories, and also set up what we have not got&mdash; libraries and rooms for ordinary teaching purposes.  Deputy Professor Thrift told you of the woeful state financially into which the great rich institution of Trinity College has fallen.  I can add to that statement of his that the two great Universities of ancient date, and of apparently unlimited resources, Oxford and Cambridge, had to apply for State assistance at the very same time as Dublin University.  A Royal Commission was set up to investigate their claims, just as a Royal Commission was set up in 1918 to investigate the position of Trinity College. The Trinity College Commission recommended that £49,000 per year additional was necessary for it to carry on its great work.  Its income, as we calculated it from the returns given to the Trinity College Commission of fifteen or sixteen years ago, was something like £80,000 yearly.  Mr. Asquith was President of the Royal Commission that enquired into the position of Oxford and Cambridge.  Only a few months ago that Commission reported that a sum of £72,000 yearly would need to be given to these rich Universities.  The University of Oxford has 39 colleges and halls in the city of Oxford.  It is one of the noted places of the world for exquisite beauty of architecture and for all the outside appearance of wealth of resource for education. Any man who wants to be impressed with the level of civilisation to which England once was able to attain merely need go to Oxford and Cambridge to be impressed for all his life.  If Oxford and Cambridge and Dublin University required these additional resources, what about a poor institution like University College, Dublin?  I dwell upon it, as it is centred in the same city as Trinity College or Dublin University and the academic rivalry, the friendly emulation for learning is keener between University College.  Dublin, and Trinity than it is between Trinity and any of the other colleges of the National University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the County Councils understand very well what it means as regards agriculture to have it based upon scientific education.  They understand the needs <Col N="1419" /> in roadmaking for surveyors and engineers, and they understand the value for their administration purposes of educated men in their membership.  The General Council of the County Councils only a month ago unanimously passed a strong resolution in favour of a further State grant to relieve the necessities of the University Colleges, more particularly University College, Dublin.  Now, there is one side of education&mdash;physical education&mdash;for which Trinity College ministers in a very remarkable degree.  For that purpose University College, Dublin, is only able to provide fields rented out at Terenure.  Where are our students housed?  The vast majority of the students that come to Dublin live in wretched lodgings in the streets and the by-ways of the South Circular Road.  I do not dwell upon details of that sort, because the public imagination would take hold of that fact and would imagine, because of the material poverty, the type of the education to be had in University College, Dublin, was equally inferior. But that is the misery of the situation.</P>
    <P>We have a staff of Professors, year after year, by good-will and devotion, giving their services for inferior remuneration, providing at smaller fees than are charged elsewhere higher education for 1,300 students, with very little pension to look forward to, and no regard either for the service they have given to the nation or any consideration for their own future.  We have that as a sore in the body educational.  It is miserable to stand up here always pleading for money.</P>

      <P>I would like in a few words to endorse the statement made by Deputy Thrift, that while Trinity College is sadly disappointed at the amount of the grant, still they recognise that, in the circumstances, the Government has treated them very fairly, and they have accepted it distinctly with gratitude.  It is a sad thing, however, to contemplate that as far as the finances of Trinity College are concerned we will be in a worse position for the next three years than before the War, so that there must be a curtailment <Col N="1420" /> of work, and a distinct stoppage of the extension of equipment and laboratory work to which we were looking forward. But we distinctly look forward, in the next three years, to a change in the attitude of the Government towards us, because we hope the State will be in a more flourishing position than at present, and we will look forward at the end of three years to getting a grant that will put us in a position which I think Trinity College deserves.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this University question which I would just like to raise.  I am sure it will excite Deputy Magennis to make even a more eloquent speech this time in defence.  I want just to draw attention to what seems to me to be a rather noticeable failure on the part of the University or the University Colleges and their staffs to influence the public life of the cities outside their ordinary collegiate duties.  I have in mind the work of some of the other Universities in extending University Education of a more popular kind, and I think that some of the desires of the Minister himself and of the representatives of the Universities could be attained if they would take a more active part in stimulating or generating a desire for the advancement in education in a wider sense the average man and woman who know nothing at all about Universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there are in every community a considerable number of men and women who are not able to take the keen, close interest in University activities that the more fortunately situated are, who are reachable by such means as extension lectures, tutorial classes, and the like. In the Universities in some places they actually take the initiative in organising this kind of work, and while there have been difficulties in this country, and while attempts have been made, as a matter of fact, and failed, nevertheless it occurs to me that the duty falls upon the Universities to help to popularise these and to make the people feel that Universities are really playing a part in their lives and in the civic activities surrounding them.  I know where the staffs are too small for the work to be done that the opportunities are very limited, and that it is asking men and women professors to do more than it is <Col N="1421" /> possible for them to do sometimes. Nevertheless that excuse is not a sufficient one to account for the failure of the Universities to enter into the common life of the non-University public.</P>
    <P>The University extension movement created a tremendous change in the public life of England.  It has had several offshoots, to which the Workers' Educational Association and, indirectly, the Labour Colleges, Correspondence Schools and other activities of that kind can all trace their origin.  The plan of popular lectures, discussions, excursions and visits to places of interest, historical and archaeological and the like, under the guidance of a competent Professor who can speak not only learnedly but interestingly, would have, and has had, a tremendous influence upon the civic life of the community where that has been accomplished and carried through.  I suggest, for the consideration of those who represent the Universities, that that is an aspect of the matter which would deserve their consideration, and, while I would not like to go so far as to say that the Vote should be reduced, or that some of these grants should be withheld until the Universities have risen to their opportunities in that respect, I would suggest it is well worth their consideration; and that before many months have passed they should take the initiative, and see if anything of that kind could be done in the cities where their Colleges are, and perhaps in other towns as well.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to ask the Minister to put matters right in respect to a more sordid question.  It is alleged that University College, Cork, is paying salaries to substitute Professors at the same time that it is continuing to pay the salaries of Professors who are now doing other duties, and are drawing pay on account of their other duties.  I am asking the question, and I do it because I want the Minister, if possible, to say that it is quite inaccurate and unfounded.  The late representative of the Saorstát in Washington was due to receive a sum of £2,100 out of this year's Estimate, and the assertion is made that he continues to draw his regular College salary, and that at the same time a substitute, another Professor, is also paid for doing the work which the representative in America is paid for.  In the case of the Professor of History in University College, Cork, it is also alleged that he is in a <Col N="1422" /> similar position; that, while drawing his pay as a Professor of History in that College, he is also drawing a salary in respect of a high post in the Army, and that another Professor is doing his work in the College, and is also paid out of College funds.  These statements are made on good authority, and it is said that they are statements of fact which cannot be controverted.  If they are facts I think something wrong has been done. If they are not true, then I am hoping that the Minister responsible will be able to give an emphatic denial to these allegations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with the last item first, no Minister is entitled to interfere with any of the University Colleges, and I pray that that may ever be the case; that in any development in this country the autonomy of the University Colleges shall be preserved. Interference of this kind has been protested against firmly, and with manifest success, in England and Scotland. At the time when the Treasury was being drawn upon for munificent support, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England, in giving the additional support, himself declared that in no circumstances would he tolerate interference with the autonomy of University institutions. If there is anything wrong in the administration of the Colleges I do not dispute the right of anyone to raise a question about it in the Dáil, in so far as it is to the Vote of the Dáil that these institutions owe their annual income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as regards University College, Dublin, which is the only one of the three constituent Colleges for whose internal administration I can speak, we have lent to the service of the State the Minister for Education, who draws not one cent. of salary from University College, Dublin. We have lent also to the service of the Dáil its distinguished Chairman, who is one of our assistants to the Professor of French, and he receives not one penny from University College during the period of his services here.  Another of our assistant Professors was lent to the administration of the State to be the Secretary of our representative in London, and from the moment that he left he received nothing from our fund.  Therefore, our withers are unwrung in so far as the Dublin College is concerned.  On the other point, Deputy Johnson hesitated to move a reduction of the Vote.  That reminded <Col N="1423" /> me of the old surgery where the surgeon, even though the patient might be suffering from anæmia, applied the usual treatment of bleeding.  Naturally an able man like Deputy Johnson, sympathetic as he is with educational development, would hesitate to recommend bleeding the College for whose anæmic condition I have been speaking so much at large.</P>
    <P>I want to correct a misapprehension. Because Trinity College, with its magnificent architecture and its superb college park, standing in the middle of the city, is associated in the public mind of Ireland with University Institutions, there is an impression that Universities are for the rich.  A palace is for a king, a castle is for a nobleman, and a university, which resembles these housings, in point of architecture and environment, is supposed to be of the palatial character associated with the privileged classes. So, from year to year, the belief grows and is spread that all that the University ministers to is the upper classes, just as the little noisome, noxious, ill-ventilated hut is for the children of the poor&mdash; for the working classes.  That is the national school; this fine building, with its costly equipment, is for the children of the rich.  However that might have been true&mdash;though, indeed, it never was true&mdash;however, there might have been the semblance of truth attaching to it&mdash; it is certainly not true to-day.  It is not true of Trinity College any more than it is true of University College, Galway, the poorest in point of material resources of our Constituent Colleges.  There is a great deal to be said in favour of bringing the University to the door of those who cannot go to the door of the University, by University extension.  But, before I speak of that, I should like to say to Deputy Johnson that he must not allow himself to be deceived into imagining that the life of the people is not touched beneficially by the operations of University Colleges, even though the adult is not coming into University Colleges. Because&mdash;and this is a thing which it would require hours to expound, and I have only seconds at my disposal&mdash;education, like religion, or, if you prefer the opposite illustration&mdash;like irreligion, Deputy Figgis suggests&mdash;I was going to say epidemics or diseases&mdash;spreads, and operates in the most mysterious way <Col N="1424" /> over inconceivably wide areas.  Education of the higher type acts not merely upon teachers who, in their turn, teach others in other schools, but it operates through journalism, through writers who are educated, through the public speaker, and through a thousand channels.  It is notorious in the history of civic development, that the presence of a University in a city means an uplifting and a raising of the general life, in the best sense of the word &ldquo;life,&rdquo; in the community. Still I do hold, with Deputy Johnson, that it is very desirable to have University extension lectures.  University College, Cork, devoted a good deal of energy to evening lectures for the people, and before the National University existed the old University College&mdash;the College of the Royal University&mdash;had afternoon lectures as one of its great features.  They were very widely attended, and I myself, as a Fellow of the Royal University&mdash;and the only Fellow&mdash;lectured every evening, except Saturday, for eleven years, for two and a half hours&mdash;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, for eleven years, until it turned my hair white.  The Minister for Finance calculated my age at sixty, on one occasion, deceived by my white hairs.  Before I was twenty-one the grey was beginning to appear; no wonder it should become absolutely white, teaching in the poor buildings of the old University College in Stephen's Green, night after night, for eleven years.  I am proud to say that some of the best graduates of the Royal University came out of those evening classes.  We have re-instituted these evening classes in the University College of the National University.  How many people attend?  There are some people who have got an ignorant idea that they must have a University degree, as if the having of a degree were everything, and having attended lectures, and having their thought directed into certain channels, and opportunities provided for them for completing their studies, were naught. Because we cannot permit the duplication of lectures by the University Professors at night, so as to qualify those who attend the night classes for degrees, the public will not come to them, which demonstrates that what the public want is the degree, which is naught in comparison. They do not want the education. The reason why we have not the University extension lectures on a wider <Col N="1425" /> scale in University College, Dublin, is because we have not the money.  Deputy Johnson does not realise, perhaps, that we have not got the staff for the ordinary purposes, because we cannot pay the salaries.  We set up a Faculty of Commerce to train students in Business Methods, Accountancy, Banking and Commercial Law, to fit them for commercial enterprises.  That costs us a great amount of money.  That was not a Faculty of the older Universities.  We have also Engineering; we have Medicine; we have one of the largest medical schools in Europe, from the point of view of numbers; but, as I pointed out last evening, we cannot house those students, we cannot provide them even with lecture halls.  The Professor of Anatomy has to duplicate, and sometimes triplicate, his lectures.  Instead of one lecture being heard in the lecture hall at once, he has to divide his class into sets and take them set by set.  So hampered, limited and restricted in that way, it is very, very difficult for us to do those things which we would like to do. However, I am grateful to Deputy Johnson for his support.  Even when he indicates a development towards a new line of work he is helpful, because he has accentuated this unhappy fact that the work that the Colleges&mdash;more particularly our College in Dublin&mdash;can do for the nation is frustrated by the narrowness of their resources.</P>

      <P>I yield to no Deputy in appreciation of certain work which has been done by the Universities, but I am rather surprised that Deputy Gorey has not risen on this occasion to ask, as he asked in connection with the National teachers, whether we are getting value for the money that is being spent on University education in this country. I do think that the Dáil and the general opinion of the country would support any plea for money to be spent on University education if it is quite plainly understood that the country is getting value for the money that is being spent on it.  But I submit that the course of University education in the past in Trinity College, and even in the National University to some extent, has been to prepare persons for emigration rather than to fit their education to the work of this country.  I would put this question: What have the Universities done for agriculture in Ireland? <Col N="1426" /> After all, agriculture is the basis of the economic position of the country, and one may well ask, in that respect, what have the Universities done?  I think it must be admitted that very little has been done.  I know that something has been tried in University College, Cork.  But, speaking generally, what have the Universities done to improve the education of the ordinary people of the country?  What have they done in scientific research, and what can the ordinary person learn from the Universities in Ireland, and from the men associated with them, of the resources of the country and how to develop them practically?  I do think that for the money that is being spent at present or for any increased expenditure&mdash;I would heartily support a proposal that the Universities should get an increase&mdash;we should get certain practical returns in the direction of the development of the country.  Instead of turning the minds of so many University students&mdash;very capable men and very learned men as some of them have proved when they went abroad&mdash;the Universities should turn the minds of their students to their own country.  In that very connection the Government itself has had to take back to Ireland from England its technical adviser on certain subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite time that the Universities should turn the minds of their students to the development of this country. What Deputy Professor Magennis has said, that a University and University education have a certain leavening effect, is quite correct.  But I think it would have been more true of the situation as it is in Ireland if he had said it <i>should</i> have a leavening effect here.  He mentioned, for instance, the influence which it has had on journalism.  He should have said the influence which it should have had on journalism in this country, because, judging by the ordinary daily paper that we get, I think everybody will admit that there is very little evidence of University education in what we are compelled to read in the newspapers in this country at the present time.  I submit that that leavening which should come from the presence of Universities can only be obtained when the general trend of the Universities is towards an interest in the affairs of the country. The fact that the Universities have been divorced from the general life of the country is, in my opinion, because the <Col N="1427" /> general trend of education was not towards the life of the country.  I do not mean exactly in the case of extension lectures or anything of that description; but in scientific education and agricultural education, and so forth, the trend of mind of those interested in the Universities, and of the men of education in the Universities, has not been towards development in this country, but towards development elsewhere.  That is really the cause of the divorce to which I have alluded.  After all, the University Extension Lectures appeal only to a certain class and to a limited number of persons. If the Universities are to take their proper place, as they should take it, in educating the men who will be the leaders of this country politically, scientifically, agriculturally, in journalism, and in every sphere of life, as the Universities in other countries do, then the minds of the men in the Universities themselves must be turned towards this country and towards its development.  It must not be their policy, as it was the policy of many of the Secondary schools, to prepare students to take places in England or America or other countries. The duty of the Universities and the duty of the other schools is to turn the minds of men to Ireland alone, and to the development of Ireland agriculturally and otherwise.  I think it will be admitted that the amount of money included in this Estimate is a very small amount to spend on University education.  If the case is really put up that the Universities are worth the money, I feel perfectly certain the Dáil and the country generally will endorse an increased Vote for education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy who has just spoken would learn much if he took part in the inner life of a University and saw something of the work that has to be done in the ordinary University by the Professor or Lecturer at the present time.  You are offering too little and asking too much.  You cannot expect a University understaffed, as our Universities are at present, to conduct at once the work of teaching and the work of research. I would gladly see every University in this country conducting research in the widest, most generous and most liberal way.  But it is really impossible. Professors to-day with large <Col N="1428" /> classes, frequently duplicating their lectures, are physically incapable of devoting such spare time as they have got&mdash; and I do not know where they get the spare time, except they take it out of their sleeping hours&mdash;to research.  A certain amount of research is done.  But, again, as Deputy Professor Magennis said, it is a question of money.  Can you give increased-staffs to the Universities? At present they are understaffed. As regards the college which I have the honour to represent, Deputy de Roiste suggested that we educate our students largely for export.  Perhaps that is so in regard to certain professions.  They did not find an opening in this country.  I hope&mdash;in fact, I am confident&mdash;that that will be changed in the future.  There was a suggestion that Trinity College does not take an interest in the well-being and in the national aims of this country.  That I controvert, and I controvert it very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Roiste asked what did the Universities do for agriculture.  As long as I have been connected with Trinity College we have been struggling to get money for agriculture.  We had a Professor&mdash;my first pupil&mdash;in the Agricultural School, Professor Barnes, and now he is a distinguished member of the service of which the Minister for Agriculture is head.  But, again, we wanted money for research there.  We wanted money to continue that Professorship.  We could not expect to get another person as self-sacrificing as the first Professor, to give up all his time for a miserable sum of, I think, £150 a year.  As regards Extension Lectures, that is the ambition of every University&mdash;to get into touch with its countrymen as widely as it can.  We have struggled to do so, but again we are short of funds, and we find it very difficult to carry on our ordinary work. Every year we have had lectures, but it is very hard to get men who have been working all day to work again the best part of the evening.  They have to prepare their lectures, and there is a lot of clerical work connected with the duties of their Chairs.  Until we can enlarge the staff of our Universities I do not see how we can carry on our Extension Lectures on any very wide scale.  I would gladly see it done.  For the last few years we have had in Trinity College a Summer Course for special bodies like the National School teachers, but that means that we <Col N="1429" /> have had to employ special lecturers. We can only do that in a limited way.  I am really only endorsing the views of Professor Magennis.  He put the case very clearly before you.  I do not think that the country is not getting value for the money expended on University education; in fact, knowing the subject from the inside, I think it is getting surprisingly good value.  I can only speak for Trinity College.  I know one Professor of Trinity College who is doing the work done by eleven men in Oxford.  We have to duplicate Chairs, Lectureships, Readerships, and until we can enlarge our staff&mdash;I am sure the same applies in the National University&mdash;I do not think we can undertake any great, fine schemes of Extension Lectures such as I, together with Deputy Johnson, heartily desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Magennis called attention yesterday to the fact that in any properly organised system of education the University should be the centre and the foundation, and that it was a fallacy to think that in educational organisation we begin at the bottom, at the lower type of school, and build up to the university.  I agree thoroughly.  I agree that it is at the top, at the university, we should begin, but if that is to be the test of the soundness of a scheme of education, then our system of education must be held to be most imperfect, for there is no proper connection between the universities and the other schools, especially the National Schools, which cater for the vast majority of the children. When, some years ago, an agitation was being carried on here for the establishment of a National University, one of the strongest arguments used was the necessity for such a university, in order to train the teachers who would be engaged in the ordinary schools.  I think it was the late eminent Bishop of Limerick, Most Rev. Dr. O'Dwyer, who made great use of that argument, in the course, I think, of his evidence before the Commission which sat before the National University was instituted.  To the ordinary man it seems a strange thing that our universities train our doctors, engineers and commercial men, but that they make no proper provision for the training of our teachers.  This matter has been agitated for some considerable time, and representations have been made by people <Col N="1430" /> who think that this should be one of the chief functions of a university, and recently a scheme was agreed upon between the representatives of the teaching body and the Senate of the National University. In order, however, to have that scheme put into operation, the consent and the co-operation of the Government was, and is, necessary.  Some months ago the Government were approached as to the possibility of putting this agreed scheme into operation, and I would be glad to know from the Minister for Education what are the intentions of his Department with regard to this particular question, and what progress has been made, if any, towards putting into operation this scheme.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate several references have been made to the advisability and the necessity of bringing the university into closer touch with the people.  I suggest that this is one of the ways, one of the chief ways, whereby the benefits of a university can be brought right down to all the people, not directly, but indirectly.  Some people who give only superficial thought to this matter may say: &ldquo;Oh, well, the man or woman who teaches what Deputy Gorey would call A, B, C, D, does not want the benefit of a University training.&rdquo;  To that I can only answer that all who have given the matter deep thought and grave consideration are agreed that it is in these very grades and in these very classes in the elementary department of our schools that the highest form of training is necessary.  I do strongly urge on the Government the necessity for initiating a scheme whereby the benefits of the university will come, in this way, indirectly to all the people.</P>

      <P>I think it will be agreed that Deputy Professor Magennis has done a very great service, not only to the Universities and to the Dáil, but to the country, in raising the matter in the way in which he has done.  It is not the first time that this subject has been raised by him here, and one would like to feel that it would be the last time, because it should achieve the purpose that he had in mind in ventilating this matter, if this question could now be settled finally.  I think it could, and I think it lies in the power of the Minister for Education, when he comes to deal with this Vote&mdash;which has assumed now the magnitude of a national peril, not only in this, but in other countries, and which is receiving attention in other countries&mdash;to indicate the lines on which it is his intention, and the intention of his Department, to have such an inquiry made into the whole case of the needs of Universities in Ireland, with a view to meeting that need, in order that the Universities may be enabled to fill that place in the national life which the Universities themselves desire more than any others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been very significant to note in the debate on this Estimate how every speaker, dealing with the matter from different points of view, have all converged on that central question.  Deputy de Roiste stated there was some evident gulf between university life and national life.  If there be that gulf it is a gulf that exists not at the will of the Universities, which desire only to bridge it.  I was very much struck by a remark by Deputy Magennis, in which he stated that it was never the case that the Universities were the habitat merely of the rich.  That is historically true, and it leads to a further reflection that, I believe, is proper to a consideration of this kind.  It is this, that in the past in all countries it is the Universities that have been poor in funds that have not extended their benefits to the people at large. It is the Universities in the past in England, France and other countries that have been rich, even at times when University education was held to be a perquisite of the rich, that made some effort ahead of their time to reach those who <Col N="1432" /> might be helped by their more fortunate position to have University education extended to them.  I think that is a matter which it is proper for us to remember at this moment, and for this reason, if University education is to have the influence and effect such as it should have over the country at large, then in the case of the Universities at the present their present impoverished condition will have to be attended to.  In England since the war, as we were reminded, and as is a matter of public knowledge, a Special Commission was appointed to go into the whole question.  I think we have had what I might call a glut of Commissions, and we could easily dispense with Commissions in that sense in the future, but some form of inquiry is very evidently necessary if we are to be saved from the position of having a slender Vote of this kind brought before the Dáil and subsequent Dála year after year, and the same complaints made, and the same discussions proceeding without getting some definite conclusion to what is everywhere admitted to be an evil.  This can only be done by some special, prompt inquiry, such as the Minister could set forth either by agreement with the Dáil or, I believe, under a minute of his own hand. I suggest that the question Deputy Professor Magennis has raised is one of such importance not merely to the Universities and the national life through the Universities, through the functions that the Universities should have in that life, that the best thing that could be done to summarise all that has been said here would be if the Minister could see his way to give an assurance that it is his intention to make special inquiry into this matter in order that a special allocation of funds might be available in the future to remedy this evil.  I have no desire to go into contentious matters, but I have been contrasting this Vote with the Vote a few pages later on&mdash;the Vote for the Army.  Obviously the Vote for the Army, now that peace has come, is going to be a Vote that will diminish from year to year, from month to month.  From week to week, much less from month to month, it will be decreasing, and one would like to feel that it would be a celebration of that stability of the State which has been brought about if the University grant could be increased, I will not say in an inverse ratio to the other decrease, but in some <Col N="1433" /> happy and necessary degree in order that the University might be able to do that which they themselves desire to do more than any others, and that is to give opportunities to all persons, no matter how poor, in order that they may, if I might quote the words of the English poet, be enabled to have &ldquo;Not merely joy, but education, in the commonality spread.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill) Eoin MacNeill">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill)</NameTxt>
      <P>I envy the position of Deputies in various parts of the Dáil who can stand up here freely to advocate the claims of university education, to point out the utterly inadequate resources that are at present at the command of our university institutions.  It would be very pleasant, in a sense&mdash;at all events, more pleasant for me&mdash;to stand alongside of Deputy Magennis and Deputy O'Connell and the other Deputies who have spoken and to raise my voice in chorus with theirs asking for more liberal&mdash;not more liberal, but more rational&mdash;treatment of university education.  I should like to see all the benches filled when the opportunity would come to me to speak out my mind freely on this matter.  I should like to see representatives of labour, representatives of practical agriculture, and the representatives of practical politics, all here in order that they might hear, if not how eloquently, at all events, how forcibly, I might be able to present the case that has been both eloquently and forcibly presented, apparently to me, by others.  There is a prejudice, and it has found expression, perhaps in a more humorous way than any other way, in this Dáil, the prejudice against the man with the university education, and even in a more concentrated form against the university professor. I think once or twice a smile has broken into audibility here when allusions have been made to university professors.  If a university professor, or any other highly educated man, is not a practical man, it is because he is not well enough educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certainly no reason in the world why education should unfit a man for public duty or public responsibility. To begin with, take the point or aspect of the subject raised by the Deputy who spoke last.  He put it to me that I should produce some plan to meet the needs and to institute some inquiry.  Now, these university institutions are manned by <Col N="1434" /> men who have been carefully and elaborately chosen for the purpose of carrying them on.  It is because that choice has been made on certain lines that these institutions are, and it is generally conceded they ought to be, autonomous institutions.  They are capable of doing their own work, and capable of bringing about their own desirable development if they are provided with the necessary resources.  And this question of how to meet the need, and this question of instituting inquiry, ought, therefore, to boil itself down to the simple question of providing those institutions with the necessary resources.  If not, if there is anything wrong in these institutions, if those who direct their operations are not competent, why then the criticism should be directed in that quarter.  But it has not been alleged that they are not competent, nor has it been alleged that they are unwilling.  I, from my experience, believe that they are both competent and willing to do the best they can do in the interests of the whole nation.  It is not to be supposed for a moment, that those who engaged in teaching in the Universities are unwilling to extend their teaching to any extent.  They are not only willing, but they are eager.  If you put it on the lowest possible motives, the man who teaches, and who believes he is capable of teaching, and has something worth teaching, if he had not anything else but his personal vanity, would desire to have an audience for his teaching.  If he had something more than his personal vanity, a zeal for knowledge and for the propagation of knowledge, he would be always willing to agree to give his teaching freely to any audience that would care to have recourse to him.</P>
    <P>That is my answer to Deputy Johnson with regard to the Extension lectures. It is my answer in part to Deputy O'Connell with regard to the training of teachers, and to Deputy de Róiste with regard to the teaching of agriculture and other subjects of the kind.  Those who can teach, as a rule, wish only for the opportunity of teaching, and the business of the public, and the business of the State is to provide them with that opportunity. Now we cannot blink the material facts, the real facts.  The evil is there.  It has been eloquently exposed; everyone recognises it.  Why is it there?  A year and a half ago there were high hopes, I think, on every side that this country was going to enter <Col N="1435" /> upon a period in which the resources which it possesses, the resources which were then at its command, would be used for the public benefit, for the National benefit, for progress, for advancement, for raising the confidence of people of this country in themselves, and for raising their name and their reputation in the world.  A calamity befel us.  I think really a large part of that calamity was due to defective education.  When I see the justifications that are put forward for it, I am sure it was based on defective education.</P>
    <P>But there is the state of the case. The resources of the country have been wasted, the credit of the country has been impaired, and I am now in the unhappy position of being at once an advocate, not for liberal, but for rational treatment of education, and at the same time bound to stand up for what I think is the imperative need of this country at present, that is to see the establishment of its finances and of its credit, on a sound footing.  It is a terrible difficulty and a painful difficulty.  I am perfectly certain that for me, who have to regard it here, speaking on one aspect, and for those who have spoken, who have to regard it in one aspect, if it is painful to us, it is ten times more painful to the Minister for Finance, who, from morning till night is compelled to face that in one hundred aspects.  A foolish idea entered into people's minds that this Government and this Ministry could be shaken by attacking the resources and the credit of the country.  Now, any person with any acquaintance with politics would know that a Government and a Ministry could go on so long as it had the means in its hands to defend itself; but that cruel blow that was struck went to the heart of the country.  It was not a blow against the Ministers. It was not really a blow against a political policy.  It was not a blow against a particular political state of things, but a blow struck direct against the most profound interests and against the future of the country.  And that we have to repair.  There is no prospect of right and rational treatment of education, University education, or any other branch of education, except that prospect be founded on a sound financial condition and a sound condition of credit for the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> I cannot escape from that.  I am bound to state it, and everyone who has any interest in education, I trust, will have that view of the case, and those facts of the case always in mind.  The best thing we can do for the future of education here in Ireland is in every way we can to build up the resources of the country.  I hope that the representatives of practical agriculture will bear that in mind; I am sure they will.  I hope the representatives of Labour will bear it in mind.  I do not enter for a moment into the controversies, sometimes taking a physical form, that we read about in the papers between one agricultural interest in Ireland and another, and between one economic interest in Ireland and another; but I do say those conflicts increase these difficulties. I think it is in controvertible that those controversies, when they take a form holding up in any way the development of the resources of the country, increase those difficulties and increase them, especially at this difficult time, enormously.  Many other points were brought forward, and, I think, in most cases the points that were brought forward by one Deputy were met in the excellent statement made by some other Deputy.</P>
    <P>Two particular matters were raised, one with regard to what the Universities are doing for agriculture and for the benefit of the country generally and not for external countries, and the other with regard to the training of teachers.  It is unfortunate, but it is the fact generally, that the application of University work and University research to the great industry of agriculture, the greatest of all industries, is very, very far behind-hand not only in Ireland but, I think, everywhere.</P>
    <P>I think Universities are only at the beginning, and they have not yet found the way to do what undoubtedly they will find the way to do&mdash;to exercise a beneficial influence on that great industry of agriculture.  I hope the agriculturists here will have faith in them and that they will recognise that just as the Universities can benefit engineering and chemistry and all those other practical economic pursuits, so also they can benefit agriculture, and confer very great benefits on agriculture.  As regards the mould of education as to whether it benefits this country or not, it has been my conviction for a long time that the <Col N="1437" /> best way to secure that education will be beneficial to the country, and that those who are educated in our Irish institutions will devote their energies afterwards to the benefit of the country is to give them an education containing elements which will make them more keenly interested in Ireland than in any other country in the world.  That has been my own particular aim in the matter of education for years.  I know I have often been met in the past with the argument that the teaching of the Irish language, or the teaching of a subject which I myself teach when I am free to teach, Irish history, are not subjects of great economic importance.  I say they are subjects of profound economic importance to this country, because an education which implants in those who receive it a deep and affectionate interest in this country is of supreme importance, and the things which characteristically and distinctively belong to it cannot fail to produce a generation and generations of students who will be devoted heart and soul to the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training of teachers and Government co-operation, I will repeat what has been impressed on you so often: that our Universities are autonomous and that Government co-operation can only take the form of approving of the schemes which they adopt, and providing the additional expenses which such schemes would incur. I quite agree that one of the principal duties of Universities&mdash;perhaps the greatest of all duties of Universities&mdash; is to provide teaching material, to provide trained teachers.  It does not necessarily mean that all the special work of training special teachers for special occupations must be done by Universities, but it does mean that the Universities throughout must have in view the teaching profession, and the interests of the teaching profession and the benefit and the improvement of the teaching profession, and I do hold that the Universities can and ought to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister would pardon me intervening.

      <P>I do hold that the Universities can and ought, as far as they are able, to take a direct part in the training of teachers.  I hope and trust that we shall see a development in that direction.  I might not personally feel enthusiastic about this particular scheme or that particular scheme, but that is not necessary.  If Universities bring forward schemes for the training of teachers, and if it is possible for the Government with its resources, doling them out in due proportion, to finance these schemes, I would be content with a very moderate claim to criticise or to modify.  I would have the fullest confidence that the Universities themselves; with due deliberation, would shape schemes in connection with the training of teachers that would be entirely advantageous and beneficial. There again as I say the main point with regard to Government co-operation means providing the financial resources.  I presume that, at least, a proper scheme for the training of teachers in direct association with the Universities would mean an extension of the term of training by one year, and that again would mean an increase of 50 per cent. or thereabouts, in the financial provision already made for the training of teachers.  That brings me back to the starting point.  We are up against the same difficulty.  Not this Government, not this Ministry has been defeated, but this country has been defeated&mdash;only for the time, of course&mdash; defeated for the time in doing things which are necessary, which are valuable, which every patriotic man and woman ought to desire to see done and to see the country enabled to do.  The country has been defeated for the time being.  I will end with a plea which I would like to be able to address to everyone of my fellow-countrymen. There is hardly anything more patriotic that an Irishman or an Irishwoman could aim at bringing about at this present juncture of time, hardly anything that would more fully prove their devotion and loyalty to this country than&mdash;in whatever way each one finds it <Col N="1439" /> possible, and with all the enthusiasm that a right, patriotic endeavour could inspire in us&mdash;to restore this country to the position of credit, of command of resources, of financial prospects and financial actualities, on which it should have embarked a year and a half ago.</P>
      <P>With regard to a point upon which I was asked to say something, Deputy Magennis quite properly said that I am not accountable for the manner in which University Professors are remunerated, or the manner in which they discharge their duties.  I made such inquiries here as I could on the spot, and I am able to give this answer.  Professor or General James Hogan&mdash;for whom those who know him as a student and a teacher as well as those who know him in his more recent capacity as an able military commander have nothing but the highest respect and esteem&mdash; receives his ordinary salary from University College, Cork, and pays for a substitute.  The only money he receives from the Army is the amount which he pays to his substitute as locum tenens.</P>

On the last occasion this matter was raised the Minister promised to go into the matter with the Transport Department.  I would like to know if any advance has been made in the direction <Col N="1440" /> of securing season tickets for members to their constituencies.  Has the matter been placed before the Railway Companies through the Clearing House, and have the railways definitely refused to meet the Government in this matter?  I fail to see any good reason why the Railway Companies in a matter of this kind could not meet a Government.  Department without compromising anything, especially as they make concessions to cattle traders and other sections of the community.  I would be glad to know if any representations have been made, and if it is a fact that the Railway Companies, to whom representations have been made, have definitely declined to make any concession.</P>

      <P>There are one or two items under &ldquo;E&rdquo; on which I hope the Minister will throw some light, dealing with salaries, wages and allowances to officers and staff of the Oireachtas.  There is one item, &ldquo;Counsel £1,200 a year inclusive; one librarian and one assistant librarian.&rdquo;  I do not know whether this is provision for the future.  At the moment I do not think that these offices exist.  I do not exactly know what is meant by provision for Counsel.

      <P>I see.  There is also a librarian and an assistant librarian Another matter that was raised before, and which I think it necessary to raise again, deals with the provision for an Officer of Communications between the two Houses.  I can only presume that the officer is presumably engaged in some other capacity, because it seems to me that the services of an officer of this kind are not necessarily much availed of.  I do not know if he is the channel through which communications, such as they are, pass between the two Houses, and as I say I can only come to the conclusion that he is perhaps engaged in some other capacity.  If he is, then his remuneration should come under some other Vote.  I am not at all objecting to that, or to the Officer personally, or to <Col N="1441" /> his having sufficient salary for the post, but I do not see exactly why it should come in under this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first matter mentioned by Deputy Davin, in connection with season tickets, I had intended to take up that matter direct with the Companies, but, having regard to the fact that this is a small Dáil, and that a proper estimate of attendances and so on was not possible, I thought it better to leave it over until after the Election.  I would then be in a position to speak for a very much larger number of persons who would be affected, and also in view of the fact that we were in communication with the Railway Companies on another matter I did not think it advisable to go into the question.  With regard to the matter raised by Deputy O'Shannon, there is a librarian and an assistant librarian. The Librarian is &ldquo;Sean Gall&rdquo; (Mr. Kenny), who was in the Customs and Excise, and was formerly stationed at Goole.  He is a historian of very considerable repute, and is at present engaged in the Castle.  We had intended to get the library over here, but as our stay is limited, as far as these buildings are concerned, it did not appear to be good business to transfer the library for a short period and then remove it again. It is the intention, although the matter is not yet finally decided, to make what is known as the Castle Library available for the Oireachtas.  Mr. Kenny has been there since his transfer from Goole.  I think Deputy O'Shannon will probably know the name pretty well and will be satisfied with the appointment.  As to the Assistant Librarian I think the Deputy is also acquainted with him.  He was the Librarian of the old Dáil, Alderman Kelly.  We had some money available from the old Dáil for the purchase of books, and he has been successful in getting some very valuable works.  That particular service is defective just now by reason of the fact of not having premises for the Dáil and Seanad, I mean what we would call a permanent or semipermanent location for them.  If premises were available I think there would be no cause of complaint with regard to the services of the two officers in question. As to the Counsel the Ceann Comhairle has answered the point that was raised.</P>

      <P>I do not <Col N="1442" /> know if the Deputy understood quite clearly.  It is intended that there will be Counsel to the Ceann Comhairle who will also be examiner of Private Bills. When this Estimate was prepared the figure £1,200, inclusive, was inserted to cover such an appointment, should it be made.  No such appointment has been made.  As was reported from the Committee on Procedure to the Dáil some time ago, Standing Orders for Private Bills are being prepared, and a fee will be paid to a barrister for assistance in preparing and drafting Private Bills.  Since no Private Bill Orders are actually in force, and since no Private Bill business is being done, no examiner has been appointed. Therefore the figure is one that is merely intended to cover the appointment should the appointment be found necessary within the financial year.</P>

      <P>With reference to the explanation in regard to the Librarian and the Assistant Librarian I am perfectly well satisfied, but I think it well that the statement that the President has made with reference to these two gentlemen should have been made. So far as I know from their reputation in the past they are quite competent and on no personal grounds could I have any objection to them at all.  But I think it is well we should be told that there was a library being made available for the Oireachtas and that it was in competent hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite recognise the difficulty of putting it at present at the disposal of the Oireachtas on account of the want of premises.  I am not satisfied with regard to the position of the Officer of Communications, because it does not seem to me that there is anything like sufficient work for an appointment of that kind.  At all events there has not been sufficient work for an appointment of the kind; I do not know whether there will be in the future or not, and I think it is not satisfactory from the point of <Col N="1443" /> view of public finance that a post which merely means occasional, and very occasional, handling of communications as between one House and the other should be created at a salary like this.  I am not at all satisfied, but I am satisfied about the other positions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I read a statement by the Minister for Finance regarding the sacrifices made by members of the Seanad, and I quite agree to a certain extent.  In that statement he indicated that there were some members of the Seanad who returned their £30 per month.  I have calculated the amount and I find that provision to the full amount for all the members of the Seanad is made in the figure of £20,830. I take it, therefore, that every Senator is drawing his full allowance of £30 per month; or is it that provision is made in case of emergency?  I would like also to know if every member of the Dáil, including some who very seldom attend, is drawing his £30 per month.  I think it is quite unfair that members of the Dáil who very seldom come here should think it advisable to draw this £30 from the State without giving service to the State for that figure.  I hope such a position will not arise in the case of any of those who seek election to the next Dáil, and I should like to know how it is such Deputies think it reasonable that they have rendered service to the State for which they take that particular amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that although the Constitution provides for the payment of members the Dáil makes provision only for expenses.  I know one member who did not attend here very often, but who is put to very much heavier expense than any other member.</P>

It has taken a considerable time, for a variety of reasons, but the <Col N="1444" /> Report will be before the Dáil and it will be open, of course, to discussion.  It is really upon the basis of that Report that a good deal of the moneys asked for in this Estimate will be actually expended in the course of the Financial Year.</P>

That is the reason for the distinction drawn there.  In the other case the difference between the two Votes, which is a remarkable difference, is due to the fact that the salary of the President is down in this particular Vote for the first time.  I do not think it was down at all last year, and was probably included in the cost of the Ministry of Finance.  Coming in there now it tips the balance in the wrong direction.</P>

      <P>On this Vote I desire to take the opportunity of calling attention to certain matters which I think should be rectified.  At the present time, amongst traders and others all over the country, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with regard to the length of time goods are held up at the different ports by different railway companies. The railway and steamship companies try to put the blame on the Customs' officials.  I had a certain specific case which I took up with the Revenue officials, and from the correspondence that I had with them, and the explanations they gave, I am satisfied that they were not to blame in that particular case. It is an appalling thing that goods should be held up, sometimes perishable goods, for a fortnight or three weeks, and in my opinion a practice of that kind should not be tolerated.  The railway and steamship companies act as carrying agents for people to whom goods are consigned. They are supposed to take delivery of the goods and to pay the Revenue duties on them at the ports, and I think, in all fair play and in order that business may be facilitated throughout the country, they should be made carry out that arrangement.  It strikes me that, in most cases, the delay which occurs is due to the fact that the companies concerned are trying to carry on with the old staffs, and they have neglected to make provision for the prompt execution of the additional work which, as carriers, they have undertaken to carry out.  I say that that is not treating the public fairly, and something should be done to have the complaints that are made by the people of the country rectified.  I have only cited one case, of which I have personal knowledge, but many others of a similar nature have been brought to my notice within the last month or two.  I know of one case where goods were consigned five weeks ago, and they have not yet been delivered to the consignee.  The companies act as agents for the people, and it is up to them to have the necessary warrants presented in time at the ports so that clearances can be promptly made.  I do not suppose that the Minister for Finance is the Minister to deal with this particular <Col N="1446" /> matter.  I am sorry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here, because I brought the matter to his notice some time ago, and he was to look into it.  I raise it now for the purpose of getting the Ministry and the Dáil to see that, when companies give undertakings to carry out certain duties, they will be compelled to do so, and that they shall not be allowed to penalise the trading community, as they have been doing, in the matter of delays for some time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to say with regard to this particular Department, except to complain that its powers to deal with railway companies, even in regard to such matters as those mentioned by Deputy Hughes, seem to be practically nil.  As I understand it, the Department is more or less a statistical one.  Certain representations may be made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and these are passed on to the Department to communicate with the railway companies, but, I think if the Department is to serve any useful purpose, or if there is to be any genuine return for the money spent under it, its powers will have to be considerably enlarged and made more effective than they are at present. I have been looking forward for some time for a statement of policy from the Government benches with regard to the future of the railways.  In fact, we were promised that statements made by Ministers in the beginning of the present year, regarding such a policy, would be put into operation before the Government went out of office, or before the dissolution of this Dáil.  I am not going to anticipate what is going to happen as a result of the rumoured early General Election, but if the Government fail to give effect to the promises they made early in the year in regard to this particular matter, they will have to answer the people for their failure to do so.  In my opinion, if there is to be any scheme of re-organisation with regard to the railways of this country, this Department will have to be re-organised, and its powers considerably enlarged.  That must be done if the Department is to be put in a position to exercise greater powers over the railway companies if these are to remain privately-owned concerns, and if there is to be any avenue by which the public can get at the railway companies in regard to such matters as the rates <Col N="1447" /> they enforce, and the application of remedies for dealing promptly with traffic in cases such as those mentioned by Deputy Hughes.  We are faced with this fact that the Northern companies have already given a considerable reduction in rates for certain classes of traffic, particularly agricultural traffic, while in the Free State area the railway companies have done nothing in that respect.  If we had a proper Transport Department, with greater powers than the present Department is invested with, I think something might be done to compel the railway companies to meet the reasonable complaints of the trading community. I hope, if the present Ministry intends to proceed with its railway policy, it will take these things into consideration, and that whatever Ministry may succeed it in the very near future as a result of the Elections, will realise the responsibility that will be thrown upon it in regard to railway policy, and also as regards setting up a Department that will be able to satisfy the demands of the trading community in everything that concerns the commercial interests of the country.  There is also the question of the power of this particular Department or Ministry to deal with such matters as conditions of service, etc.  I merely mention this matter so that the Government, between now and the time it proposes to give effect to its previous promises with regard to railway policy, may consider the advisability, in the interests of trade, of the travelling community and in the interests of the users of the railways and of the workers employed on them, of enlarging the powers of the Department so that the taxpayers may be enabled to get some return for the large sum of money voted in respect of the services it is supposed to render to the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one or two remarks on this Estimate.  Owing to the high freight charged by the railway companies there is an immense lot of motor traffic on the roads.  This is causing a great deal of damage to the roads, especially in Westmeath.  People living as far down as Galway remove their goods by road.  It would be well if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would look into this matter with the railway companies with a view to having a reduction of the freight charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> I would be glad if the Minister would give me an idea of the wages, including bonus, of the messengers.  There are rumours that the wages of the messengers are to be reduced very soon.  I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here, but perhaps the Minister for Finance might answer.  Because if there is a reduction of wages, it would only mean a further strike, and I know the Minister would not like that.</P>

      <P>A statement was made by the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce, the other day, and statements have appeared in the Press, dealing with the position of the amalgamation of railway lines and railway systems within the Saorstát, and those that communicate from the Saorstát to the Six Counties.  That matter was raised serveral times in this Dáil and it was promised that fuller information would be available when we reached this particular Vote, 56, dealing with the Transport Department.  I think it would be for the general information if we could receive a fuller statement on that matter now, more particularly in regard to one aspect of it.  There have been <Col N="1449" /> suggestions that any amalgamations that might occur of different systems would leave one or other of the railway services in the South outside, and that one of them&mdash;the one that was mentioned was the Dublin South-Eastern&mdash; might be included within the control of a vast railway system outside the Free State.  That is a matter that, obviously, would be very much to the injury of the Free State.  It would be to the injury of the Free State if there was a single mile of Irish railways controlled by any directorate that was not resident in Ireland. I think that would be agreed as a sound principle that ought to be adopted in regard to such amalgamations.  Inasmuch as difficulties have arisen&mdash;at least one is confidently informed in the Press that certain difficulties have arisen, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce some time ago informed this Dáil that, in the event of failure, it would then be the responsibility of the Ministry to put up a definite scheme, and to bring in legislation on the lines of that scheme, and compel adherance to it&mdash;I think that the promise made that information would be given to us on the head of this Vote should now be fulfilled.  We should have some fuller information than has yet been given to this Dáil on this very important matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Hughes, I will undertake that the Ministry will investigate any specific complaint of delay. There have been some cases of complaints.  Investigations have taken place, but the complaints have been more or less of a general character.  If specific instances are furnished we will undertake to deal with the matter in a way that will give satisfaction, I think, to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question raised by Deputy Davin, the functions of the Transport Ministry in regard to railways cover Finance and Statistics, Public Safety, Appointments of Baronial Auditors, Rates, Fares, Facilities, Liquidation of the Control Agreement between the railways and the British Government.  Owing to the unsettled conditions of the railways, the Department has been largely kept engaged since its transfer to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on special matters regarding the functioning of the railways, their future policy and questions <Col N="1450" /> arising out of wages and conditions of service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matters raised by Deputy Figgis and Deputy Davin, they have not yet reached the point at which it would be to the interests of either the railway companies or the Government to make a statement on them.  We know that negotiations, suggestions, recommendations, and so on, take a very considerable time.  If the railway companies cannot come to an agreement that undertaking that was given by the Minister will have to be carried into effect, but we believe that it is better still to spend a little more time in seeing if it be possible to come to some accommodation. In the first place it would be more satisfactory, and in the second place it would probably speed up the ultimate settlement of the question more than if we had to come along with a cut and dried scheme of our own.</P>
    <P>The Department's functions also include various matters in connection with tramways, railways, canals, docks and harbours, including the receiving and examination of accounts, returns, Sinking fund, powers to reduce rates in certain circumstances, appointment of auditors, power to impose penalties, and also matters of public safety.  I am also informed that increased powers for the Transport Department are desirable, but they can only be conferred on them by new legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I am sure, appreciate the difficulty of introducing new legislation, or even dealing with some of the many complex problems that we have by reason of the shortage of time and the necessity for going slowly to avoid mistakes. It is better not to make mistakes. They are not easily remedied, and they may have very bad reactions if they are made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Seán O Laidhín, the scale of pay of established messengers is 25/- a week, rising by 1/- to 29/- plus the Civil Service bonus, which is equivalent, at the current rate of bonus, to 47/5, rising to 56/- per week.  Unestablished messengers receive uniform and overtime in respect of hours in excess of forty-eight per week.  A limited number of subordinate employees, fire-lighters, etc., are on a scale of 18/-, rising by 1/- to 22/- plus Civil Service bonus, equivalent at the present rate to <Col N="1451" /> 34/2 and 41/9.  This is the scale we received when we took over from the British and we have paid that since.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the President's statement, the Railway Companies do not seem to have come up to the requirements of the Government in regard to agreement on a particular scheme; yet they appear to have in mind the operation of that scheme by making certain alterations and changes in their staffs.  They are, in fact, making certain arrangements for the dismissal and removal of members of their staffs.  It would be very desirable, in view of the statement which has been made, that representations should be made to the Railway Companies that they should not carry out this scheme of removal until the scheme is cut and dried, and until such scheme has met with the approval of the Government.  It is very unfair that while the Railway Companies have not come to any agreement on a particular scheme they are anticipating it at the expense of the staff in certain matters. I would like that the Minister, or the Transport Department, should make some recommendation to the Companies that no changes should take place in the personnel of their staffs, and no reduction of staff should take place until the scheme is cut and dried and until the Government has adopted it.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, though I suppose Deputies will hardly believe it, that since the statement was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce not a week has passed that I have not been in conference with him and the Assistant Minister and officials of the Department on the subject, trying to work out a satisfactory scheme.  I do not think that there is any subject has absorbed so much of my time, if we exclude the question of finance.  I think, while there is a great deal to be said for what Deputy Davin urges, that it would not be well if we were to allow ourselves to be sidetracked by any detailed considerations when the big problem is yet unsolved.</P>

I tried to make it quite clear that although the Railway Companies have failed to bring forward any scheme that would meet with the approval of the Government, they have tried, nevertheless, to anticipate it by making certain changes and alterations in their staffs.  In many cases where vacancies have occurred, through death or otherwise, such vacancies have not been filled.  I do not think that any scheme which may come into operation should be anticipated at the expense of the staff.  This is a policy which, to my knowledge, is causing a good deal of irritation.  It should be dropped until such times as the Companies and the Government have agreed on a particular scheme.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That it is an essential condition precedent to the peaceful development of Industry and Commerce in the Saorstát that the workers should be guaranteed regularity and permanence of employment, and payment for their work at rates sufficient to maintain them and their families in decency and comfort; also, that it is the opinion of the Dáil that the Government should call into conference representatives of employers and workers organisations, for the purpose of devising the best means and methods of providing such regularity and permanence of employment, with satisfactory payment for work done.</P>

      <P>The motion on the paper was proposed by Deputy Johnson on Friday last.  An amendment was moved by Deputy Whelehan, the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In lines 2 and 3 to delete the words &ldquo;be guaranteed&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;have,&rdquo; so that the motion if amended would read &ldquo;That it is an essential condition precedent to the peaceful development of Industry and Commerce in the Saorstát that the workers should have regularity <Col N="1453" /> and permanence of employment, etc. Deputy Johnson was speaking on the amendment and moved the adjournment of the debate.  He is therefore in possession now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on Friday last, having just the verbal statement of the Minister in my mind regarding the amendment that he proposed to my motion, I did not appreciate at its true value the effect of the amendment which he proposed, and I spoke rather too emphatically in my repudiation of that amendment.  I think it is unfortunate that he was not willing to accept the resolution as it was moved, but I desire to say that the amendment which he proposed did not justify my repudiation of it in the very emphatic words which I uttered.  Nevertheless, I desire to argue that the motion as moved is better than the amendment of the Minister. The effect of the amendment would be to alter the motion in the sense that whereas I desire to say that there should be a positive assurance given to the workman&mdash;that he should have some guarantee of permanence of employment and payment for work done at rates sufficient to maintain him and his family in decency and comfort&mdash;the Minister prefers that the Dáil should say that the workers should have regularity and permanence of employment and payment for their work at rates sufficient to maintain themselves and their families in decency and comfort, and he is prepared to say that the Government should call into conference representatives of employers' and workers' organisations for the purpose of devising the best means of providing such regularity and permanence of employment with satisfactory payment for work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion it rather seemed, from the statements that were made by one or two Deputies, that the motion involved primarily a State guarantee of permanence of employment. What is implied in the motion is that the organisations of workmen and employers, the economic organisations of the country, should endeavour to devise means and methods of achieving the end which may be generally considered to be a desirable end, and that quite conceivably those organisations may themselves devise such ways and means without the intervention of any State authority; nevertheless, failing such ways and <Col N="1454" /> means being absolutely watertight, that there should be, as a co-relative guarantee, a State guarantee, backing up and supporting a voluntary guarantee of the organisations of employers and employees. Now, Deputy Magennis implied, and Deputy Whelehan stated in so many words, that the proposition was an idealistic one, and was impracticable because it was idealistic.  Well, I demur. I say it is not impracticable, and though it may be idealistic at this moment, it is an ideal which can be realised, and it is incumbent upon us to make an attempt to realise it.  There are organisations of employers and employed which have, as a matter of fact, devised ways and means of ensuring permanence of employment in the sense that is referred to here&mdash;regularity of employment&mdash;and I contend that such organisations in all industries can be arrived at if the will is present. I think that it is unfortunate, most unfortunate, that Deputies should get it into their heads that anything which means a real improvement on present conditions is idealistic, and because it is idealistic it should not be striven for. We are reminded too much of Mr. Gradgrind, &ldquo;facts, facts, facts,&rdquo; as though the only facts were the sordid ones, as though there were nothing better in life than the sordid things, the things that drive men down.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Dáil to agree with me that there is in humanity something better than the mere greed and acquisitiveness upon which the political economists of the last century based their theories, and upon which, unfortunately, most newspaper leader writers, members of the Dáil, and, I think, Ministers, base their views of political economy, the inexorable economic laws which are supposed to be absolute, and must inevitably lead to the degradation of humanity.  I deny the inexorable nature of those laws; I deny that they are laws except on the assumption, which is the assumption of those economists who are looked on as the spiritual fathers of modern commercialism, whose economics are based on one single assumption, that the only constant factor, and therefore the only factor, that can be considered in dealing with human affairs is greed&mdash; acquisitiveness.  Deputy Magennis said that the doetrine I had expounded &ldquo;is utterly opposed to the doctrine of class warfare, which is the weed that flourishes <Col N="1455" /> when the materialistic conception of life is allowed to replace the proper conception of human values,&rdquo; and that I had dissociated myself clearly and unmistakably from those who espouse the class war doctrines.  Deputy Magennis knows, I am sure, but I think it well that other Deputies who are, perhaps, not so conversant with the philosophy which propounded this doctrine of the class war, should know that it is not a doctrine which has to be preached or advocated; People, looking at economic and social life from a certain point of view, contend that it is by the method of class struggle that Society has developed, and I say this, that if the economics advocated, in the daily newspapers by newspapers leader writers, by shipowners in their manifestoes, by Deputies in the Dáil, by Ministers, are true, then class war doctrine is true.  If it is true that the one permanent factor which dominates all the rest of human impulses is this factor of acquisitiveness and greed then class war doctrine is the true one and a correct description of the methods whereby human society has developed and will develop.  I do not believe in the foundation of that theory. I do not believe that greed is the only factor, that the other factors being accidental and impermanent, need not be taken into account, and therefore I believe that some other method could be developed than the method of class warfare.  But any other method cannot be developed than the method of class warfare if we are going to rely constantly and insistently at all times upon the laws of competition, upon essential greed as the impulse which drives humanity forward.</P>
    <P>When Deputies ask us to repudiate or to discountenance the doctrine of a class war they are asking us to dispute and discountenance one aspect of the every day doctrine which they are preaching in every walk of life, in every aspect of economic and social life, for they tell us that you cannot expect employers in this country to pay wages at a higher rate than employers in a rival country are paying; that you must reduce the conditions of labour, the price of labour and wages to that of your rivals, because the economic laws compel you.  If that is the case, if these laws, so called, are inexorable, as we are told, then inevitably men are driven to combine to obtain <Col N="1456" /> possession of these material sources of power, to protect their interests, and to satisfy that fundamental urge which is presumed by the political economists, who are the fathers of these ideas, to be the one dominant and permanent factor which can be taken into account in discussing economic theories.  I believe that while society is based, as it is today, upon these laws of competition&mdash; that acquisitiveness, the desire for gain, is the one purpose and intent, the end of so much popular teaching&mdash;that there is no other end to that doctrine than the doctrine of the class war.  Recognising that, I subscribe to that doctrine of the class war, so long as we are forced to work under that system of society which has its foundation, and its rise, in this desire for gain, this urge for acquisition.  I want the Dáil to agree that there can be something better, that we can, in this state begin to introduce into the economic and social life of this country from this place, the right place from which such ideas should be generated, a better idea to rally to the growth of society, the higher human impulses, and to keep greed and acquisitiveness in its proper place, subdued and subordinate to something better.  We are told that the country cannot afford to continue, it cannot prosper while the present rate of wages, the present conditions of labour exist, that the Irish workman has been able to resist the downward trend of wages, that because wages have fallen in England, Scotland, Germany and Belfast, that, therefore, Irish wages must come down, in the same ratio, or something equivalent. That is asking us to accept a doctrine that though your political rulers have gone, your economic rulers remain, and that you must adapt your mode of life, your conditions of poverty, to the mode of life and the conditions of poverty which exist in other countries. We have tried to encourage men to think, during the last few years, that a political emancipation would give an opportunity for this country to work out a social emancipation for itself, and we are not prepared to accept the view that there shall be a common level, and that the conditions of the lowest will ultimately determine the conditions of the workmen here.  I do not believe that it is necessary.  I I believe that this country can, if it will, <Col N="1457" /> feed, clothe, house and make comfortable, so far as material wealth can do so, its present population, and much more than its present population, out of its own soil, out of its own resources, and I believe that if we are going to adapt our economic life to the circumstances determined by other countries, then we have failed utterly in the attempt towards freedom.  When English conditions are quoted, one remembers that in certain industries in England, in some of the greatest industries, the conditions of the workmen are actually much worse to-day than they were pre-war; that the rates of wages are lower, or as low, as they were in 1914, whilst the cost of living is considerably higher; and that not only are the rates of wages lower but the earnings are much lower than they were in those days, while the cost of living is higher, and we are asked to consent to certain conditions here because of those conditions there.</P>
    <P>I think it is fallacious to suggest, as the Minister suggested, that with an extension of present activities, with a mere burst of business enterprise, you will gradually absorb the unemployed and solve the problem.  You may temporarily, but you will not solve the problem. England is very much more prosperous in the way of production and material wealth per head than Ireland is likely to be for a long time.  The problem of unemployment is very grave, and even in the best of times there it has been contended by the so-called captains of industry, and by the more responsible political economists, that the industrial machine depends upon a margin of not less than 5 per cent of unemployed.  We know that in America unemployment alternates every few years with over employment, boom following slump and slump following boom.  The mere attempt to meet this problem by encouraging commercial activity is not going to solve it.  I would ask the Dáil to think of this problem, and its solution as they would think of the permanent problems of life, not casually, not simply echoing the things that have been said for a generation or two by English newspaper writers, politicians, statesmen and economists, all of which things and words have been spoken and written in relation to life under English conditions in England, and industrial conditions in England.  I say that to follow on that course is fatal to any hope of a real change in the social <Col N="1458" /> life of Ireland, or a real improvement in the social life of Ireland.  I have seen very often&mdash;in yesterday morning's paper for instance&mdash;reference to the necessity for reductions in wages and changed conditions because of the rivalry of other countries, and that such reduction was required as a preliminary to decreases in the cost of living, and that with such adjustments the cost of living in Ireland would inevitably and automatically fall.  I want to say here what I have said at more length in a letter to the newspapers, that so far as the workman's life is affected, so far as those things which enter into the average workman's household are concerned, as detailed in the official reports of the Cost of Living Committee, the reduction of wages in Ireland is going to have a very small effect upon the cost of living of the workman's family.  The President does not read the papers.  Therefore, I will risk repetition at least of the conclusion of that communication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw that all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion is that even though the workmen engaged in the handling, the preparation, the distribution within Ireland of those articles which go to make up the workmen's budget were to work for nothing, the reduction in prices of those articles would not be more than thirty per cent., would be less, as a matter of fact, than 30 per cent., and that if we were to assume a general reduction all round of 20 per cent. in wages the effect upon a household budget, if all the saving were transferred to the consumer in reductions in price, could only mean a reduction of 6 per cent.  Now, think of what that means to the workman's family&mdash;think of how that is going to appeal to the workman. He knows, as a matter of experience, that wages rose long after prices rose, and he knows, as a matter of experience, that prices fall very slowly and laggardly after wages have fallen.  The ultimate end of the example I quoted was with a 20 per cent. reduction in wages, the workman who has been receiving £4 would have his wages reduced to £3 4s., whereas the commodities that that £4 hitherto has been expended on, would only be reduced by 4s. 9d. to £3 15s. 3d.  That is to say, with wages of £4 he has been able to buy £4 worth of commodities; henceforth with reducea wages of £3 4s. he would be 11s. 3d. <Col N="1459" /> short in buying the same commodities, that is a reduction of 14 per cent. in his purchasing power.  That is how it appeals to the workman.  I think I can quite confidently challenge any examination of those figures with you.  That is how it appeals to the workman, and it is the reason, in my opinion, why the policy of this country should be directed towards a high wages policy, and concurrently an imposed obligation that these high wages should be spent in increasing proportion upon Irish-made and Irish produced commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have to find means of imposing that obligation upon the producing elements of the community by tarriffs, or by other means.  I do not want to prejudice that question, but I say that for the real prosperity of the country we should rely rather upon high levels of payment, even though high prices continue. I was tempted to follow some of the arguments of Deputy Gorey, but I shall refrain and shall pass them merely by saying that I was not attempting to deal with any single industry or any kind of dispute.  I do not want to localise this question in any way.  There are many causes which lead to labour disputes, purely economic sometimes, psychological sometimes, hot weather sometimes; but from a good deal of experience and very close inquiry I am convinced that 75 per cent. as I said last week, of the disputes that arise from year to year, have their primary cause in the sense of insecurity, the fear of unemployment.  Now, if you could remove the greater part of that fear, you would remove a great part of the causes that lead to disputes.  You will not remove them all.  I do not pretend for a moment that you are going to remove all the causes of disputes by removing the fear of unemployment; but you will, I am sure, remove the greater portion, and I believe in doing so you are laying the foundations of that prosperity which the Minister for Education spoke of in an earlier discussion.  We are told many times, and truthfully, that this country requires great development in mechanical appliances.  I believe that is true; but the workmen have resisted the introduction of mechanical appliances. They have resisted it in Ireland as they did in England, Germany, France, and in fact every country in the world.  They will resist it in self-defence unless you can promise some assurance that the introduction <Col N="1460" /> of these appliances is not going to deprive them of a living, and it is not enough to point to the development in those countries which have been most proficient in the use of mechanical appliances.  The workman sees one machine doing ten men's work, and he sees that nine men are going to be deprived of the opportunity of a livelihood.  There should be no need for it.  The introduction of a machine ought, as a matter of fact, ease the labour while insuring the men of a better living; but, unfortunately, what happens now is that the machine deprives him of a living, and there has to be a period of lag before he and his family can retrieve the loss which the machine causes.</P>
    <P>What I desire is that the Dáil should express itself in favour of guaranteeing workmen, who are willing to work, the opportunities for work, or, as an alternative, if we do not so design our economic system, that we should provide them with means of living.  I believe it can be done, and with good-will, by the collaboration of the organisers of industry with the operators in industry.  It is the function of the organisers of industry to direct the courses of industry to provide for the needs of the people; that is their function.</P>
    <P>The profit they make should be incidental, and should not be the objective. I want to see if it is possible to bring these people together and to let them set before themselves the duty of devising means and methods of securing this end, which the Dáil is asked to declare to be a necessary end if there is to be a peaceful development of industry in this country.  The Minister says in his amendment that the words &ldquo;be guaranteed&rdquo; should be deleted, but he is prepared to say that it is an essential condition precedent to the peaceful development of industry and commerce that the workers should have regularity and permanence of employment, and payment for their work at rates sufficient to maintain them and their families in decency and comfort.  He is also willing to say that it is the opinion of the Dáil that the Governments should call into conference representatives of employers and workers' organisations for the purpose of devising the best means and methods of providing such regularity and permanence of employment with satisfactory payment for work done.  If the Dáil prefers the amendment to my motion, I shall think <Col N="1461" /> that the Dáil has done good work, and the passing of such a motion, even as amended, and the putting of it into operation at the instigation of the Minister, may be the means of laying the foundations, at any rate, for a better social life in this country for the next few years.</P>

      <P>I desire quite briefly to support the amendment moved by the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the suggestion that this resolution should be adopted with a substitution of the word &ldquo;have&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;be guaranteed.&rdquo;  I do not think that Deputy Johnson has put forward anything that is idealistic.  I think that the sentiments he expresses, in a very large measure are sentiments that would be supported in many parts of this Dáil.  I agree that the ideal expressed in the resolution, as amended by the Minister, is an ideal, in his own words, which can be realised.</P>
      <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the chair at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that it should be realised, there are certain elements that, I think, would require more stressing.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that the idealistic quality of a man's mind is necessary. There are many conceptions necessary, but there is one that is absolutely essential, and it is that of the efficient conduct of business in this country.  The resolution, as it was originally, proposed that the workmen should be guaranteed regularity and permanence of employment.  It is impossible to guarantee regularity and permanence of employment.  There are elements in the calculation that may make it utterly impossible.  Let me give two instances that I speak of with a certain degree of knowledge, in one case having made investigations and in the other case it was a matter that came before me in another connection.  Take the dairy industry in Ireland.  Are the workers engaged in the dairy industry to be guaranteed regularity and permanence of employment and payment for work at rates sufficient to maintain them and their families in decency and comfort? That they should have it is one thing, but can they be so guaranteed? That means, if the guarantee is to be forthcoming, that the industry must be <Col N="1462" /> conducted efficiently.  Is it being conducted efficiently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known, and Deputy Johnson will know it from the results of the inquiries that he conducted on a Commission on which both he and I served together, and from the inquiries of a Commission that he now belongs to, that I am stating what is the truth when I say that of the dairy cattle in this country you might safely take it that between one-half and two-thirds are losing for every day they are being kept.  In other words, through lack of proper method of conducting that industry, that industry is not maintaining itself on an economic basis.  If the industry is not maintaining itself on an economic basis, through whatever fault, how can it be argued that workmen or anybody in that industry can be guaranteed things that industry cannot give, because it is not being conducted properly?  Take another case. A friend of mine to whom I was speaking a fortnight ago is the owner of a very large factory in Dublin.  He employs a large number of hands.  What salaries they get I do not know.  I did ask him if he could let me have a certain piece of information that it was necessary for me to procure in connection with certain other inquiries.  He makes a certain machine, and I wanted to know what the cost of manufacturing that machine was at a certain stage of its manufacture.  I was astounded and astonished, for he answered me that he kept no costings at all in his manufacture.  He is a large manufacturer, employing a very great number of hands turning out a large number of machines every year, and he could not state what the cost at each stage was, or what the proportion of labour was in the finished product!  He made a guess that inasmuch as he drew certain moneys from month to month for himself, and inasmuch as the actual profits were always sufficient to cover that, that his factory was yielding him a sufficient and handsome profit, and all further inquiries and costings methods were unnecessary. But the situation might at any moment change for him.  If it did change for him he would not be able to track where in his process his business had failed.  He would not be able to effect the economies that were necessary. Surely, it is obvious as a matter of common sense that any business that is being conducted in that way cannot be held to guarantee to any persons employed <Col N="1463" /> in it, either workmen or employers, a sufficient wage to keep them in decency and comfort.  They should have it, but they cannot be guaranteed it. It is a remarkable fact that the two most prosperous industries in Ireland&mdash;two of the industries that are paying the kind of wages that are required or stipulated for in this resolution&mdash;are the two that are being conducted on a proper system of costings from beginning to end.  I do think that Deputy Johnson has served a practical purpose in bringing this resolution forward, if only to draw attention to this very element in the working out of the social state that he desires.</P>
    <P>If we care to have that state we will require to have efficient handling of business in Ireland.  The agricultural industry, as well as every other form of industry, should be conducted in a modern scientific fashion, as is done elsewhere. Then it might be time to speak of guarantee.  It is certainly impossible to speak of a guarantee now.  Deputy Johnson said that the ideal expressed in the Resolution either in its original or amended form, is one that can be realised. I have stated that I believe it can be realised.  If it is to be realised, not only must there be a certain aspiration of mind, but there must also be a certain ruthless efficiency of method, and that is not everywhere apparent.  While it is not apparent, and while the machinery is not available in order that you might be able to estimate exactly how every given industry stands at a given moment, as can be done in large undertakings in other countries, we can go no further than the Resolution, as amended by the amendment put forward by the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce. I feel, therefore, that the amendment is necessary if the Resolution is to be made practicable.  When I use the word practicable I do not use it in the sense that Deputy Johnson spoke of the use of that word, when he quoted Gradgrind.  I am using it in another sense altogether.  If life is to be properly conducted it must be efficiently conducted. Nothing that is inefficient can be said to be practicable.  It is because an impossible demand was being made in the original form of the Resolution, and because the amendment moved by the Assistant Minister for Industry and Commerce has reduced it down to <Col N="1464" /> what can be adopted, and what may be held up as a possible and practicable ideal, that I will support the amendment, and will support the Resolution in that amended form.</P>

      <P>It is evident that in the industrial community there are strongly held views amongst all parties about questions now brought forward touching wages and conditions of labour. These questions are of first importance to the whole country, and it is always to be deplored that they cannot be settled without stoppage of work.  Sometimes it appears stoppage of work cannot be avoided, but of all times for a stoppage to occur it will be generally agreed that the time when the country is about to terminate an era of disturbance and to elect a new Government is the most unfortunate. We are at present suffering from a stoppage at the ports, the effect of which on the country's economic position is necessarily serious.  On Friday the Minister for Industry and Commerce will endeavour to find a way out of the deadlock at the Conference between the parties, and I do not think it would be unreasonable for the Dáil to express the view, that the parties should come to that conference as men on whom a great responsibility rests, and who should not leave the Conference without having arrived at such an adjustment between their respective points of view as will recognise the genuine difficulties of both sides and the need for mutual concessions Besides the trouble at the ports there are rumours, in some cases more than rumours, of extensive industrial trouble.  Questions may be involved that are not easily settled, but I would suggest that none of them can be of such extreme urgency as not to permit of a little longer time for their examination. I would suggest that the parties should consider whether a more fitting time to examine them will not present itself, when the period of disturbance we are just passing through has terminated, and when a new Dáil can apply itself to those social questions to which for some time it has not been possible to pay very much attention.</P>
