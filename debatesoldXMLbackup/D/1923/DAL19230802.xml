      <P>asked the President whether any steps have been taken to give effect to the resolution of the Dáil expressing its opinion that an essential condition precedent to the peaceful development of industry is that the workers should have regularity and permanence of employment, and that, for the purpose of devising the best means of providing such regularity of employment the Government should call into conference representatives of employers and workers' organisations.</P>

      <P>The matter is receiving the consideration of the Government, but it is not yet possible to make any definite announcement on the matter. The question of the personnel of any conference summoned to go into this matter will require very careful consideration to ensure its being thoroughly representative. If the Deputy would have any suggestions to make on this particular matter I would be very glad to receive them; or, preferably, to have a conference with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether the Registrar-General has issued an order transferring all records of births, marriages, and deaths from Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, to Cavan town; whether he is aware that such a transfer will entail enormous trouble, expense, and delay to all in Bawnboy who require certificates of age, etc.; whether such an order has <Col N="1794" /> been carried out in other counties, and, if so, which counties; whether the Registrar-General consulted with the Local Government Minister and the Law Officers of the Government before making this change, and whether any communication concerning it passed between the Local Government Department and the Cavan County Board of Health prior to the issuing of the order; further, whether the Cavan County Council, the County Board of Health, and all local authorities in Cavan are against the proposal, and if the Registrar-General can show any reason, either from an economic or other point of view, justifying the change.</P>

      <P>On the directions of the Registrar-General, who is an officer of this Ministry, the registration records have been transferred from Bawnboy to the central strong room at Cavan. This transfer will not involve any serious trouble, expense, or delay to parties in Bawnboy requiring certificates of age Similar transfers have been carried out in Counties Kildare, Kilkenny, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, and Wicklow, and will be effected in the remaining counties according to the progress of amalgamation schemes under the several Boards of Health.  This change was made in connection with the County Cavan amalgamation schemes with my authority and full weight was given to all legal considerations. It was not necessary to communicate with the County Cavan Board of Health prior to the issue of the directions, but protests against the proposal were received from the Superitendent Registrar at Bawnboy.  I have no information in regard to the views of the local authorities in Cavan on the matter, but the Deputy may feel assured that the centralisation of the records in each county under the control of an officer of the County Board of Health, will make for safety and substantial economy in administration, while no serious inconvenience will be entailed.</P>

      <P>Five of the railway companies have submitted a provisional scheme of amalgamation.

      <P>I beg to move an amendment in Sub-section (2) of Section 3, on line 2, to insert before the word &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; the word &ldquo;high.&rdquo; As the sub-section stands there is nothing to compel an Executive Minister who appoints a Board of Commissioners to appoint to it judges of the highest status.  The section, as a whole, is a fulfilment of the promise made some time ago by the Minister for Home Affairs on one of the stages of the Public Safety Bill, that the Ministry would appoint a Court to review and, if necessary, to revise the sentences passed by military courts.  In south Africa, when a similar Court was set up, the decision there was that the Court should consist of three Judges of the Supreme Court. I think all the argument is in favour of the appointment of the highest judicial officers that are available in the Saorstát. The duty of the Board of Commissioners will involve many legal and other questions, and I think it would be much better if the members of the Board were the highest judicial officers in the land.  Indeed, it would be well, I think, though it is perhaps outside the scope of the amendment, if there were three Judges instead of two, because with two there may be differences of opinion, and in that case I do not know what would happen.  I formally move the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment is put down which has a very vague meaning. Very few reasons are given for it, and no case is made out for its acceptance. I have asked a simple question. I am a plain man, as the Deputy knows, and I am entitled to know whether or not that is the intention or the meaning of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathalOShannon" hpid="CATHAL O'SHANNON CATHAL O'SHANNON">
      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is not to name any judicial officers at all.  It is a mat ter of indifference to me who they are in personnel, but their judicial standing is a matter of very great concern, and the reputation and the experience of judicial officers is a matter of very great concern. Now, as the President admitted yesterday evening, the sentences imposed by the Courts mentioned in the Bill were imposed by men acting under great difficulties; they must have been imposed in many cases by men who had little or no legal experience.  The intention of the amendment is that in the review of these sentences, if the review is to be a genuine one, and if it is to be not merely a simple reconsideration of the case, but a review conducted in times of peace, it should, I submit, be conducted by the most competent people whose services the State can call upon.  If the President thinks that the amendment as I put it is too indefinite, I shall ask him if he will accept an alternative amendment that the members of this Court shall be Judges of the High Court of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As the sub-section stands, the Court to be established, or the Commissioners who may be established under this, which is virtually a Court of Appeal, may be persons who hold or have held any judicial office, even the most minor.  The office of Peace Commissioner would, I suppose, hardly be held to be a judicial office, but the office of a District Justice would certainly be held to be a judicial office under this section.  A District Justice may be a man who may not have had very much experience as a Judge, though he may have had a good <Col N="1799" /> deal of experience at the Bar or as a solicitor. But what is required, in my view, is judicial experience, and it is surely not an extravagant request that the persons who are to be appointed as Commissioners should have that judicial experience. They will hear appeals from the Committee of which one had to be a lawyer, and it is not, I suggest, too much to ask that that Court of Appeal should be composed of men who have held high judicial office, not merely judicial office, because of the fact that they had been appointed District Justices and had no experience beyond the last two or three months. Surely the President is not going to say that that is an extravagant or an unreasonable amendment to propose.  The term &ldquo;judicial office&rdquo; would cover the veriest novice.  This Court of Appeal will have imposed upon it the duty of trying cases, and these are alleged to be criminal cases.  It is not asking too much that the Court of Appeal, which in effect this Court will be, should be composed of men who have had considerable experience in the trying of cases.</P>

I merely say now that I fail to understand how any human being can object to this particular amendment if this review performance is intended to be serious.</P>

      <P>The President's earlier observation shows something that we have observed from time to time on the Ministerial side, and that is that there is a profound distrust of the High Courts in this country.  I have not moved, though I might well have moved, that the appointment of these Commissioners might be taken out of the hands of a member of the Executive Council, but I did not move that.  I have moved that the Executive member, in appointing Commissioners, should appoint Commissioners of a certain judicial standing, and it is not either the mover of the amendment or the supporter of it who is asking to be allowed to nominate these officials, but the Ministry is asking that an Executive member should make the nomination.  I want to see that the officials nominated will be the most competent people who can be got.</P>

      <P>The next amendment on the paper has been altered to read: &ldquo;In Section 3, Sub-section (3), after the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including power to compel the attendance of and to examine any person whom the Board of Commissioners may desire to give evidence).&rdquo;  I think we will take that as a separate matter from the question of inserting the word &ldquo;annul.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I formally move the amendment.  The sub-section enables the Board of Commissioners to be set up under the Act to review, and at such review to confirm or to reduce, but not to increase, a sentence of penal servitude or imprisonment imposed by one of the Courts.  Remarkably enough, it omits to enable the Commissioners to annul or to reverse a decision of one of these Courts.  I do not know whether the Minister will claim anything like infallibility for the Courts that have been operating for the last nine or ten months. I do not think he will.  The Courts and the officers comprising the Courts have had a very difficult job indeed.  Their work has now to be reviewed by the Commissioners, and if they have made mistakes in the length of sentence, the Commissioners will have power to reduce that sentence.  If, in the judgment of the Commissioners, they have not made a mistake in a particular case, the Commissioners will have power to confirm the sentence, but if the Commission comes to the conclusion that, as a matter of fact, a prisoner found guilty and sentenced was not in fact guilty, the utmost the Commissioners can do, according to the sub-section, is to reduce that sentence.</P>

      <P>The Courts that have been operating have been sitting in secret.  In many cases, with the exception of military witnesses, if there were such, there have been no witnesses called.  The Commissioners now set up, so far as the sub-section goes, do not seem to have the power to call witnesses, not even to call military witnesses.  It <Col N="1802" /> seems to me that the powers given to them by the Court will be very illusory if they have not the ordinary rights of Courts.  It may be that the intention of the Minister is not to make them Courts in the proper sense of the word at all, but to be merely advisory bodies, such as the bodies set up under the previous Act. Their appointment will merely be a sham if they are not in every sense of the word Courts.  If they are Courts, they ought to have the power to call witnesses, whether military witnesses or civilian witnesses, when they are reviewing any particular case, and they ought to have the power to compel the attendance of those witnesses and to examine those witnesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeGDuffy" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>All the sentences passed by these military tribunals have been, as I understand, submitted to the Judge Advocate-General or some other military or quasi-legal official, and have been passed by that dignitary. Therefore, if the present clause is merely intended to provide that some other dignitaries ought to do precisely the same work which the Judge Advocate-General has already done, the section is nothing but a vote of censure upon that dignitary. As we cannot assume that the Government desire to pass such a vote of censure, their intention must be to allow &mdash;if they are consistent&mdash;a proper review of these cases.  Now, merely to read a document sent up from a Court-martial as a record of proceedings is not a review in any true sense of the word.  It is quite obvious that if it is seriously intended&mdash;as it should be seriously intended&mdash;to have the cases gone through by a competent legal authority, that authority must have power to call witnesses before it.  I would ask the Dáil to remember that it frequently happened &mdash;and we all know it frequently happened&mdash;that owing to the circumstances under which these trials were held the accused were unable to get the witnesses whom they would have called had the circumstances been different.  They were unable in many cases to put the case and prove the case which otherwise might have been proved.  I have not the actual text of the amendment before me, but I would like to suggest to the mover that he should agree to the insertion of two words, &ldquo;on oath,&rdquo; in the proper place, dealing with the giving of <Col N="1803" /> evidence.  It is obvious that to ask people to give evidence otherwise than on oath is worse than useless; so much so that in the British Army code, when they are dealing with such a simple and informal matter as the summary of evidence that is taken at the preliminary inquiry before a Court-martial, the accused can insist on having the evidence given if he wishes to do so, on oath.  I think the mover of this amendment would <Col N="1804" /> be well advised to agree that the words &ldquo;on oath&rdquo; should go in in the proper place, as it is not worth while giving these officials power to review anything if the evidence is to be given otherwise than upon oath.</P>

      <P>I formally move the amendment.  The case has already been stated by me.  So far as I can see, the sub-section does not enable the Commissioners to annul a sentence passed on a prisoner, even if the Commissioners are of opinion that such sentence should not have been passed&mdash;that, as a matter of fact, the particular prisoner was not guilty of the offence for which he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a period of either penal servitude or imprisonment.  I think it is necessary that this power should be given to the Commissioners, otherwise their job is very largely a sham.</P>

      <P>I was in some hopes that the President would tell us that his draftsman was responsible for the oversight whereby these Boards are not given power to do what they consider to be justice when they have re-examined a case.  That hope is diminishing as I see the President's reluctance to meet the amendment, and I fear that we shall be told that it is seriously proposed to put up Boards which will be asked anew to go through the cases, and will be told that, having done so, they have no power whatever to let out people who are wrongfully imprisoned.  Words fail one to criticise that kind of thing.</P>

To put up Boards&mdash;the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo; is carefully not used for fear that the Courts would have to be public under the Constitution&mdash;which will pretend to review cases, and, when they find an innocent man is in prison, will have no power to let him out or annul the wrongful proceedings, is nothing less than a scandal</P>

      <P>Apparently the Minister is accepting this amendment, inasmuch as he has not deigned it worth his while to say one word in opposition to it, or any other member of the Government or supporter of the Government.  There has been talk of setting up of a Court of Criminal Appeal.  Whether one exists at present or not I am not sure, but apparently the judgment of the Ministry is that the Courts set up by the military authorities were so perfect in their judgments that they cannot make a mistake respecting the guilt of a person.  They might make a mistake respecting the amount of a sentence, but they cannot make a mistake respecting the guilt.  It is very pleasant, I am sure, to the Ministry to be able to think that their work, having looked upon it, could be pronounced so good as not to require any qualms as to the perfect lucidity and sound judgment of the several military courts, with whose composition we are not very well acquainted.  It would be only fair to those men and to the public to know the names of those perfect judges of those very perfect tribunals, who cannot make a mistake, and whose judgments cannot be varied, but whose sentences may be.  This is an Indemnity Bill, and the proposition is not only to indemnify the courts or tribunals, or the persons constituting those tribunals, but to say that they were perfect in their judgments, and that no Court of Appeal or Board of Commissioners established to review a sentence could possibly determine that a judgment was against the weight of evidence, or that the prisoner should not have been convicted.  All that they can say is that the judgment was sound, but that the sentence was too <Col N="1806" /> severe.  One would like, if possible, to understand or get some idea from the Minister as to what explanation could be given of his refusal to allow the Board of Commissioners to annul the sentence. Perhaps the Minister is doubtful of the wisdom of this Bill at all; perhaps he has no confidence in these Courts, and is pushing forward this Bill against his will and better judgment, because he is compelled to do so, and perhaps he dare not express his views about the amendment for fear he might state his own views. I wonder if that is the explanation of his silence on this amendment?  Surely a Court of this kind, that has power to review sentences, and to be composed of persons holding, or who have held, judicial office, are not to be restricted to saying &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to a secret military court or tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can better understand now why the Minister refuses to certify or ensure that these Commissioners should be men who held high judicial office.  He knows any person having held high judicial office would be less liable to accept a position which would only allow him to reduce a sentence, and would carefully confine him to reduction of sentences or confirming of sentences, but would not allow such a judicial person to say that the judgment of the Court was a bad one.  That explains the attitude of the Minister in regard to the persons who may be appointed to this Board of Commissioners. They must be people who cannot decide that the judgment of the secret tribunal was an unsound one, and they must be of a character which will confirm the judgment of those earlier Courts, and confine their reviewing to whether the sentences were excessive or not.  We will be able to form a judgment of the character of the men who will form these Boards of Commissioners under these circumstances.  They will certainly not enhance their reputations if they accept office under these extraordinary conditions, that they as a Board of Commissioners who have held judicial offices, may review sentences, and may reduce sentences, but they may not say that the sentences of the Court were invalid.  It certainly is an extraordinary state of mind to be revealed.  I have no doubt the Minister does not really believe in this clause, but he has been obliged to <Col N="1807" /> put it forward, and dare not justify it for fear he might be tempted to reveal his own mind.</P>

      <P>If it does not, it will not be your fault, I am sure of that. I wonder if Deputies take the pains to read these Bills, or do Deputies really consider their position seriously at all? Was the Deputy who has just spoken here yesterday evening or not?  Perhaps he had a more important engagement, and perhaps he only comes in here to amuse himself.  If I were gifted with the same amount of verbosity as the Deputy I would not confine myself to the words in the section, but I think the Deputy has not read it carefully.  He has certainly not studied it, but he is contenting himself with rhetoric and with firing incense at himself, and when he had too much for himself he distributed some of it to the benches opposite.  What is meant by reviewing or reducing sentences?  Cannot one reduce a sentence of five years, of <Col N="1808" /> which six months has run, by four years and six months, or must we put into a Bill an interminable list of words in order that Deputies would have an opportunity of airing their views.  Last evening we spent two and a half hours on this Bill. I entered into a very long and very careful explanation of its provisions, but that was all useless, because Deputies had not read it and were not interested enough in it.  There are two orders in the community so far as I can see which appeal to the Deputies opposite, themselves and the Irregulars.  They will deny that, but they are endeavouring here to secure, as far as possible, and as far as their ability suggests, means of escape for these men. They hold up to ridicule the courts that have been established, or the tribunals that have been established, by the resolutions of this Dáil.  In a sentence, they discount and they discredit, and they show their lack of confidence in the Army, and Deputy Gavan Duffy joins and assists them in that.  We are asked, when we say that these tribunals have done their work well, to say if they are infallible.  They are not infallible, and I have never claimed infallibility for them, but I do claim honesty for them, and I claim as much honesty for them as there is in this House, or as there is on the far benches amongst the minority in this House.  I claim that they have done their work well, because I know of some cases in which guilty persons came before them, and because certain technicalities had been neglected, these persons were found &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo;  The Deputy says I have not much faith in this Bill. I have a lot more faith in it than he has. I have read it, and studied it carefully, and I believe everything that I have said about it, which is a good deal more than I would be in a position to say for those who have spoken against it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment No. 3:&mdash;To add to Sub-section (4) of Section 3, the words, &ldquo;provided that such rules shall not prevent such Board of Commissioners from holding any of its sittings in public, and that nothing in this Act shall permit such Board to sit and hear in secret such case for review.</P>
      <P>The proviso that I desire to insert provides that such rules as are made shall not prevent the Board of Commissioners from holding any sittings in public, and that nothing in this Act shall permit such a Board to hear in secret such cases for review.</P>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is to secure that the sittings of these Commissioners shall be, at all events, not in secret, and that in that respect, at least, their proceedings shall be brought into conformity with the Constitution.  As the section stands, it is quite open to the Minister, when making the rules bearing on the Board of Commissioners, to provide that the Commission sit <i>in camera:</i> that, in fact, its procedure in that respect should just be the same as the procedure of the military courts whose decisions it is bringing under review.  The amendment would prevent a Minister from allowing or compelling Commissioners to sit in secret, and would not allow the Commissioners themselves to decide to sit in secret.  A good deal could be said on the Boards as such, but if they are to be merely secret then they are even a greater sham than they have appeared on the face of it to be.  I move the proviso.</P>

      <P>Is it possible that this amendment also fails to meet with the approval of the President?  I recall the Dáil in its ironical mood, somewhere about last October, solemnly pretending to pass in this Assembly a Constitutional Article which said justice&mdash;justice mark you&mdash;shall be administered in the Public Courts established by the Oireachtas.  I suppose it would be letting the cat out of the bag to point out that the reason why these Boards are called Boards is that it is hoped to wriggle out of that Article of the Constitution.  If they were called Courts they would have to sit in public.  We will call them Boards.  We will give them no power except a nominal power, that is worth nothing, and then, perhaps, the Courts will say they are not <Col N="1811" /> Courts at all and may sit <i>in camera.</i>  If the President is so proud, as he says he is, of the work of the Tribunals in question&mdash; for aught I know he may have excellent reason to be proud of it, but none of us know if he is as proud as he says&mdash;he ought to be delighted to let a little day, light into this whole performance.  The whole proceedings have been in secret. Has the Executive any reason against allowing the review, such as it is, to be published, or the results of the review to be published?  Even one authorised Dublin Pressman was not allowed to attend a trial.  Apparently, no Dublin Pressman may attend the new performance. If the Executive wishes the country to have any confidence in proceedings which were secret originally, they must allow them to be reviewed openly, now that the war is over, now that their own Courts have officially declared that there is not a state of war.  What have they to be afraid of?  They are proud of the magnificient work of these Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are they afraid of the comments or of the decisions of the somewhat knock-kneed Boards that will be allowed to review but not to annul?  What is the reason for this extraordinary inclination to secrecy, which is so prevalent in the Ministerial mind, and which, if Ministers knew their own minds is very much against the interests of the Free State <Col N="1812" /> and of the Executive of the Free State. It is quite obvious to anybody reading this draft Bill that the document has been expressly and purposely drawn in such a way that the review should be held by a body which cannot be described as a court, and that this is done for the purpose of enabling the Executive, which appoints this Board, to have its further performance in secret likewise.</P>

Incidentally it provides means for reducing sentences.  The argument is that it should not only provide means for reducing sentences, but also provide an inquisition into the character and conduct of the military courts and committees.  It may be desirable to impeach those committees. It may be desirable to review their conduct, but if it is so desirable it is perfectly obvious that the place for bringing forward a proposal of this kind is not in this Bill of Indemnity.</P>

      <P>Well, the object of this Bill was indemnity not in quisition.  I think that that phrase shows a strange confusion of mind in such an eminent Minister as the Minister for Education, for this particular section does two very distinct things.  First of all it validates the courts in order to put right the officers who manned these courts, and I have no quarrel with that. Secondly, it validates what the officers did, for the purpose of justifying sentences which may or may not have been right.  These two things are very distinct. Upon the first, upon providing a legal sanction for the actions of men taken under these difficult circumstances, I am quite at one with the idea underlying the Bill.  One knows that officers have an intense dislike to sit on courts-martial of this kind.  One knows that they do their duty very reluctantly, and that they are only doing their duty.  One knows they often do that duty at great risk, and, therefore, so far as giving them a personal indemnity goes, I have not a word to say against this section.  But the Ministry does not stop there.  Nobody wants an inquisition, to use the word of the Minister for Education, if that means an attack upon the particular men whose duty it was to man these courts-martial. But the Bill, although it is miscalled an Indemnity Bill, contains this most important proviso, the second part of this clause, which asks this Dáil to say that all and everyone of the sentences passed were perfectly right, although the whole thing was done in secret, although the officers, however excellent their intentions, were men unversed in legal matters, unused to sifting evidence, with only one legal person present at the court, and although they were acting at a time of considerable excitement when no man could entirely divorce his feelings from the subject matter of the case.  No <Col N="1814" /> ordinary man could entirely divorce the fact that this conflict was going on from the judgment of a court-martial of that kind.  Therefore, while I have no objection at all to giving any indemnity you like to the men who simply did their duty, I have the strongest objection to registering in an Act of Parliament that these sentences, passed in such circumstances, were necessarily right, that the verdict was right, and the sentence was right, and that all that can be done is to allow the Board appointed by the Executive to look through the documents, without calling witnesses, to see whether or not it might be well to reduce sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is treating the matter seriously.  It seems to me that the very first duty of an Executive which wants to have these sentences reviewed is to come before the Dáil with a Schedule containing all and every sentence passed since these Courts were instituted, to tell us how many there were, who were the men convicted, and what they were convicted for.  There may be life sentences; there may be sentences of ten years penal servitude; we have no assurances, no knowledge, of what it is we are asked to say was necessarily right.  That kind of special pleading that objects to attacks on a section of this kind on the ground that it is an attack on the Army, will not do.  I have no doubt that nine-tenths of these men did their duty to the very utmost of their ability and that there were very few or no abuses, but they were not men qualified for this kind of work, and they were acting in times of great difficulty.  Therefore, the proper course to have adopted was surely to have appointed a legal tribunal which would be a court in the true sense of the word, and which would be manned by people accustomed to weighing evidence, to examine all the evidence in these cases, and also to bring in a law dealing with the matter, for the Dáil will observe that this Court of Review is given no indication whatever as to the basis on which it is to proceed, what code it is going to administer.  It is not told what code it is to administer. There is, of course, no legal code.  There ought to have been.  There is only that very vague Resolution of the Provisional Parliament, which is not law.  Instead of bringing in an Act on the analogy of the Botha Act, the Ministry apparently proposes to leave the matter at that&mdash;that <Col N="1815" /> we intend to appoint men to only look through the whole proceedings, and it will be quite enough to say that such and such a sentence should be reduced.  It is not treating the country fairly.  The country is entitled to know that these sentences, particularly if they are to be carried out, as the Public Safety Bill provides, are beyond all possibility of question; that they have been investigated by people accustomed to administering the law, and investigated on the basis of a law of this country.  A special law may be necessary. Very well, introduce it, but to ask courts or boards with no real power, secretly to investigate these secret performances and tell them that all they may do is to review sentences and give a little less, or a good deal less, is not treating the country as the country is entitled to say that it should be treated.  It is not only sentences, but judgments and orders passed by these courts, which we are asked to validate, completely in the dark, and if Deputies turn to the second part of the section they will see that in the reviewing sub-section you are dealing with men who, if they defended themselves at all, were defending themselves under circumstances of considerable difficulty.  It is no use saying that 99 per cent. of them are guilty.  They may be. Those who are not are entitled to a fair show.  I do not think that anybody with any experience of law would say that they are sure to get justice under the scheme proposed now, by merely allowing the sentences to be examined with a view to reduction.  The whole proceedings from beginning to end ought to be examined by competent people.  I ask that in the interests of justice in this country, and in the interests of settled conditions, as long as you have people smarting under a sense of injustice you are not going to have settled conditions, and I do not think it is fair to ask the Dáil, because the present Government happens to have a large majority, to pass a law in the dark stating that everything that is being done in the way of sentences is quite right, except that the Board may possibly reduce the sentences.  It is not treating the matter seriously, and it is too grave a matter to be treated in this way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy three or four times in the course of his address asked the Dáil to believe that the object of this section was to declare that the sentences passed were quite valid and perfectly right.  No one here will accuse the Deputy of stupidity.  The Deputy is a lawyer; he is accustomed to reading legal documents, and he knows as well as anyone knows, that what this section declares is that certain things which have been done are to be validated.  That does not say anything as to whether they were right or wrong.  It declares them to have been valid.  The Deputy knows very well the difference between being valid and being right and wrong, and at the moment of making his speech he knew the difference between the word &ldquo;valid&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;perfectly right.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, he has talked to us about voting down by a majority.  He endeavours to create the impression, either here or wherever else his words go, that this section purports to do something which he knows perfectly well it does not purport to do.  It declares these things to have been valid. He knows perfectly well that it is said to be artificial validity for these cases whether they were in the first instance valid or not valid.  That is the meaning of indemnity.  The Deputy also knows perfectly well that indemnification of that kind is a usual thing following the state of suspended law and military action, such as this particular measure is dealing with.</P>

      <P>That the object of this was to declare that the sentences passed were perfectly right.  It simply makes them valid, valid for a particular purpose, that is, so valid that the persons who were engaged in holding these tribunals cannot be impeached for what they have done.  But if they cannot be impeached in one way they are to be impeached in another way.  They are to be indemnified.  The Bill is declaring their actions valid, and provides indemnity, but, nevertheless, it is to hold an inquisition, and that was distinctly <Col N="1817" /> demanded in the last statement of the Deputy, though disclaimed in his previous one&mdash;that is an inquisition into the character and conduct of these tribunals. That is not the object of the Bill.  As I said before, if it is desirable to review the actions of the various military tribunals, and to set up a court of inquisition for that purpose, a measure should be produced for that purpose, and the thing should not be done under the cover of this measure of validation and indemnity.</P>

      <P>I remain absolutely unrepentant.  The special pleading of the Minister who has just sat down, in his last statement has gone beyond anything I have heard for a long time in the Dáil.  He says that the object of this Bill is to give an artificial validity to the sentences.  I thank him for the phrase, &ldquo;artificial validity of the sentences.&rdquo; What I said was we were asked to declare these sentences perfectly right, subject to the provision of the Board reviewing them.  No arguments or misuse of words can alter the fact that the effect of this Act, taken with the Public Safety Act, in which it was declared that sentences were to be served until they expired or were discharged, the effect of which, coupled with this very limited and inadequate power of review, means that men will continue in prison whether they are rightly sentenced or not unless this Board, looking at their papers, chooses to think that their sentences ought to be reduced.  Therefore, it is true to say, that we are asked to give approval of sentences of which we know nothing.  If not, I think the Minister rather makes the case worse by talking about artificial validity, or sentences that are not deemed right, are to be deemed valid.  If that is of any use to the Minister I make him a present of it.</P>

      <P>If I understand this argument, it is that the courts we set up are to be validated, every sentence is deemed to have been valid and within the lawful jurisdiction of the tribunal.  So far, so good.  The Minister says that this is not intended to be anything more than a validation Bill, an indemnity Bill, validating the actions of these courts. There is to be a Board of Commissioners to review these valid sentences, sentences <Col N="1818" /> which may not have been right, or just, or well-founded, but were within the jurisdiction of the courts.  But the Board of Commissioners which may review the sentences may not review the verdict of these valid courts.  They were considered to have been within the jurisdiction of the military courts, and though they may have been wrong, ill-founded, against the weight of evidence, and entirely beyond the judgment of trained judges, nevertheless they are to be not only valid, but the verdict is to be confirmed so far as this Bill is concerned. The Minister says you may introduce another Bill to give power to a court to annul the sentences, but the Ministry does not care about annulling sentences.  They say that these courts that they set up were courts of sound judgment, infallible judgment, as a matter of fact.</P>

      <P>May I explain? On no occasion has any member of the Ministry made statements that the courts were infallible.  Never at any time, in my recollection, have they done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No; no member of the Ministry has made that statement, but that is the only inference from the production of this Bill at the end of a session, at the end of a Parliament, at the end of the responsibility so far as legislation is concerned, of the Ministry. They say, &ldquo;under our initiative we set up courts, and these courts formed judgment as to the guilt or innocence of a prisoner.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Courts that sentenced prisoners were not legal Courts but it was essential that they should be given powers, and that their powers should be validated afterwards.  The Ministry produced an Indemnity Bill and a Bill for validating these Courts, but it has not introduced a Bill which would provide a Court of Appeal.  The omission in this Bill speaks as loudly as the things in it.  The Minister refuses to allow the word &ldquo;annul&rdquo; to be inserted, so that the Commissioners must not be allowed to annul sentences.  They must say that the verdicts of these secret Courts are valid.  These secret Courts must be considered to be infallible in their <Col N="1819" /> findings, though they may be fallible in their sentences, and we are not going to introduce a Bill which gives the power of appeal.  That means that men may have been sentenced against the weight of evidence, and even without evidence, and that an innocent man is confirmed in his guilt by these Commissioners.  He must be considered guilty because he was sentenced.  There may be a review of the sentence; the sentence may be confirmed or reduced, but there is no power given in this Bill, and the Minister refuses to add to the powers of the Court of Commissioners, to say that the verdict is against the evidence and that the man was wrongly convicted.  I say that is by inference undeniable, an assertion or a plea, that the courts were infallible in their judgment, whatever they may have been regarding the sentences inflicted.  I think the Minister is grievously at fault in not having made provision for the retrial if that were necessary, of those people who were convicted by these secret courts.  Validate the Courts if you like. Indemnify the officers and the judges in these courts and tribunals for any act they committed by the authority of the Dáil but do not assert, or let it be thought that by your refusal to allow an appeal to a public court you believe in the infallibility in these tribunals you set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <P>Listening to the two speeches that we have just heard, I was reminded very much of Mr. De Valera's mental acrobatics at the time when he was somersaulting in and out of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It reminded me of the entertainment produced here in Dublin&mdash;I think it was the pantomime of Cinderella&mdash;some years ago in which there were two ugly aunts or sisters, I forget which, of Cinderella. They were refused admittance into the ballroom by the old footman, and the Prince seeing them, came forward and introduced them, and they pirouetted, saying, &ldquo;Now we are in, now we are out, and now we are neither in or out,&rdquo; with one foot on one side of the door, and the other on the other side.  The Bill is, as the Minister for Education says, an Act of Indemnity.  The Deputy who was there yesterday evening, and the Deputy who was not, are mixing up two Clauses, 1 and 3, of the Bill together.  Yesterday we <Col N="1820" /> validated the sentences.  They were declared valid.  It is no compliment for us to do that.  The officers concerned are under no obligation to us for having given them that indemnity.  You asked them to do certain work, you provided they should do it, and put them on certain Committees.  They have done that work, and the very least you can do is to give them that indemnity.  How can you give them that indemnity?  You must validate the sentences of their courts and the Committees.  I have no hesitation in saying there was no miscarriage of justice as regards finding the men guilty on the evidence.  I am not claiming infallibility for these courts, or saying that there may not have been mistakes, although I doubt it very greatly, and I believe the Deputy knows in his heart that that is so.</P>

      <P>For the last six, seven or eight months every possible criticism that could be passed upon these officers has been passed.  There are two points on which objection has been raised.  One is the terminology of this Act, and its various clauses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And the keeping of the sentences secret?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; and the Deputy knows the reason why.  It was in the interest of the lives of the officers that these things were kept secret, and now all this tomfoolery about having open courts in which people want to pose as champions of liberty is all very well for a headline; but it was not that that secured us our liberty in this country.  It was these men who, without any guarantee from us did their duty, and it is now our duty to see that their sentences are validated, and that they get bare justice&mdash;nothing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing is easier in the world than to say that because the court was secret the sentences were wrong and unjust.  It has been the sport of political platforms in this country for generations to say the Executive Government or authority whatever it is, is wrong, unjust, unfeeling, unsympathetic and cruel.  I have already said here in this Dáil that I know of at least one case, and I am sure I have heard of several others, but I have one <Col N="1821" /> prominently before my mind, in which a man guilty of murder was acquitted by one of these courts, because a mere technicality of the law was not complied with in connection with the prosecution. Deputies think when they come here and pour out their rhetoric that they alone are the guardians of the liberty in this country.  You had officers who knew full well what they were doing in a case like that, and knew that they would be perfectly justified in finding that man guilty, but they emphasised their honour once a case of that kind was put before them just as a High Court judge might do in very difficult times, and in a manner that even a High Court judge might not do. I think it is an abuse of the rules of this Dáil that Deputy Gavan Duffy who had not time to come here yesterday when we were dealing with the section on the validation of sentences should come here and on another section show his form because he has been up against the Indemnity Act by raising questions on it.  I think that not a scintilla of a case has been put up against the Indemnity Bill in the form in which it is submitted to the Dáil.  I put it that it is to the honour of every man in the Dáil, whether he voted for it or not, but being a member of the Dáil, he was responsible for its passing, should now take responsibility for the action of these officers who carried out the duty when they had no guarantee except their sense of public duty to guide them&mdash;I say it is due to these officers that they should get the validation asked for here.  It is another question altogether and apart from this whether the sentences should be reviewed, but the validation is a matter upon the honour of the Dáil, and the Dáil has no option but to grant what is asked for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's logic is peculiar and wonderful.  He quotes an instance of a court which, because of a technicality, refused to find guilty a person who was obviously guilty of murder.  The court which he speaks of was strict in the observance of its duty, and strict to the point of stretching the law in favour of the prisoner.  I am prepared to admit that that defence of the court will apply to every other court which was set up under this Act, and I am prepared to admit that every court acted in every case in the most honourable way possible.  I am prepared to <Col N="1822" /> admit that, in the absence of proof to the contrary.  But that does not for the moment affect the question that is at issue.  We are not now considering the honour, the trustworthiness, the good faith of the officers who constituted these courts.  You are not doubting the validity of the courts when you allow the prisoner the right of appeal to the High Court; you are not denying the validity of the lower courts when you allow an appeal to a higher court.  You are not holding up the judges of the lower court to opprobrium simply because you say they may have been mistaken in their judgment, and you are not merely asking the higher court to review the sentence on a prisoner when you give him the right to appeal; you are throwing no slur on the lower courts because you doubt their wisdom and declare that they may have been fallible.  The Minister's passion is quite uncalled for.  He refuses to concede the suggestion that these courts may have been misguided or unwise in their verdicts; he refuses to admit that they could have been wrong and suggests to us the reason, and the reason is, because the courts were secret.  He says we are to infer from that that the sentences were just.  We say that we have no right to assume that because the courts were secret the sentences were just; we have no right to assume that because the courts had his confidence, and because they were set up by the Executive Council, their judgments were always wise, and their verdicts could never be upset by Superior Courts.  That is the contention of the President, and he tried to hide that up by charging us with denying the uprightness, the straightforwardness or the honour of the officials who constituted the courts.  The position the President is taking up is this: &ldquo;we set up these courts; we were satisfied with the men who formed them, and, therefore, they could not make a mistake.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is always edifying to see the President waving flags of distress, waving them wildly as he has just now being doing, and waving flags that we all have seen so often in this Dáil. He said, for instance, that I made an attack upon these unfortunate officers; whereas, in fact, I went out of my way to pay a tribute to men who had the doing of unpleasant duties.  But one expects these things.  Three times the President, in the typical way that he can meet an argument, asserted that I was not here yesterday.  The President might have taken the trouble to acquaint himself with the facts.  The Speaker knew that I had a more important engagement than attending upon the President rushing Bills through this House, and that I was unable to be here yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> I can assure him that it was not through lack of interest in the subject matter of this particular performance. The President talked of people pouring forth torrents of rhetoric.  That was rather good from the President.  He should know what a torrent of rhetoric is.  But when the President is not engaged in making election addresses to the Dáil he sometimes recollects his better feelings.  There is one little matter in this section to which I desire to direct his attention, in the hope that, before this Bill finally becomes law, he may see that it is adding another injustice to the Bill by making it compulsory upon prisoners to apply to this Review Board. It is quite natural that men in their circumstances will be very reluctant to go before these Boards and quite natural that they should not have much confidence in these Boards, in view of the kind of Board that is set up here.  Even if that were not the case I put it to the Dáil that it is obvious that the sentences, at least, from the President's own point of view, to say nothing about the verdict, should be re-examined, every one of them automatically and independently of whether the prisoner asks for re-examination or not.  No man can honestly tell this Dáil that the sentences passed under the circumstances under which those sentences were passed are necessarily right.  I think the President in his better moments would realise that it is only justice to have these matters reviewed, whether or not the review be specifically asked for by the individual concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between Deputy Johnson and myself on this question. Deputy Johnson wishes to give a sort of half whitewashing certificate of indemnity to those officers.  I will have none of that, as far as I am concerned, and the Dáil will not have it.  You have got either to stand over what these men have done or not to stand over it.  You had no right to ask them to do those things unless you were prepared to back them.  The only way you can back them is to say that the sentences of those courts were valid.  The Deputy does not consider this necessary. A consideration that the comfort or perhaps the discomfort under which certain persons are suffering is a matter of the first importance with him.  We differ there.  The first consideration is for <Col N="1825" /> the people who were responsible for this Dáil setting up those courts.</P>

When he was in the Executive Council he was always putting up one.  I am sure when you get into the habit of that it is hard to get away from it.  As far as those people having an objection to applying to these Boards, I am not going to facilitate people like these to live in this country, and always to be in the position of saying we are acting consistently.  I am not going to afford them any facility for doing that.  If they do not accept citizenship the sea is before them, and they can get out.  If they do not get out and if they dispute the rights of the rest of us to have citizenship here they will go under, and they will go under rapidly.  There is no use in telling us they will not accept our Board.  They have accepted what they call the British courts; they were there yesterday, they were there to-day, and they will go there to-morrow.

      <P>In view of what has happened to-day, it is quite possible that the persons for whose responsibility we are liable may be affected unless immediate effect is given to this Bill.  I think that is a matter of very, very great importance.  We are told that certain people have declared that the war is over. By reason of that fact, a number of <Col N="1828" /> persons who have trust in us, and who unhesitatingly gave us their support, during a difficult period, now have a natural prescriptive right to look to us to see that they are safeguarded, and that they are held immune for certain acts that have been done during the disturbance.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to move: &ldquo;That the Dáil sit later than 8.30 p.m. to-night,&rdquo; in order to consider a matter of public urgency arising out of a decision of the High Courts to-day.  I propose that at any convenient hour we should adjourn, either for tea or dinner, but it is essential that we should sit late in order to deal with this matter, which is of the first importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a Bill dealing with the Public Safety Act which has just been passed, and of which I will give notice later on.  It appears that it is held that some Resolution should have accompanied the Bill which would bring it into immediate operation, and that is the particular function we intend to perform in passing this Bill tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it within the Order that we should be called upon to sit late to deal with an entirely new matter, of which no notice has been given until now?  Surely that is not the intention of the Orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order is: &ldquo;A motion that Dáil Eireann shall sit later than 8.30 o'clock on any evening may be made without notice not later than 6.30 o'clock p.m. on the same evening.&rdquo;  The Standing Order apparently simply contemplates sitting beyond 8.30 p.m.  There is nothing in the Order about emergency or the nature of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that assumes that it is to deal with business, of which due notice has been given, so that Deputies who may not be present will understand that no new business, perhaps of an entirely foreign character, shall be brought forward.  Surely it is stretching the rights of the President to ask us to <Col N="1831" /> sit late to deal with a matter of which no notice has yet been given.  I submit that it is going entirely outside the spirit of the Standing Orders, whatever the latter may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are times when it may be necessary to go outside the spirit of the Standing Orders, or the spirit of the law as it stands.  No injustice is done to any Deputy who is within the ambit of the circulation of the ordinary newspapers, through the bringing forward of this motion this evening.  This matter that I am going to deal with in the introduction of the Bill of which I will give notice later on, is in the newspapers. It is a matter of the first importance. It is known to every person who reads newspapers, or who sees placards and it will be evident when the business is brought forward that it is of such importance that it would be our duty to bring it forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible, in special circumstances, and after a suspension of the Standing Orders, to consider a matter which is not on the Order Paper.  Should it be necessary to sit late for the consideration of such a matter I take it that under this particular Standing Order a motion can be moved to sit later than 8.30.  No restriction is set down in the Standing Order, and the matter which the President says he desires to take after 8.30 p.m. cannot be taken unless the President gets the leave of the Dáil to take it, in the requisite manner.  From that point of view I think he is precluded from taking up new matter unless he fulfils the requirements of the Standing Orders, but he is not precluded from moving that we sit later than 8.30, because the matter on which he desires to speak is not a matter on the Order Paper.  Otherwise, this Order would be a contradiction of another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know for my own guidance if it would be necessary to indicate the particular business I intend to deal with.  It is for bringing in a Bill which will ensure that the Public Safety Act which has been held by the Courts to be non-operative for seven days, shall become operative, and have the force of law directly this Act is passed.  That is, having regard to <Col N="1832" /> the circumstances, I think, a subject of the first importance, and it is to bring under your notice the urgency of the matter that I move for permission to sit after 8.30 p.m., and, I think it will do during the course of the evening to ask for permission to bring in that Bill rather than to ask it now, a matter that must be decided before 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, not raising objections one way or another, but merely as a matter of procedure and order, arising less under the Standing Orders than the Constitution, I apprehend rightly the difficulty in which the President now finds himself I would like to enquire under Article 47 of the Constitution, which, I understand, is the matter that has created this difficulty, whether or not a resolution would not be sufficient?  I have been studying this article of the Constitution, and I certainly believe a resolution will be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that arises until we actually come to decide what the procedure will be.  I think the matter which Deputy Figgis raised will arise later rather than now. Even for a motion of that kind it may be necessary to sit after 8.30, in which case a motion of this kind would be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the middle of of a discussion on the Indemnity Bill, which is to validate acts done by the Executive in times of emergency, as they thought.  I submit it would be very much more in keeping with the requirements of the case if they took any action that was necessary, bear the responsibility, and then come for an Act of Indemnity when there is time rather than come to the Dáil, and ask the Dáil to legislate, or ask them to pretend to legislate, simply to ratify an order the Minister has already made.  I do not know what the Bill is, or what the necessity is, except in so far as the Minister has now said.  I have not seen the newspapers, and I have not seen the placards, but I know from what the Minister has now stated, because the Ministry has made up their minds to have a rushed election, they are asking us to turn out Bills just as <Col N="1833" /> though out of an automatic machine, and they come along again almost on the last day of the Session and ask us to introduce and pass another Bill. I do not know how many more will be brought forward before the Dissolution. If this matter is of such urgent necessity <Col N="1834" /> that he must keep these prisoners in, do the thing yourself and then take the responsibility.  Coming to the Legislature is only a pretence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move an amendment to sub-section (3) (c) of Section 1, to insert after the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; on line 14, the words &ldquo;or authorised assault.&rdquo;  Paragraph (c) will then read &ldquo;any civil proceedings founded on negligence or authorised assault in respect of damage to person or property or.&rdquo;  The acceptance of this amendment would, I am sure, meet the desires of the Ministry, if we are to judge by their statements in the earlier proceedings on this Bill.  They disavow any act of a malicious kind on the part of any servant of the State, and not only agreed but expressed their desire to bring to justice any person guilty of any such act.  While it is the function of the State to bring to the criminal court any person responsible for criminal acts, there is also the question of the right of the aggrieved person to sue for damages, not only in the case of negligence but for damage due to unauthorised assault, and I am sure the Ministry do not want to validate any act of that kind, or to indemnify any person guilty of any act of that kind.  It is not the desire of the Minister, I am sure or of the Dáil, to relieve of liability any person who claimed to be acting in the interests of the public safety, or for the State, or any person who is guilty of cruelty, the ill-treatment of a prisoner or of violent assault, and who acted entirely on his own responsibility and without authority.  &ldquo;While we must <Col N="1835" /> accept the words of the Minister, when he said the State would be not only willing but eager to bring to justice any offender, there is the further responsibility upon the Dáil, and that is to leave it open for everyone who has suffered from mal-treatment to bring an action in the civil courts against the persons responsible for that mal-treatment, if these persons were acting without authority.  I think that the amendment is one that ought to commend itself to the Dáil, and I accordingly move it.</P>

      <P>Unauthorised assault, I take it, must have some interpretation. An assault must be authorised, and it is open to every officer and to every man and to every citizen to prove that he has been authorised to assault some person in order to escape.  I really cannot see the sense of introducing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment to Section 3.  It is to delete lines 44 to 53 inclusive, and to substitute the following: &ldquo;Every Military Court or Committee (in this section called a military tribunal) which was established before the passing of this Act by the Military Authorities of the Provisional Government or of the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann, and the establishment of which was ratified and approved by Resolution of Dáil Eireann on the 28th day of September, 1922, shall be deemed to be and always to have been a validly established tribunal, and every sentence passed, judgment given or order made before the passing of this Act by any such Military Tribunal, which was ratified by or which was duly passed, given or made in accordance with the said Resolution or any general order or regulation made by the Army Council, and laid on the table of Dáil Eireann, as required by said Resolution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to incorporate in the Bill what the Minister in charge of the Bill assured us was the intention, and to safeguard against validating acts which may have been committed by Military Courts, Committees or Tribunals which were not authorised by the Dáil, and by the jurisdiction of the Army Council acting under the Dáil.  The clause as it stands would have the effect of validating the actions of any Committee of a Military Court which may have been set up without authorisation.  If the Bill passes in the form in which it is presented it would have the effect of relieving from liability of a civil or criminal character any person acting without authorisation, or even in defiance of the instructions or the authorisation of the Dáil.  as it stands the section is too loose and too wide in its sweep.  It speaks of every Military Court and Committee or tribunal established by the Act as the Military Authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Figgis argued yesterday that the Military Authorities could only be taken to mean those authorities which were established by the direct authority of the Government or of the Dáil.  There is a danger, I think, that that may not be the case, that &ldquo;Military Authorities&rdquo; may include people who would be acting outside the jurisdiction and authority imposed upon them.  As the section stands, I submit it is open to the possible interpretation that minor officers who are <Col N="1838" /> not acting as Military Authorities within a given jurisdiction may be deemed to be &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; referred to in this section I want to ensure that any acts which are covered by this section shall be the acts of authorities established and approved by resolution of the Dáil&mdash;acts committed with that authorisation.  I submit that the amendment will embody the intentions as expressed by the Minister better than the section as it stands.  I am asking that the courts whose judgments are to be validated shall be the Courts or Committees or Tribunals which were ratified and approved by the Resolution of the Dáil; that only those Courts or Committees or Tribunals shall be validated, and that no other Courts shall, even by a possibility, be indemnified under the Act against illegal acts.  I think that the amendment I am putting forward, if it is read and considered in the spirit in which it is put forward, will be accepted. It does, in fact, embody the assurance that was given by the Minister yesterday that it was only those Courts which were authorised by the Dáil that were intended to be covered by this Act.  Now, the Minister will say, or did say, that he knew nothing about any other Courts.  There may not have been any other Courts, but there may have been Committees set up by military men who were regarded as being Military Authorities, and if the Bill passes in the form in which it at present stands, those Committees will be validated and the acts of those Committees will be validated.  I want to ensure that only those Courts, Committees or Tribunals which were authorised by the Resolution passed by the Dáil in September come under this section.</P>

      <P>This question was argued very exhaustively yesterday. I think the Minister for Defence made it quite clear that when he used the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; he meant military authority. This is a legislative document, and when it becomes the law &ldquo;military authority&rdquo; will be subject to a legal interpretation. I think that no tribunal which acted otherwise than under due and proper military authority would be held by any stretch of the imagination to be a court entitled to indemnification and validation.</P>

      <P>In the Sub-section as it stands there is no definition of what is meant by the &ldquo;Military <Col N="1839" /> Authority.&rdquo;  In every case, particularly in the Army Act, legal definitions are given, but I do not know that a definition of &ldquo;Military Authority&rdquo; in that particular Act can be taken to apply to the words in this Act, because the military body mentioned in the other Act is not, in the sense in which this Act is, retrospective.  Deputy Johnson's amendment does go a long way to define the <Col N="1840" /> expression &ldquo;military authority,&rdquo; or rather it puts down in black and white in the letter of the law and the Act what is meant and referred to by &ldquo;authority.&rdquo; The sub-Section as it stands in the Bill does not do it, and I think that it is up to the Minister to accept the amendment, particularly if the amendment is really the expression of the opinion which was expressed here yesterday evening.</P>

      <P>I have another amendment to that section.  It is: In line 58 to substitute for the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;  The sub-section as it stands provides that the reviewing body shall consist of not less than two, and the object of the amendment is that these bodies shall consist of not less than three.  It is possible, I do not know whether it is probable or not, that under the sub-section as it stands the revising or reviewing Board of Commissioners shall consist of only two.  My object in moving the amendment is to give a rather bigger minimum.  It may be the Board shall consist of four or five. The maximum number is not specified but the minimum number is.  I would have that minimum number three, because if a Board of two is set up, and a disagreement arises between the two as to say, the length or duration of a particular sentence, I do not know then what would happen.  There is no provision in the Bill for the solution of a difficulty of that kind, and there is nothing provided in the Bill for sending such a case to another Board of Commissioners.  I think the amendment is quite reasonable, and would allow, in the case of a Board consisting of the minimum number, that at least there should be a majority, so that an actual decision could be arrived at.</P>

      <P>I voted against the amendment of Deputy O'Shannon to insert the word &ldquo;high&rdquo; because High Judicial Office has been defined, and there are only 8 or 10 persons who would be qualified to act in such a capacity at present, if Deputy O'Shannon's amendment were carried, and it is doubtful if many of these would be inclined to act under this Bill.  I propose to add to the Section the following words, &ldquo;The Board of Commissioners shall be persons who on or before the date of their appointment held, or have held, judicial office in Saorstát as Judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland, Recorders or County court Judges, Judges of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court of Saorstát Eireann or of the late Supreme Court of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That will confine the choice of Commissioners to people who have been at some time County Court Judges or High Court Judges.  There are some existing County Court Judges who would be well qualified to fill the office.  You would also include all those who are included in Deputy O'Shannon's amendment, and you would include in addition to those, people who may be appointed to High Judicial Office in our own Courts set up under the new Bill which was read a first time yesterday. I appeal to the President to accept this amendment, because &ldquo;Judicial Office,&rdquo; as Deputy O'Shannon pointed out, is a very vague term and may include any person down to the very worthy person, no doubt, who holds the office of President of the Court of Conscience. There are many small judicial offices that would be quite covered by the term used here, and I would not care to see such people on the Board of Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The curious process by which the Executive is seeking to commend the Free State to the public continues with such measures as this, and the Public Safety Bill as shining examples.  I have been struck by the similarity of the spirit which presided over the last Irish Parliament of 120 years ago with the spirit which presides over this, and I would recommend <Col N="1843" /> to the President a course of Lecky on the subject in order that he might be duly impressed with the parallel.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The short session of Parliament,&rdquo; says Mr. Swift MacNeill, &ldquo;which began on January 21st, and ended on April 15th, 1796, was mainly occupied by an Act of Indemnity for such persons as had in the preceding half-year exceeded their legal powers, and by an Insurrection Act.&rdquo;  I will give to the Dáil two or three of the mildest extracts concerning that period. &ldquo;A clause very strenuously opposed by Grattan and Sir Lawrence Parsons actually legalised one of the worst excesses of legal powers in the preservation of the public peace whose previous perpetrations had been condoned under the Indemnity Act.  By this clause magistrates in the proclaimed districts were enabled to send men whom they considered disorderly characters, untried to the fleet.' `Under this comprehensive category,' writes Mr. Lecky, `were comprised all who were out of doors in the prohibited hours, and who could not give a satisfactory account of their purpose, all who had taken unlawful oaths, all who could not prove that they had lawful means of livelihood' &rdquo; That was in 1976.  In 1797 similar outrages were indulged in, and we read: &ldquo;The efforts of the Opposition in the Irish House of Commons to impose some restraint on the military violence reprobated by Sir Ralph Abercrombie were, of course, futile.  A new Indemnity Act was carried which sheltered all magistrates and other persons employed to preserve the peace from the consequences of every illegal Act they had committed since the beginning of the year 1797 with the object of suppressing insurrection, preserving peace and securing the safety of the State.&rdquo;  The language is very familiar, indeed: &ldquo;A clause of which Plunket was the proposer for granting compensation to the innocent victims of military violence was opposed and rejected.&rdquo;  The next Parliament was occupied with similar business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Parliament was prorogued on June 1st, 1799.  The proceedings of that assembly were marked by its wonted subserviency to the Government.&rdquo;  A Bill was introduced empowering &ldquo;the Lord Lieutenant as long as the rebellion continued, and notwithstanding the opening of the ordinary Courts of Justice to authorise the punishment by death or <Col N="1844" /> otherwise according to martial law,&rdquo; and so forth, &ldquo;and the detention of all persons suspected of such crimes and their summary trial by courtmartial.  No act done in pursuance of such an order could be questioned, impeded or punished by the courts of common law, and no person duly detained under the powers created by this Act could be released by a writ of Habeas Corpus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could quote nearly every chapter of this volume, which would be very much apropos.  One other item only to which I desire to draw special attention, and that is the question of presuming good faith as prescribed in this Bill.  In March, 1799, another Indemnity Act was carried; it provided that &ldquo;in all cases in which sheriffs or other officers or persons were brought to trial for acts done in suppressing the rebellion, that a verdict for the plaintiff should be null and void unless the jury distinctly found that it had been done maliciously and not with an intent of suppressing rebellion, preserving public peace, or promoting the safety of the State,&rdquo; and that even where juries did find that the act was malicious, the judge or judges who tried the case should have the power of setting such verdict aside. This Bill does not go quite so far as that, but in practice it does not fall far short of it.  I refer to Section 2, Sub-section (2), and I desire to make it clear that I have no objection to an Indemnity Bill as such after such a conflict as we have had.  If the Executive did confine this to an Indemnity Bill properly so called, and drawn within reasonable and moderate lines, I should not have opposed it, but I should in any case have opposed the other part of the Bill which should have been presented to us in a separate Act. So far as indemnity is concerned, I do very strongly object to the clause &ldquo;which provides that any act, matter or thing such as aforesaid done by or under the authority of a person holding office in or employed in the service of the Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann shall be deemed to have been done in good faith unless the contrary is proved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The judge, I take it, will be entitled in any case to say, &ldquo;There is no adequate proof to allow me to put to the jury whether or not to give a verdict for the plaintiff.  There is no adequate proof of want of good faith.&rdquo;  How can there be adequate proof.  You are asking your <Col N="1845" /> plaintiff to prove a negative.  You are asking him to prove a negative in respect of what was in the other man's mind. Nobody could seriously suppose that a plaintiff could prove any such thing.  If the Executive stopped short of inserting that provision they would be removing the worst blot on the indemnity part of the Bill.  It cannot be necessary to make a plaintiff prove that the defendant was not acting in good faith.  If the Executive are anxious that if he did not act in good faith he should be punished, and if it is not necessary why is it inserted?</P>
    <P>I turn to another point.  As in one of those Statutes of 120 years ago, innocent persons who have suffered are precluded from getting compensation for damage to property, destruction of property or theft of property.  I cannot but think the spirit which produces such an Act as this is a spirit utterly foreign to the century we are living in, and far more congenial to that 18th century upon which it is modelled.  I do not desire here more than to make a protest against it, because I realise that in the present Dáil it is hopeless for us to do more than that.  But I do most emphatically protest against that particular section which I should have protested against before had I been able to be present when the matter was rushed into this Dáil.  I ask if any reason can be given?</P>

      <P>Precisely. What I am saying for the President's benefit, is, so far as one object is concerned, at all events&mdash;the indemnity part of the Bill&mdash;it seems to me to be very seriously prejudiced by having that particular blot on Section 2, which I submit is unnecessary.  I do ask why this Bill should be introduced and rushed through now?  I submit that it would have been fairer and more far seeing for an outgoing Executive to leave the work, however necessary, of whitewashing what has been done to a new Executive, elected by the people, instead of taking upon themselves the duty of giving themselves a certificate of good character.  I think that such a certificate given by the next Dáil would have been, shall I say, a little more convincing, would have, at least, more moral value than anything that could be done by the present Dáil, which has been a party to the things <Col N="1846" /> which the Executive asks us to indemnify. I regret that this matter has been rushed upon us.  I do not desire to add anything further upon the second part of the Bill which, to my mind, is much more objectionable, because the particularly evil matters with which it deals have already been discussed at some length.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has puzzled me not a little with regard to the subjects he dealt with and the manner in which he dealt with them.  Looking over the Dáil debate of the 27th September I find that the Deputy supported certain Resolutions that were submitted, and which this Bill in a certain sense validates.</P>

      <P>May I, on that matter, make a personal explanation. The President, if he reads back, will find that I said I would support the resolutions whole-heartedly on two conditions&mdash; one was that men concerned should be treated as prisoners of war, and the second was that the Hague Rules should be applied.  These two conditions were embodied in two amendments which I thought would be accepted.  When I found that they would not be entertained, I voted against the resolutions, as the President will see by referring to the Division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the volume here.  At page 884, Mr. Gavan Duffy:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When I came into the Dáil I intended to support the motion.  In spite of the eloquence of Labour Deputies, I still hope to be able to support it substantially, because of the fundamental fact that the other side of this dispute have chosen the arbitrament of war.  If it is war, we must recognise that fact; also, I want to support the Government, because this measure aims at a military dictatorship.  I have been in favour of a military dictatorship from the beginning of the war, because I trust military guidance in a matter of this kind, and I entirely mistrust any kind of political control, because political control is not only a sham, but is often mischievous.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary to read the whole of the speech.  It goes the whole length of a page, and there is nothing about the Hague or about prisoners of war in it. That is the support that made those <Col N="1847" /> officers we are indemnifying do their duty.  This Indemnity Act gives them that indemnity.  The Deputy said there were some parallels between this Act and Acts that were introduced by what has been called the Irish Parliament of 1796, 1797 and 1798.  Where is the parallel? I cannot see it.  I do not recognise any similarity whatever.  If there be a similarity, the Deputy cannot be with what he calls the patriots of that time, having regard to the attitude he took up in the Dáil with regard to these Resolutions. If the Deputy put it that we are in the position of the British Government Ministers in the Irish House of Commons of that time, I deny it point blank.  We are not in that position.  We are not doing what they were doing for themselves in that Indemnity Bill.  We are not doing the same thing as in the Indemnity Bill of that time.  The circumstances are wholly dissimilar, and only a mind bordering upon lunacy could possibly suggest anything of the sort. Just think what it means.  Here we are, magistrates functioning to all intents and purposes under an Executive responsible to the British House of Commons!  A Minister in what is called the Old Irish Parliament was not, as Deputies know, responsible to the House.  The Executive was not responsible to the House.  It was responsible to the Minister who, in turn was responsible to the British Executive. That is not the case here.  The action we took was to vindicate the Deputy in putting his name to an instrument which we have honoured.  In the extraordinary steps we have had to take in vindication of that, we find it necessary to bring in this Indemnity Bill.  I must express my amazement at the Deputy drawing such parallels at all, and I do not think that, in his more lucid moments the Deputy himself will see any parallels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeGDuffy" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters on which I desire to offer an explanation.  The first is in regard to the comparison I made.  The comparison I made was between the spirit that animated the promoters of those Indemnity Bills and the spirit that animates the promoters of this Bill.  What I said when these military resolutions were introduced is in print, and I stand by every word of it.  I said I would support the Government, having introduced, myself, two amendments which I believed would be accepted.  The President will find them referred to at the end of that speech.  One of these amendments&mdash;I ask leave to repeat myself, as the President evidently did not understand me&mdash; stipulated that the men tried should be treated as prisoners of war.  That amendment I duly proposed when the matter came up.  The other amendment proposed that the military should be bound to apply the international rules of war in trying these prisoners.  That seemed to me be wholly natural, and I should not have had the least objection to these tribunals being set up if those two essential conditions had been accepted. The President will find, if he looks at the end of that debate, that, as a result of his stating in the course of the debate&mdash; I think it was by way of interjection&mdash; that these men would not be treated as prisoners of war, I voted in the minority against the Resolutions.  I say again I would have supported the Executive if they had accepted the two amendment, which I thought they would have accepted, and when I found, in the course of the debate, that they would not accept them, I voted against the Resolutions.</P>

We went there, and if we did not Deputies in this Dáil would not be here now.

      <P>There is a point that I wish to raise.  I may say I am not placing any obstacle in the way of this Bill.  I recognise the question of urgency, and that the Bill that was passed here yesterday must be given effect to; it was the intention it should. However I am not in entire agreement. The only matter that I am raising is a matter of importance for the future, merely a question of procedure.  Whatever we decide here will be taken as a precedent for the future.  Under Article 47, as I read and construe that article, I believe that a Resolution of this Dáil would be sufficient to meet the case.  It would certainly be a much less cumbersome procedure than taking a Bill already passed in this Dáil and making it a schedule to some new Bill that is taken a day afterwards.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Bill.  We endeavoured to get the particulars that were asked for by Deputy Figgis, but it appears that the reports in connection with the case are being transcribed, and it would take maybe a half an hour or three quarters of an hour until we are in a position to say exactly whether it will be possible to get them within an hour or afterwards.  I have asked the Attorney-General to attend <Col N="1855" /> this evening.  If it was the wish of the Dáil to hear a short explanation from him he will give them that explanation, although we have not had up to this any outsider, that is, a person who is not elected a member of this Dáil, addressing it.  But if it were desired, in view of the special circumstances of the case, that a statement, dealing with the proceedings that took place in the court to-day, should be made by him I would ask the Attorney-General to address the Dáil.  I think that is scarcely necessary.  The decisions are there.  The reasons why these two decisions were given or the particular reason which actuated the decision that was given, would scarcely affect the case, because we are presented with a certain fact, the fact being that an Act that was passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas, that has received the Royal Assent is held for seven days by reason of Article 47 of the Constitution.  Had that been anticipated I think there is not the faintest doubt whatever but that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have passed the necessary resolution.  As to the suggestion that was made by Deputy Figgis, earlier in the evening, regarding this Article, that is that it might be possible for us now to pass this resolution, though I subscribe to that as a solution of the difficulty, I am not satisfied that that solution would be accepted and we might be faced with a network of difficulties and complexities just as we had contemplated adjourning and dissolving. On that account it is unwise that we should take any step which is not a sort of cast-iron security that the measure that we have considered here for a very considerable time, and that has been a subject of very serious consideration in the Seanad should run the risk of being held up for any period by reason of the re-actions which the holding up of the Bill might bring about.  In moving the Second Reading it is only necessary to state that it was the intention of this Dáil and the intention of the Seanad that this Act should become operative immediately on its passage through both Houses and on the Governor-General appending his signature to it.  I, therefore, formally move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I am not raising any objection or difficulty to this.  I am entirely in agreement with the President so far as the necessity for giving effect to what was clearly the intention of the Oireachtas, is concerned. My point may seem a little unnecessary and pedantic, but I do think it is right that at this early stage of acting on the Constitution it is very desirable that we should proceed with care in order that the matters we now do might not form unhappy precedents for the future.  I cannot but think it is not altogether the best of possible precedents to pass an Act, say, on Wednesday of one week, and because a certain eventuality occurs that that Act, on the Thursday of the same week, should be made a Schedule to another Act.  Article 47 of the Constitution is, I think, quite clear.  Article 47 does say that these provisions, the provisions by which two-fifths of either House may claim a referendum, but must claim it within seven days, and that therefore a Bill is not presumed to be of full effect in law and to have actual currency until those seven days have expired, shall not apply or be of effect in the case of Bills.  The Constitution reads: &ldquo;This provision shall not apply to money Bills or to such Bills as may be claimed to be needed for the preservation of the public peace, health or safety.&rdquo;  I have a very clear and actual memory of the scene in which these words were drafted.  It does not say that such a resolution making these provisions null and void in respect of Bills of this sort must be passed with the Bill and accompanying the Bill; it merely says that such a resolution must be passed by both Houses.  It might be passed the day after.  I believe the construction of Article 47 is that it may be passed any time within the seven days, and I think it would be a more desirable procedure to adopt.  I know the arguments that will be raised.  No doubt, this argument would be put forward that a resolution of this kind passed the following day was <i>ex post facto.</i>  It is still within Article 47 but it is neither more nor less <i>ex post facto</i> than the procedure to be now adopted.  If the argument that the procedure by resolution&mdash;the simple direct procedure&mdash;is not going to be accepted by the Courts&mdash;and I take that by anticipation to be the argument for the procedure now being defined&mdash;<Col N="1857" /> then the same would apply towards making a No. 2 Bill with No. 1 Bill as a schedule.  I am perfectly well aware other arguments could be put forward, and I imagine they will be in due course of time, but I prefer they would not be interlarded with my arguments at the present time.</P>

      <P>I suggest Article 47 is perfectly clear.  A certain type of Bill shall not be held up for seven days.  That type of Bill is the kind of Bill that is necessary for the preservation of public safety, peace and good order. If the Dáil at any time decides that a certain Bill which is passed five minutes or 24 hours before is of that kind, then, if it passes a resolution to that effect, then this provision, if now proved to be an impediment, shall not apply.  I urge that on the President for a very practical reason.  To-day it was necessary to suspend Standing Orders.  If a resolution of this kind could have been adopted I take it Standing Orders need not have been suspended, and it is better not to suspend them if it can be avoided. Sometime in the future the same emergency might arise that has now arisen, and it might not be possible to suspend Standing Orders.  It might be possible to proceed by way of resolution.  If that is sufficient now it will be sufficient then, and I do urge a resolution should be passed and presented to the Court, and that it would effect the purpose in exactly the same way and with exactly the same authority, being within the meaning of Article 47, as making a No. 2 Bill of what has already been a No. 1 Bill.</P>

      <P>I am loath to occupy time as time is precious, but Deputy Figgis is really spinning cobwebs for his own delight.  Nothing can be clearer than Article 47, &ldquo;A Bill passed, or deemed to have been passed, may be suspended&rdquo; and so on &mdash;&ldquo;These provisions shall not apply to such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety&rdquo; His argument, therefore, that what was held against the validity of the Public Safety Act, Number 1, would apply equally to this, falls to the ground be <Col N="1858" /> cause this second Bill is accompanied by the necessary declaration.  That is the essential difference.  This Bill is accompanied by the declaration or will be accompanied by the declaration of both Houses that it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace.  The contention of Deputy Figgis, that it will suffice, after the Bill has been passed, to make an <i>ex post facto</i> declaration that it is of that nature, merely shows that Deputy Figgis is not acquainted with the ways of the Law Courts.  The Judge might very well, without going to any great length to discover or invent difficulties, hold that the meaning of these words is that the declaration is to accompany, and be an integral part of the legislation.  What the President proposes to do puts it out of the power of any logic chopping gentleman, on or off the Bench, to utilise that argument so that whether this is novel procedure or not is not a fatal objection, because the situation is absolutely novel.  I do not like to comment upon it further than that, but it is an effort of the old regime to interfere with the coming into operation of the new regime.  I will not say anything more than merely to put it in very mild terms.  What we are doing to-night may be unique in the history of legislation, but it is the proper way to meet a difficulty which is in itself unique in its creation.</P>
