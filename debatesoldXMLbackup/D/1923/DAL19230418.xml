      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that during the last week in March, 1922, the then Military Authorities of the 1st Eastern Division circularised the injured and disabled soldiers of the old I.R.A., asking them to send in their claims for injury or disablement in hostilities against the British occupation, that a claim for compensation was made on behalf of William Goodwin, Baltrasna, Drumree, Co. Meath, for disablement of his right leg in an ambush of a train at Celbridge, Co. Kildare, on July 2nd, 1921, that compensation has not yet been paid in this case, that the said disabled soldier has been a burden on the local rates for the past fifteen months; and to ask when does the Minister intend to deal with this and similar cases.</P>

      <P>I have ascertained that such an inquiry was made early in 1922, in what was then the 1st Eastern Division.  This inquiry was apparently initiated locally, and its results were not communicated to G.H.Q.  I have no information at present regarding Wm. Goodwin.</P>
      <P>Post-treaty events have prevented the matter of dealing before this with the question of grants and pensions in respect of men disabled in hostilities against the British.  I expect, however, to be able to introduce a Bill, dealing with this matter, and with similar cases arising out of the present hostilities, early next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to bring before the Dáil a question of the privileges of Deputies which, as I conceive it, is one of very considerable constitutional importance&mdash;I refer to a question arising out of a raid conducted upon my house, a search through my papers by armed men acting, apparently, under the authority of the present Ministry. I wish to make it perfectly clear, in raising this question, that I want to do so as impersonally as possible, on public and not on personal grounds.  I wish to make clear, also, that I want to deal as little as possible with the demerits of the raid, as a raid, because, compared with what other people have had to suffer, it was a very trivial affair, but its constitutional aspect is another matter; and that aspect, from the point of view of the privileges of this Dáil, is a matter of importance to every Deputy in the Chamber.  Before raising the matter here I notified the Minister for Defence, setting out the facts in a letter to him, and I received a reply from him stating that the military authorities, and the military intelligence authorities, had no responsibility in the matter.  Likewise, before raising the matter in the Dáil I notified the Attorney-General as the particular person responsible for the administration of justice and law in this country, and I asked him to make enquiries, on the Civil side, as to the matter complained of, and I asked for an assurance that there would be no further occasion to raise any similar complaints.  I regret to say that the Attorney-General has been unable to give me any answer&mdash;at least, any answer that I can use in this Dáil&mdash; on the matter of my complaint, and I do not, up to the present moment, know whether the Ministry accept responsibility or do not accept responsibility.  I informed the Attorney-General that I would raise the matter at the meeting of the Dáil to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allow me to state as briefly as possible what happened.  In the early days of March I had a previous visit from un-uniformed armed men in broad daylight, about 4 o'clock.  They came in a lorry, and three of them made their way into my house, and they asked for a person who does not live in the house, and whose name I did not know.  They were told it was my house, and they apologised <Col N="200" /> profusely and withdrew and searched other houses in the neighbourhood.  That was in broad daylight, and quite publicly. The three men who entered the house on that occasion were among the number to enter the house upon the occasion which I wish to describe to Deputies now.  On Saturday, 24th March, I left Ireland to go abroad for the Easter holidays.  On Tuesday the 27th March, during my absence abroad, the raid in question took place, between 5 and 5.30 a.m.  I had taken the precaution to leave a maid in the house, but the house looked as if it were an empty one, because the blinds had been taken down.  On this occasion of the 27th March, two lorry loads of armed and un-uniformed men came to my house.  The lorries were left on the public road, guarded by men with rifles, and the house was surrounded by men with rifles.  Some 20 men armed with revolvers and flashlights made their way into the house.  They tried to break in by breaking in a small window, and, failing in this, they were eventually admitted by the maid.</P>
    <P>When she opened the door some twenty men rushed in.  They said they were looking for a man unnamed, and they went all through the house apparently looking for this man unnamed.  The maid said to them&mdash;&ldquo;Do you know that this is Mr. Gavan Duffy's house, and that he is away?&rdquo;  One of them made answer, &ldquo;We know it bloody well, and we will do him in when he gets back.&rdquo;  That may be put down to frolic and exuberance, but one could wish that the frolic of these gentlemen would take a little less sinister form.  Various small articles were purloined, and a certain amount of breakage was committed; but on these matters I do not wish to detain the Dáil.  I mention them merely in order that the Dáil may see the setting of the picture.  For some reason, which I do not pretend to have fathomed, gentlemen who, two or three weeks before, had apologised for their invasion had discovered in the meantime that apology was not the right attitude, and that quite a different attitude was to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I now come to what is the main complaint I wish to bring before Deputies, because it involves every Deputy in this Dáil.  The raiders, I may mention, were in telephonic communication from my house with someone, presumably the persons to whom they are responsible, and <Col N="201" /> I am left to gather that when they did not find the man for whom they were looking they satisfied themselves that their duty would be to go through my papers.  At all events, the fact remains that these persons spent, as nearly as I can ascertain, one hour in my house ransacking my papers; private papers, political papers, historical papers, and legal papers.  I ask, by whose authority, and by what right?  Am I, or am I not, a Deputy in this Dáil, and as such Deputy have I, or have I not, the right to protection from this kind of molestation?  I bring the matter before Deputies here as a member of a minorty in this Dáil, as one with no Party to support him, but confident that my fellow-members will see that a matter of principle is involved. I do not bring it forward because it affects me personally, but because it affects&mdash;it goes to the root of&mdash;the right of Deputies to exercise constitutional opposition against the Ministry for the time being.</P>
    <P>I have stated the facts as plainly as I could.  I have not sought to embroider them in any way, and I do not wish to make very much comment upon them; but I do put it to this Dáil that the matter, if you eliminate the personal issue altogether, is one of privilege to which no member of this Dáil can be indifferent. Some of my papers were taken away.  One man was seen to put a private diary of mine into his pocket after examining it.  Later on, during the same day, a parcel wrapped up in brown paper was brought to my door.  This parcel was addressed to me in block capitals, so that one could not identify the handwriting. The messenger who brought it, when asked where he came from, said: &ldquo;This is from Pim's.&rdquo;  That parcel turned out to be a parcel of papers abstracted by the armed raiders that morning.  Perhaps I need not comment upon that.  What I put to the Dáil is this: Either a Deputy, who has become in every sense a member of this Dáil, is entitled to protection from molestation, or he is not.  The Constitution deals with the matter in this way. Article 20 provides that each House shall make its own Rules and Standing Orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom to Deputies and to protection for their official documents, and all their private papers.  It reads: &ldquo;To protect itself and its members against any person or persons interfering with, <Col N="202" /> molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.&rdquo; We have not made any Rules or Orders dealing with this matter so far, but I think Deputies will probably agree with me, that in stating in the Constitution specifically that we, this Dáil, have power to make rules to protect the private papers of members, and to protect members against molestation; that by putting that in the Constitution, we implied that these were rights of members which we intended to protect.  Nothing has been done to give effect to that Article, but in raising this matter I raise it in the hope that something will be done now. I should not be frank with the Dáil if I did not tell them what I conceive to be the reason for this raid.  I may be wrong. I hope I am.</P>

      <P>The question of privilege, which is a general one, is that the Deputy's house is privileged against raids by Government forces.  If that were established, it could not be qualified.  At this particular time, the Deputy is only raising the question of privilege, but at another time, such as on the motion for the adjournment, he could raise any other matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil will see that two questions are involved. Perhaps I have said enough to make that clear.  Two questions are involved.  One is the right of a Deputy who takes his place in the Dáil, who takes the oath and who becomes in every way a Deputy of the Dáil, to be immune from raids upon his house.  The second is the right of the Deputy under all circumstances to have his papers immune from examination by the servants of the Ministry. All I wish to say is this: unless this Dáil asserts itself to protect Deputies in such matters, it will be obvious that no constituent of a Deputy who enjoys the disfavour of the Ministry will be safe in writing to that Deputy because <Col N="203" /> the correspondence received from that constituent as well as the answers to the constituent will be liable to be examined by persons who have no right to examine those papers.  I do not think it is necessary for me to develop that at greater length; but Deputies will realise that if the privacy of one's papers is gone you might as well abandon all pretence&mdash;because then it would be a pretence&mdash;that constitutional opposition is a legitimate and proper thing in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is is a matter of fact involved in this.  A question of privilege may be raised so as to interrupt business, but in this matter which has now been raised there is, in addition to a question of privilege which would be for the Dáil to decide, a question of fact.  If Deputy Gavan Duffy's house was raided by Government forces the question of privilege immediately arises.  If a question of fact as to who raided the Deputy's house has to be cleared up first, it cannot be cleared up at this particular time. Other opportunities can be given.  In order to see how the debate may develop, I would like to hear whether it is admitted that Deputy Gavan Duffy's house was raided as he alleges.  That is the essential point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must certainly enter a very strong protest against the manner, style, and, indeed, everything connected with the way in which this question of privilege has been raised.  The Dáil met on Thursday and Friday of last week, and on Tuesday of this week.  Now, on Wednesday, we get a hysterical description of a raid that has been reported to Deputy Duffy, and which occurred a week, or a fortnight ago.  I have had no communication from the Deputy about this, and if Deputies do take up an attitude like that and come along with every trumpery charge they have got, and every allegation that it is possible for them to make, there cannot be any satisfactory answers given to them.  I think it is unreasonable to expect in a matter of this sort on which a Deputy appears, or endeavours to make us believe that, he appears, to take very strong exception, when he has allowed his passion to subside for four days without bringing it forward, and then brings it up without <Col N="204" /> notice, and without giving any indication good, bad, or indifferent of the fact that he was about to raise it at a particular time, that any satisfactory answer can be given.  I think it is unfair and unreasonable for any Deputy to expect an answer in such circumstances.  I cannot give a satisfactory answer to any case of this sort that is brought forward in such a manner.  The Ministry has no interest, good, bad or indifferent in any legal, historical or private papers belonging to Deputy Gavan Duffy, nor have they any interest in any such papers possessed by other Deputies.  I think Deputies will admit that from the very begnning we have endeavoured, as far as our resources and abilities would permit, to deal with every case that any Deputy has brought forward as fairly and fully as possible. Unless the Deputy wishes to get a political advertisement out of this, there is no other excuse I can find for his bringing it forward in such a manner, without giving due notice.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow the last statement of the President to pass without refuting it.  I stated previously, and I now repeat, that I gave notice to the Attorney-General of my intention to raise the matter to-day.  I think I made it clear before that the only reason I did not raise the matter before was because I wanted to give the authorities time to answer the case that I put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of privilege is whether a Deputy's house may be raided by Government forces, and whether a Deputy's documents may be examined by Government forces.  That question can be raised at exceptional times, but if in this particular instance it has to be settled first, as a preliminary, who the people were who raided the Deputy's house, then that question will have to be settled in another way and at another time.  The Deputy will have to raise the matter on the adjournment, or by question, and if it is established that the Government forces raided his house, then a motion can be brought forward to declare that such action is a breach of the privileges <Col N="205" /> of Deputies, or a motion could be brought forward to set up a committee on privileges which would set out what, in its opinion, should be the privileges of Deputies. When that committee would report, the Dáil would have an opportunity of expressing its opinion.  I do not think that we can continue this matter further at this stage.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest, as this question does raise a very serious matter, especially in view of the question put by Deputy Staines yesterday, that there should be some understanding, or, shall I say, some decision of the Dáil, as to what the privileges of the Deputies are.  I would support this suggestion that you have thrown out that a Committee should be appointed on privileges generally or on the privileges of the Deputies, and that Committee could report to the Dáil at an early date.  There is no need to argue the necessity for such a Committee.  I would ask the Minister, the President of the Council, to move in this matter at the earliest possible date.  It is obviously such a case as ought to be moved by the President, and not by any Deputy of the Dáil.  I would urge that the matter should be taken up in that way and a Committee on Privileges set up at once.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Governor-General's Salary and Establishment Bill. Article 60 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;the salary of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State shall be of the like amount as that now payable to the Governor-General of Australia, and shall be charged on the public funds of the Irish Free State, Saorstát Eireann, and suitable provision shall be made out of these funds for the maintenance of his official residence and establishment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In order that the payments for the salary and the establishment expenses may be made in a regular manner, it is necessary that an exact method of charging, which is not indicated in the Constitution, should now be defined. Payments out of the public funds may be made in various ways.  The present Bill proposes to indicate the exact manner in which those payments should be made. I accordingly move the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on this Bill to the extent that Section 1 provides for taking away from the Dáil, to some extent, supervision of the expenditure. It is suggested in Section 1 that <Col N="207" /> a salary of £10,000 was to be a charge upon the Central Fund, and Section 2 provides for the expenses of the establishment being paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  I think it is very desirable that we should have both sums charged against the same moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  As far as I can see, there is no necessity for this particular alteration or variation; and it is better that we should have our attention drawn year by year, to the fact that this particular officer of the Saorstát is costing us £10,000 per year, plus establishment charges.  Then I think it is undesirable to state in the Preamble that &ldquo;the Dáil resolved, by Article 60 of the Constitution, to provide for the salary,&rdquo; and so on.  I think that the manner of stating this rather suggests that we are very willing and keen about it.  I prefer to suggest that we are doing it because we are compelled by the Constitution and by a clause in the Constitution which we did not willingly submit to.  It is better, I think, that the Dáil should make clear that the constitutional officer known as the Governor-General has not been a freewill offering, but that he has been imposed upon the Saorstát by agreement; and it is rather better that we should bear that in mind when we are drawing up Bills relating to that particular officer. One does not need to say very much about the Bill.  We have bound ourselves to pay this sum, which is alleged to be £10,000, or whatever sum it is that is paid to the Governor-General of Australia. But we had better do it in such a way that will ensure that it will always be clear to our successors, year by year, that we are paying this particular sum, and also that the Constitution requires us to do it, and that it is not what you might call a generous gesture on the part of the Dáil, but that it is something that we had to do and could not get out of.</P>

      <P>It is, perhaps, too late to attempt to revive the discussions upon which we entered with so much verve and zeal when the question of the salary and emoluments of the Governor-General were debated as an Article of the Constitution.  We had to accept this functionary by an Article of the Agreement.  We were obliged as a consequence of that to agree to pay him the salary that is set out here, as measured <Col N="208" /> in the way set out here.  But what at the time I think most of us were inclined to resist, had not party allegiance interfered with the voluntary actions of so many, was the impositions upon the Free State of all the cost of the maintenance of his establishment. Equity would suggest that as he is in a large measure the official of the Commonwealth of Nations of which this Saorstát forms a constituent part that some, if not all, of the expenses of the establishment should be borne as an Imperial charge.  However, we were defeated in our representations in this regard, and I think it ought to be obvious to us now that inasmuch as provision for this office and its maintenance is one of the essential charges or impositions upon the State by virtue of the Treaty, it is only reasonable that provision in this Bill should be made to have it a charge upon the Central Fund. But when it comes to a question as to determining how much from year to year shall be expended on the upkeep of the official residence, the pomp and other things incident thereto, it becomes of the last importance that the money should be voted by the Parliament, so as to be kept under constant scrutiny and liability to revision by the Parliament.  In making the provision there in Article 2 for a different method of raising the money from that, or at any rate indicating a different source from that out of which the payment of the annual salary of £10,000 is to be drawn, I think the Bill is to be commended and supported.  There is one feature in it, however, objectionable. Clause 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid by the Minister for Finance out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas such yearly or other sum or sums as the Minister for Finance may from time to time determine to be suitable provision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be meticulous criticism to say that there is a certain inconsistency in that provision, but my objection to it is not on any verbal grounds; my objection is that it appears to leave to the Minister himself the free discretion to determine how much shall be appropriated for this purpose.  In other words the function seems to be divided between the Parliament and the Minister in this fashion, that the Parliament, when invited <Col N="209" /> by the Minister for Finance, is to provide yearly a sum or sums, and it is for the Minister to determine the measure of such sum or sums.  With all respect and deference to the Minister for Finance I would suggest it would be better if it were left with him to advise the Oireachtas as to the amount that he deems necessary and appropriate and to leave it finally to the determination of the Parliament instead of taking over to himself the determination.  It may come to the same thing in the end.  But as a matter of policy, as a matter of constitutional practice it would seem to me to be better that he should advise that the Dáil should determine.</P>
    <P>The Preamble, as Deputy Johnson points out, is in slight measure defective also, inasmuch as it fails to recite that this office is created by the Treaty. The first recital should be: &ldquo;Whereas in accordance with the Treaty provision is required to be made for a Governor-General,&rdquo; and it should then proceed to recite these other things.  It is on the records of this Dáil that we do not do this thing freely, or even with a measured amount of enthusiasm.  At the same time technically I think what ought to be the second recital is fairly correct in its phraseology that &ldquo;Dáil Eireann has resolved.&rdquo;  It has passed a resolution; that undoubtedly is a historical fact.  The Bill leaves itself open I think to no serious criticism except that the Minister for Finance is given a larger amount of discretion in <Col N="210" /> the matter than I think the Dáil ought to accord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Bill applies to the salary paid to the Governor-General in the same order as salaries are paid to Judges or other items which are unchangeable and not variable from year to year.  The second part deals with the upkeep of the establishment; that is variable.  It is possible that in one year one could have much more expense than in another year.  The first year's expenses ought naturally to be much larger than succeeding years.  I should say in the particular case we have in mind that we have been saved a good deal of expense by His Excellency, the present occupant of the position of Governor-General.  In the ordinary way we might reasonably have been called upon to provide certain furniture that he insisted on taking over from his own house.  The Constitution has already adopted this, and I think it is not really wise to put forward the objections that have been entered as to qualifying the terminology of the Bill.  The terminology appears to me to be a very fair reflex of what has already appeared in both the Treaty and the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have handed in an amendment to paragraph (b) of Resolution 1:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the words &lsquo;and subject to the provisions of the Double Taxation (Relief) Act, 1923 (No. 8 of 1923),&rsquo;&rdquo; My object in moving this amendment is to assist the Minister for Finance in meeting the charges that he deems to be necessary for the current year, and further to provide him with an opportunity of explaining, in more detail than we have yet learned, the effect of this Double Taxation (Relief) Act, and the cost of it to the Free State, provided such arrangements as have been suggested in regard to Income Tax are brought into operation.  This particular Act dealt with Stamp Duties, for instance, and other things besides Income Tax, but it seems to me that the provisions relating to Income Tax ought not to come into operation without our knowing pretty definitely what it is going to involve.  We know, as a matter of common knowledge, that a very much greater sum of money is invested in British undertakings by residents and citizens of Saorstát than is invested by citizens of Great Britain in undertakings in the Saorstát.  I do not think it can be considered in the light of a reciprocity arrangement unless reciprocity means giving away 5s. for the sake of getting in return 1s.  Some time ago there was an estimate, taken, I think, from Official Returns, published that some £108,000,000 or £109,000,000 were invested in British Government and Indian Securities from Ireland.  Then, we know of very considerable sums invested in railways, corporations, insurance companies and industrial undertakings of one kind or other, having their headquarters and chief operations in Great Britain.  The income which is derived from those investments by citizens of the Saorstát ought, as I understand it, be liable to taxation in Ireland, and no case yet has been made which convinces me that there is any necessity for making any remission or giving any relief because they have already paid an Income Tax to the British Government. The effect of this relief is to encourage Irish investors to send their investments over the water.  I think the policy should be just the contrary&mdash;to encourage or induce or prevail upon Irish investors, by a fiscal provision, to invest their moneys in Irish undertakings.  I suppose it would not be an exaggeration to say that from Saorstát Eireann £100,000,000 is invested in British undertakings.  It may be more, it may be less; it is only a guess.  But <Col N="215" /> in any case it is a very large sum.  How much of the dividend from those investments is subject to deduction of Income Tax at the source, I cannot tell.  Possibly the Minister is able to give us some enlightenment.  But, in any case, it is a considerable sum.  It may amount to half a million pounds, or it may amount to much more.  It may amount to less, but it is going to be in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, and it seems to me that the finance of the Saorstát cannot afford to allow that sum to slip through its fingers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is going to be a loan called for. I suggest that it would be a considerable inducement to the investors in British undertakings to transfer their investments to the loan if this responsibility for Income Tax was imposed upon the holders of foreign securities.  It might even be found profitable&mdash;I think it would be found profitable&mdash;for investors to take up loan stock and they would not have any complaint to make that they were being deprived of security. Surely, to a citizen of the Saorstát the security of the State is good enough.  If it is not, then I think the person of the investor ought to follow his investment. It is said &ldquo;where your treasure is there will your heart be also,&rdquo; and if we encourage, by this system of relief, investors to invest their money in British securities we shall find that the minds and the thoughts and the ambitions of the said investors will follow their investments and that they will take more interest in British affairs than they will take in Irish affairs.  This sum of money that might be drawn into the coffers of the Saorstát might very well go to reducing the tax&mdash;the one tax that touches in a direct way every child, every woman, and every man in the community&mdash;on sugar.  It is an imposition that I think should be lightened at the earliest possible date.  I suggest that if the Minister for Finance in his scheme thinks that the inducement to investment in the loan that is proposed is sufficient, without using this particular relief of taxation, that the sum might very well be used to reduce the tax on sugar.  But whatever may be the use made of this sum of £200,000 or £300,000 or £500,000 or £1,000,000, it is well it should be made use of by the Irish Government.  I think from the <Col N="216" /> point of view of revenue, from the point of view of industry, from the point of view of citizenship, that it is desirable that the citizens who have investments in British securities should be called upon to transfer those investments to Irish securities.  And if they decline to do that then they should not be relieved of the taxation that every other citizen who is prepared to invest his money in Irish securities has to undergo.  I know there will be all kinds of arguments used regarding credit and trust funds and widows and orphans, but I submit that the Minister can make quite certain that no harm will come to the widows and orphans and the trustees who are responsible for the maintenance of such trust funds.  He might even suggest some means whereby there will be relief from Income Tax for investors in such a loan.  In any case I would urge that the interest of the State will be better served by giving no relief in respect of Income Tax and that in consequence this particular phrase in sub-section D of Resolution No. 1 should be deleted and accordingly I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>A few more speeches like that to which we have just listened from Deputy Johnson, and there will be very little capital left in this country at all.  Let us consider for a moment the people who are likely to have money to invest in internal loans and in Irish securities.  A great part of the invested moneys of the people who are for the moment citizens of Saorstát Eireann are funds paid under the Land Purchase Acts to landlords whose properties were sold to their tenants.  Many of these men are living, we hope temporarily, in England until the Bill that was before the Dáil the other day which will enable them to rebuild their houses, has been passed.  They have no estates to manage; they have bits of demesnes left, and they look forward to coming back here and resuming their places as citizens mainly on the ground of sentiment. But sentiment is a very light thing when you set up against it cash, and you will find, I have no doubt whatever, that if they are made to pay heavily for the pleasure of coming back here, they will not come back at all.  You might get a little from them, if the <Col N="217" /> Amendment were accepted, in the way of Income Tax, but that is only a drop in the bucket compared with what you would lose by people going away again, and not coming back.  You may lose not only a comparatively trifling amount drawn from them by way of Income Tax, but when any one of these dies, as a citizen of the Saorstát, the State takes a heavy toll in Death and Estate duties, and the consequence of such a proposal as this might be that you would be driving away by taxation, not only so much Income Tax, but accumulated Death duties, out of the coffers of this State in consequence of a person being denied the relief that is extended to residents in Canada, Australia, or other Dominions because of investments they may have over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the people who have invested money are the monied class, or what is called, I suppose, capitalists&mdash;more or less wealthy people who live on incomes derived from trust funds.  You cannot get an industrial concern to put their money into loans of this description, because if the country prospers they will invest their reserve money in their own concern and their own business.  These people do not have large sums to invest; they do not have anything except comparatively small reserves to invest in loans.  What we want is men who are what is called flush of money to put it into investments in this country and to put it into loans in this country.  You will not find many people beside the existing citizens of this country who will produce money for that purpose, and therefore our first and main object ought to be to keep those people we have, and to make sure that these monied people, temporarily out of the country, will not remain permanently out of it, but will come back and resume the place as citizens that they held heretofore.  It may be said it is not a very patriotic thing to run away from Ireland and go somewhere else.  It is not; but one must make excuse for those people.  They have been up against rather dangerous circumstances for the last two or three years that have not been a great encouragement to them to remain in their native land.  This new Oireachtas ought to see that they will be welcomed back, and will not be placed at a disadvantage if they come back, and will not be treated differently here from <Col N="218" /> what they would be treated in England if they changed their residence to England, or if they went to Canada or Australia. We want to keep everybody here, as the Minister for Finance said, who has a £5 note or anything else in his pocket.  Let us encourage such people to stay here and to produce that £5 note for our own internal government.  I am not interested at all in trustees, or widows or orphans, or matters of that kind, and I hope I will not hear any cheap gibes about my clients.  My only client in this matter is the Exchequer of the Free State, and it is because I believe that the proposal put forward by the Deputy opposite, in the way it is put forward, would be absolutely disastrous to this country in making sure that all the capital that could flow out of the country would go that I so strongly oppose it.</P>
    <P>Now, it is within my own knowledge that a very wealthy man indeed, living in comfort in a small house where he made up his mind to live for the rest of his life here, in this country&mdash;a very wealthy man indeed, who pays something between £15,000 and £20,000 a year in income tax and super tax into the coffers of the Free State, and whose estate would pay I do not know what sum in death duties when he died, did clear out of the country, and went away in consequence of very similar proposals to that we have just heard this afternoon. That is one case, but there are any number of very much smaller people no doubt, but monied people all the same, who would follow his example. I quite agree that could not be described as patriotic, but, after all, money talks and people will not make great pecuniary sacrifices for the sake of sentiment. I know many people again who have a most strong desire to come back to this country, and to live and die here, and who are not living here now, but who are waiting and hoping for an opportunity to come back, but who will abandon that hope, and will not come back unless they see that they can come back on equal terms with those they receive in the places in which they are resident for the moment.  It will be time enough, after they are settled down here again, to consider what measures we are going to take, but if you once begin what you may call a system of threatening to conscript capital which can go <Col N="219" /> across by the mail boat at a moment's notice, and go for ever, you will find it will be pouring out of the country and that when you come to float your internal loan, the people who have money to lend and who would be prepared to do so, and who would be prepared to take their money from English investments and put it into your Irish loan, will not be here in this country at all.</P>
    <P>It does appear to be the very worst policy in the interest of the State that we should even seem to countenance the possibility of such penalisation of people who have exercised the right that every person who owns money has to put it into such concerns as will remunerate him best. If they think this is going to be a prosperous country, and that this country is going to make good they will put their money into loans here, but if you adopt this method of coercion you will not find them consenting to draw out their money from foreign countries or from the other Dominions to put it into Irish industry.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time that we have heard from Deputy Johnson this curious doctrine of liberty&mdash;that we should force those who have money to invest, to invest it in Irish enterprises.  Anyone who knows the elements of business is aware that the way in which you get capital invested in any enterprise is by making it attractive to the investors.  You will not force people who have money to spare to invest it in any undertaking merely by declaring that you will tax and tax, and double tax, whatever dividends they would get from other sources.  They will adopt the resource that is far too frequently adopted in Ireland, even in the best of circumstances&mdash; they will hide it under the hearthstone, or they will put it in the stocking, or transfer it into paper and hide it between the pages of the family Bible.  They will do all sorts of things with it except the one thing&mdash;make it fruitful.  The last thing that is possible by coercion is to make people invest money in something in which they have no confidence. I say that even if you could do that, and it is notoriously impossible&mdash;but if you were to do it, it would be execrable tyranny.  If a man, through his self-denial or excessive work, or through any other exercise of his energy, has a surplus <Col N="220" /> above what meets his present needs, surely he has as much right, consonant with ordinary morality, to do with that what is reasonable, as he has with any other of his possessions.  We are not all obliged to work throughout the twentyfour hours of the day.  Our capacity for work and our energies are so far at our own disposal.  After all, accumulated capital is pretty much the same thing, and if you are going to take away from the citizen the right to dispose of that, you might as well take away from him at the same time the right to dispose of his labour or to dispose of his mental energy.  Would the Deputy introduce an Act which would compel all men to write articles for six hours of the day and lecture for six remaining hours, and for six other hours to labour in the fields to recuperate? I suggest, though that seems to be fantastic, the parallel itself is in principle on all fours with the proposal to force people to withdraw against their wills and against their better judgment, or against their own conception of the fitter circumstances in individual cases, the money which they had invested, and to compel them to put it into something else.  Deputy Fitzgibbon has pointed out an alternative which seems to have escaped the attention of the advocates of this particular form of liberty, that capital can fly, and that the bird with the capital will fly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And will go elsewhere.  The proposal amounts to this: that we have not sufficient faith in the future of the Free State and have to try to give it an artificial stability&mdash;to try to make it appear a better thing to the world of credit than it is and to take steps to keep a larger measure of capital unwillingly within its shores.  I say to keep it so is not to have it remunerative capital; it will leave a sense of grievance with the owners of it.  It seems to be incredible that anyone who advocates liberty with the persistent zeal and ability that Deputy Johnson invariably does should, as he thinks, in the interests and for the betterment of the country, propose to deal what is in some sense a fatal blow to confidence. because everyone will ask the question: Why is it necessary to make an enactment of this kind which is so obviously <Col N="221" /> harsh in the way of its application, and why should it be necessary, in this initial stage of fiscal control in the Free State, to make this enactment?  It can only be because these people do not believe that voluntarily their own citizens would invest their moneys there.  Now I have faith, and I am sure Deputy Johnson has no less faith than I have, in the future of the Free State, particularly as from now on.  We are entitled to be hopeful, and to be very optimistic with regard to it I think what we ought to do is to lessen income tax and lessen the taxes on necessities, and make this an attractive place for people to come to live in who have a little surplus of money to invest.  If we succeed in doing that it will go a long way to stabilise the Free State.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson. I am sorry that Deputy FitzGibbon and Deputy Magennis should have taken up an attitude of opposition to it.  I think that we in this country. have no longer any room for drones who simply lodge their money in the banks and do not utilise it for the benefit of the people, or for the advancement of the interests of the country.  In my opinion these people should utilise the money they now have lying in the banks for the benefit of the people who were instrumental in raising such capital for them.  It seems to me that there are Deputies in this Dáil who want to save people with money lying idle in the banks.  The fact that there is so much money lying idle in the banks is largely responsible for the big amount of unemployment that exists at present in this country.  There are thousands of men out of work at present, and both they and their dependants are suffering the greatest hardship because of the fact that they are unable to get employment.</P>

      <P>I do not see any reason why this amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson would not be agreed to. It is not calculated, in any shape or form, to penalise any capitalists in the country. It simply deals with income tax.  We all know that there are a great many <Col N="222" /> wealthy people in this country who have all their money lodged in the banks. The money is locked up in them, and is not of any use to the country.  In my opinion the Minister for Finance, instead of charging them 5s. in the pound income tax on that money, should increase the charge to 10s., or else these people should be made take the money from the banks and utilise it for the development and benefit of the country.  If that were done, I think it would be a great means of saving the State.  As I have already said, we want no drones in this country.  We want every man to take off his coat and to do his part in helping to make the country prosperous and happy.  It is a terrible thing to reflect that you have thousands of people in this country living in circumstances of the greatest poverty and hardship, while there are millions of money lying idle in the banks.  Something will have to be done to relieve all these cases of hardship, and I hope the people with money will come forward and help the industrial movement in the country.  The settled conditions that now obtain in the country go to show that the present Government represents the majority of the people of this country, and when that fact is fully realised, I am sure capitalists will be only too delighted to pay the 5s. in the pound income tax in order to relieve the State of its great responsibility.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to the speeches on this subject. I do not think that Deputy Fitzgibbon need hold the gloomy view that he seems to hold, because in reality the proposition made by Deputy Johnson is not taken very seriously throughout the country.  The advocacy of Deputy Johnson on any question connected with industry and finance does not carry very far, and I think he will find that out at the next election. We have heard a good deal about Irish securities.  The reason that there is no confidence in Irish securities at present is because everything in Ireland is looked upon as absolutely insecure.  Any little industries we had during the last few years have been spoiled by the people engaged in them.  It is not a question of providing money in Ireland for industrial purposes; it is a question of distributing money amongst certain people who will not work.</P>

      <P>The first thing they try to do is to break up the industry.  We hear a lot about paying them, but we get very little return for what is paid to them. There has not been very much of a return. Go through the country and you will find industries broken up, because there is no effort made on the part of those engaged in the industries to work, and, consequently, there is no security. Industries of that description in any other country in the world are a success.  Why are they a failure in Ireland?  That is a plain question, and I want an answer to it.  Present methods will result in turning not alone the people Deputy FitzGibbon referred to, but every man in the country who has an investment, out of Ireland. They will not continue to pay double income tax; they will not pay tax here and in England.  They will either live here or in England.  If we were turning only a few landlords out of the country, it would not be a very big matter; but you will be turning ten times as many people out. You will be turning anyone who has any stake at all in the country away from it. The only way to restore confidence both in the country and in its industries is to show that our securities are really secure. We have heard talk here about patriots. I would like to know how many people in this country are really patriots.  I think patriotism is trotted out a bit too much. The great factor of human feeling seems to be lost sight of altogether when we talk about patriotism.  I have not met a lot of patriots in my time.  I met a few&mdash;but real patriots are very scarce.  When people talk about patriotism it is really only claptrap with a great many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Magennis has said, this proposition, coming from the people who put it up, is a confession of no faith in Irish industry and Irish effort.  I do not think they have any faith in them; a good many of us have not.  Except their attitude is changed altogether, I see no future for Irish industry.  Distribution would be a better word than investment; it would be nearer the mark and nearer the true meaning of the proposal.  There was a reference to people sweating.  If we had a little more sweat we would have a little more security.  Deputy Lyons spoke about sweat.  I have not seen a man sweating for twenty years.  If there were a little more, there would be greater <Col N="224" /> security and confidence in industry.  I would like to tell Deputy Lyons this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be fair to push this amendment, because we undertook that by reason of the change in the setting up of the Saorstát persons having investments should not get a jolt which any discrimination against them in the shape of double income tax would impose.  It would certainly not be fair.  There was no notice given that it was our intention to saddle them with an extra imposition, and any withdrawal of the relief which would be accorded by the double taxation order would certainly amount to a breach of faith, and would affect your credit not alone with regard to those people, but with regard to others who might possibly be inclined to invest in our own loan. There is nothing to prevent you in six months time from saying: &ldquo;We borrowed under very great difficulties; we were in a tight corner; and now we will take up this loan at 10 per cent. discount,&rdquo; or something of that sort.  It would not be fair, having regard to all the undertakings we have given, to withdraw now from any of those undertakings.  With regard to the second question mentioned by Deputy Johnson, I know full well that for a great many years past a good deal of criticism has been passed on the Banking Institutions and Corporations having <Col N="225" /> their investments in British or Foreign securities, as the case might be.  One must realise what the position of a Bank is.  A Bank takes in deposits and undertakes to pay them out again at very short notice.  It has never got what we would call a lease of any of the monies that are lodged there.  We know that people will not go into a bank on a given day and say: &ldquo;We want all the money that is there on deposit.&rdquo;  The banks, without at least some authority, must certainly have equivalent securities for the monies that have been lodged with them, so that they may be readily available and easily liquidated at very short notice.  There was no security in this country available for such investments. That is natural in a country like this, which had not got its own Parliament, and had not got the ordinary investments which would be easily liquidated.  Even if it had, I think it will be admitted that it is not wise for any country to restrict itself solely to investments within its own borders.  It will be recollected that a few years ago one of the most powerful countries&mdash;perhaps one of two of the most powerful countries&mdash;was confronted with a very, very serious banking crisis.  Those who studied that particular difficulty at the time know well what a serious thing it was for industry, commerce and business, and for the ordinary people of that nation.  The hundred millions or so that the Banks of this country have invested in English securities form a sort of reserve. They can easily liquidate those investments, and there is not any likelihood whatever of what we call a banking crisis in this country, having regard to the way in which the Banks' investments are made.  If one were to say to the Banks: &ldquo;You must sell out those and invest in something in this country,&rdquo;  I believe you would impose at once a banking crisis. In the first place, a huge quantity of investments would be unloaded on the market; and even if they got rid of them, what is there in this country to invest one hundred millions in at the moment and without inflating the prices?  Then, when it is invested, supposing it were put in Railway stock, Corporation stock, Guinness or any of those stocks, where is the reserve?  Each one of those particular investments would be at a higher price than what would be the normal price. I do not think that there would be any <Col N="226" /> justification for that.  Our business is to grow steadily, slowly, on a sound basis.  Even if one were to start new factories and large factories and so on, one would scarcely be justified in indulging in an experiment of that sort without making sure that there is a market, and without making sure that there will be stable industrial conditions and so on, Then we know very well here that it would be unreasonable to expect sound industrial business men accustomed only to running small businesses to branch out at once into huge extensions of the business they have experience of. Also, if these experiments were not a success you would find that other people would be deterred afterwards from making such experiments.  These experimental roads must not be tampered with, because there are very considerable concerns whose success is really attributable to the number of failures that have gone before them.  As people sometimes say: &ldquo;Fools build houses for wise men to live in,&rdquo; but if the wise men had built the houses they would be probably in the same position as the fools.  They are benefiting by the experiments of others.  We have £100,000,000 at the present moment invested in British securities.  I do not know if there is any machinery available at the moment to enable me to give the Dáil a return of the amount of British capital invested here.  I agree thoroughly that in order to stimulate interest in our own commerce, industry and business we ought have our money in it.  But I do not think that it would conduce towards investing our own money in it if you were to put a prohibition, or any coercion, upon the people who have other investments. These investments, at this moment, are equivalent to a surplus of exports over imports.  We know that the British system of finance and British credit, if I might say so, has been built up not to-day or yesterday, but over a very long period of years, and that on the Continent British banks and British securities generally hold a high place in the opinion of financiers.  That has been built up without any extraordinary alteration in the system, but by a gradual growth.  People who invest in them know that revolutionary changes in their financial system will not be embarked <Col N="227" /> upon, and that it is as a result of long years' experience and of close attention to a particular system that they have succeeded in maintaining their position even after the war.  A couple of years ago the English pound was worth 13/-. It is now worth 19/-.  One sees there, at least, that there has been considerable industry in the financial operations that have enabled them to restore the position with regard to that.  During the war, when there were great drains upon their resources, the system of taxation and everything in the nature of impositions were gradual.  After the undertaking that we have given and the promises that we have made and the actual equity of the case, I do not think we would be justified in refusing or in postponing the carrying out of the terms of the Order that we have already agreed to&mdash;the Double Taxation Order&mdash;and any infraction of it now would seriously damage our reputation and our credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, and I am not going to transgress the rules of debate in that respect.  I merely want to make a remark.  The essential thing in relation to the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson, on the other side, is that, in the first place, in laying the foundations of the financial affairs of this country of ours, we should give security. That is the first essential for success&mdash; that security should be given.  That security is being established, and that condition of affairs is being arrived at when the investors can realise that they <Col N="228" /> are going, in the first place, to have security.  After security comes returns. That is the profit from their investment. The fact of whether they will engage in investment here or somewhere else would be measured by them in relation to the extent or amount of profit that they are liable or likely to secure in return for the investment.  We must try, as far as we can, to give them an opportunity of being able to prove to themselves that they are on the road to make a good return&mdash; or as good a return, or perhaps a greater return&mdash;in the Saorstát than they will receive if they invested anywhere else, and that they will have an advantage instead of a disadvantage in investing here.  We, in laying the foundation here, should be anxious to have capital invested in this country, not because we stand behind capitalism, not because we are wedded in any way to capitalistic influences, or that we admire in any way the spirit that permeates and animates capitalism, but because we want to use capital as a means by which our people here may be enabled to earn their living, to secure a good position in which they can work out their own affairs, and bring up their families, and keep themselves in fair and reasonable conditions.  That is the fundamental issue with regard to capital here.  We do not want it as capital, but we want it for this express purpose that I have defined.  And these people, who have control of capital&mdash;if we want to use them we have to give them the advantages that I have here pointed out.</P>
      <P>Now, I think this double taxation merely means not to charge twice.  I think it relieves those who are resident in another country, and who have capital here, from paying Income Tax on that capital in both places&mdash;in the place where they earn the money and in the place where they reside.  I think that is the meaning of this Double Taxation Bill. I am sure it should be an equitable thing to say that we have no right to tax a man, first where he earns the money and then where he resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do that we certainly will make him take the money from the country where he earns it into the country where he resides, and where he is only likely to be called upon to pay one Income Tax. We have only one grievance with regard to our people here in this country.  A great many people tell us there is not <Col N="229" /> much money in the country.  I think myself that that to a large extent is false.  I believe that there is in this country a good deal of capital lying dormant.  It is in the hands of individuals who are not using it for any public purpose, or to any national advantage, or even for the laudable purpose of earning something on it for themselves.  There is a certain spirit of frugality in this country.  It has induced people to hoard money, and a great many of them have not yet learned how to invest it.  They are not versed in investments as people in other countries are.  The ordinary labouring man in other countries if he has capital to invest knows how to invest it, and he trusts to the security he gets.  Here we have a great deal of money lying uninvested.  A good deal will depend on ourselves at the start in this country, and upon the conditions, and I am very much afraid, I must admit, of this present Budget.  I am afraid it is going to be too oppressive.  I am very much alarmed about the danger of driving from the country the capital that will be necessary to lay for us here the foundations that we would wish to see laid.  It is very important and very imperative that we should have preferential conditions here over any of the neighbouring countries.  We are only divided here from a foreign country by a fence, and on all occasions the advantages of living at the other side of the fence will be pointed out. I think it is up to us at the present time to study very carefully whether we cannot by some financial ability perhaps&mdash; and we have that financial ability, I am sure, amongst the men who are in charge of the financial affairs here&mdash;discover some method by which we would not alone make secure the financial condition of affairs in the country, but at the same time not leave it in the mouths of those who are opposed to us in the countries that adjoin us to insinuate that this is a country to live out of.  Rather we should try to compel them to admit that this is a country to live in.  I do not like the 5s. Income Tax.</P>

      <P>One would imagine that this double taxation arrangement had been ordained at the time of Adam Smith, and that the absence of such relief between one country and another would mean the impossibility of investments as between one country and another ever taking place.  But it is quite a modern innovation, and was arranged between Britain and her Colonies, but it was arranged in such a way and at such a time that the income tax in those particular dominions was very much smaller than the income tax in the British Isles. The amendment does not attempt to curtail or to prevent or to interfere with the rights of the owner of monies to invest in securities outside the Saorstát.  There is no attempt to prevent any exercise of that liberty.  What it does try to bring about is that you are not going to use the machine of legislation and the finances of the country to induce Irish capitalists to invest their money in England, because that is what the effect of the Relief Bill is going to be.  It is going to encourage and induce Irish capitalists to invest their money in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One heard with some regret the speech of the Minister for Finance on this Bill, because it showed, I think, pretty plainly that he had been completely caught up with the British ideas of finance and economics and commerce, and I think that it is a bad look out for the future of the country.  We all know the extraordinary position that the City of London has occupied in the financial world for many years, and of course we know that the Continental banks recognise that fact. But Continental investors have money invested in England, and British investors have money invested in France and other countries.  There is no reciprocal <Col N="231" /> arrangement of this kind, and it does not prevent investments between one country and another.  The British financial system, no doubt, has been extraordinarily beneficial to British financiers.  It will continue to be successful, and just as long as we are prepared to be drawn to that system, to follow it implicitly, to allow ourselves to be caught up in the toils of it, just so long are we going to decline the benefits that political liberty would bring in its course.  It seems to me, from the Minister's statement that we can look forward to a financial and commercial policy which will ensure that there will be no change in commerce and industry and finance from that which has prevailed hitherto.  That, I think, is a very regrettable decision on the part of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey put a plain question when he asked &ldquo;Why are the factories through the country idle; why have they been a failure?&rdquo;  Partly because of the extraordinary pre-eminence of British finance &mdash;because of the extraordinary position the British commercial system has allowed Britain to occupy, and partly because of the inability of Irish owners of factories and workshops and fields to get the most out of their businesses and to organise them properly.  Inefficiency on the part of the owners of fields and farms and factories&mdash;that is the reason that these undertakings have so often failed.  One would imagine that the picture that Deputy Fitzgibbon drew of capital going across, day by day, by the mail boat was one that represented the truth.  The facts are, of course, that this country, as every other country, lives by its yearly produce, and though it might be a comparative calamity and regrettable that gentlemen whom Deputy Fitzgibbon spoke of, should decide finally never to return to Ireland and that such investments as they have in Ireland should be transferred&mdash;presumably to effect the transfer it would be necessary for somebody to purchase their holdings&mdash; although that might be regettable, it is not going to be all calamity.  The country can survive even the absence of any <Col N="232" /> particular group of its present citizens who prefer to have their homes where their investments are.  The credit of the country, as has been said before in the Dáil resides in the ability of the people of the country to extract wealth from the soil of the country and that can go on as long as the people are here to labour and to consume.  We are not going to be frightened by the picture of capital leaving by the mail boats.  We are told that the proposal to refrain from relieving investors abroad from income tax&mdash;to make sure that the investors in London North Western Stock, for instance, would be just as much entitled to pay income tax to the Irish Exchequer as the investors in Great Southern and Western Stock&mdash;we are told that if we remove the relief we are offering the investors in British securities, we are compelling people to invest money in securities in which they have no confidence. The proposition does not do anything of the kind.  It simply says that if they prefer, above all things, to have their investments in British securities they shall not by that fact be relieved from paying income tax to the Irish Exchequer.  It seems to me that the case made for relief has not been sound or conclusive.  I do not know what promises or undertakings have been given that the Minister for Finance referred to.  I do not think the Dáil has given any undertakings.  It passed an Act respecting the relief of taxation.  There was nothing in that that said that it would be taxation of income that there would be relief from.  It provided that certain arrangements might be made. The Dáil has not yet passed any particular arrangements, and I do not think that any undertaking that the Dáil has not entered into need necessarily be fulfilled. I feel that the amendment is one that ought to be pressed, and that we ought to test the feeling of the Dáil upon it.  Therefore, I propose to ask the Dáil to express itself by a division.</P>

      <P>It was stated yesterday that, owing to the shortness of the time for giving notice, amendments might be moved in manuscript, and, therefore, I rise to move in paragraph A of the first resolution to delete the words, &ldquo;five shillings in the pound,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof, &ldquo;four-and-sixpence in the pound.&rdquo;  That amendment is open at once to the suggestion that was more or less thrown out yesterday by the Minister for Finance that, though some of us had adversely criticised the adoption of the English system, nevertheless we desired to get conformity with it now.  I think, of course, that is a perfectly possible and perfectly plausible charge to make, but the substance of the reason for such a deduction is this: that if are going to adhere without change to the general system of taxation that we have taken over from the previous Government in this country, it then becomes a matter of the very first importance to us to see that in taking over that system we should not permit any part of it to fall behind in comparison with what the English system is changed to, and so that we may not have what I described yesterday as an invidious comparison to be thrown up against us.  I said here yesterday, and I think the Minister for Finance agreed with me in general terms, that ultimately it will become necessary to revise our entire system of taxation and our entire fiscal policy, so as to make it suitable to the conditions of this country, because the system we have taken over was provided and devised so as to be suitable to the conditions of a country wholly different from this.  As the Minister has said, a change will have eventually to come about, but the present system will last for a large number of years&mdash;he said ten years&mdash;an unnecessarily long time&mdash;but he stated a very important truth when he said that the change would have to come in instalments, bit by bit, and not entirely and at once.  I think it is unfortunate, seeing that this change will have to come about, that it should not begin at once. However, I am not going into that, at the moment, because it is possible that there will be no change.  So far a decision is taken, and it will be very difficult to alter it, but seeing that we have undertaken what is practically a facsimile of the English system, then I urge it should be kept as a facsimile until we have decided to make certain drastic changes.  I do not propose to repeat any of the arguments that arose on the previous amendment.</P>

      <P>The arguments <Col N="235" /> advanced by several deputies on the previous amendment are, generally speaking, applicable to the amendment now before us, because where one's treasure is, as Deputy Johnson said, quoting from a very high authority, one's heart must be also.  There will be a tendency undoubtedly, a very natural tendency, that we cannot question or criticise, to the sending of treasure out of this country, if it can be done so profitably.  I think that we cannot, at the present moment, afford to allow ourselves to be subjected to the unfortunate comparisons that were made in this regard yesterday.  In the public press they put the citizen of this country, in this particular matter, at a very serious drawback, seeing that people who have capital to dispose of could easily transfer themselves and their capital to England, and so live under a cheaper rate of income tax.  Now, I have endeavoured to assess what the change might mean.  I notice, in one of the papers given to us, that property income tax includes super-tax, mineral rights' duty, and comes roughly, in round figures, to £5,000,000.  One might safely assume that every shilling brings in a million of revenue.  A reduction of that by sixpence would, therefore, mean that the State would have to forego revenue up to a sum of £500,000.  I notice, also, among the estimates for the new year, that the estimate for the Army is £10,664,000.  One is very glad to note definitely that the conditions of war that have prevailed for the last seven or eight months are disappearing, and that we are definitely approaching a period of peace and settlement.  I suggest that under the changed conditions it might be very easy to economise in the estimated army expenditure to the tune of the odd sum of £664,000, and to employ the savings so made to the relief of income tax.  Let the one balance against the other, with this end in view: in the first place, that we might be saved from the criticisms that the benefits to the country projected under the Free State are not accruing, and, in the second place, citizens may be enabled to be maintained in this country, and not be obliged to go abroad because of a lower scale of taxation.  Had the system been changed, such criticisms as I am now making&mdash;and this is the whole purport of my present amendment&mdash;might not <Col N="236" /> necessarily have matured, but seeing that we have frankly taken over, without change, the English system, then let us frankly abide by the condition, so that there may be no unfortunate comparisons.</P>

      <P>Deputy Figgis, in referring to certain statements made by me yesterday seems to have misunderstood a good deal of what I intended to convey.  Perhaps I did not convey it, but I will convey it now.  What I see useful in the English system is, number one, its success, and, number two, the fact that it is evidently built on a sound basis.  The difference between the British Budget and our Budget, both last year and this year, is a very considerable difference.  In one case there is a surplus of money and in the other case there is a surplus which nobody has discovered except the Deputy who proposes now to reduce this Income Tax by sixpence in the pound.  Now, as far as they are concerned, they are entitled to reduce their Income Tax by 6d. in the £, having also reduced other items.  One of them, I am sure, is a tax that the Deputy does not take any interest in, and others perhaps are taxes which other people do not take any interest in.  At any rate, there has been a generous distribution of the benefits that have been derived from a very successful financial year.  Have we got these benefits?  We have not.  Evidence is brought before me occasionally that wages are not as high in England as they are here.  Now, if wages are higher here, obviously the circulation of money must be, to some extent, affected beneficially, and the people must have gained by that extra wage that is paid here.  If that is the case, obviously people who handle more money proportionately than they are handling in England are better able, by reason of that money they are handling, to pay Income Tax to the amount they are asked to pay here, that is, 6d. in the £ over what they are paying in England. Now, in the first place you have got no surplus.  You have not got a balance or anything approaching a balance, and you have not yet considered the Estimates, and no matter how you would consider them, if you are going to reduce this from 5s. to 4s. 6d you ought to be able to <Col N="237" /> show somewhere or other in that estimate a method of reducing your estimated expenditure to the tune of £500,000.  Even taking it on the method that the Deputy suggested yesterday of spreading over a number of years the charges that are not legitimate charges to be placed upon this particular year that we are entering into now, it must be borne in mind that these charges cannot be looked upon as a National Debt, because you could not say that any national benefit has been derived, which shall extend over a number of years, by reason of the discharge of the liabilities which we have to bear under the Damage to Property Act.  Even having paid them, and having discharged your liabilities to the people to whom this compensation is due, you have got no national benefit to look to, nor can we say we have got material benefits on which we would be entitled to bank.  Looking at it in that way there has been no case put up for a reduction of Income Tax from 5s. to 4s. 6d. There are other taxes which affect other people very much more materially than this tax of 6d. in the £ over England, and those people are entitled to ask: &ldquo;If there be a reduction in taxation where is our portion of it?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, of all the taxes that are being imposed that I know of, I think there is no tax as fair as Income Tax, and the pity is that the entire taxation of the country is not raised by Income Tax on every person in the country, no matter what his income is.  If we pay taxes on tea or sugar or beer or whiskey we know full well that the cost of collection of that tax is out of all proportion to the cost of the collection of the Income Tax.  In other words, it does not matter to a trader who takes a puncheon of spirits out of bond and who has to pay £300 in duty whether he has to pay it to the manufacturer or the Government.  This money has to be paid down, and it is immaterial to the trader to whom he pays it.  If he has to borrow it he has to pay 5 per cent., and in handling that money it is the same to him as if the manufacturer had charged him that price.  He must also have the profit, and his profit is the cost of the collection of that £300 for the State.  To that extent it appears to me that there is a considerable waste in certain of the taxes, but that is the system that the various countries in the world <Col N="238" /> have adopted in collecting their revenues. I regret very much indeed that in this the first year of the Saorstát our taxes should be in excess of the taxes of another portion of our State.  We are entering into a consideration of the boundary question at a serious disadvantage, and at a time when, if it were not for the disorders that have occurred and for the non-acceptance of the people's decision with regard to every question in the country, we might be more favourably circumstanced. We had to enter into the consideration of that very important question at a most serious discount, and it is no argument to put back to us that we are not able to solve every question when people take the ground and materials for solving those questions out of our hands.  It is no use to us to say that the particular portion of the instrument that we have subscribed to is defective when other people have made that instrument as defective as they can, and if they take from us every opportunity we would and should have if it were not for a certain madness seizing upon certain people.  I appreciate the importance of that particular tax being at the same figure in the South as in the North, but I wonder has the Deputy considered what is the respective ability in both the South and North to bear this particular tax at the moment.  As I said before, on the question of our fiscal arrangements and on our financial matters to-day, one cannot solve or hope to get a solution for such important questions in mere amendments or mere alteration or mere arbitrary suggestions regarding the method of treatment. When the time comes to consider not alone the question of taxation but also the fiscal question, even after the most careful examination that can take place on it, one will find that amendments will have to be introduced year after year to meet the changing circumstances or to meet certain misinterpretations or miscalculations that will inevitably creep into a subject so vast and so exhaustive and so important to the State.  The most important consideration I put to the Dáil in dealing with this matter is, &ldquo;are you justified in reducing the revenue of the State by half a million pounds simply because the British Government has been able to reduce its particular taxation under that head?&rdquo;<Col N="239" /> I submit that having regard first to our liabilities, to the serious and enormous liabilities that we have got to undertake, in order that this State may function, that we must bear some of the taxation in this, the first year of our new State. If you start out by showing not alone to your own people, but to the whole world, that you want to be able to shout out the battle cry of freedom or your equality with the North or your equality with Great Britain, and the cost of that is refusing to pay your debts, I think that you are going to do more damage to the credit of the State, and to the State's estimate of its responsibilities, than you are going to gain from the mere paltry saving of half a million pounds to the pockets of people affected.</P>
    <P>Now, I observe in looking at the newspapers, in the very limited time that I have to look at them, that one particular paper has urged a reduction of the Income Tax from 5s. to 4s. 6d.  The same paper, dealing with some of our taxation, or at least dealing with the setting up of our own Customs and Excise, wanted to know if the Border Customs and the collection of Customs at the Port of Dublin, direct by ourselves, means that we are to lose immediately £3,500,000, because that particular item in our estimate is lower by £3,500,000.  One can see at once what infantile experts there are engaged, when such a question as that is put.  I do not think it is necessary to explain to the Dáil that by reason of a huge firm like Guinness's paying its Excise Duties here, when the British Government collects its duties at Holyhead, there must be an extraordinary difference in those two items.  That is responsible for that particular item, and not the setting up of the Customs as a fact in itself.  In other words, the mere setting up of Customs does not mean that we lose £3,500,000 at once; it simply means adjustments that had to take place, and they will not be shown in the same way next year.  I feel rather keenly about this matter.  I think, having regard to the fact that there is a big expenditure of money on the Army this year, a much larger expenditure than there was last year, and a very much larger expenditure than there will be next year, when we contemplate that within 12 months <Col N="240" /> there will be decreed in our courts something like twenty millions of money, and when that sum will be put into circulation in the country I think it is a year in which the people can better afford to bear sixpence in the pound more on their Income Tax than even they can bear in the North or in England.  Certainly we are justified in that distinction anyway as between here and the North. I do admit that in certain cases there is an unequal charge.  There are, for example, people who have small investments and nothing else; they will certainly have to bear it.  The country, however, could not go through what it has, I hope, successfully emerged from for the last twelve months, without at least bearing some of the cost.  For that purpose and for the purpose that we may in this, our first year, make a special effort to meet the costs we have to meet, I think the Dáil ought to be satisfied that we have not increased taxation.  If there is to be a decrease, it ought not to be on one particular item of taxation alone, and therefore, I could not accept the amendment.</P>

He used the words&mdash;not imputing them to me&mdash;&ldquo;simply because of what the English Government has done.&rdquo;  That is not the reason why the amendment is moved. It is moved for the reason I stated; if we decide to drop from 5s. to 4s. 6d. we will retain the citizens and lose half a million of money.  If we keep the tax at the higher rate we will still lose the money, and we will also lose the citizens.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil agrees with the Committee in this resolution.  I will make a brief explanation in regard to paragraph <i>(c).</i>  The reason for continuing the annual value is that, owing to the amount of work involved in making assessments on property, it is not possible for the Revenue Department to face this question this year.  A loss of revenue will arise on account of that, but this cannot be helped at the present, when the trained staff is not sufficient to cope with the difficulties. The bulk of the losses will arise in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving that the Dáil do agree with this Resolution I may perhaps give a little explanation.  It has been mentioned in the Press that we are going to call upon business people to do some accountancy work and to place them in the very unenviable position of imposing additional duties upon them, and to generally interfere with the ordinary discharge of their business.  That is a misrepresentation of this resolution. The reason for it is that for the year 1921 there are 3,725 cases of persons owing under £100 and for 1922 there are 6,861 such cases.  The taxes covered in this respect amount to not less than a quarter of a million pounds.  As regards cases of persons owing more than £100, there are 200 for 1920-21 and 423 for 1921-22. The actual tax involved there is £115,000. The position as regards Dublin City is that the arrears due from employees, exclusive of workmen, amount to something like £365,000.  Making allowance for deductions which may be claimed, the net sum involved is not less than £300,000 for Dublin City only.  The exact method in which we intend to move in those cases is that an assessment will be served on the employer of a man having £1,000 or £500 a year, as the case may be.  He will be ordered to deduct the tax from the salary of his manager or whatever official belongs to the firm.  If the case be put up to the Revenue Commissioners that this man cannot pay the full first instalment at once arrangements can be made for having instalments extended over a certain period.  Objections have been made by business people that pretty big claims for Income Tax, if demanded at once, would have a very serious effect on their business.  I have not heard of any case in which, the circumstances having been explained by the person or the business firm, the Revenue Commissioners did not meet it fairly.  No complaint has been made, but we must remember that unless some facility is afforded the Revenue Commissioners they will not be able to collect this money, and the collection of this money is vital to the revenue.  After passing through two or three years of what we have passed through, and having a huge <Col N="242" /> pile of arrears, exceptional steps must be taken in order to collect them.  If there be a desire to pay there is a corresponding desire on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to meet the persons concerned. If there be a desire to evade responsibility, then we must take other steps to deal with them.  This, as far as we know, is the most expeditious, the cheapest, and the most efficient way.  It is an innovation, I admit, but it is an innovation that is certainly justified by the circumstances.  Within the last few years I have heard of cases in which Income Tax Collectors were told that they would not be paid their money.  They said: &ldquo;Well, it is not different to what people have said to us who are different in political outlook to you.&rdquo;  That is, it was not altogether a question of politics; it was really a question of money. That money is there; it should have been paid before this; it is now due.  There is no more suitable method of collection that we know of.  It is not an unfair method; it will not tax the resources of business establishments to any considerable extent.  It will, in fact, be easier than affixing insurance stamps in regard to the National Health Insurance and deducting coppers from the ordinary working man.  I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agrees with the Committee in this Resolution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly what the Minister for Finance said is true, that this is an effective method, and that in the circumstances an effective method of collection is called for. Can nothing further be said in favour of the proposal, for that is not sufficient to recommend it?  The Minister for Finance has assumed the simplest case.  It is the simplest case that he clearly has before his mind.  A.B. has one source of income, and one source only.  The income tax collectable upon that is to be paid by him within a certain date, or by his employer.  In a case like that the machinery proposed is quite simple, always pre-supposing that the employer is willing to become a tax collector for the State.  Employers have declared their unwillingness to take on that function. With them I have little sympathy.  I may as well be frank and honest about <Col N="243" /> the matter at once.  I think a good citizen's duty is to assist the Government of the country in every way that is convenient, and that is not inimical to the transaction of his own business.  Take the case of a man who has many sources of income, and this machinery fails to operate.  I take the case of a man who is assessible in more than one district of the city or county of Dublin.  Now, this is my own grievance.  I am obliged to fill up a form, in which I disclose all my intimate affairs in several offices to several officials, who will, bye-and-bye, send along several separate collectors, each of whom carries in his pocket a complete account of my financial position. I shall be told, no doubt incidentally, that each of those is under a solemn vow of secrecy, but I know, under the late administration, in a moment when he was off his guard, a collector who had happy recollections of me as an examiner, told me he was only lent to this Department, whereupon I asked him, &ldquo;Have you not taken the oath?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;What oath?&rdquo; and then I had him in my power.  Supposing a person who is assessible in various districts has to go from office to office in order to get the exemptions to which he is entitled, you can imagine how many of his working days during a working year would be occupied with setting official after official right, because in those offices they have an unlimited capacity not for taking pains but for making pains.  Genius has been defined as &ldquo;an unlimited capacity for taking pains.&rdquo;  They have a perverted genius of that type.  How is my employer to deduct from me the Income tax that is due?  He does not know.  You may say he knows as much as concerns the transaction between him and me. Yes, but he does not know how far that amount is qualified by other sources of income.  Am I to disclose to him what these other sources of income are?  The thing becomes intensely complicated, and in its complication it becomes unjust. There is another thing; there must be reciprocity.  If the employer is to come to the aid of the State by collecting the tax in this peremptory and exacting fashion, so, too, the collecting-side must undergo a transformation.  There must be a new spirit.  There has been no greater tyranny&mdash;I speak only of what I know&mdash;than the operations of the Inland <Col N="244" /> Revenue under the British administration. Every petty clerk was not a petty tyrant but a monstrous tyrant.  I make a claim for expenses.  He refuses to allow them.  There are all sorts of claims to which, in justice, I am entitled.  He will hear nothing of them.  The only answer that he will make is: &ldquo;Very well, then, we will send in the bailiffs.&rdquo; There is no possibility of saving oneself from them.  I hope that a new spirit&mdash; a clean heart&mdash;is going to enter into Income Tax collecting in the Free State. It will have to be reciprocal.  If we are to pass legislation which makes it impossible for a man who receives a salary from an employer to escape paying Income Tax, it ought to be equally impossible for the Income Tax Collector to refuse to him those measures of relief to which he is supposed to be entitled.  I know of income tax-payers who are assessed at random.  I was told by one collector that a certain colleague of mine on the medical side had refused steadfastly, year after year, to fill up a form, and that they had been assessing him on an ascending scale year after year, and had not yet found his limit.  That is delightful when one is in the medical profession, but it is very easy, unfortunately, to find the limit of most other men in that regard.  I used to be under a foolish impression that one was entitled to a certain allowance for expenses. A barrister invariably charges a proportionate amount for his study because it is a place in which he transacts a certain amount of his business.  Other men charge for a renewal of their libraries, and I very soon discovered that there was an insane regulation in regard to this matter.  If I pretend that the amount I charge for books is in respect of renewal of books which, formerly, I had, and which got worn out, the amount will be allowed, but if, as is the case, the money is expended in the purchase of new books, which mean an addition to my library, I am not entitled to any allowance.  I am only entitled to allowance for renewals.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is liable to be prosecuted under the Truck Act for making an employer pay his men less than they earn.  However, I do not suppose that will apply in this case.  In my opinion a lot can be said in favour of this proposal.  Would it not be a nice thing if, through inefficiency, the revenue of this country were to be diminished by £300,000?  It would mean that those men who willingly or who, through force of law, are paying their Income Tax, would be shouldering the burden of other people who, through inefficient methods of the Revenue, would be escaping.  Therefore I think that this resolution will prove effective and very simple in operation.  Although it will create friction between employers and employes, because it is an effective and useful resolution, I think it should be adopted without further comment.</P>

      <P>I am against this resolution for the reason that the introduction of this method of collecting debt is going to be harmful, as an example to the future.  The intention is to permit these &ldquo;leopards who do not change their spots,&rdquo; that Deputy Magennis has spoke of, not only to fix the amount of the debt but to name the collector of the debt and to punish the collector if he fails to collect.  For two or three years back&mdash;the argument runs&mdash;men have not paid their Income Tax.  My contention is, as I have stated before, that there has been no Income Tax due by any citizen of this State or lawfully imposed for the last three years, and that those people who have paid Income Tax have done it as a voluntary act and as a matter of voluntary taxation.  The proposal is to put what is called an &ldquo;Income Tax debt&rdquo; in a category by itself, as compared with, say, the amount that one of Deputy Wilson's clients owes him for milk.  I do not see why that particular debt should be put into a position of preference as compared <Col N="246" /> with the tailor's bill, the grocer's bill, or the milk provider's bill.  More than that, analogy is closer if one speaks of the amount due for rates.  I see a very small difference between a proposition of this kind, which would allow the Income Tax officials to send an employer a notice that he must deduct from his employé's wages or salary a certain sum, weekly or monthly or quarterly, as Income Tax, and some other official of the Government saying to an employer that he must deduct from such and such a person so much weekly or monthly or quarterly for rates.  Another official may come along and say that a judgment has been awarded for a debt for groceries, clothes, bread, or milk and that the employer must be called upon to collect that debt from the debtor.  I foresee the danger of the extension of this principle and I think that it is a bad principle to introduce in regard to the collection of debts.  The amounts involved, no doubt, are very large, but the collection of a debt for Income Tax&mdash;if it is a debt legally recoverable&mdash;surely ought to follow the ordinary courses of debt collection. Why should an employer in the one case, be called upon to act as a debt collector and why should he be brought into a new relationship with his employés&mdash; a new and a worse relationship than ever?  I have no doubt that it will be quoted against me that the employer is already collecting Health Insurance Tax and Unemployment Insurance Tax, but that is in a somewhat different category inasmuch as it is insurance and an insurance in which the workman has a personal part and is a conscious participator. But here we have the case of debts that have been growing for two or three years back and in the case of these debts&mdash;and only in their case&mdash;we are asked to throw upon the employer a new responsibility and to create a further antagonism between himself and his employé.</P>
      <P>Now I say it is a bad principle to encourage and there is no logical reason that I can understand why the same process should not be adopted for the collection of debt for rates and the collection of debt for milk or for groceries, or clothing or any other debt whatever. I believe that the process of the law in regard to debt collection should be availed of in this particular case as in every other.</P>

      <P>I object to the imposition of this task upon the employers in the country.  There must be some reason why this three hundred thousand pounds figure was not collected in the county and the city of Dublin The reason, I imagine, is that the official who should do this duty of collection has not fulfilled his duty.  There may be another reason, and that is, that the Minister for Finance did not give him due support; but the collection, I imagine, should take place by the ordinary process of law.  It is altogether too bad that employers, at any time, should be compelled to do the duty of officials, and to relieve officials of the duty they should perform and pass it on to employers.  This is only one instance, but it may be applied to any number of debts handled by any individual of the State, and for that reason I absolutely object to this class of work whereby you make employers do the duty of some official who is paid to do that duty himself.</P>

      <P>There is one consideration that is weighing upon my mind that I would like to put before the Minister for Finance and the Dáil, as to why I think it would be impolitic and unwise to adopt a procedure of this kind.  Everybody knows in industrial matters that for every strike that occurs there are at least five or six occasions when friction between employers and employed gets very near to a strike.  The least addition to that friction, on that margin point, will accumulate industrial disputes in the future.  Now surely it is the intention of the Government, and should be the desire of the Government, to try and bring that friction down to the minimum point, not to give it an abundant opportunity of increase.  Surely it is obvious that this Resolution is going to give that abundant opportunity of increase.  I may prove to be wrong, but I do feel that the effect of this resolution will be to bring about such a spirit between employer and employed as will lead to continual irritation and continual exasperation which exists only too abundantly in a plentiful outcrop of industrial disputes that might have been averted had better relations been maintained.  I do urge that this matter is worthy of careful consideration.  Obviously as this Income Tax must be collected, there is <Col N="248" /> no question but that this method would be a very effective method to achieve that end.  My opposition is not on that ground, but on the ground that it would be peculiarly effective in creating a number of little exasperations and irritations as between employer and employed. There might be some moment when a little tact and a little understanding could establish all that good relation that may avert a strike or a lock-out in some industry, and that good feeling would be brought down to the lowest point by means of the procedure set up by this resolution which will produce industrial disputes that might otherwise be avoided.</P>

      <P>Before the motion is put I desire to ask a question, though I am not inclined to take part in the discussion upon these rather bare Resolutions.  I think the Finance Bill will give a better opportunity for raising a discussion on them.  There is a matter, however, which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance, and I think this stage, on this particular Resolution, affords me the best opportunity to do so.  I refer to the position of persons employed in the Dáil during the time of the war with England.  It seems to me that it would be manifestly unfair that these persons should now be compelled to pay Income Tax on their then salaries.  I suggest it would be manifestly unfair for this reason: I do not think it can be denied that these persons, every one of them, were employed at whatever salary may have been fixed in any particular case, on the quite distinct understanding that that was a payment which they would receive without deduction.  We had no Income Tax to impose, and these people were not expected to pay Income Tax imposed by British law.  That being the case, I put it to the Minister that it would be only equitable that he should make provision whereby, when he is trying to recover arrears of Income Tax of the past years from people whose salary or remuneration was obtained on an express or implied understanding that it would not be subject to any deduction, they should not now find that they have a very considerable burden before them of finding money to pay Income Tax upon what at the moment of receipt they very naturally <Col N="249" /> and very properly took to be remuneration which would not be subject to any such tax.</P>

      <P>I would like to have further particulars about the cases to which Deputy Gavan Duffy refers.  I would like also to inform the Deputy that the question is not one for the Minister for Finance whether &ldquo;A&rdquo; is only to be charged so much and &ldquo;B&rdquo; is to get so much of a deduction.  That is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, and, as I have said already, the Revenue Commissioners must get the last penny that <Col N="250" /> they are entitled to, but they do not look for more, and they have not been unreasonable in any cases.  They have not been unreasonable in such cases as those mentioned that I know of, even though they have more power in this matter than the Minister for Finance.  These particular matter refer to Schedules D and E, and these Schedules do not affect the people Deputy Figgis has in mind.  I now move: &ldquo;That the Dáil do agree with the Committee in the said Resolution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am raising the question of the condition of citizens of the Saorstat who happen to be in terned within the Six Counties.  I want to mention a particular case of a citizen &mdash;I understand he is a citizen&mdash;who has got two or three brothers serving with the National Army.  He is a resident of Co. Louth, and some two or three weeks ago he crossed over into Co. Armagh to visit a married sister.  He passed the Royal Ulster Constabulary Barracks, was arrested, and has since been interned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solicitors who represent him have been informed by the Royal Ulster Constabulary that he is interned under one of the Sections of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations, which are apparently still operative up there. There are numbers of others, not very many, perhaps, who are claiming to be citizens of the Saorstat, and who, happening to find themselves within the Six County area, and within the reach of either the Ulster Specials or the R.U. Constabulary, have been arrested and dumped into the internment ship under Craig's Government.  I should like the the Dáil to be informed as to what steps the Ministry can take to interfere on behalf of those citizens.  There is a great deal of traffic backwards and forwards between the Six Counties and <Col N="251" /> the Saorstat.  So far as I know, nobody from the Six Counties who has crossed into the Saorstat, unless he or she has been actively opposing the Saorstat Government, has been interfered with inside our area.  Outside the Saorstat, citizens of ours have been interfered with and interned.  The case I mention is that of an employee of a Dublin firm. There are other cases of persons, some of whom, perhaps, are natives of Ulster, but who have been resident, or in business in the Saorstat.  For some reason or other, without any charge being made against them, and at a time when there is no activity, so far as any of us knows, being carried on within the Six Counties against the Government there, those people are arrested and interned.  A number of those may be released on certain conditions.  A certain number of internees have been released on certain conditions.  The main conditions are that they will clear out of the Six County area.  They can go to the Saorstát, go to England, or anywhere they like, but to secure their release they are informed that their release is only on condition that they clear out of the Six Counties. I should like the Ministry to tell us whether they interfered in any way on behalf of these citizens, or what steps they would advise should be taken on their behalf.</P>

      <P>The jurisdiction of the Saorstát extends only over the Twenty-six Counties.  There have been a number of cases that I, personally, have enquired into, and most of them have been technical breaches of the law in the Six Counties.  If the Deputy would let me know of any definite cases in which men are arrested for merely crossing over the Border, and in which there is nothing in the nature of a charge urged against them, I would be glad to hear of them.</P>

      <P>The case that has been referred to by Deputy O'Shannon was brought to the notice of the Minister for Home Affairs about three weeks ago, and I understand the Minister for External Affairs has had some notification of the particular case.  It is the case of one Osborne; and the information that has <Col N="252" /> been supplied to me in the matter is that this particular man's business, at least his going into the Six County area, was entirely a matter of innocence and social amenities.  As I understand it, no charge whatever is preferred, no technical offence has been charged against him, and they have exercised what they had deemed to be their rights to intern this man under the provisions of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act. Now we have got into the unfortunate position that I suppose is not easy to make representations in such a case. But I wonder whether there have been any cases of commercial travellers, visitors from the Six County area, who have been arrested on suspicion in the Saorstát and interned.  I think there is just as much justification for such arrests and internments in the case of residents of the Six County area coming into this country and conducting business which may, or may not, be innocent, travelling from one town to another with messages conveying information of a kind which may be innocent, but which may not be innocent, just as this man was presumed by the Government of the Northern area to have been one that ought to be arrested.  There has been no charge against him, no evidence, and he is interned. I think it might be well to understand from the Government whether any such similar cases have arisen, and whether the Ministry have had under observation any of these frequent commercial travellers and the like coming from the Six County area into the Twenty-six Counties of the Saorstat.</P>
