      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance, (1) if he can state the number of pre-truce claims for malicious injury to property and person in the County of Mayo; (2) the amount represented by those claims; (3) if he is aware that considerable privation exists through the non-investigation and non-payment of the claims in question; (4) if he is aware that the County Court Judge has, unmolested, gone on circuit in Mayo; (5) that large garrisons are maintained in all the principal towns; and (6) such being the case, why cannot the Malicious Injury Commission, or one of its sub-commissions, hold courts for the investigation of claims in the county?</P>

      <P>I am informed that the number of claims registered by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission from the County of Mayo, is 1,834, and that the amount represented by these claims is not available at the present time.  I understand that the Commission are at present investigating some Mayo claims, and will deal with the others at the earliest practicable moment.  The Government is not in a position even if it so desired, to issue directions to the Commission, which is an independent international body.  The number of awards being notified by the Commission for the country generally has been increasing very much of late.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Fisheries if he is aware:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  that in 1919 the Department of Agriculture issued an order extending the mouth of the Carrowbeg or Westport River about 1 ¼ miles seaward, and a like distance from its natural outlet.</P>
      <P>(2)  that this extension runs through the fairway channel of Westport Harbour.</P>
      <P>(3)  that fishing was prohibited within a specific distance of the artificial mouth then defined.</P>
      <P>(4)  that this extension was authorised for the promotion of a private interest, and as an aid to private pleasure, and confiscated the rights of fishermen working for a livelihood.</P>
      <P>(5)  that seeing that this unnatural extension serves no useful or national purpose, will the Minister cancel the order authorising such extension and if the order extending the mouth of the Moyour River, which was issued at the same time as the order extending the mouth of the Carrowbeg River, and for the same purpose, will also be cancelled?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Finian Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The order made by the Department in 1918 did not extend, but defined for the first time, the mouth of <Col N="1592" /> the Carrowbeg or Westport River.  The defined mouth of the river crosses the fairway channel of Westport Harbour. The prohibition of netting for salmon within half a mile of the mouth of a river is fixed by statute, to secure that a proper supply of fish may ascend to the spawning grounds, and thus maintain the stock in the river.  The Department merely defined the limit of prohibition.  The mouth of the river was not defined in favour of a private interest.  A public inquiry was held at Westport, of which due notice was issued, before the definition was made, and no objection was offered by the local net fishermen.  If a demand for an inquiry with a view to altering the mouths of the Rivers Carrowbeg and Moyour is made, the question of holding it will be considered.</P>

I wish to ask him if the spawning beds referred to were not formed immediately before, or since the enquiry of 1919, and is he aware that this Carrowbeg River was never a salmon river, and never will be?</P>

      <P>I may say, first of all, I have received a message from the Governor-General in respect of these moneys, and I now move this Resolution. It is a formal Resolution rendered necessary by the money character of the Bill that the Dáil is considering just now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to this as a formal Resolution.  He has argued, and his argument has prevailed with the Dáil, that this is the time for such Resolutions to be brought forward in all cases where money is affected by Bills.  But I think we have the right to accept the intentions of the Ministry in proposing these formal Resolutions and to discuss the purpose&mdash; to take advantage of the opportunity to raise the financial issue, which the Government provides by putting down this Resolution before the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The present Resolution goes into some detail, and seems to me to be unnecessarily definite.  Hitherto the Resolutions we have had of this kind have not only been formal, but they have been indefinite, leaving everything pretty well open for future discussion.  But this Resolution is very definite, and refers to compensations and payments and particular kinds of damage, the method of paying, the authorisation to pay securities, and so on.  That authorisation, I may say, without going into details, which I will leave to the Minister himself or to other Deputies who wish to raise them, practically says that we authorise the creation of an indefinite amount of securities.  I think it well to draw the attention of the Dáil to Sub-section (1) of (<i>a</i>), and to ask the Dail particularly to note that this authorisation to expend moneys is confined to damage to property. There have been, as we all know, many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cases of men and women who have suffered personal damage: loss of limbs, eyes, and life, but they are not to be compensated.  I had hoped that we would have heard, or at least that we would have read, a proposal from the Ministry to make provision for compensation for personal injury, but that has not been done.  Therefore, I think it is necessary to draw the particular attention of the Dáil to this fact, that in considering this Resolution authorising the payment of moneys, we are confining that payment to those who have suffered damage to property.  I do not know whether it is to be held as impossible to pay any compensation to those who have suffered much more by such loss than those who have suffered damage to their property.  We are not even confining this compensation to property losses&mdash;we are not confining it to property which was of material benefit to the locality.  House property is to be compensated for, not to the tenant of the house&mdash;to the person who has actually suffered loss&mdash;but to the owner of the house; I submit that that is certainly <Col N="1599" /> not equitable.  In the setting up of the Shaw Commission&mdash;shall I say before such setting up of the Shaw Commission&mdash;representations were made to the late Minister for Finance, urging him to make provision that in any compensation tribunal not only should loss of property be considered, but personal losses, and also consequential losses of the kind which we have referred to several times, where men and women lost their employment.  I have reason to believe that representations in that respect were made to the British Government, but because thy were to be liable for some of the loss&mdash;the greater portion of those losses for that period&mdash;presumably they declined to agree and the Shaw Commission was precluded from dealing with such losses.  In this Bill, and in this Resolution, we are proposing to follow that very bad precedent.  I referred on the Second Reading Stage to the case of Balbriggan, and it is a very appropriate illustration of what I want to bring home to the Dáil.  People might suffer personal losses, loss of life and loss of limb.  They also suffered to a very great extent, indeed, loss of employment, but property losses were compensated, and may, under these new provisions, be compensated for, and the people simply withdrew their money and took it over to London.  That should not be perpetuated.  It should not be copied, it should not be followed in these new arrangements.  I submit if the objection is a financial objection, if it is said again here, as it has been said elsewhere, that the coffers of the Saorstát will not stand the strain, I ask the Dáil to accept the contention in such a case that the first charge upon whatever fund there is should be those who have suffered loss of life and limb, and not those who have suffered loss of property.  I have a letter from a man which would illustrate the contention I am making.  He says:&mdash;&ldquo;I am a working man having a wife and seven helpless children to support. I work on the Great Southern and Western Railway, and on the evening of the 16th December, was acting as watchman.  A number of robbers attacked the goods wagons, and in my efforts to save those goods I was set upon by five of the gang and kicked almost to death. I was removed to hospital, and I have been a cripple since.  The spine of my back is injured, and as a result of kicks <Col N="1600" /> in the stomach and groin I suffer extreme agony with urinary trouble.  I believe I am permanently injured.  I get only a small weekly allowance from the Railway Company&mdash;one-half of my pay&mdash;altogether insufficient to provide food and clothing for my family.  That is my unhappy state.  Are my children to starve and live in misery in consequence of this anticipated change in the law?  It might be possible to build up mansions destroyed, without Government aid, but you cannot build up the loss of life or limb except in a poor way with it.&rdquo; That is one of the many cases of men who have taken all the risk that their occupations require to keep things moving. The Minister has at other times asked that the business of the country should, as far as possible, be kept going.  There are many men who have undergone much more than the ordinary risk that every civilian has to take, and I submit that the extraordinary risks which a time like this has entailed upon many people, that if there is any justification whatever for any malicious injuries compensation, of any kind&mdash;and I believe there is&mdash;the first claim upon such a fund should be personal damage.  If, therefore, the contention is that it is a case of inability to finance personal damage, plus property losses, then I submit that the first claim should be the loss suffered by personal damage.  I regret that we have not had from the Minister some indication of the mind of the Ministry in response to the gentle hints thrown out on the Second Reading discussion.  It will be remembered that we had not the Bill in hand very long when the Second Reading came on, and while, in the main, I repeat the general welcome that I gave to the Bill, I feel, having read the Bill more thoroughly, that I was too generous in my welcome on that occasion.  I hope, however, that on this question of personal injuries, particularly when men have been deprived of the power to earn a livelihood for themselves and their families, that he will give the Dáil and the country some indication that the door is not closed upon them and that he will bring in at a later stage of this measure or in a new Bill some provision which will ensure to this class of sufferer some compensation for the extraordinary risks that they have to run and the damage <Col N="1601" /> which they have suffered by taking these extraordinary risks.  It will be said, as it has been said with regard to the pre-Truce damage, that this is part of the national struggle, and that every citizen must bear his share in the cost. That may be true, but we are asking certain citizens to undergo a special risk, and in such cases it is a reasonable responsibility for the nation to bear.  It should be a social charge, and not an individual charge, and when we have a Bill presented to us, and, as at this moment, a Financial Resolution presented to us, authorising the payment out of national funds of certain compensations, we ought not to restrict it to property compensations, and to deprive the sufferers from loss of limb and life of any chance of compensation.  The principle is a bad one, and I regret that up to now the Government has not seen fit to enlarge the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the protest of Deputy Johnson against the system we are adopting of having these vague Financial Resolutions before we have the Bills with which they are concerned&mdash;a system based, as I ventured to suggest on a previous occasion, on a quaint misinterpretation of Article 37 of the Constitution.  On this occasion, however, we are asked to go a great deal further than we ever went before, because the Resolution of the President not merely demands authorisation in respect to certain sums of money, but also claims an authority to create securities, securities for an indefinite amount, bearing we know not what interest, redeemable, we know not when.  It is, as I think, one of the defects that will have to be dealt with when the Bill is reached &mdash;that the securities which we are going to offer people in part-payment are there wholly indefinite; they are equally indefinite here.  So that you are giving a man paper without letting him have any means of knowing, any explanation as to what that paper will be worth.  In respect to this particular Resolution the danger of it, as I see, is that if it be acted upon to the letter the Minister for Finance will have power, unchecked, on the faith of this Resolution passed by the Dáil, to create securities to an amount which the Dáil will never have sanctioned. I pass from that because I am not sanguine enough to expect that the <Col N="1602" /> President will acquiesce in my view on the subject, and I do want to call attention to another matter.</P>
      <P>I want to call the special attention of the Dáil to what is omitted from this Resolution.  I refer to what I might call the pre-Truce damage.  Assuming, for the sake of argument, that such Resolution as this be necessary, I submit that this is eminently an occasion where we should cover the whole ground&mdash;that just as the Bill should deal with pre-Truce damage, so should the Financial Resolution deal with pre-Truce damage.  I want very seriously to ask the President if he will, between this and the Fourth Stage of the Bill, present to this Dáil particulars showing the position as to pre-Truce damage, because without such particulars there are portions of the Bill, particularly Part I., which are literally unintelligible to any member not having special information such as can only be obtained from Government Departments. There is nothing in this Resolution about pre-Truce damage, and yet the Dáil will remember we have voted no less than half a million pounds on account of pre-Truce damage.</P>

      <P>That is better for my case.  As to property, let me, if I may, in the hope of persuading the President to give a statement which I really think we ought to have, so that we can understand Part I. of the Bill, say one word about property as distinct from personal damages.  On the 8th May the Shaw Commission was set up by the Lord Lieutenant.  That body has no statutory authority, I understand.  That body will only have power, as far as I know, to recommend certain payments for damage to property.  There is no statutory authority whatever for payment of awards recommended by that Commission.  Last December we voted two hundred and fifty thousand pounds in respect of prospective loans to persons obtaining awards from the Shaw Commission, and, so far as I am aware, that Vote of the Dáil is the only thing distantly approaching Parliamentary sanction to the payment of money in connection with the Shaw Commission, and the Dáil will observe that that was merely <Col N="1603" /> an authorisation to lend money to claimants up to date.  The President will correct me if I am wrong, but I think there is no authority whatever under Statute to make payments to what I may call Shaw claimants.  I do suggest that when you are dealing with malicious injury in general, and taking away completely the rights of persons whose injuries arose before the Truce, you are bound in justice, when taking away these rights, to set down, in statutory form, what alternative rights or remedies shall be given to the injured persons.  That is what I do not see in the Resolution or in the Bill.  Therefore, so far as property is concerned, I ask the President, between now and the Fourth Stage, to let the Dáil have a statement showing the total amount of awards to date, the total amount of payments to date, and distinguishing between what is payable by the Irish Government and what is payable by the English Government. I think the time has come when it is not unreasonable also to ask that the President should let us have particulars of the agreement come to between the Irish and British Governments on this subject.  Is it still the case that the Irish Government is to pay for damage done by its supporters and the British Government to pay for damage done by theirs.  How does it work out in practice? I think this is an opportune moment for the Dáil to have that information. You cannot know whether you are dealing fairly or unfairly under Part I., with pre-truce cases, unless you have this information, and, I, therefore, ask for these particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to personal damage, that is on a totally different basis.  There is no Shaw Commission there.  Let me remind the President of what he said to us when we were voting another sum of a quarter of a million for personal injuries on the 13th December last.  The President explained that provision was made for each side to compensate its own supporters; the British would compensate the British supporters and the Irish would compensate their people, and, in the case of neutrals there would be a half-and-half basis of payment. He said:&mdash;&ldquo;Where awards are available&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, I take it, where awards have been made&mdash;&ldquo;steps will be taken for discharging our liabilities.&rdquo;  I <Col N="1604" /> suppose that is still the intention, but it is right that before the Dáil passes clauses which take away any right whatever for redress for personal injury it should know from the President that all our liabilities have been discharged, or, in the alternative that the President should get inserted into that Bill a definite clause giving statutory authority to payment of personal injury claims up to the amount for which awards have been made, or for which awards may be made.  I think it is hardly necessary to apologise to members for taking up so much time on this matter.  The reason why this matter is important is that you are now coming to a stage where you sweep away the whole personal injury compensation, and you put nothing in its place, and do nothing to legalise the payments proposed under the arrangement between the Irish and British Governments.  I would ask the President to let us have particulars of what that agreement is, and how it works out in practice.  The Dáil will realise that in personal injury cases, as distinct from property, Irish sufferers are likely to be at considerable disadvantage, as it is notorious that Dublin Castle took very good care to pay its own friends personal injury compensation.  It stopped from the County Councils large sums of money and the people who had the right views got their money, and the other people did not get their money, inasmuch as these cases, which were not settled by Dublin Castle, in which any English retainers may be involved, would, I understand, be cases in which England would have to pay the residue; the Irish sufferers, who had no pull in Dublin Castle, are people whose payments would come out of the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I make myself clear, but I understand that the English Exchequer is to pay for its people and soldiers damaged, and why we should seize this moment to do away with personal injuries altogether, and not to state that though we were doing away with personal injuries under the Criminal Injury Acts, we are putting in their stead something else agreed to with the English Government I cannot conceive.  It seems to me an essential injustice not to seize this particular opportunity to do so.  We are all considerably confused on account of the time that has elapsed and the various moves taken to deal with <Col N="1605" /> these matters and I do suggest to the President that between now and the time the Bill comes up on the Fourth Stage, we should have such information as is in his possession, so that we would be in a much better position to deal with Part I. than at present.  A quarter of a million has been voted under both heads.  At all events there is this much, that there is no statutory authority whatever for payment of damages under any head or any agreement with the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this Resolution that I am not sure is not a point of order, but it certainly is a matter of very considerable substance and is not a point touched upon by the two previous speakers. I entirely concur with the two previous speakers who stated that the procedure is cumbersome and unnecessary, an antiquated procedure coming from the old days of kindly privilege that has no substance in modern democratic practice and fact.  If I understand the procedure aright it is that in the Bill we are to consider we are precluded from the consideration of certain various important matters in which the spending of money will be involved, unless we have previously, before we pass into Committee, passed these Resolutions authorising us in certain specific matters to deal with these issues. That is to say, that where compensation is to be paid in respect of damaged property, as is outlined in the Bill, we may be going beyond our powers in dealing with that matter unless some resolution of this kind had previously been passed in the Dáil.  Very well, there is a series of amendments on the Order paper to-day by which that expenditure will be enlarged by the inclusion of other matters. These amendments may not be passed, but it is at least a fair and a courteous supposition that they have a chance of passing.  The President does not agree that they have a chance of passing.  Be it so, but in any case this important matter arises with this Resolution. I wish to know definitely whether this Resolution does, or does not&mdash;and according to my interpretation of the procedure it does&mdash;preclude the consideration of any expenditure of money other than that defined in the Bill; in other words, if this Resolution be passed there are certain <Col N="1606" /> other matters by which the expenditures in the Bill will be very considerably enlarged.  If the Resolution were to pass, and if we cannot consider the expenditures that are contemplated in the Bill unless such a Resolution as this be passed, how can we consider the expenditure of money contemplated in the amendments to the Bill, unless they are also included in some such Financial Resolution of this kind?  It is a very important matter, because if this Resolution is essential to authorise, or to consider one type of expenditure, then by its authorisation it precludes us from considering certain other matters.  A whole mass of amendments quite rightly would therefore be put up to you as being out of order, although they are definitely accepted and put down on the paper, and are within the legislative right of the Dáil to consider, if not to pass.  Nevertheless, this Resolution that we are going to pass now will say all these other matters which have been dealt with, such matters as personal injuries and such matters as consequential losses and other matters cannot be considered by us in Committee if this procedure is the right procedure.  I think it is a very grave matter for us to decide in passing such a resolution of this kind.</P>

      <P>I would ask the President and the Government to give very serious consideration to the question of personal injury.  The whole question of personal risk and property risk is ostensibly one that concerns the interests of the State.  When a man is taking a personal risk to help the State he is not thinking of property, but the risk to his own person.  If we want the citizen to do his duty to the State, and <Col N="1607" /> if he knows that he or his people will not be compensated for the risk he is taking, it is a poor inducement for him to become a good and proper citizen. There is this peculiar aspect of the whole question of compensation, that a widow may, perhaps, get compensation for a suit of clothes her husband wore because it is bullet-holed, but will not get anything at all if the man's brains are blown out.  I think this is a very serious question.  I will not go into the question of consequential damages or injuries, because that is not the thing to be taken up, to my mind.  I do think that the question of personal injuries ought to be part and parcel of this measure, as it is very serious.  When a man is running a risk he is not thinking about the risk to his property, but to his person.  If you want a man to be a good citizen to the State, the State should compensate him for any risk he runs and any losses he may incur.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring before the Dáil two outstanding cases which occurred in my district.  One is the case of a man who went out to see a cottage that he was getting, and which was three miles distant.  When he reached it he lighted a match and observed that there were three men inside. He asked them what they wanted there, and they replied by asking what he wanted to know for.  He said he would report them to the military.  They then opened fire upon him, and he was shot in the legs.  One of his legs had to be amputated, and he is now a cripple.  The other case is that of a solicitor, a very popular, able and inoffensive man.  He was asked to visit a person who lived four miles away for the purpose of drafting a will.  When he arrived at the house he was fired at, and got such severe injuries that he died a short time afterwards.  He leaves a wife and five children.  People in this country are asked to show civic responsibility and courage and to support the military.  If this is the reward or recompense that they are to receive &mdash;that cases of this kind are to be excluded from the scope of this Bill&mdash;it is certainly very discouraging and disappointing. In fact, it is nothing but cruel injustice, and if this is the sort of treatment that is to be meted out it <Col N="1608" /> will incite still further those who are out to terrorise, penalise, maim and kill persons who have the manliness to stand up against tyranny and support the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gavan Duffy stated that the Commission which was set up on the 8th of May was set up by the Lord Lieutenant; that is, the ex-Lord Lieutenant, His Excellency Lord Fitzalan.  That is not the case; it was set up by agreement between the two Governments, and is an International Tribunal.  The awards that are made by that are supported by the vote of this Dáil.  The agreement I mentioned on the last occasion still stands, that is, that the damage which was done by Crown Forces will be paid for by the British Government, and the damage done by our nationals will be paid for by this Government.  The Deputy also asked for a statement showing the total amount of awards to date.  The awards to date are published regularly in the Official Gazette of the Dáil.  The payments to date are not so published. Delay is occasioned through several causes.  In the first place, persons affected in whose favour awards have been made have had legal rights against local authorities, and I think nobody here is under any delusion as to the value of these legal rights.  They had absolutely no value in cash.  That is admitted.  That disposes of the case that is made to substitute another legal right, because the right that they have there is a right which carries nothing with it&mdash;absolutely nothing.  When the ordinary preliminaries in respect of which the Ministry of Finance must take especial care to see that they are properly discharged are completed, those amounts are paid.  The first thing that has to be done is to discharge the local authority from any legal liability, and the person may refuse to do that. Suppose, for instance, an award has been made of £5,000 for a house or premises. The Shaw Commission reduces that to £3,500.  I do not know, and I have not heard, of any case of persons signing a release for that local authority in respect of the difference.  Ultimately there might be a legal liability on the local authority if, when most of the awards have been discharged, and only <Col N="1609" /> a few remain to be paid, the local authority would be sufficiently strong financially to meet that liability.  I think it is mentioned in the Bill that the rights against the local authorities have to be discharged.  Now, it would not serve any useful purpose to disclose the amounts paid and the respective liabilities of the British Government and the Irish Government, because, let us assume, we deal largely with Cork for three or four weeks.  I think that there is an impression abroad that most of the damage was done there by Crown Forces, and so a balance would appear against the British Government, and the following week, if a number of cases were taken where the damage was done by our nationals, you would have an uneven balance, and I do not think there would be any period at which you would get a fair average of the entire number of cases; that is, that the proportion would be equal over a certain period.  I think the Deputy would bear me out in that.  Even though we had the information, it would be no indication as to the respective proportion of the total liability of the two Governments, if that were the intention.  The total amount paid up to date in respect of the Shaw Commission, the total outgoings amount to something approaching a million pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I have not the faintest notion.  Even if you had the proportion it would not mean you would see what we have paid because we have paid the whole of it.  That was the arrangement. We paid out the whole and in the recent negotiations in London we made arrangements for recoupment with regard to the Shaw Commission.  I think that deals with most of the cases mentioned by Deputy Gavan Duffy. With regard to compensation for personal injuries, I find that in the Dáil Report for Thursday the 8th of February, on Page 1407, that I dealt at some length with this matter.  I explained there that the real cause of the severance of local authorities throughout the country from the Local Government Board which functioned at the Custom House was the punitive effect and the immoral burden that local authorities had to bear by <Col N="1610" /> reason of the Criminal and Malicious Injury Acts of 1919 and subsequently of 1920.  Everybody in the country, with the exception of those who got decrees against the local authorities, objected to the imposition.  They objected to pay compensation for personal injuries and until the Act of 1919 was passed no citizen had any such right to compensation. There may have been exceptions of certain magistrates or people like that, but it was a very restricted class and the Act of 1919 and subsequently of 1920 opened the door wide and let in practically all the supporters of the British Government, of their forces, or of their magistrates, and so on.  It also allowed compensation&mdash;the 1920 Act, I think&mdash;to the ordinary citizen who might be so injured, but up to that time there was no such provision in any Act for compensation for any person injured either through riots or disorders or anything else of the sort.  Now, for two years from the time that that Act was passed, early in 1919, until the Truce, the most intense opposition was offered on the part of every local authority and of every person representing popular opinion throughout the country to the imposition of that Act.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  It is off, and it is not the intention of the Ministry to have any such thing.  It is under consideration to set up a tribunal to consider the cases of persons so injured and to report and make recommendations regarding <i>ex gratia</i> payments. We are setting up a Commission to enquire into those cases and to report as to what compensation may be proper. <Col N="1611" /> On receiving the report the Dáil will be asked for the necessary Vote.  It was the first time that I knew that there was a case in any part of the country for such an Act.  I explained, I think, on the last day at some length that it is a matter which may have given rise to this total disregard to the value of human life if people are going to be compensated. It is not the case in England. It is not the law in England, and it was not the law in England during the raids by the Fokkers or Zeppelins that came over from Germany.  There was not compensation in these cases, and I presume there would be just as good a right to ask for it in these cases as now.</P>

      <P>One thing that is of some consideration in a matter of this sort is that wholly extravagant decrees were given in respect of personal injury claims throughout the country.  It is, of course, to the credit of the British Government that they, in so far as their nationals were concerned, paid these extravagant amounts.  There is this satisfaction to the people of this country that, although it was meant as a punitive measure against us, it has actually reacted against themselves; at least they have the liability of discharging these huge sums that have been awarded.  Now, if there be any feeling in this country that such extravagant awards are to be shouldered by this Bill, I say that the country cannot afford it, and the Dáil cannot afford it.  There was in one case an award of £15,000, and two or three awards of £5,000 or £6,000.  I knew of one case in which a person who was killed actually conferred a benefit on his next-of-kin, that is, he had a sum of money which was distributed amongst them, and the amount distributed was larger than he had ever contributed to their maintenance, and even after that there was a pretty considerable award made.  The peculiarity of the case was that if one were to count up all the money that the man could have earned since he started, and make allowance for what it would cost to keep him, there was still a balance. Although he held a Government appointment it was computed that it was a remunerative Government appointment, over and above the terms of his <Col N="1612" /> remuneration.  I think that makes it clear now as regards that, and that no real case can be made against the provisions of our proposals with regard to those personal injury cases.  These are not the liability of the State according to the Acts to which exception has been taken and that we are repealing.  If you say in these cases that certain people have certain rights, very well; leave them there, and see if the local authorities will raise the assessed sums awarded against each local authority in each area. It is very unlikely they will do so in most cases.  Now, I think, with great respect, that a good deal of this has been irrelevant to the terms of the Motion.</P>

      <P>If there are to be irrelevancies then I presume that one can say in this respect of any motion that it will be objected to because it does not include every subject that every one would like to see embodied.  It was with some amazement that I heard, I believe, the Acting Chairman of the Constitution Committee enlarging upon the restrictions and the bounds that were placed upon the Bill under the Constitution, which I believe he warmly supported when it was under consideration here. It is quite possible that the Deputy may have in mind his own position as Minister for Finance at some time or other, when he would keep this Dáil within the bounds of these limitations.  I think a good case has been made for passing this Resolution.  In any case, if the Resolution be not passed it is not open to us to consider the Bill.  I think the case made against bringing on the Resolution now is a dangerous one, because a Money Resolution of this sort has to be submitted to the Dáil, and the whole Dáil can attend and vote, and can restrict the operations of similar sections of the Bill.  I think the proposal of bringing in the Resolution now was a wise one, and Deputies will ultimately recognise its wisdom.</P>

If there was any real case of the Minister of Finance holding up the payment of an award made by the Shaw Commission then there would be some reason for it.  In the second case you are going to give legal effect to a body that has been set up by two States.  An Act that we pass here will not bind the British Government.  We cannot pass an Act here which will merge them. Our liability in respect of the payments of the Shaw Commission, in my opinion, are probably one-third.  If you pass an Act here legalising that and binding the British Government, it has no effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Bill deals with the cases that are before the Shaw Commission.  We want to relieve the local authorities of their liabilities by one swoop.  It will relieve us to some extent, because after that has been passed we need not seek further releases from people in the manner I explained a few moments ago.  I think, if it were agreeable to the Dáil, I might propose the whole of that Section which deals <Col N="1615" /> with the substance of the things I have stated, and that would give an opportunity for moving the amendment which comes under it, and which, to some extent, offers compensation for the loss of legal rights that people have got now against local authorities, and defines the existence, if I might say so, of the Shaw Commission.  If you will permit me I will move the first five, which, I think, will not interfere with the opinions of members of the Dáil on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeGDuffy" hpid="Mr. GAVAN DUFFY Mr. GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the ground you have already covered, beyond saying that personally I shall certainly vote against the Section which does away with personal injuries, pre-Truce, altogether without giving any substitute, whereas the substitute, in fect, exists, as this Dáil knows.  So far as property goes also, I think it would be unfortunate that there should be a Government amendment referring to the Shaw Commission, whereas, in fact, for some reason which I fail to fathom, we shy at incorporating the Shaw Commission, so far as we have responsibility for its acts.  My chief reason for rising on this section is to ask the President whether he has considered the effect of the Constitution in connection with this retrospective legislation, which I find in portion of Section 1.  If the President will look at Article 73 of the Constitution he will find there what, I suggest, is a fairly clear prohibition against retrospective legislation.  Article 73 says: &ldquo;Subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in the Irish Free State at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same, or any of them, shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I merely wish to draw attention to the matter, which is more important in other sections. There is a possible, and, I think, a probable interpretation of that section which will make it impossible for this Dáil or for this Oireachtas to go in for any retrospective legislation in the same manner as we have clearly defined in the Constitution, that you cannot create a crime after the event.  For the moment I merely draw the President's attention to <Col N="1616" /> that section, which applies even more strongly to certain other parts of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that that is scarcely correct, having regard to the history of these Acts, which I have recounted, the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts of 1918 and 1920.  It was a subject of agreement between the late British Government and the late Minister for Finance and the late President that these Acts should be repealed by us, and that the British on their part would repeal them. It was not done at the time because the Provisional Government, without a Parliament, was scarcely the body that could pass an Act of Parliament.  It was generally agreed and admitted that no person who had any rights had really got negotiable rights.  There were, therefore, people with huge, big decrees not one single penny of which would be paid or could be paid, and I think at the earliest moment notice of the fact was issued by the Provisional Government.</P>
      <P>Now, as far as the Article of the Constitution is concerned, I think it must be read in the light of these circumstances, and that for the point raised by Deputy Gavan Duffy I ask how can you, in an Act, specify your liability or the liability of this State for a sum unestimated and impossible to estimate at the moment?</P>

      <P>You must.

All the arrangements we have made are satisfactory to me, to <Col N="1617" /> the Executive Council, and to all my advisers.  If there was any danger of them failing, an Act of Parliament passed here would not make it safer as far as we are concerned, and I do not think there is any fear.</P>

Therefore, the people likely to be damnified by doing away with these personal injury claims are our own people whose claims are not greater, but, if my information is correct, are very much smaller than those of the gentlemen already paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point on which there seems to be scarcely a clear appreciation of the circumstances of the case.  In this Bill we are not drawing a distinction between persons who lost property and persons who suffered personal injuries, except to this extent, that the restoration of the property is no loss and no extravagance, generally speaking because of the employment it gives.  Now, huge payments for personal injuries mean sending out huge sums of money for which there is no immediate need.  In other words, if a person is to get a sum of money into his pocket in respect of which he is to restore nothing to the nation there is much greater liability to be extravagant than in other cases, because the steps we have taken to ensure that the property will be restored, and the wealth of the nation will not be lessened indicates the difference in our appreciation of the thing.  Take <Col N="1619" /> the case of a man who has met with an accident.  Possibly the medical expenses amount to £100, and other expenses might amount to another £150, and the general impression amongst his friends is that he should get one thousand pounds, which means that he could put £850 into his pocket.  There is a danger of extravagance in this case, and to that extent only is there discrimination between the two.  In the one case it requires all the money to restore the wealth of the nation, and in the other case there is very great danger of extravagance.</P>

He apparently has in mind claims for the loss of life of a head constable or a D.I., where very large sums were in question, and with these in view he is forced to take up the line he has done.  I presume that a tribunal or a Commission of Inquiry will be set up, and I would like to have it made a little more clear, even though I run the risk of being blamed for dullness or obtuseness, still I would like the President to enlarge a little more upon the intention with regard to this tribunal&mdash;this Commission of Inquiry&mdash; dealing with personal injuries.  He made a promise on the first occasion that seemed to have something to do with cases in the pre-Truce period, because immediately after saying that there was a tribunal to be set up to deal with the <Col N="1620" /> case of persons who ordinarily would have claimed under the Personal Injuries, or whose relatives or next-of-kin would have claimed he said we are finally determined that no such compensation will be admitted in future.  What I would like to find out is whether this tribunal is only to deal with the claims for personal injury from the pre-Truce <i>regime</i> which have not come before any Court&mdash;the Shaw Commission only deals with property&mdash;and will he tells us is there to be another tribunal to deal with the post-Truce cases.</P>

      <P>Before I come to the first amendment standing in my name, which is to add a new sub-section, I would like to direct the attention of the President to two improvements in Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (3) that I think ought to be made before this Bill finally becomes law.  It is provided that every applicant in one section who brings evidence, and in the other sub-section every applicant who serves notice of his intention to re-open the decree shall serve notice. Now, either the Statute itself ought to prescribe the length of the notice that is to be given by the applicant in the one case or by the Minister for Finance in the other case, or else there should be some provision in the Act, which I cannot find, for a rule-making authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Local Government Act, which codified the law relating to Criminal Injuries, it was provided that a certain Committee, consisting, I think, of some County Court Judges and others, should provide rules for the carrying out of the Act.  Now, this provision of a notice seems to me necessary. If there is no definite time the law presumes <Col N="1622" /> that the notice shall be a reasonable one, but you will always have questions arising as to whether a particular notice, in a particular case, was reasonable or not.  Therefore, it seems to me proper, though I have not put down any amendment, because it is a matter rather for the Minister in charge of the Bill, that provision ought to be made for a notice of, say, a week, a fortnight, or three weeks, as the case may be, of the intention to have the matter reopened.  I also suggest that something should be put in the Bill, before it finally assumes the shape of law, as regards making provision that rules be introduced for the carrying out of the Act.  I think that is clearly a proper provision, because this Act supersedes all the old Criminal and Malicious Injury Acts; it repeals them, and they all provided rules for carrying them into effect.  In the one case, the rule-making authority was the High Court, and in the other there was a special rule-making authority.  It is a matter of machinery that ought to be provided somewhere or other.  Coming to the first amendment standing in my name, I beg to move to add a new sub-section before Sub-section 6 as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This section shall not apply to any decree made in respect of an injury to which this part of this Act applies, where such decree has been varied or affirmed upon an appeal, at the hearing of which the local authority or authorities concerned were represented.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In some previous remarks the President said, what I did not know before, that in certain cases the Local Authority appeared and made only a nominal defence. I had not known that.  I thought that where they appeared they fought the case, and therefore I think it would be only proper to add to this amendment the words where &ldquo;representatives appear and make a <i>bona fide</i> appearance.&rdquo; The object of this amendment is, not to increase the burden on the State at all.  It seems to me that where a case was honestly fought by the people interested in opposing it, that it is very improbable, where there was a hearing before a County Court Judge or an appeal at which the Local Authority concerned did, <i>bona fide</i>, contest the case, that any very exorbitant decree could have been given.  I could understand if you said that all the Judges <Col N="1623" /> were corrupt or incompetent, but that does not lie in the mouths of Ministers who have continued these Judges in office, and in fact have appealed to them for decrees against Mr. de Valera, Mr. Stephen O'Mara, and trustees of one sort or another, and to whom they go for the ordinary necessary orders for carrying on the affairs of State, the recovery of Income Tax, and one thing and another.  Therefore, it does not seem to me possible to make the charge that these decrees ought to be abolished because the Judges were corrupt or incompetent. We must assume, I think, that the decrees were at any rate comparatively honest.  If so, and the decrees were given after a contested battle between the parties interested, it does seem to me to be plunging the country, the applicants and the State, into unnecessary litigation which must be paid for.  I know, as well as anyone else, that the dearest luxury any man can enjoy in the world is the luxury of litigation. This Bill provides that not only the State, but the Local Authorities, and, of course, the applicants, must be represented upon all these re-hearings, or ought to be represented at them, and the costs will be included in whatever award is made, and will have to be provided for.  It seems to me that wherever it is possible we should close the door to a re-agitation of a matter that has already, as I assume in my amendment, been fought twice over and has then arrived at a final conclusion.  There is one other matter that I think we should consider. The credit of a country rests, to a great extent, upon the confidence that other people have in the way the law is administered in that country, and in the way that country fulfils its obligations. It seems to me it would be a grave shock to the credit of this country if decrees, arrived at by the Courts after two hearings, are torn up, and you have to put the whole matter into the melting pot of litigation over again.  Retrospective legislation, which comes in under another part of this Bill, always causes a shock to the credit of any country.  The other day when one of the Federated Colonies in the Commonwealth of Australia, I forget which it was, proceeded to repeal statutes dealing with certain land settlements, <Col N="1624" /> what a tremendous outcry there was against that action.  I believe they were unable to borrow the money in London, the natural place for them to go to, because the financial people, or capitalists there, who finance these International loans had so far lost confidence in them by reason of their land legislation that they could not get the money in London, and were compelled to go to America and pay a higher rate of interest by borrowing in a foreign country than they would in the ordinary course, or that their sister Colonies would be liable to pay in the London markets.  I have no particular interest, and I know nothing at all of any of these decrees, but I am anxious that this Bill should, as far as possible, avoid doing injury to the country.  I do not think the amounts saved by re-opening the decrees of the class to which this amendment refers will be so great as to off-set the immense loss in litigation and cost and of the undoubted damage the re-opening of decrees of this particular kind would do to the credit of the country and the administration of the law.  I beg to move the amendment, with the addition after the word &ldquo;represented&rdquo;&ldquo;and <i>bona fide</i> opposed the decree.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that I could not accept the amendment. A discretion is given to the Minister for Finance in opening up and taking exception to any decree that has been given.  One of the disabilities which all persons, with the exception of those who have got decrees, would suffer by reason of their not having looked for decrees, and put the machinery of the Courts into operation, is that they would have secured compensation for consequential loss.  And compensation for consequential loss is excluded.  It is one of the main features of this Bill, and it would mean in effect that certain people who operated against what was the general popular opinion for a period of one or two years, or possibly three years, and who said &ldquo;We will take advantage of this law; even though the vast majority of the people say it is bad law, we will take advantage of it,&rdquo; would get their pound of flesh.  I think the number of cases that are in the mind of Deputy Fitzgibbon as affected by this is relatively small.  I do not know that <Col N="1625" /> there are any.  The only place I know where there is a likelihood of any such cases having been heard is in the City of Dublin.  Now, in the City of Dublin it is possible that there may have been some defence by a local authority. We will take it that there is a claim for property damaged, say, in Rathmines or Pembroke, and in the ordinary way I think that counsel for the City of Dublin would appear; counsel for Rathmines, possibly for Pembroke, and probably for the County Council.  If the Rathmines Council only appeared and fought the case it is quite possible that their counsel would succeed in having an award given which would apply, say, to the City of Dublin and to the County Council of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but his interest would be at that time to keep the award away from Rathmines, and his interest would not be in the reduction of the award.  And, although he might have contested in every possible way the amount, it is more than possible that he would have paid more attention to the fact that Rathmines or Pembroke should be excluded from the decree than to the actual sum awarded. I do not know that I could accept it, in view of the fact that a person having secured a decree in this case must necessarily have some compensation for consequential loss, and that a small section, perhaps a couple or, at the most, perhaps not even a half-dozen would get that advantage which is now denied to the vast majority.  It would also, I am told, prevent the reinstatement condition. I think it is generally agreed that there ought to be a reinstatement provision.  Should there be costs, it is a matter for the State, and it would be a matter for the consideration of the Minister for Finance whether he would be justified in asking for the re-hearing of these cases, in which there would be considerable costs, if the result of the re-hearing simply meant that only a small sum would be excluded from the decree for consequential loss, and that it would entail a heavier expense by reason of the additional costs than the amount of the consequential loss.  I <Col N="1626" /> shall also say that the Shaw Commission, as it is called, is really reviving cases that were the subject of decrees in Court; and it is subscribed to by the British Government, which has a pretty big tradition behind it of settled law and order and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldFitzgibbon" hpid="Mr. FITZGIBBON Mr. FITZGIBBON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGIBBON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer very shortly the two arguments of the President. He refers to the Shaw Commission. The Shaw Commission does not deal with cases of the kind which I have referred to at all.  Because the Shaw Commission only deals with undefended cases.  He also instanced the case of the city of Dublin.  My amendment was carefully framed to meet the cases that I knew had existed in the city of Dublin. It was only in the city of Dublin that I came professionally in contact with those criminal injury cases at all.  And I came across very few of them, and my recollection is that the city itself&mdash;the Corporation&mdash;was not represented upon any of these hearings.  One of two townships where they were concerned did appear, and I carefully framed this amendment so that the decrees should not be confirmed unless the local authority or local authorities concerned, which means all the local authorities concerned, were represented. And, therefore, where a person brought a claim in the city of Dublin, and a township was represented, but the city was not, this would count as an undefended decree, and would not be affected by the amendment I have moved.  I have answered the two main arguments of the President.  The other was a question of consequential loss. Well, speaking from memory, my recollection is that until very late, indeed, in the day, the Courts had held that consequential damage could not be recovered and I think that the right to recover consequential damage was only affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeal as it then was, the body which existed for about a month, and no longer, some time in the month of October or November, just before the Free State came into existence. And I think that until then the general opinion and the general trend of decisions where cases had come up for decision was that consequential damage could not have been given.  Therefore, there could have been very few cases&mdash;defended cases&mdash;indeed, covered by the <Col N="1627" /> amendment that I have put on the paper in which consequential damage had been given, and the local authorities concerned were represented in opposing the decree.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that the President has not seen his way to accept this particular amendment; because it was the absence of such saving clauses as that which added enormously to the shock produced in business circles by some clauses in this Bill, and particularly this Clause.  It is well-known that the Banks had advanced money to people who had got decrees on the faith that those decrees would eventually be paid.  And what I suppose startled people more than anything else was the tangible evidence that the Government thought it right to start its career with very definite retrospective legislation.  I put it to the President that this matter wants further consideration from another point of view; and that is that he may find himself in very serious difficulties on the Constitutional point that our Constitution prohibits retrospective legislation.  I sympathise with his desire to revise in this Bill unjust and excessive decrees.  I sympathise absolutely with that.  But there was another way of doing it.  It was not necessary to do it in the way proposed here.  Here the Minister is to have absolutely unlimited right to re-open.  I suggest that what might have been done first of all, instead of providing for any re-opening, was to extend the time for appeal and in the comparatively small number of cases where a revision is deemed necessary to provide that a superior judge should hear these appeals instead of sending the cases back to the same judge; and further, to provide that the Minister should only call for that revision on certain specified grounds.  If the Minister had done that&mdash;and that is one of the things which I venture to think we should have secured had we been able to talk this matter over in a Select Committee&mdash;you would produce a very different impression on the public mind. You would be showing that you did not intend to inflict injustice and you would be limiting your right of revision to cases where it was clearly shown to the Minister that grossly excessive damages had been granted, at all events to a <Col N="1628" /> series of cases of which you had tabulated a description in your Bill.  If you do that you get away from the Constitutional difficulty and instead of re-opening the cases already decided you adopt the very much more satisfactory principle of granting an appeal on certain very limited and definite issues to a higher tribunal.  I hope it may not be yet too late for the President to consider that suggestion before this Bill finally goes through, because the thing as drawn is certainly very objectionable.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that the Minister for Finance should not have accepted the amendment put forward by Deputy Fitzgibbon, and one can only hope that it is still possible that his decision will be open to review for very grave reasons indeed.  I think it would help, as Deputy Gavan Duffy has said, to clear a very manifest trouble that is awaiting the whole of this Section under the Constitution.  As it stands, even if the amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzgibbon had been accepted I venture to say it may yet prove, and I believe it will yet prove, that the whole of this Section is <i>ultra vires</i> under the Constitution.  Article 66 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive, and shall not be reviewed, or capable of being reviewed, by any other Court, tribunal, or authority whatsoever.&rdquo;  That, it will be said, is the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State.  That is perfectly clear.  But under the transitory provisions it is also stated that until Courts have been established for the Irish Free State in accordance with this Constitution, the supreme Court of Judicature, the County Courts, etc., as at present existing shall for the time being continue to exercise the same jurisdiction as heretofore.  There is a proviso at the end of Article 75 which refers back to the earlier Article of the Constitution to which I have referred, and specifically states &ldquo;Provided that the provisions of Article 66 of this Constitution as to the decisions of the Supreme Court established under this Constitution shall apply to decisions of the Court of Appeal continued by this Article.&rdquo;  That means that any decision by the Court of <Col N="1629" /> Appeal that has hitherto existed, and still continues to exist until the Judiciary Act shall have been passed, is a decision that is not capable of future review by any Court, tribunal or authority whatsoever, even the authority and the tribunal of this Dáil Eireann.  Deputy Fitzgibbon's amendment is one that helps a very great deal to meet that point, but I venture to say, seeing that it has been intimated, that it will be rejected by the Ministry that it may yet prove that it is necessary, because the amendment reads: &ldquo;where such decree has been varied or affirmed upon an appeal.&rdquo;  I suggest that under the Constitution if any decree has been varied or affirmed on appeal that that decision under the Constitution is a binding decision, and cannot be upset by any legislation that we now enact, and I hope that will subsequently be proved with regard to the Section in the Courts of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot decide on this particular matter as an abstract problem, and one cannot judge of its merits or demerits apart from concrete circumstances.  This Section of the Bill deals with injuries committed after the eleventh day of July, 1921.  The eleventh of July, 1921, was the date of the Truce; the 6th December, 1921, was the date of the signing of the Treaty. As between the date of the Truce and the date of the signing of the Treaty you had an interesting and highly anomalous state of affairs in this country.  You had functioning within the country two sets of Courts, some of the Courts receiving the allegiance and obedience of a section of the community and repudiated by another section.  Then there was another set of Courts similarly situated.  That state of affairs lasted from July to December. It will be admitted that for several months after December order had not been produced out of chaos.  During these months between July and December we were in a state of suspended hostility with regard to the British and their institutions within the country.  We had set up in this country a fighting machine which served its purpose very well as a fighting machine, and which we called a Republic.  Pending a definite settlement with the British and pending the signing of the Treaty by our plenipotentiaries we were not abandoning that particular <Col N="1630" /> fighting machine, and we would have been very foolish to do so.  Consequently throughout that period you had people objecting, and objecting very definitely, to going into British Courts in any capacity whatsoever, whether in the capacity of plaintiff or as defendant, or as prisoner or as witness.  Decrees given by the Courts during that period may deserve examination, may deserve very close inspection, now when a more ordered set of conditions prevail.  It may be that important evidence in a particular case was withheld because of the objection of a particular witness to appear.  The Ministry of Finance will, no doubt, have rather detailed information with regard to each case.  It should be open to that Ministry at its discretion, and for cause given, to apply for the re-opening of a particular case, when one considers the circumstances that existed, not merely from the 11th July to the 6th December, but for many months after the 6th December&mdash;highly anomalous conditions, not orderly conditions. It may be a sound principle for general application that retrospective legislation is bad.  We hold no particular brief for retrospective legislation in the normal, but a country emerging from a revolutionary period and emerging from a period when there was a very distinct clash of jurisdiction and a clash of authorities is not normal, and when you had side by side in this country for quite a long period two sets of Courts.  We all remember last year that horrible period of dual jurisdiction when people did not know where they stood as between a ukase of one Court and a ukase of another, and when the Dáil met, and shortly after the Provisional Government was set up, we took steps to hew our way out of that <i>debris</i> and out of that condition of disorder, but it took time. It is the decrees given during that period that the Minister for Finance asks to have re-examined, not decrees given in normal orderly conditions.  That is the case for it.  I do not propose to deal with Deputy Figgis's highly Constitutional argument.  Deputy Figgis, I take it, disapproves of retrospective legislation. Yet he suggests that the Constitution which we passed here rules back to the 11th July, 1921.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 3, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add a new Sub-section before Sub-section (6) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any assignment, mortgage or charge which, on the 6th day of February, 1923, affected the compensation awarded by a decree, made in respect of an injury to which this part of this Act applies, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, continue to be in full force and effect against, and shall affect any compensation which may be awarded on the re-hearing of an application in respect of the same injury, under the provisions of this Act, in the same manner and to the same extent in all respects as such assignment, mortgage or charge affected the compensation awarded by the said decree.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is one that appears to me to be one of elementary justice. From the earliest times the best recognised security that any borrower could offer was a judgment, and before mortgages were invented authority used to be given by power of attorney.  It was marked up, registered and re-registered from year to year, and assigned and treated as one of the most valuable securities for the advancement of money.  Many decrees obtained under the Criminal Injuries Acts have unquestionably been assigned, mortgaged or charged for value.  Those are all being swept away.  New decrees are about to be given by new tribunals for in some cases greater and in some cases lesser sums than those secured by the old decrees. It is quite true that they are to be charged over again, but somebody or other who has got to get a good charge for money honestly advanced upon a decree which was lawful at the time he gave the money may find himself completely cut out by the applicant coming in and getting a new decree from the new tribunal, and then proceeding to charge it in fraud to the man who had already advanced him money on the security of the decree now going to be abolished.  Unless this amendment is passed this Act opens the door to enormous fraud by people who have already borrowed money on the security of decrees they have got, and who will be able, unless this amendment is passed, to borrow money again from other people on the security of the new decrees, and defraud those who advanced the money relying on the value of judgments of the Irish Courts.  If you are <Col N="1633" /> to cover your courts and judgments and the whole administration of your law with contempt and bring them into discredit throughout the whole world, you will reject this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;To add a new sub-section before Sub-section (6): `Where a decree has already been made in respect of an injury to which this part of this Act applies, and such decree has been varied or affirmed upon an appeal, at the hearing whereof the Local Authority or Authorities concerned were represented, and the sum awarded by such decree has been mortgaged, charged or assigned, <i>bona fide</i> and for value, the amount awarded upon any re-hearing under this section shall not be less than the sum advanced or paid upon the security of the original decree.' &rdquo;  This amendment would be unnecessary if the first amendment I moved had been adopted.  The principle of this amendment is that where a decree has been made, and has been honestly fought, that is a decree the Dáil has decided shall be, or may be, re-opened.  But where such a decree has been fought, and where it has been assigned or mortgaged for value, the amount awarded in respect of the new decree shall not be less than the amount advanced on the security of the old one.  The main difference in my first amendment would leave the decree standing with the full amount, and the <Col N="1634" /> second amendment will only leave it to stand for the amount that has been honestly advanced, and <i>bona fide</i> paid on the security of the decree as it stands. As the President said, nobody thought the decrees were worth 2d. when they were given.  A great many people probably did not think they were worth twopence, but some people who had experience undoubtedly thought they were worth something, and advanced money on the security of these decrees.  I do not suppose that the advance in any case would be anything like the amount of the decree, as no mortgagor or lender ever lends up to the full value of the property. Undoubtedly many of these decrees were used by people who had got them to obtain the means of living.  The decrees were not levied, as they could not be levied, and in some cases they were all the unfortunate applicant had, and he assigned these decrees for very much less than the nominal face values of the amounts, in order to obtain a means of living for the time being while he was looking for a home elsewhere.  I suggest that where the money was so obtained by the applicant on the security of these decrees, the decrees should stand for the amount for which they were sold, assigned, or charged.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider the possibility of amending this Section.  As <Col N="1640" /> drawn up it gives the Minister the right to appear and be heard by a solicitor and counsel, but it also involves the possibility of a large piling up of costs. Take a case on the verge of the City of Dublin where you might have a good number of local bodies represented as well as the Minister.  I do not think that under the provisions now proposed, the local bodies will, in many cases, have very much interest and I should like to see it provided that they are not to be represented except there be special cause, and I should also like to see provided that in places where the Minister, to get at the facts, wants the help of the Local Authorities, instead of being directly represented by a solicitor and counsel he himself should be able to instruct the Local Authority to act for him.  In most cases that will arise under this part of the Act, there will really be no object in having the Local Authority specially represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>In a few cases there might be, but as a rule there will not be, and I should like that provision should be made so that a normal course for the Minister would be to instruct the Council to have their solicitor to represent him in order not to multiply or to duplicate the legal people who will be appearing in those cases.  The costs, remember, are considerable and there are cases which will be re-opened where the costs have already been accruing.  I suggest it will be possible to re-draft this Clause to have the cost cut down so as not to have the Councils represented except in those special cases where it is necessary for them to be represented and in other cases to have the local body to represent the Minister. I would ask him to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been under consideration.  Ordinarily we thought it might have been possible to get the Local Authority to defend those cases, and make some contribution to us for this enormous legal expense, but it would be necessary, I think, to permit Local Authorities to come in where reinstatement or anything of that sort may arise to make a case for us.  Suppose a Local Authority has a valuation of £100,000.  A number of premises that <Col N="1641" /> have been destroyed may possibly reduce that by £1,000.  It would be to their interest to see that some property was reconstructed in their area to make up for that £1,000.  The danger arises in this way, that they might make it a point to get considerable sums were they even in excess of equitable amounts in order to ensure that their valuations would be at least as great, if not greater, after re-instatement than they were before.  And generally we come to the conclusion that the sum of money we might save by reason of the employment of those people might easily be lost otherwise.  Of course, at present as they are not associated with their proportion of the cost of compensation they would not have any interest in keeping down the amounts. But it would be to their interests to appear in connection with re-instatement. In that case if they appear there, they appear to protect some of the rights of their own districts, and they would have to bear their own costs in these cases.  It would not put any extra expense on us, and it would relieve us to this extent that we would be saved a great deal of the trouble of getting information with regard to re-instatement. To that extent our expense would be limited, but I do not see how it is possible to make use of the local authorities, or even to get them to look at this from our point of view&mdash;that is, the point of view of the State.</P>

      <P>So far as the representation of the local authorities at the hearing goes, is it not desirable in view of the President's statement that you should put in your Bill provision for paying their costs in certain cases.  You should, in other words, limit the cases where they are entitled to appear otherwise than at their own expense.  As the thing stands they might come in, and it may be secure payment of the costs they incurred, even though there may not be good reason for their appearing at all.  It seems to me to be too vague, and the cases where they ought to appear should be clearly specified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Clause 6 that has been moved is one of the most contentious clauses of the entire Bill. It is the one that deals with consequential damages.  I think there are few matters that have aroused more criticism in respect of this Bill than this very Clause, and because of that very reason I will oppose this Clause, for I believe that if the Clause were cut out that it would be very much more advantageous to the Bill as a whole, because the whole question of consequential loss raises a matter of the very first importance.  By restricting the compensation in respect of consequential losses, while allowing such compensation in respect of actual loss of business, it seems to me that in this Bill the State is putting a certain premium on idleness and is making a certain disadvantageous distinction against industry and production. Take two buildings, one of the buildings belongs to someone who lives in England, let us say; that building is being put to no practical use for the benefit of this country, the earnings such as the owner may make are spent outside this country, and he may only live in that building during his times of leisure and for purposes of luxury.  If that building is burned that person gets complete compensation for its burning. Turning now to another building, which <Col N="1643" /> I set off in contrast to the first, a small factory which has been built, not to be lived in, but in order that it should be put to productive use for the benefit of the country as a whole, the burning of that building&mdash;that shop, it may be, to extend the word &ldquo;production' in its widest significance&mdash;means not merely that the person who put it up has lost the bricks and mortar and timber and whatever else went to its composition, but he loses all the production that that building meant to him, and pending the hearing of that person's case he has lost and lost heavily, but his loss has not been direct and actual, as in the first case I have put.  His loss has been a consequential loss, and consequently you say, as between these two persons, one has a building that is non-productive and the second has a building definitely productive.  You say to the first person, &ldquo;you are unproductive, you have never helped in the productive life of this country, you life in so far as this building is concerned is a matter of waste. Nevertheless, if the building be destroyed you shall be compensated in full.&rdquo;  But to the other person we say in this Bill, &ldquo;this building you have put up is a definitely productive concern, so long as that building continued certain works continued in it which enriched this country, but we penalise you as against the first person, your loss is mainly a consequential loss, and the loss of the building is a small part of the loss you have incurred.  We will only compensate you for that small loss, and we will cut away all the consequential loss that would accrue to you because of the destruction of this building and the machinery of this building, that was less valuable in itself than valuable for what it produced.&rdquo;  Now, I anticipate the argument, which is a very strong argument, that the Minister for Finance has already brought up against such a case as I have put.  He has said, and I must acknowledge that he is right in saying, that there are no funds to pay all the losses.  That is admitted.  There must be a certain percentage of the entire possible compensation that under other circumstances and in more fortunate times we might be willing to recompense, but that now, conditions being as they are, we must forego.  That is a <Col N="1644" /> strong argument, and it has been put very strongly in the Dáil by the Minister. I imagine there is no member of the Dáil who is not in entire agreement with it, but I put before him this thought that that argument of his does not help him with regard to this particular Clause.  I will endeavour briefly to show why.  I have taken two persons, one person whose building is an unproductive building, and a second person who has a productive building. The person who owns the first gets full compensation; the person who owns the second gets a very small fraction of the compensation to which he should in equity be entitled.  Now, surely one would think that the right method would be to make some kind of computation, which would have by necessity to be very rough, and add the two together, and having got the total for the two, to say the total for the two is such and such a figure, but the State cannot afford to pay more than 50 per cent. of that; but being able to pay 50 per cent. of the total it will pay 50 per cent. in each case, so that the man whose building is non-productive does not get the whole of his compensation, just as the other man whose building is productive fails to get the whole of his compensation. Each person would be treated on a perfect parity; whereas it is perfectly clear under the provisions of this Bill persons are not treated on any parity whatever.  One person is put in a very strong position of advantage as against the other and we have chosen to put the very person in a position of advantage whose existence in this country is no positive gain to this country.  I will oppose this Section for that reason.  I am full well aware, as I have said, of the argument that the Minister has put forward, that this country cannot afford to pay all the heads of compensation at the full 100 per cent.  I think a very strong case could be made out against that, but it is not the intention, I think, to do so.  I admit we cannot pay 100 per cent.; we can pay, say, only 50 per cent. or 40 per cent. or 30 per cent., but whatever that percentage be, let it be paid to each and every person alike and not pay one man 100 per cent. and pay another man 5 per cent.  Therefore, you should make some balance between the two that the country can pay and <Col N="1645" /> strike a balance in that way between the deserving case and the undeserving case.  Because it is inequitable and would be bad, I think this Clause has been rightly denounced in every part of the country and will earn for this Bill, I believe, more opprobrium than any other separate item of it with the possible exception of the personal injuries.</P>

We surely have had a sufficient indication of what a false thing a paper currency is.  Do we want to add to all our other ills that horrible load of paper under which other countries are groaning?  I never in my life heard anything like the suggestion that every sort of claim should be bulked, and that 50 per cent., or 40 per cent., or 30 per cent. should be paid.  As to how this 50 or 40 or 30 per cent. is to be paid we are given no indication.  This Bill seeks to start out on certain definite lines to place people in the same position as <Col N="1646" /> they were in on the 11th of July, 1921; to give them an opportunity of starting business again, starting them as such in that way.  The case that has been made for consequential losses, in my opinion, by reason of the exaggerations that have been introduced into it, is a false case. We never heard in the Ministry of Finance that there was as much money made in this country until claims for consequential losses came to be considered. Then we discovered that the sums of money that we should have been earning on Income Tax were beyond the dreams of avarice, that we could almost afford to pay the costs of a Bill like this every year instead of once in a generation, and I wish that those who make a study of the case for consequential losses would also make a study of how to bring home to the people who make such claims, honest conceptions of their duties to the State.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Gavan Duffy had risen to speak. He had caught my eye just before I intervened, and, therefore, he is in possession when the Dáil resumes to-morrow, or the next time this Bill comes before it.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Dáil adjourn until Friday, February 23rd.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil rose at 6.5 p.m.</P>

      <P>May I ask, Chinn Chomhairle, in connection with Question number 7 on the Order Paper, where there has not been sufficient time for the Minister to make enquiries, will he treat that as an asterisk question, instead of having it put down again on the Paper?</P>
