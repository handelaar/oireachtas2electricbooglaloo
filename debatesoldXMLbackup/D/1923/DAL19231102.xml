      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in the case of a tenant who has been getting an abatement from a landlord for a number of years, reductions under the Land Act, 1923, are to be made under the abated rent or the old rent; whether, in the event of a dispute between landlord and tenant as to the real rent, what is the procedure as to settling the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 (3) of the Land Act, 1923, provides that in any case where an abatement of rent has been allowed by the landlord and where an agreement for an abated rent constitutes an agreement for a new rent then the reductions under the Land Act, 1923, are to be made from the abated rent and not from the old rent.  The question whether the agreement for the abatement amounts to an agreement for a new rent is a question of fact in each case, which in the event of a dispute between the landlord and tenant can only be decided by the Judicial Commissioner who will hear both sides.</P>
      <P>Receivable orders to enable tenants to pay compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent are issued by the Land Commission in accordance with the particulars of the rent as furnished by the landlord under Section 22 (1).  If a tenant questions the accuracy of these particulars as regards the amount of the rent, he can proceed to have the matter determined under Sub-section (3) of Section 22 as explained above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rules 3 and 4 of the prescribed rules of the Land Commission, dated 18th August, 1923, prescribe the procedure necessary to obtain the decision of the Judicial Commissioner on this question. The procedure is as follows:&mdash;A tenant may lodge an objection in writing with the Land Commission setting <Col N="623" /> forth the grounds of his complaint.  A copy of the objection is furnished by the Land Commission to the landlord. If the tenant's contention is not agreed to by the landlord, or the objection is not withdrawn by the tenant, the objection will then be listed for hearing before the Judicial Commissioner.  The Rules referred to may be purchased from Messrs.  Eason &amp; Son, Dublin.</P>

Unfortunately it has not been possible to provide for the deliveries, as no person is willing to perform the duties owing to local intimidation.</P>
      <P>The matter is being kept under notice, and every effort is being made to restore the deliveries at the first available opportunity.</P>

      <P>Immediately on the passing of the Land Act Notices were published in the public Press that the Land Commission was empowered to collect from tenants &ldquo;compounded arrears of rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;payment in lieu of rent,&rdquo; and landlords, agents and receivers were therein notified that they should apply to the Land Commission for forms on which to furnish particulars to enable such arrears and payment in lieu of rent to be collected.  A Notice was at the same time published explaining to tenants their position as regards the payment of compounded arrears of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provisional rules as to the collection of arrears and payment in lieu of rent <Col N="626" /> and as regards the procedure to be followed under the Act have also been published.</P>
    <P>Up to the present the Land Commission have been furnished with particulars on the prescribed forms of the arrears of rent due by some 81,000 tenants on 4,400 estates.  The amount of compounded arrears payable by each tenant has been calculated, and so far some 54,000 receivable orders have been prepared and issued to the tenants on approximately 3,500 of these estates to enable them to pay the first instalment of their compounded arrears.  Receivable orders in the remaining cases are being prepared and issued as rapidly as possible.  Up to date the sum of £135,000 has been lodged by the tenants to whom receivable orders have been issued, and arrangements are being made to pay it out to the parties entitled.</P>
    <P>As little more than a month has elapsed since the first of the receivable orders for the payment of arrears was issued, the collection to date must be regarded as highly satisfactory, and the Land Commission anticipate that the collection of compounded arrears generally will be equally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The instalments for the payment in lieu of rent are also being calculated and the receivable orders prepared, and already a number of them have been issued to the tenants.</P>
    <P>In addition, landlords have been furnished with the prescribed forms to enable them to furnish the particulars required for the ascertainment of the lands to be vested in the Land Commission, and already these particulars have been furnished in several estates and they will be surveyed as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate, <Col N="628" /> after Deputy Johnson's speech, more than three weeks ago, I did not anticipate that I would have time to go to Copenhagen and come back in order to verify Deputy Johnson's facts, and consequently I did not arrange to do so. I am content to accept Deputy Johnson's facts.  In doing so, I might point out that Denmark is a very exceptional country.  During the war Denmark and Holland were the back doors of Germany.  They were in that respect very exceptional countries.  The Germans had to get their stuff in there, and they had to pay any price the Danish people liked to demand from them.  The result was that if the Danish quay labourers chose to ask for any increase of wages, the shippers were making such profits, that all they did or had to do was to put the price on to Germany.  I am rather surprised to find that that condition has continued to the present day.  I have no doubt that in both Denmark and Holland labour is very highly paid.  They were neutral during the European war, and naturally they took advantage of that position.</P>
      <P>Now, I propose to confine myself, in discussing the Governor-General's speech, entirely to one paragraph, and it is the same paragraph that Deputy Johnson dealt with&mdash;that was the paragraph dealing with unemployment and high prices.  Those of us, at any rate, who went through the last election on an independent platform, and who were not under the necessity, as the Minister for Home Affairs was, of making the same speech over and over again, in defence of the Government's policy, found that the two things that really interested the electors were the questions of unemployment and the high prices of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This latter was sometimes more epigrammatically expressed in the statement: &ldquo;Will you lower the price of the pint?&rdquo;  My general reply was that it was easier to lower the pint than the price.  That is undoubtedly the paramount issue in the minds of the electors to-day.  Deputy Johnson spoke on that matter, and I found myself, as I always do, in complete agreement with Deputy Johnson as long as he stuck to general principles; but when he proceeded to reinforce these <Col N="629" /> general principles by arguments and points of detail, I disagreed with him very violently indeed.  If Deputy Johnson would only confine himself to general principles, and not bring forward any facts in support of them, I think we would agree.  Now, to come to the question of the limitation of profits, I am one of the comparatively few Deputies who belong to a class who have had their profits limited for forty years, ever since the Land Act of 1881.  I have no objection in principle to the limitation of profits.  I am delighted to see that other people will get the same medicine as we have got.</P>
    <P>In regard to the particular point of the limitation of profits, it is very easy to limit the profits of anything that cannot get out of the country.  It is easy, for instance, to limit the profits of land, because it is there and cannot be removed.  It is easy to limit the profits of a shopkeeper who does business in his own neighbourhood; but when you come to limit the profits of a business that has an export trade, it becomes exceedingly difficult.  That is why I quarrel with Deputy Johnson's instances.  He gave as one instance the firm of Messrs. Guinness.  As I have already mentioned Messrs. Guinness&mdash; perhaps I ought to state that I have no direct interest in the firm, and my only interest is as an occasional consumer of their products&mdash;Messrs. Guinness do the bulk of their trade outside the thirty-two counties of Ireland. Two-thirds to three-fourths of their business is done across the Channel, and if you limit their profits to such an extent as seriously to interfere with their dividends and their business, they will then say that there are other countries in which profits are not limited, and chemical science has made such advances that they can probably do without the water of the Liffey and they may be tempted to remove their industry elsewhere.  They may be tempted to sacrifice their trade in Ireland and remove their industry to a place where profits are not limited.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the country is going to benefit by that.  The workers of Dublin will not benefit by it.  I do not think the barley-growers will benefit, and I am quite certain the Minister for Finance would be exceedingly unhappy. <Col N="630" /> That point has to be taken into account.  Limit profits by all means, but it must be done carefully and scientifically.  If you limit profits in a fashion merely to obtain popular applause and assert a principle, you will drive some of the few remaining industries out of the country.  There was one remark of Deputy Johnson with which I find myself in perfect agreement.  He said: &ldquo;The whole question seems to me to require some kind of an assent to a proposition that human labour must not be treated in the same way and by the same logic and argument as all ordinary marketable commodities.&rdquo; There I agree with the Deputy, but as far as I know nobody proposes to apply the same logic and the same rules of political economy to human labour as to manufactured products. It is a maxim of political economy to buy in the cheapest market, but if anybody was proposing to carry out that in Ireland we would have Zulus working on the quays and Chinamen on the trams.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is working that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not suggested that the employer imports cheap labour, but there is one form of logic to which human labour must yield, and that is the logic of facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And if it is a fact that work can be done more cheaply outside Ireland and people can live more cheaply outside Ireland, then that work will be sent out of Ireland, and people will go and live outside Ireland, and they are doing so. That is one of the most serious factors of the present case, and it is due to the high cost of living, and it is also partly due to the disturbed state of the country.  These things are driving people out of Ireland, and a great number of people are going out of Ireland, partly because it is a very expensive country to live in.  Things cost more in the City of Dublin and other Irish cities than they do in Manchester, Liverpool or Belfast.  Postage is more expensive, for one thing, and people who are not tied to this country, by the conditions of their employment, or their property, will undoubtedly tend to go away where they can live more cheaply.  The exodus nowadays is not confined to one <Col N="631" /> class of the community, namely, the boys and girls, who throng the American Consul's office, in the desire to have their passports vised.  Professional men, doctors, barristers, auditors, are going away to England, and the only people who are remaining are solicitors and architects, because of the great amount of work that remains to be done in their particular line&mdash;reconstruction work&mdash; owing to recent destruction.  Most of the class of people who tend to go away are those who have small incomes either from securities or from pensions.</P>
    <P>In other days Government servants, bank managers, Local Government officials, and people of that class, when they got their pensions, came up to live in the County Dublin, but now they go away to Wales or France, to escape the heavy taxation and because a shilling goes further in these places than it does in Dublin.  But that is not the only loss of expenditure in this country.  We are paying compensation for damage to person and property, and except where there is a reconstruction clause attached, a great deal of this compensation money is being spent outside the country, and that has a most serious effect upon every class of the community. It has an injurious effect not only upon trade, but the fact that that money is going out of the country is a great factor in producing unemployment. I had hoped that the gracious speech we heard from the Governor-General might have recognised that very serious factor in our national life. You have only to walk outside this Dáil and pass into Grafton Street and O'Connell Street and you are struck with the number of empty shops in these great thoroughfares, even though quarter of O'Connell Street has been destroyed.  Ten or fifteen years ago you could not possibly get an empty shop in Horse Show week in O'Connell Street or Grafton Street, yet when I was looking for Committee rooms at the last election I had a choice of four business premises to select from.</P>
    <P>It is not only employment that is disappearing, but the taxation which would arise from monies spent on luxuries and other things is going also. People will not pay the Income Tax in <Col N="632" /> this country when they are only called upon to pay less tax across the water. The people are going to France in very large numbers.  I am told that there is a large Irish colony at Dinard in Brittany, and also there is a large Irish population in the Channel Islands.  I am not saying these things for the purpose of blaming the Government, but I hope they will bear this factor in mind. In making Ireland a country attractive for people to live in there is one factor that would contribute very greatly to that end, and that is the factor of taxation. One of the things that is driving the people out of the country is the fact that we have the heaviest taxation anywhere in Europe&mdash;I am not sure about Germany, but there the currency fluctuates so much that you pay your Income Tax as late as you can in the year, and sometimes you find that you have made a profit.  But certainly of any place in this part of the world we have the heaviest Income Tax.  As the Minister for Home Affairs asked in regard to the Northern Government joining with the Free State, why should the six counties want to pay sixpence more by ranging themselves with us?  Of course, it will be better for the six counties in the long run to come in, as I hope they will, but they very properly ask at the present moment why they should unite with us in order to pay 6d. in the £ more in Income Tax. There is not one word in the Governor-General's speech about the heavy taxation. The country is bearing the heaviest taxation it can, and if the country is really to prosper that taxation must be reduced.  I do not blame the Government for making promises they may not be able to fulfil, but I hope they will take this matter into their deepest and most earnest consideration. It is the bedrock of everything. It is at the bottom of the high cost of living.  If the merchant in Cork, Limerick or Dublin has to pay sixpence in the £ Income Tax more than his competitors across the water, he is forced to extract that sixpence in the £, until we have a tariff system, out of the consumer, because he is not a philantrophist. Now, I have spoken at greater length than I intended, but I do want to put one or two points before the Government for their consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> I agree with Deputy McGarry who said in the Dáil some time ago that there was no use in laying down general propositions on political economy without suggesting some remedy.  The remedy of course is bound to be a highly unpopular one in Government Departments.  There are two suggestions I want to make, and in doing so I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is not here, but I hope that what I have to say will be conveyed to him.  There are two ways, I think, in which he might divert some of the burden that falls on his shoulders.  I know of course that he has immense responsibilities to bear, and that he has the most unenviable and unpopular post in the Government.  Apparently he is not let go on any of the Government joy-rides, he was not taken to the Imperial Conference, nor did he go to Geneva.  I may say that I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister for Finance, but what I am now going to suggest is in the hope of trying to lighten the immense burden he has to carry.</P>
    <P>My first suggestion is that he should be assisted by a small Committee on the lines of the Geddes or the Inchcape Committee, which should be set up to go into the estimates of every Department of the Government, and which should be asked to indicate where reductions can be made.  I know that we have an Estimates Committee under our Standing Orders, but I do not suggest that the small Committee I propose should be composed of Deputies of this Dáil, or that even it should be a joint Committee representative of the Dáil and the Seanad.  We are all very human, and we all have our constituents, and we might be slow to make a recommendation, even though we thought it right, which, perhaps, conflicted with the interests of our constituents. What I suggest is, that this small Committee should be composed of the three best men that the Minister for Finance can get, whether they be members of the Dail or not.  In my opinion there should be on the Committee a business man and a pensioned Government servant.</P>
    <P>My reason for suggesting the appointment of a pensioned Government servant on the Committee is that we all <Col N="634" /> know the tricks and the camouflage that could be put before an enquiry of this kind if you had not on it some person like a pensioned Government servant who had inside knowledge of Government offices.  You might also have one, if not two, business men on the Committee, with this pensioned Government official, which would go slowly and methodically through the estimates of every Government Department. Take one item of expenditure, the cost of travelling expenses.  That is an item on which I believe there could be an enormous sum saved.  The cost of travelling expenses in connection with the Board of Works, runs, I believe, to a colossal sum, compared with the return given for such expenditure. The Committee, I suggest, should go through the estimates for each Government Department in the same spirit as a business man trying to discover, from an examination of his accounts, why his business was not paying.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Minister for Finance should be asked to share all the responsibility for the Government's enormous expenditure, and for that reason I would suggest that he should ration each Government Department and discover how much money he can allow to each.  He should be put in a position to tell the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and so on, that he was allowing each of them so much and that they would have to do with that particular sum.  Such a system might mean that supplementary estimates would have to be introduced, but I believe if such a system were adopted you would be setting each department to carry out reforms inside itself, you would prune off the unessential and leave the essential, and most certainly, I think, the pruning knife is overdue.</P>

    <P>As Deputy Bryan Cooper remarked, we listened the other evening to an avalanche of statistics from Deputy Johnson.  They were most interesting, of course, to all of us, but the impression left on my mind was that there was nothing constructive whatever in the speech.  There was no suggestion, as far as I could discover in the speech, which would help in any way to relieve what is present in all our minds, namely, the problem of unemployment. The Governor-General in his speech recognised the importance of the matter, and the pressing need of meeting this problem.  The longest paragraph in his Address was devoted to this subject.  The Government put forward, in the speech delivered by the Governor-General, two special remedies. These were the construction of a larger number of houses in the country and the improvement of our roads. Both proposals are excellent in their way, especially the building of an increased number of houses.  Anyone who goes through Ireland, especially the towns, and indeed through many of the country districts, must be impressed by this fact that there is an urgent need to have the housing conditions in Ireland vastly improved.  It must be admitted, of course, that a great deal has been done in that direction during the last forty years, beginning with the Act passed by the Imperial Parliament about the year 1883; but still a vast amount remains to be done.  When a start was made with the building of houses in Ireland a great many years ago they were let at a very low rent of about a shilling a week.  That rent, of course, would not pay for the building or the cost involved in the erection of a scheme of houses.  To do so it would be necessary to charge a rent of about 2s. 8d. per week, but the houses were let at 1s. a week, and the people in the districts in which these houses were erected were perfectly content to make up the balance in the rates, because they saw what an advantage it was to have houses provided for the labourers.  That has been the record <Col N="636" /> for practically every scheme of houses erected in Ireland.  Public bodies saw that houses were urgently necessary, and they were content to let them at a rent which meant a big tax on the local rates.  Up to a certain point the country was quite prepared to pay its share, and rather more than its share, in the erection of houses, but it can no longer do so because of the high cost of materials and the other almost prohibitive costs involved in the carrying out of building schemes. Nevertheless, houses must be provided, and the Government recognise that this is a pressing necessity.  The Government also recognise that the improvement of the roads of the country is an urgent necessity.  None of these things, of course, will bring grist to the Government mill, but I would suggest that there are other ways of meeting this unemployment problem which, I believe, would bring in money to the Government exchequer. It is well known that there is a vast amount of potential wealth in the undeveloped water-power of Ireland and also in the development of our fisheries.  I do not propose to touch on this latter aspect of our national resources, but I desire to say a few words on the development of electrical power, which has not been developed at all in Ireland so far.</P>
    <P>There is a vast field of possible enterprise in that direction.  I daresay a great many people have been aware that for a long time there has been a great deal written about what is called harnessing the river Liffey.  Probably Deputies know something about that matter.  I think it was opened first of all by an address given by Sir John Griffith in this very room on that subject a good many years ago.  Quickly following upon that address a great many people formed themselves into companies and went down to the place and had interviews with the different riparian owners, of which I am one. They tried to bring those schemes forward. Of course they would not bring them forward if there was not some money in the enterprise.  That stands to reason.  When I was approached on the matter, I said that if it was to the advantage of the district I should be very glad to help in any way I could. <Col N="637" /> None of these schemes that have been brought forward seem to me likely to be of the least advantage to the district. They will be of great advantage to, shall I call them, the company-mongers, but to nobody else.  The whole desire was to get in front of a scheme which would really be of advantage to the people, and which would cost much more than these schemes which these small companies bring forward on their own account.</P>
    <P>Some of these schemes are of the most weird nature.  There was one proposal to carry the river Liffey in a tunnel, diverting it from the falls of Poulaphouca, which is one of the beauty spots of the country, and leaving the river bed perfectly dry for a mile.  This tunnel was to be carried through my place, partly through the ground and partly in the air. Naturally, I had rather an objection to this.  Of course I am not the only person concerned.  There are a good many others.  I happen to own one side of the river, and on the other side there are a great many different owners.  As a matter of fact all the schemes which were brought forward would absolutely ruin the beauty of Poulaphouca, one of the beauty spots of the country that many people visit and which might be developed in that respect much more than it is.  All those schemes proposed to draw off the water from the river and leave it dry for about a mile, with a dry arch at Poulaphouca, which would naturally ruin the beauty of the place.</P>
    <P>There is one scheme that has been put forward by Sir John Griffith which to my mind is a scheme worthy of attention on behalf of the Government. That scheme proposed to form a lake above Poulaphouca, which would give an even flow of water all the year round for the purpose of making electricity. The idea of these companies is to supply Dublin and the townships and the electric railways, and that beautiful railway called the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway, with electricity, which undoubtedly they could do at a very low rate.  My position is this.  It is rather a peculiar one.  I am rather like the lady who was so bothered by her admirers that she was recommended by her medical adviser to go on board ship to get rid of them. <Col N="638" /> When she got on board ship she found that the captain and the crew gave her so much annoyance that she had to jump overboard to get rid of them.  I do not propose to do that, but I thought when I came to Leinster House that at least I should be rid of those people. Only the other day, however, I was called out to meet another company that had been formed to develop electrical power at Poulaphouca.</P>
    <P>I want to let the Government see that there is money in this thing, that it would give a vast amount of employment if a proper scheme was taken up and would bring in a good deal of money to the Exchequer, else these people would not be bothering about it. The people of the district are most anxious that the Government should consider this scheme&mdash;I do not say take it up.  It is a scheme worthy of their consideration, because there is money in it.  Another consideration is that the people of the district think that the preservation of the beauties of Poulaphouca would be taken into consideration by the Government more than by any company which would be simply out to exploit the undertaking for its own benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry indeed that I am not a riparian proprietor of land, and that I could not also bring forward a scheme of development for my area.  I rise to speak on behalf of an industry which occupies the attention of more than 2,000,000 of people in the Free State.  I wish to point out to the Government that while the legislation foreshadowed in the Governor-General's speech in connection with agriculture is good in its way, it falls very far short of the requirements of the case and is not at all in keeping with the depression which exists in that industry, on which the prosperity of this State is dependent.  I will be criticised if I do not attempt to put forward some constructive proposals by which this industry might be saved. The Agricultural Commission which sat recently has made certain recommendations, and the legislation which is foreshadowed implements those recommendations as far as they go.  There are, however, other things which are entirely neglected, which in my opinion <Col N="639" /> are responsible for the depression in the agricultural industry, and which, if not speedily remedied, will sound the death-knell of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place I would refer to paragraph 11, which says that the reorganisation of our railways has for a considerable time exercised the minds of the Ministers.  In this country agricultural products are still being charged freights 400 per cent. above pre-war rates.  Prices are on a par with pre-war, so that we are debarred from the markets beside us where most of our products are sold.  The products of this country are in the proportion of three to one; that is, two parts must be exported, and the other part kept for internal consumption.  While two-thirds of our products must be exported we are asked to pay a railway tariff 400 per cent. above the pre-war rate.  The whole idea of railway reorganisation, in the mind of the Ministry, is to put it on a paying basis.  Sufficient attention is not given to the rating levied by the railways.  There is no body in authority in this country who can say to the railways, &ldquo;You are charging too much for the carriage of this or that product.&rdquo; Up to 1920 there was such a Board in England, and when a revision of rates was necessary the railways had to go before that Board.  As the Board has been abolished in this country the railways are in a position to charge what they like.  The result is that we are, three or four years after the European war, paying enormous freights which place us at a great disadvantage with competitors.  If you take up a railway classification book you will find that the rates are based on an English classification, and that they are in favour of a manufacturing country, to the detriment of the products of this country.  Textiles, hardware and boots are charged the same rate as eggs. There is no comparison whatever between the value of, say, 5 cwt. of drapery and 5 cwt. of eggs.  Still we are compelled to pay a rate for eggs equivalent to the rate paid for high priced articles.  Eggs in boxes are charged what is known as third-class rates.  Hardware, cutlery and boots are also charged third-class rates.  A box of <Col N="640" /> boots containing 100 pairs will occupy the same space as 3 or 4 cwt. of eggs, and while the eggs will be worth about £9 the boots will perhaps be worth £100.  The railways are collecting one per cent. from the manufacturers and 20 per cent. from the agriculturists. The exporters are paying these charges, although ostensibly it may be thought that they are paid by people on the other side.  Prices are fixed in England, and when people there buy cattle or eggs they know what they will get for the goods and what the railway freights will be.  They deduct from the price they pay for products the enormous charges that have to be met. That means we have to pay in freights 20 per cent. of the value of the goods purchased from us.  That is one cause of the depression in agriculture, and unless it is removed we have no chance of making progress in the industry.</P>
    <P>Heretofore it was the custom to book cattle through from any part of Ireland to any part of England.  You cannot do that now.  Why?  The English rates have been reduced to 50 per cent. over pre-war, but the Irish rates are 150 per cent. higher than they were before the war.  The Irish railways will not reduce their rates in accordance with the English rates, and accordingly there is only booking to Dublin, and re-booking to England at tremendous expense and annoyance. It is only in parts of Ireland, where a railway company have reduced rates, that through booking is now available. Deputy McKenna will be able to enlighten the Dáil in that respect and explain what it means to agriculture. My remedy for the present state of affairs is to set up a rating authority and to let it differentiate in favour of agricultural products, and see that they are carried at the lowest possible rates.  Most of the traffic that is carried in Ireland is from the ports to inland centres, so that there is a continual stream of empty waggons, going from the centre of the country to the ports, to bring back imports.  The traffic that comes from the interior of the country could be carried for nothing, as the railway waggons have in any case to go back empty when <Col N="641" /> there is no traffic.  We should have the cheapest possible rates on agricultural products.  Our competitors in the Dominions get their products carried at a halfpenny per ton per mile.  Why are Irish agriculturalists not placed in the same position?  These things can only be remedied by setting up a rating authority under the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to which complaints could be sent, so that farmers will be able to put produce on the market at the lowest possible price. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is amused.</P>
    <P>If he were in the same position as a man on the land who has to pay annuities, local rates, and income tax, he would not be laughing so heartily.  The second thing that operates adversely to agriculture is the incidence of local taxation.  At the moment, by reason of the various Land Acts, we are asked to pay an annual charge of £4,000,000 in annuities.  £3,133,000 was paid last year, and the Land Bill is operating to extinguish rents in the nature of £1,000,000 so that the overhead expenditure on land which we have to pay is £4,000,000.  We cannot reduce that, but in addition we have the local rating, which we can reduce if we work in the proper way.  The last local councils were elected on a political basis.  They were elected not for the efficiency of the members, not for their capability for conducting business, but rather to uphold certain political doctrines which at the time were necessary to fight other organisations.  We have a series of Councils whose whole idea seems to be not to give good service for money but to give pensions here, jobs there, and grant direct labour here and there. Everything is done in a wholesale manner. Money is filched away, and we on the land are suffering and we must see that the Government, who went to the country on the plea of progress and who filched away farmers from their allegiance to the right people, shall, in return, see that the next elections will not be based on a political basis but on questions of economy, efficiency and good dealing.  The whole country is being turned into a country of pensions. Home help is the name in one case, and old age pensions is the name in the other, but whether it is home help, old <Col N="642" /> age pensions, the Army, or the Civic Guard, we are being saddled with the expenditure, and I ask the Government to see in the next election that suitable franchise proposals will be put forward so that the people who pay the piper will be enabled to call the tune.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the next obstacle in the way of progress, I would say that it is the attitude of labour.  We have been forced for the last three or four months to sit idly by and watch a conflict with which we were not concerned, but which has inflicted untold damage on our industry.  We have had to stand by with a falling market and have had no means of sending our goods there in time.  This recurs yearly. Last year the same thing happened in Tipperary where a dispute took place between the creamery owners and labour.  Our milk was refused, and if we sent it to the creamery we were not paid for it.  These things are happening every day in the week, and until some definite arrangement is made by which labour will see that it is in their own interests not to hold up our products but to take a common sense attitude and meet the claims of the producers we will not be able to make the industry self-supporting.  A good deal has been said about unemployment, which is a subject that has been over-dealt with.  There are 40,000 unemployed persons registered in this country.  All the industrial workers in the Saorstat do not amount to 250,000.  The cost to the State in bonuses to these people is half a million pounds.  If there is unemployment in the country the farm labourer is not insurable, and we have to support him in home help.  Why do not the industrial centres bear this burden by raising the rates on the employers, on the one hand, and the workers on the other hand?  Let the 200,000 people keep the forty thousand. Those who are idle should be kept by those who are employed, but do not saddle the community with half a million pounds to bolster up people who number only 250,000.  Two million people are on the land, and if there is any unemployment there let the industries in the city support them.  As regards general taxation, I had hoped that the Minister's statement would have been before us.  It is absolutely <Col N="643" /> essential that the pruning knife should be rigorously employed to cut down expenditure&mdash;I do not say this year&mdash; to a state in which income will balance expenditure.  We must borrow this year, and the farmers have been asked, and I have asked them myself, to contribute their quota to this new loan. Will anybody support a country in which running expenditure exceeds revenue? If you want money and you go to a bank, what will the banker say? He will say: &ldquo;What is your income and what is your expenditure?&rdquo;  and if he finds that your revenue is not in accordance with your expenditure he will not touch you.  The same applies to a country.  We must balance our accounts. How is it to be done?</P>
    <P>The pruning knife is one way; taking off unemployment relief is another way, and the setting up of the Commission, advocated by Deputy Cooper, so that the internal administration of the Head Office here should be overhauled and so that nobody will be employed for whom there is not suitable work, is another way.  If we get our revenue and expenditure to balance then we can talk of joining the people in the North, and then it will be to the benefit of the people in the North to join us.  By thus attending to our expenditure we can make this country a wealthy one.</P>

      <P>The address of the Governor-General was notable to me by the omission of one great problem which will add to the responsibilities and troubles of the Government of this State in the coming year.  I am no lover of the League of Nations.  I think it was a mistake to join it, and this Dáil will realise before many years that it was a mistake too.  But I must confess that I am both instructed and amused by the grandiloquent phraseology and cultured form of sunburstry which announces Ireland's entrance into the League.  We are told nothing of the responsibilities or expenses which membership of the League will entail. The fact remains that this nation here was always a nation.  The Union with Great Britain did not take away the attributes of a nation, and we were <Col N="644" /> ushered into the League of Nations under the patronage of the chief tyrants, and the clamours of the minor ones.  The Imperial Conference stands on quite a different footing.  This State is a member of the Commonwealth and as such unfettered commercial and social intercourse should be cultivated and encouraged between all the States in the Commonwealth, paying, of course, due attention to one's own special interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I said that the Governor-General's address to me was notable by the omission of one great problem.  I fear that His Excellency and the wise men who sit in his council chamber were so lost in contemplation of the delights of Geneva that they failed to see the problem looming big and gaunt which will call imperatively for their attention during the next few months.  The harvest has failed absolutely, and in the west there is not half the usual yield of the two great essentials of life, turf and potatoes.  On account of the bad weather the turf could not be saved and the potatoes are all rotting.  In normal times, with industry going full speed in Ireland and Great Britain, this would be a serious condition of things.  To-day, with stagnation all round, it is a thousand times more so, and a comparatively small expenditure upon roads and upon houses affecting small farmers very indirectly will not go very far to relieve the distress. I hope Deputy O'Connell will not think I am forestalling him about the fisheries, but it is only now I saw his resolution about the fisheries.  Of course there is no mention made of the sea fisheries in the Governor-General's address.  We have heard a lot of rumours.  In imagination I have listened to the rhythmic rumblings of the new steam yacht and to the music of General Mulcahy's sharpshooters ranging round the coast seeking the enemies of the fishers.  Both are expensive luxuries, and I can well imagine the groans of the Minister for Finance at the cost. We are now told we are to have four warships on the list.  I will say nothing about that for a time, but the building up of a strong and prosperous fishing community is as important to the economic development of this nation as <Col N="645" /> the welfare of the farmers.  I hope the Government will give serious attention to this question in the near future.  It is announced that laws affecting merchant shipping are to be introduced. Those laws will have a very great influence for good or for bad on the merchant shipping trade of the Free State, and I hope sufficient time will be allowed to elapse between the time when the Bill is first introduced, and when it comes up for due consideration.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy McBride, I cannot say that I was very favourably impressed by the Governor-General's Address.  There are very many serious things that the Governor-General studiously ignored, and if his outline of the Government's policy is to be the guiding factor of the Government during the coming year or two, or whatever number of years the Government holds office, I think he should have told us in detail what the Government proposes to do.  One thing left out in connection with our entrance into the League of Nations under the patronage of our oppressor of yesterday, is that not one word was said as to the cultivation of the Irish language in a proper manner so that we might assert our distinctive nationality before the world.  It is all very well to say that we are a distinct nation, but if some effort is not made to secure that that nationality is felt before the nations of the world, we are but ploughing the sands.  There is another matter about which I have not been able to find any reference in the Address, and that is the fact that to-day thousands of men are locked up by the present Government and no indication is given as to whether or not they are to be locked up indefinitely.  It is not, I suppose, a pleasant matter to introduce, but it seems to strike at the fundamental principles of freedom in every country, the power of any Government to take a body of men and lock them up indefinitely without making any further observations on the matter.  Time and again this question has been raised, and I think it is nearly time that we knew.  I am speaking apart altogether from the protest made by these men on hunger strike.  I am demanding a statement as to whether <Col N="646" /> the fundamental principles of liberty are not being stretched in order that these men may be kept incarcerated. That is one matter to which the Governor-General has not referred, and also the matter of our national distinctiveness regarding our language, and I desire to draw the Government's attention to these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with a few points in connection with the speeches made by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Wilson.  We have heard from them the great grievances from which Ireland is suffering, the excessive taxation, the exodus of the people who had money to spend in the country, the fact that shops and other places are vacant, and the only thing that I did not hear them speak about was the root cause of this.  It is perfectly evident that these things have been caused by the political position in which a minority refuses to accept the will of the majority, that the actions of the Republicans have caused chaos all over the country, and that to-day money was never so scarce.  There have been 109 men returned to enter the Dáil to endeavour in every possible way to uplift the country, and the cause of the present unemployment, of the scarcity of money, and other troubles, is due to the policy adopted by the party of forty-four&mdash;I cannot call them T.D.'s, I call them D.T.'s&mdash;because the policy they stand for is unsound.  If it goes on as at present the particular Party that would come most to grief will be the Labour Party, because a Loan is about to be floated and if the money is not forthcoming and if the Government are not able to get funds to carry on, it is perfectly apparent that in the near future there will be starvation. If they had addressed their remarks to the Party which has caused the excessive taxation and the exodus I think they would be well advised.  I am sorry that Deputy Wilson touched the matter of Home Help, because I happen to be in touch with the distribution of Home Help in the county I come from, and I know that but for the small amounts distributed to these people they would either be in the County Home or in their graves.  This is one of the items which I think it <Col N="647" /> would not be possible to reduce.  I only make these remarks because it is perfectly clear&mdash;to me anyhow&mdash;that the cause of our troubles is the fact that the minority have paralysed the trade and commerce of the country. With regard to those who have left the country, if you had peace, or any sign of peace, you would have them all back again, because they cannot live out of it.  Although we have not peace a great many of them are already coming back, and I believe that if this party who call themselves the Opposition would preach to the people who are causing the trouble, instead of stating that the Dáil is the cause, it would have a much better effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the considerable amount of space that the Governor-General has given to the agricultural industry in his Speech.  I am glad to see that the Ministry realises the importance of the agricultural industry in the fabric of this country.  I note the Governor-General's references to the Land Act, and I would say that I, as one of those who had a good deal to do with the agitation which led up to the introduction and passing of the Land Act, felt a good deal of pleasure in its passing, and to a certain extent approve of a good many of its provisions. We believe that the Government made a brave and a bold attempt to pass an Act which would finally settle a question which has been bothering this country for generations.  But there is one portion of the Act which we never gave our approval to and which we asked our Deputies to use all their persuasive powers to get amended, and these are the Sections which deal with the matter of the arrears of rent.  We know that in all the Acts passed in the British House of Commons it was a common thing to wipe out arrears, or the greater portion of them, and if they were not actually wiped out by the wording of the Act, in the actual carrying out of the transaction, the passing of the land from the landlord to the tenant, they usually were by agreement, or were added to the purchase money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we find in this Act is that the greater portion of the three years' <Col N="648" /> arrears is payable by the tenants, and I would like to call the attention of the Government to the fact that these arrears accrued during years of turmoil and distrubance, during years of civil strife and strife with a foreign enemy, and this strife was followed by industrial distrubances.  It is a fact that farmers, both purchased and unpurchased, can honestly say that they have not made a profit during the past two years.  I do not know if there is any farmer in this country who can say his balance sheet will show a balance on the right side during the last two years. Since the passing of the Act the position of the tenant has been worsened. This industrial strife has held up the whole agricultural industry, and has prevented the export of our products. It has forced the farmer to sell at 50s. per cwt. pigs valued at 80s. across the Channel.  Our whole cattle trade was held up, but our butter trade was not held up, though the actual cost of shipping it was considerably increased owing to these disturbances. I know for a fact that there are unpurchased tenants all over the country who are finding it a matter of considerable difficulty to meet the first demand made on them by the Government.  I have been approached many times in my capacity as a Deputy for the farmers with regard to this matter, and I honestly believe that the great number of people who have come to me have told me what is the absolute truth with regard to their position.</P>
    <P>Some of them say they have found considerable difficulty in getting the actual amount necessary to meet the first demand by the Government, that is 75 <i>per cent.</i> of one year's rent.  We know that at any time before the appointed day they may get a demand for 75 <i>per cent.</i> of two years' rent, and simultaneously they may get a demand for the ordinary 75 <i>per cent.</i> of the annuity they have to pay in lieu of rent.  I ask the Government to take into serious consideration the position of the agricultural community on whom they are making this demand, and I would say to them there are three courses open to them.  The first course is to resist the demand, and I am afraid if they do they will find themselves <Col N="649" /> practically up against a stone wall.  I do not think they will be able to collect the arrears they are attempting to collect, for the farmers will not be able to pay them, and they will have to evoke the law, and carry it to its utmost extremity.  The Government may find themselves in the position of having to seize the cattle in the land, and forcing some of the farmers to sell their land to pay these annuities.  I hope the Government will not follow that course.  I would suggest that there are constructive courses open to them, and the first is to pass an amending Act which would have the effect of wiping out a certain portion of these arrears.  If they do not think that is possible owing to the fact that they have just passed a Land Act, I would suggest some definite measures should be taken by which the tenants would be relieved of the fear that immediate demands would be made on them for the balance of arrears, and that some effort should be made by which the balance of arrears would be extended over a long period and make it easy for these tenants.  I say that, not for the purpose of making a debating point, but to aid the Government and advise them on a matter which I think is of great consequence to the peace of the country.  I know certain people are going through the country, and the advice they are giving is this: &ldquo;Do not pay these arrears, pay no rent, and pay no taxes, and pay no shop-bills, and in the course of time you will not have to pay anything as we will have these things wiped out for you.&rdquo;  We do not give that advice.  I advised these unpurchased tenants not to withhold the first payment, and that we would do all in our power to influence the Government to make the balance of these payments easy for them.  Another notable omission from the Governor-General's speech is the matter of agricultural credits.  I am sorry that the Governor-General did not see his way to suggest to the Government that they should carry out the suggestion which was put forward by the Agricultural Commission with regard to the provision of agricultural credit for the farmers.  We know that the loans from the Board of Works have been cut off, and there is no available <Col N="650" /> means at present by which farmers can get loans on long-term credit for the purpose of doing such work as improving their houses and buildings and carrying out drainage, or any work of that kind which involves borrowing money for a considerable time.  Banks are not willing to lend money for this purpose; they want to have their assets readily realisable, and they are accustomed to lending money for short-term dates of three or six months, and it does not suit a man who has to borrow money for the purpose of permanent improvement on his holding to be continually going to the bank and asking them to renew these bills.  I suggest it is to the interests of the Government to introduce at an early date legislation to deal with this matter of agricultural credit, and I would suggest to them to follow the advice given to them by the Agricultural Commission which has studied the thing, and must know what they are talking about.  It is also essential that the Government should in some shape or form encourage the establishment of co-operative banks for the purpose of making it easier for small farmers to obtain credit than it is at present.</P>
    <P>As I stated before in connection with the unpurchased tenants' problem, there are many small farmers at present on the verge of bankruptcy, and if the present bad times continue they will have to appeal to somebody to provide them with funds.  The Government should seriously consider the question of encouraging them, either by grants or guarantees, in the formation of Co-operative Bank Societies which will place within the reach of those small farmers an opportunity of obtaining credit on easy terms Before I finish, there is one matter which, I think, is of urgent importance to the community I represent.  I note that the Governor-General refers to the improvement of the change in the system of government.  I suggest in connection with this that the Government should give consideration not only to the matter of improving the present system of Local Government administration in the country, but to the changing of the incidence of Local Government taxation.  We, representing <Col N="651" /> the farming community, feel that we have to pay an undue proportion of the taxation which has to be borne. Take the case of a farmer with twenty acres.  During the past year or two he made no profit whatever out of his holding, and yet he had to pay a local rate equal to that paid by the owner of a shop in a town whose income would be about £1,000 a year.  It is not uncommon for such a thing to happen. We of the farming community have to pay the rates for the maintenance of the main and trunk roads. What use does the average small farmer make of those roads?  We know that by far the greatest damage is done by motor traffic.  The largest amount of damage is caused by heavy lorries which tear up the road surface. The main and the trunk roads ought to be made a national charge, and the farmers of the country should not be forced to bear the expenses of maintaining them.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few remarks in reference to Deputy Johnson's speech on the occasion of our last sitting.  The reason I do so is that in my judgment the industrial situation, bad as other situations are in the country&mdash;situations in respect to farming and so on&mdash;at the present moment overshadows everything else.  I think there are few things more important than the immediate prospect of industrial peace.  For that reason I listened very carefully to Deputy Johnson's speech here on the last day. I was particularly anxious to know if he could give us any definite constructive proposals, and, candidly, I was disappointed.  He gave us an exceedingly interesting academic resumé of the whole industrial and economic situation, but with the exception that towards the end of his speech he made a suggestion about the selection of a tribunal to ascertain certain facts, I am afraid I could not find any constructive proposal in his speech.  I would like to say that with the general tone of Deputy Johnson's remarks I am in perfect agreement.  I think there was really very little fault to be found with the general tone of his speech.  He gave us a great many <Col N="652" /> figures, figures which dealt with Denmark and other places, and as far as the figures which he brought from Denmark are concerned I am not in a position to contradict them, and I accept them.  He did indulge in some figures relating to matters nearer home.  He referred&mdash;I am sure it was an oversight&mdash;to some of Messrs. Guinness's figures.  He stated that the capital was 2½ millions.  That was obviously a mistake.  The concern was originally bought for 5 millions, and floated for 6 millions.  There have been various paper adjustments since then, but if the Deputy considers the real working capital in Guinness's he will find the amount of money invested in stocks and debts and so on runs into very many times 2½ millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not wish to make any particular point out of that.  The Deputy referred also at some considerable length to the cost of living.  Very often when people speak about the cost of living, I think they might more correctly use the expression &ldquo;the standard of living.&rdquo;  I go further and say it would be more correct to use the expression &ldquo;standard of luxury.&rdquo; in this matter of Guinness's to which Deputy Johnson refers.  He told us the profits for the last three years were approximately 14 million pounds.  If we allow for the fact that a considerable proportion of those profits undoubtedly come from across the water and from foreign export trade, there still remains a very appreciable sum which was earned in Ireland.  The first question I want to put to Deputy Johnson in that connection is this: where do those profits come from?  They come out of the wage earners' pockets and out of the farmers' pockets, and out of the pockets of other classes of wage earners in Ireland, but more particularly out of the workers' pockets.  With reference to the standard of living, or what I would call, to a certain extent, the standard of luxury, in which the country is indulging at the present moment, in my judgment the country cannot hope economically to sustain it. Take the city of Dublin as an example. I remember some years ago, when I came to Dublin from the country, there were two or three theatres here.  There <Col N="653" /> were a couple of small music halls, and that represented practically the total number of houses of entertainment in the city of Dublin.  I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that at the present moment, within a radius of four miles of where we sit, there are probably three-quarters of a million of money invested in picture houses alone. I want to ask Deputy Johnson seriously to consider where did that money come from.</P>

      <P>Precisely; they were supporting a standard of luxury and not a standard of living.  That is the point I want to make.  I think it ought to be perfectly clear that this country cannot sustain a standard of luxury of that nature.  It is really altogether wrong to talk about the cost of living being too high when hundreds and thousands can be accumulated from the surplus earnings of the various wage earners to put up the capital necessary to supply all these forms of amusement which we have nowadays in the city of Dublin and throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that is consistent with the cost of living being too high.  Mind you, I would be the very last in the world to interfere with or to suggest that the workman should not have reasonable relaxation.  But, I am honestly afraid that not only the workers but the wage-earners generally, are endeavouring to support a standard of living, or should I say of luxury, whichever way you wish to put it, which the country is quite unable to afford.  Deputy Johnson laid stress on the difference between employers and employees.  In dealing with the industrial situation generally, he took up what I consider rather a detached attitude.  His idea appeared to be to recite all the industrial and economic grievances, and no one knows how to do that better, and to bundle up all these troubles and throw them at the heads of the Government and to say to the heads of the Government &ldquo;settle them.&rdquo;  In my opinion Deputy Johnson, and the gentlemen who sit on those benches with him, do themselves represent a class which more than any other class can be expected to give help in securing industrial peace.  One of the difficulties at the present moment in the matter of securing industrial peace&mdash;and I do not wish to say this for the purpose of irritating Deputy Johnson, or the gentlemen who sit with him &mdash;is, that the Labour Party have not, at the moment, industrial peace in their own ranks.  That is the statement which I make genuinely and with very great regret.  There was a time when employers, as a class, looked upon the formation of workmen's unions with very grave suspicion.  However, a great deal of water has rolled under the bridge since those days.  For my part, as one who is associated with a great many industries, I view personally, even from the businessman's point of view, with very grave regret, those domestic differences within the ranks of the Labour Party, because one of the greatest difficulties which business <Col N="655" /> people have to meet with at present is the fact that it is difficult, in a great many instances, to have a united Labour Party with whom they can negotiate and with whom they can make agreements, agreements that they can have confidence will be respected. Therefore, I think that if Deputy Johnson would use part of his great talents in trying to compose domestic differences in the Labour Party, that to my mind would be one step in the right direction towards securing industrial peace.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper, in the course of his speech, referred to the formation of a Finance Committee to help the Government to secure economies and to advise them on their policy generally.  He mentioned that, in his judgment, it would be a very good thing to have some businessmen on the committee. I suppose I come under the category, to a great extent, of a businessman.  It has been the custom in a great many quarters to regard the businessman as some kind of a superman.  He is nothing of the kind.  He is just gifted with the same dose of original sin that the Independents or the Cumann na nGaedheal members, or anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, they are human, too.  The great objection I have, as a businessman&mdash;I will be perfectly candid and lay all my cards on the table&mdash;to going on these Committees is that having regard to the businessman's training and also to the fact that most of his mental activities are generally associated with a certain amount of commercial benefit to himself, which is really one of the main objects in a great many cases, it would be very difficult for the ordinary businessman to preserve a judicial attitude.  After all, they are human, just as well as anybody else, and it is inevitable that the average businessman always has a tendency to view things from his own particular angle.  For that reason I do not really think that the suggestion of Deputy Cooper that businessmen should be put <Col N="656" /> on these proposed Committees is a good one.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of industrial peace, it is a matter on which I feel very strongly.  I am not going to here enter into any statement of the employers' case, or any criticism of the labourers' case.  I do not think it is to the advantage of the present situation that I should do one or the other, but I cannot help thinking that if there was a little more of the milk of human kindness on both sides, and if there were less of an atmosphere of mutual distrust and suspicion on both sides, we would make a good deal more headway in the matter of bringing about a more prosperous commercial condition in the country.  I have been associated with a good many businesses. There are good employers and there are plenty bad ones.  For my part, I have always found it very good business in dealing with labourers or with labour organisations to be a little bit human.  I do not think it is good business for either side to get their backs to the wall, so to speak.  I think there should be always a spirit of compromise and mutual trust and goodwill on both sides.  Speaking as an employer, I say definitely that I have always found it good business to do that.</P>

      <P>I have listened with a great deal of interest to the observations made to-day.  I had not an opportunity of listening to the speech of Deputy Johnson which has given rise to so much comment.  But the impression I have formed from listening to those speeches is that in the main those who have spoken are viewing the situation on a one-eyed outlook.  They only see part of the Constitution.  At least one of the very serious aspects in the life of the country and its potentialities has been entirely ignored.  But before I come to deal with this, I should like to mark my very emphatic dissent from the allusion made by Deputy McBride to the entry of Ireland into the League of Nations.  I think that was a momentous step, and one which marks the <Col N="657" /> manner in which the world was made congnisant of the emergence of Ireland from behind and below the barrier of British aggression into a life of freedom and into the family of free nations. Those other nations may have members of their communities that have the worst of human failings, but I think there are just as great potentialities for good within these States as we pride ourselves on having in Ireland, and I think it will be something to the world's advantage if Ireland's association helps to evoke and make stronger those potentialities for better things.  I do not know whether Deputy Egan suggests that we should abolish picture-houses and theatres, and that we should abolish racing and Gaelic athletic meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>And, as the Minister for Home Affairs, says, sweepstakes. It is evident that the apprehension of once more being confronted with the Sweepstakes Bill is weighing heavily upon the mind of the Minister.  I can assure him he has the greatest ground for his apprehension, for soon, I hope, we will not only confront him, but overwhelm him, in his opposition.  I do not know whether the abolition of these places of amusement would be the solution of unemployment or would bring industrial peace to the country. The real solution, or what appears to me to be the real solution of the lack of industry, has not been touched on so far as I heard, in this debate.  I do not really think we can come to grips with that until the findings of the Fiscal Commission have been published. Speaker after speaker has emphasised the great, pressing need of this country, and the only way to the financial solvency of the country it would seem is the application of the pruning knife to Departments.  One would imagine that there is not, and cannot be, any element of growth of revenue within this country, and that Ireland's financial position must be almost limited to its present source of taxation; that there can be no further increase in those sources, or in the capacity of existing sources to bear <Col N="658" /> increased taxation.  If such an assumption were accurate, then it would be conclusive that the future of Ireland was to be no better than that of an economic derelict, and that all our associations with the other nations of the world, at Geneva or elsewhere, would be simply a mockery, because Ireland would be like a whitened sepulchre that concealed a mass of uneconomic rottenness within the country.</P>
      <P>There are other sources of taxation, and there are other sources of revenue, besides that of cutting down the stipends of State officials, or cutting down the general expenditure of departments. Other countries had recourse to them, and I think we seem likely soon to appear to the world, if we persist in the existing fiscal system which has come to us as a heritage from our association with Great Britain, in the position of Casabianca who stood alone upon the burning deck.  I doubt if there is any country in the world to-day that stands for the Free Trade system under which we exist at the present time.  Even England built up her industry and greatness under a system quite different. It was only when she had the markets of the world at her command and was going ahead of every possible competitor that she opened her own markets to free imports.  Even amongst those countries which have risen from the position of colonies to that of great self-governing dominions I do not think any of them adopted the principle of Free Trade, but, on the contrary, they reinforced their Exchequer by large taxation put upon foreign manufacturers who sought access to their markets.  The Irish market is a valuable market, one of the most valuable that the English manufacturer has access to.  Access to that market is a great thing to him, and if this country is in financial distress I say it is worth while considering whether or not we should not make these foreign manufacturers pay for having access to our markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general tone of the discussion, in regard to the relief of unemployment, seems to have been that the State should act in the capacity of providing for that unemployment.  It is <Col N="659" /> essential in some direction that that should take place, but I do not think it is good, sound economies.  It certainly is not the way industrial enterprise has been built up in other countries.  The great vital asset, without which no country can expect to get upon its feet either commercially or industrially, is the initiative of men prepared to start industrial concerns, and the essential thing, to make that enterprise successful, is that they should get a fair chance, and should not be harassed, as if they were so many enemies of the State.  There seems to be abroad, in this country, an impression, shared to some extent on the one side by those who sometimes call themselves the proletariat, and shared, to some extent, I fear, by our immature economists within the Government, that the manufacturers are so many parasites who want to prey upon the community.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that is a profoundly erroneous idea, and one which, if persisted in, will simply mean a continuation of the industrial distress through which we have passed.  A captain of industry in this country is a much more important factor in the nation's future than a dominating politician, and we have got to recognise that the whole economic structure of the country rests, in reality, upon the brains and the enterprise of these men, and on the security that they get to carry out their different operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>In saying that, I am not making any reflection upon the farmers, but I do want the farmers to realise that there are other elements in the country besides the farmer, and that the more prosperous these other industrial enterprises are, the better for the farmer, and vice versa.  I do not want to anticipate the discussion upon the findings of the Fiscal Committee which, I assume, will take place when they are published.  I am sorry that they have not already been published, so that we might have considered them in conjunction with the remarks of the Governor-General.  I believe those who are interested in the work of that Committee are looking <Col N="660" /> forward for some message of economic hope for the country, looking forward for an economic vision which will consider Ireland not as an abstraction, nor the Irish people as so many economic mummies that are simply there to be studied, but that will consider Ireland as a living reality.  I trust the Committee's recommendations will be such as to be helpful to bring to this country a policy that will give renewed life to industrial enterprise.  If it does that, it will have set Ireland on the right road, not only to industrial rest, but to progressive civilisation, but if it fails to do that, then a great vital issue will have arisen.  I cannot anticipate what the decisions of this Committee will be, but whatever its decisions be, they will at least mark a definite stage in the life of Ireland's economic interests. They will be, to my mind, a highly important mark in these matters, and if they do not give us a hope, or if they do not fulfil the hope that a new system, and one more in accordance with Ireland's economic interests, is to be infused into the life of the nation, then I am afraid the Committee's labours will have been wasted. However, we shall wait and see.</P>
      <P>That is the main thing I wish to draw attention to, that you may devise schemes by which the national revenue may be allocated to this phase of unemployment or that; you may arraign one section of the community as opposing the real interests of the nation in one direction or another, but now that we have in our own hands that for which we have struggled, not merely political power but economic power, the right to decide our own fiscal future and fiscal policy, the right to weld and to mould Ireland's interests, if we fail to do that we will have, I was going to use a very harsh phrase, I was going to say we will have sold the pass, but at any rate whether that is an accurate description or not, we will have done something to diminish very seriously the hopes with which the Irish people have looked to this Assembly to lift the country from the demoralising and derelict condition in which the last two years have placed it, and put it in a position to become, in the near future, one of the most solvent and progressive States in the world.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to intervene and cut across the line of this discussion.  As we have reached the stage when the credit of Saorstát Eireann is for the first time to be put to the test of an appeal for funds to be borrowed in the open market, I think it is proper that I should acquaint the House with such particulars of the financial situation as will enable an accurate judgment to be formed of how we actually stand.  I do so all the more readily because numerous irresponsible reports and comments on the financial situation of the Saorstát and the supposed intentions of the Government in the matter have been given currency for some time past, and it is desirable that authoritative information should be available to prevent the growth of misleading ideas.  I can only ask the House now to judge the position by reference not to reports from irresponsible quarters but to plain facts which I shall endeavour to place before it as lucidly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government of this country, although gravely preoccúpied with other difficult problems, has now for over a year and a half carried on its financial business successfully without being obliged to look for assistance outside of Ireland.  The idea that seems to be entertained in some quarters, that this country as a State is going to be dependant for money on outside capitalists, is a mere delusion, and it has been propagated without encouragement or inspiration from here.  It is important to have it understood that the public finance of the country does not need to be conducted, and will not, under the present Government, be conducted in a manner that can render us subservient to any external interests.</P>
      <P>I will ask Deputies in the first instance to consider the Statement of Exchequer transactions for the half year ended on the 30th September.  This Statement, which has been circulated, is the usual weekly Exchequer Statement as issued in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 2nd October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important figure on the Receipt <Col N="662" /> side of the Statement is the tax revenue which, taking the several heads together, shows an aggregate of £12,235,000 for the half year, as compared with an Estimate of £20,550,000 for the whole year.  I am glad to be able to say that since the original estimate was prepared I have received a revised statement of estimated tax revenue which shows for the whole year an increase of £1,650,000 beyond the original estimate.  An increased yield in the non-tax revenue of the Post Office is also expected.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase of revenue that we anticipate is attributable largely to abnormal causes, such as the extent of income tax arrears.</P>
    <P>The receipts of the half year from non-revenue sources represent borrowings which have been incurred under powers duly conferred on the Minister for Finance by Act of the Oireachtas. The items to which I wish to invite special attention are those under the head of Free State Bills and Free State Savings Certificates.  The Bills are short-dated securities which have been taken up by the banks for the purpose of tiding the Government over the interval that must elapse before the proceeds of a funding loan are available. The friendly relations existing between the Government and the banks, and the willingness of the banks to assist the Government in financing the public services in the most effective manner are factors which will be appreciated at their true value by intelligent observers of the present situation.  The inherent soundness of the banking position in this country is an important financial asset which the Government have every desire to safeguard and defend.</P>
    <P>The Savings Certificates to which I have referred were first introduced in the month of July.  In the three months which have since elapsed we have raised from this source almost £300,000. The figure has increased from £220,000 as shown in the sheet to £293,000.  I would ask Deputies specially to note this point, as one of the surest indications of the possibility of attracting the genuine savings of the people of this country into an investment which is used for the benefit of this country only, and enjoys a security guaranteed <Col N="663" /> by this country alone.  These certificates are of course an excellent investment for any citizen of the Free State from the point of view of yield and of the privilege of exemption from income tax.  Organised measures will be taken shortly to bring the advantages of these Certificates directly to the notice of the public, but in the meantime the sale of them has, as is evident, been most encouraging, especially as no special effort has been made to force them into public notice.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Exchequer Statement, I will refer briefly to the expenditure side of it.  It is necessary to mention that the figures represent money issued out of the Exchequer which is not exactly the same thing as expenditure on public services in the period.  But the amounts are sufficiently approximate for practical purposes. The expenditure on general public services amounts, on the basis of the issue shown in the statement, to a total of about 17½ millions for the half year as compared with about 9¾ millions for the corresponding half of the preceding year.  About one million of this apparent increase of 7¾ millions is not a real increase, being only a disbursement occurring this year but not last, in respect of land purchase annuities which is offset by a corresponding receipt of the annuities themselves.  The balance of the increase is due in the main to obvious and easily understood causes, namely to the facts that the Army charge and the compensation charge had not begun to make themselves felt fully during the same period last year, whereas they were very serious burdens this year.</P>
    <P>In regard to compensation, it is well to have it known that the rate of discharge of awards has advanced rapidly during the past half year.  There is, in fact, no room whatever at the present time for the complaints which used to be made six months ago about alleged delay in payment of awards made by the Compensation Commission. That Commission, which deals entirely with pre-truce damage, has made considerable progress with the issue of its awards, and the machinery set up by the Ministry of Finance has, for some time past, been working at <Col N="664" /> a rate which has overtaken arrears, and keeps pace with the making of the awards by the Commission.  Altogether over 2½ millions in cash had been paid out up to the end of September, the payments in that month alone reaching £430,000.  The Army expenditure of the half-year has been on a heavy scale, the Exchequer issues for that service having amounted to £6,149,500 in the period.  The Government have had constantly in mind the serious problem which this expenditure constitutes for the Saorstát, and have been engaged for some time in carrying out, through the Minister for Defence, administrative reforms designed not only to put a stop to the waste, which was largely inevitable under the active service conditions of a year ago, but to establish an orderly and systematic control of the whole spending machinery of the Army, with that efficiency which peace conditions should be expected to render practicable. Financially demobilisation is the problem of most interest, and, as regards this, the Dáil is aware that it has already been found possible to effect a large reduction of strength, by allowing a proportion of soldiers to return to civil life, according as the period for which they attested has been completed.  As a consequence the strength of the Army, which was some time ago well over 50,000, has now fallen to nearly 35,000.  In the next place, reductions have been effected in the high rates of pay which had been settled hurriedly in the troubled days when quick recruitment of an adequate force had to be the primary consideration. For some time past every soldier who is reattested for a further period is only accepted at a new scale of pay, the rate being for a private 2s. 6d. a day, as compared with the rate of 3s. 6d. heretofore paid.  Again, it has been necessary to take steps for doing away with the expensive system of dependants' allowances heretofore applicable. Under the arrangement recently introduced no dependants' allowance will be payable in respect of soldiers reattested, beyond a marriage allowance, which has been fixed on a moderate scale.  Previously the allowances were for N.C.O.'s and men:&mdash; Wife, 4s. per day; first child, 1s. 6d.; <Col N="665" /> second child, 1s.; third and each additional child, 9d.  Then, there were allowances for other dependants.  The marriage allowance under the new arrangement is as follows:&mdash;All N.C.O.'s and men entitled to marriage allowance to allot at least 1s. a day towards the upkeep of their homes; the State will grant 1s. 6d. a day as marriage allowance, and additional allowances for children of 1s. a day for each of the first two children, and 6d. a day for each of the next two children. Four children is the largest number provided for, so that 3s. per day will be the maximum allowance on this basis.</P>
    <P>The special units of the Army organised for protection work and marine duties have been almost entirely abolished or absorbed.  As a result of these and other measures which have been or are being taken, it is proposed to bring the Army Estimate for next year down to about 4 millions, as against the total of nearly £10,700,000 for this year.  As is indicated by the fact that Army expenditure for the half year ended on 30th September last was over 6 millions, the steps taken during the last six months to discharge Army liabilities in the country have made satisfactory progress.  Current liabilities are being met in an effective manner, and such difficulties as still exist relate in the main to accounts outstanding from the period of turmoil where there is inevitable delay in getting evidence as to facts.  A great deal of delay is occasioned by fraudulent and inflated claims which have been sent in and which necessitate a great deal of special investigation.</P>
    <P>As regards expenditure generally, an opportunity of analysing past transactions will be afforded when the Appropriation Accounts, now in preparation, are available for the Public Accounts Committee.  It will, I think, be of greater advantage at the moment if I explain in some detail the general course of policy that the Government propose to take henceforward.</P>
    <P>Careful consideration has been given for some time past to the relation that at present exists between the revenue available from taxation, even on the present scale, on the one hand, and on the other hand the expenditure that is <Col N="666" /> being incurred on the normal operations of Government; that is excluding Compensation Charges and that part of the Army charge which can be regarded as abnormal.  As conditions have not yet had time to become definitely settled, and important parts of the administration are still, to some extent, in a state of transition, exact conclusions are difficult to reach.  But on the best scrutiny of the facts available, it appears certain that the normal operations of Government at present entail an expenditure which exceeds revenue by at least something more than one million a year.</P>
    <P>Now, whatever justification may exist for going outside of revenue to meet the abnormal expenditure on Compensation and the Army&mdash;and the justification in those cases is obvious&mdash;the Government are quite convinced that the normal public services must be financed out of revenue and not from borrowing. The evils of a contrary policy are familiar to all observers of the plight of those countries that have conducted their finances without regard to the necessity for budget equilibrium.  To aim, accordingly, at reaching such equilibrium, is a guiding principle of the policy that the Government in the best interests of the country find it essential to pursue.  Not only is it important to refrain from borrowing for the purpose of meeting such normal charges as should be borne by revenue, but it is important also to recognise that where there is borrowing to meet some legitimate capital need the annual charge in respect of the debt must be met out of revenue.  It would manifestly be a spendthrift and ruinous procedure to have to borrow to pay interest on one's existing debts.  It is the avoidance of this spendthrift procedure that I have in mind when I speak of aiming at budget equilibrium.</P>
    <P>Now, we are spending on normal services at the present time at a rate which substantially exceeds the collection of revenue.  This is a definite danger sign which the Government are bound not to ignore.  It is specially necessary not to ignore it now, as there is the absolute certainty before us, that the position, if not properly handled, meanwhile will be aggravated next year by a heavy addition of new and inevitable <Col N="667" /> debt charge.  Between Exchequer borrowings and securities issued for payment of compensation, it is necessary to contemplate a debt charge of perhaps two millions next year.  Moreover, recent legislation has put new burdens on the State, such as Army pensions and the completion of land purchase, the effects of which will be appreciable. For relief from this situation it is not permissible to rely upon a higher yield of revenue from existing taxes.  A good year is about to be replaced by a bad year in the computation of income tax, and the general depression of agriculture and industry in this country during recent years are adverse factors of great importance.  The appreciation of money and lower prices and incomes generally have a similar tendency.</P>
    <P>What, then, can the Government do to bridge this gap of several millions next year, between revenue on the present basis and expenditure in respect of normal services?  The obvious alternatives are higher taxes or lower public expenditure, or partly one and partly the other.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to dilate upon the evils of high taxation.  It discourages thrift, retards industry, and increases unemployment.  Three of our taxes, the beer duty, the income tax, and the Corporation Profits tax, are actually higher than the corresponding taxes in Great Britain at the present time.  In addition, our postage rates are heavier than the British.  These higher imposts have an adverse effect on workers and all other sections of the community.  As regards the direct imports in particular, the Free State producer of any given article who has to reckon with them is handicapped as regards the sale of that article, even in the Free State, as compared with the British producer of the same article, who is not subject to the same imposts.</P>
    <P>On general grounds the Government cannot contemplate the imposition on the country of any heavier burden of taxation than it now bears.  It is rather the aim of our policy to bring about a lessening of that burden at the earliest possible date, and it is even hoped that by adopting measures of retrenchment, such as I am about to indicate, the <Col N="668" /> possibility of reducing taxation in some slight degree may be considered in relation to the next Budget.</P>
    <P>Retrenchment, then, is the only course open to the Government if taxes are to be kept from exceeding even the present high level.  Economy is an unpopular policy among those who do not appreciate the true wisdom of it and who will not face facts.  Even among those who admit its propriety there are many who admire it in its general aspect but become critical when it is applied in some particular sphere of expenditure in which they take an interest. The Government fully realise all this, but are convinced that in pursuing economy in a practical manner they can count on the support of every Deputy in the Dáil who wishes to keep outside of the Saorstát those easy but improvident methods of public finance that have worked themselves to their logical conclusion in the economic breakdown of certain continental countries.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, accordingly, to aim at securing forthwith substantial savings throughout the public services, distributing the inevitable sacrifice as fairly as circumstances permit.  As a help towards understanding the position which has to be met I have had prepared for Deputies a special statement, giving in the light of the best information at present available, a revised estimate in summary form of the revenue and expenditure of the current year. This statement shows that after meeting, estimated commitments of every kind, normal and abnormal, there would be an excess of expenditure over revenue amounting to about 18½ millions.  An analysis of the figures on which the statement is based discloses that even if we exclude every expenditure which can fairly be treated as justifying recourse to borrowing, there still remains a deficit, as I have already stated, of at least over a million a year.  This figure, however, does not give us the full measure of the savings that it is necessary to effect in order to reach Budget equilibrium.  We must add to it a further amount of over two millions in respect of next year's debt service. Thus savings of between three and four millions should be aimed at in order to <Col N="669" /> effect a balance, and even then further savings would be required before the present level of taxation could be lowered.  Savings on such a scale are not possible without retrenchment over the whole field of the public services, wherever there is a discretion for applying it.</P>
    <P>A survey is accordingly at present in progress of every head of public expenditure for the purpose of ascertaining where curtailment can be effected with the least detriment to the public interest.  In the civil departments generally the fall in bonus is producing in the course of time an appreciable diminution in the cost of staff.  It is reckoned that the provision for bonus over the whole of the current year's estimates amounts to a total of about £1,350,000.  This is already down to about one-half of the corresponding figure for the time when the cost of living was at the peak.  For the purpose of next year's estimates the provision to be inserted for bonus will be calculated on an index figure five points below that adopted in the current year.  If the index figure were to fall more than these five points the bonus payable would of course be likewise reduced to such extent as the terms of the scale provide.  In regard to the Civil Service generally, there are two fairly distinct spheres in which economy may be sought.  The first of these is the sphere dependent on policy, for which the ordinary example is whether a particular service should be retained or not, and as to this I do not propose to say more at present than that we are considering carefully the justification of existing Government services and will not hesitate to seek Parliamentary sanction for the scrapping of any services, the maintenance of which cannot be fully justified.  The other sphere is in relation to the cost of administration of such Government services as we have at the moment in existence, and this resolves itself largely into an examination of the staffing of Government Departments so as to ensure that both in numbers of staff and in scales of salaries our staff expenditure is consistent with the strict economy that is necessary at present. In the case of all Government services, and particularly in the case <Col N="670" /> of those services which were administered as purely Irish Departments before the change of Government, I am taking steps to ensure that the administrative cost of the services for the Free State will compare favourably with the administrative cost of the services for the whole of Ireland, and will reflect the loss of work represented by the present exclusion of the Six Counties.  In the case of one or two Departments, the Revenue Department and the Post Office, which were administered from London prior to the change of Government, it will of course be appreciated that the creation of a spearate administration is an obstacle to reduction in the cost of administration. In the Post Office, however, where a majority in numbers of the entire Civil Service is employed the steps which have been taken are already producing an appreciable result. The effect will not have time to make itself fully felt in the present financial year as some of the steps are of recent date, but it is expected that in next financial year the expenditure of the Post Office will have fallen by perhaps £250,000 a year below its recent level.  The net loss on the working of that Department should be reduced not only by that amount but by a further amount representing anticipated increase of revenue due to the resumption of more normal conditions in the country.  The staffing generally of the Civil Service is under constant review and I have issued instructions to all Government Departments that no vacancies can be filled and no fresh appointments can be made without my sanction, and to obtain this it will be necessary for Departments to prove their needs.  At the moment we have more than one heavy task on hand of a temporary character, for example, payment of compensation, collection of arrears of rent, and for these temporary tasks we have had to engage additional temporary staff so that at the moment our expenditure on staff, apart altogether from fluctuations in the cost of living, is higher than it is likely to be in a normal year.</P>
    <P>The instructions which have already been issued from the Ministry of Finance for preparation of Estimates <Col N="671" /> for the next financial year lay particular stress on the necessity for all departments carrying out a strict scrutiny of their existing activities. It is explained that in general the financial position is such as to preclude sanction being given for additional charges on public funds, and that the possibility of sanction being given for any new service will normally depend on a clear demonstration that a compensating reduction is being effected in some essential existing service.</P>
    <P>Of our total normal expenditure, about 10 millions, that is nearly one-half, is devoted to education in all forms and pensions, including Old Age Pensions.  It is evident that the large saving that must be effected will not be feasible unless a fair contribution is made by these services which account for so large a part of our total charges.</P>
    <P>As regards education, the Government feel that the time has come when the salaries of National School Teachers must be reviewed.  I should explain that the present scale of salaries for these Teachers was fixed in November, 1920, on a basis which made no provision for variation in respect of changes in the cost of living.  At the time when the negotiations leading up to the agreement fixing the salaries were taking place the cost of living was still rising, and the agreement was signed at the time when the cost of living was actually at its highest point, being 176 per cent. above pre-war.  As Deputies know, the cost of living figure has steadily fallen since the end of 1920, and with it the salaries of Public Servants generally.  A Civil Servant, whose salary at the end of 1920 was between £150 and £500 a year, has suffered a reduction varying 30 per cent. at the lower salary to 25 per cent. at the higher salary.  Salaries outside the Civil Service have been affected in a similar manner, and we feel that it is not unreasonable that the very decided fall in the cost of living should be reflected in the emoluments of National School Teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The salaries fixed in <Col N="672" /> 1920 were anything from three to three and a half times the salaries obtaining before 1914, and even admitting that those salaries were abnormally low we cannot justify continuing to pay salaries so many times the pre-war salaries when the index figure of the cost of living shows an increase over pre-war of 80 per cent.  If the ordinary Civil Service bonus were paid on the pre-war salaries the resulting remuneration would be approximately only half of the present salaries.</P>
      <P>In view of these general figures, the Government have decided that an immediate cut must be made in the remuneration of the Teachers.  They do not want to take drastic action at short notice and to make the full reduction, which the facts appear to justify, at once.  They, therefore, propose that a reduction of 10 per cent. should be made with effect from the 1st of November, and that an inquiry should be set on foot immediately for the purpose of exploring the question as to what further adjustment may be proper.</P>
      <P>Another definite economy that the Government are obliged to propose is in regard to Old Age Pensions.  When these pensions were first introduced in 1908 the rate in the most usual case was 5s.  As the result of war legislation it now stands at 10s.  It was not intended at any time that the pension should provide the recipient with a complete and independent means of livelihood.</P>
      <P>The 10/- rate was adopted when the cost of living had risen to 120 per cent. above pre-war and was still mounting steadily.  It remained at 10/- when the cost of living index figure was 176 per cent. above pre-war.  Judged in this light alone, it is manifest that a fall in the cost of living index figure to the present level of 80 per cent. above pre-war makes a prima facie case for substantial reduction of the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the consideration of the pensioners themselves, it is necessary in this matter also to bear in mind particularly the weight of the burden imposed on the State.  In 1920-21 the charge for Old Age Pensions in the whole of Ireland was £4,463,500, the total revenue of the whole of Ireland being then £48,845,000.  At present the <Col N="673" /> charge for Old Age Pensions in the Free State is £3,277,000, the total revenue (according to the revised statement which has been circulated) being £24,761,405.  That is, we are paying three-quarters of the all-Ireland pension charge of 1920-21 with only half the all-Ireland revenue of the same year.</P>
    <P>In 1920-21 the charge for Old Age Pensions in Scotland was £2,456,000, the revenue of that country for the same year being £119,753,000.  In 1920-21 Scotland spent 2 per cent. of her revenue on Old Age Pensions.  At the same time Ireland spent 9.1 per cent.  To-day the Free State spends 13.2 per cent.  The fact must be recognised that the resources of the country are not equal to the present burden of the Old Age Pension charge.  For this the pensioners may attribute a high degree of responsibility to those who have wasted and impoverished the country during the past two years.  The Government, in their desire to extend every consideration possible to the old people affected, are confining their proposal in this matter to the most moderate limit permissible, and accordingly will not ask for a reduction of more than one shilling on the present rate of pension. Legislation on this matter will be introduced almost immediately and will deal with some points about means and other details, as well as the actual pension rate.</P>
    <P>These economies that I have mentioned represent merely the application in the sphere of Government of measures of the same sort as those which have to be endured by other sections of the community.  It cannot be contended that because certain classes of persons receive their money from the State they should, at the cost of the taxpayer, be shielded by the State from the harsh winds that blow upon the taxpayer himself.  Civil servants, working men, soldiers, indeed all persons earning salary or wages throughout the country, have been experiencing, for some time, a reduction of at least their nominal receipts, and it would be improper for the State to continue to strain its resources by not aiming at some corresponding reduction of the receipts of teachers and old age pensioners. Reduced public charges will tend to operate towards reducing the <Col N="674" /> cost of living, and thereby compensate at least to some extent for the lowering of emoluments now proposed.</P>
    <P>The general course of policy that I have now perhaps sufficiently indicated will, I hope, be taken as evidence of a recognition on the part of the Government that the time has come both for the State itself and all sections of the community to accommodate themselves to the economic and monetary charges that have been operating in our midst for a long time past.  The cost of living index figures show conclusively that, whatever particular exceptions may be adduced, the cost of living in general has diminished to a marked extent during the past three years.  The purchasing power of money has grown, and therefore a man may be as well off as before even though he may suffer a large reduction in the nominal amount of his salary or wages.  If it was only reasonable, as everyone admits, that remuneration should increase in nominal amount during that period of war-time inflation when the pound was steadily losing in purchasing power, it is equally reasonable, and indeed necessary, that remuneration should diminish in nominal amount in consequence of the subsequent recovery by the pound of much of its former loss of purchasing power. The same accommodation to circumstances is required from those dealers in commodities who still fail to appreciate that the progressive inflation and rapidly falling value of money which afforded some excuse for and rendered possible the scale of war profits have ceased to be available in support or justification of any attempt to secure a similar scale of profits now.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of facilitating the transition to that nominally though not really lower level of prices and wages which present conditions warrant and require, the Government, without hazarding the general pursuit of economy, are desirous that such resources as they can provide shall be applied in the most beneficial manner. Continuance of State aid to housing, which is also vital on other grounds, offers a prospect of being useful in this direction, and the Government will be prepared to formulate a suitable scheme as soon as there is evidence of a reasonable <Col N="675" /> adjustment of both prices and wages in the building trade.  Between this scheme and the requirements of reinstatement for which large sums have now been put at the disposal of compensation claimants, a considerable contribution is made to the problem of affording employment for demobilised soldiers and others.  In addition, the Government expect to be in a position to finance to the extent of perhaps a million and a quarter, a generous scheme of works for the improvement and repair of roads over the next eighteen months.  The money for this scheme would not involve any addition to present State charges but would consist mainly of the proceeds, as at present, of motor vehicle duties plus the special rate which County Councils are required to pay to the Exchequer under recent legislation as their share of the compensation liability arising from the events of the last two years.</P>
    <P>It is an essential feature of these schemes that they cannot be initiated until definite recognition is given to the fact that the Government, in the financial and economic interests of the country, cannot consent to allow them to be conducted in a manner that would raise or keep prices or wages above the nominal level at which they should fairly stand at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have now, I trust, said sufficient about expenditure to enable Deputies to follow the general trend of policy. I have sketched the path by which it is hoped to arrive at budget equilibrium. In the meantime, heavy capital issues that are not a proper charge against revenue are required.  The finding of money to finance these issues for compensation and the Army is a task that cannot be evaded or deferred.  The magnitude of the task is still a matter of some surmise, but it is at least possible to be assured that it is not more than the present resources of the country can bear.  The brunt of the abnormal expenditure on the Army has already, we may hope, been borne, and the balance yet to come should not prove too formidable.  The sums required for compensation are still, to a great extent, indeterminate at least as regards the period since the Truce, but we know at least that the day of destruction <Col N="676" /> is gone and that no new liabilities are arising on this account.</P>
    <P>The Government have heretofore borrowed for these necessary purposes mainly by having recourse to the Irish banks.  Our National Debt up to date has reached the total of £5,990,500 of which the banks have provided £3,795,000 by discounting bills.  I need not tell the Dáil that it is not good policy for a Government to pursue too far the course of borrowing from the banks.  Borrowing in this form, while it can provide a temporary but fallacious show of prosperity, is peculiarly liable to cause instability of monetary conditions and to end by necessitating measures which depress trade and create unemployment.  It is, therefore, intended to seek a loan within the Free State at an early date for the purpose of attracting the national savings into our own securities.  The country has now had sufficient experience of its new national and international status and of the possibility of maintaining stable conditions of administration to justify a confidence on the part of the Government that the citizens who have money to invest will now be prepared to buy the stock of the Free State with at least as much faith as they have shown in the past in investing their money abroad.  The Free State is not a new country like Australia or Canada that must depend largely on the importation of capital from outside.  Our people, on the contrary, have heretofore provided capital in large amounts for other countries, and especially by way of investment in the Government and industrial securities of Great Britain.  They will henceforth have more abundant opportunity for investing their money at home with greater advantage both to themselves and to this country.  The loan that we are about to issue will, in accordance with the recent Appropriation Act, have the absolute security of the Central Fund of Saorstát Eireann, and the charge in favour of the stockholders will, therefore, secure their rights in priority to any of the demands made on the Exchequer for the ordinary public services of the State.  In addition to being an entirely gilt-edged security, the loan will possess for subscribers the advantage of giving a yield which, as this is our first venture on <Col N="677" /> the open market, must necessarily be somewhat more favourable than that obtainable in other investments of like standing which, however, are issued by borrowers better known in the outside financial world.  Also, the loan will be an investment authorised by law in which Trustees may invest Trust funds.</P>
    <P>It is the hope of the Government that a substantial subscription can be secured in the first instance from the actual free savings available in the country, whether in the form of bank deposits or otherwise.  Next to this source the realisation of investments at present held in Government and other securities abroad is likely to be of the most service both to the State and to the investor, who will obtain by the exchange a higher income and at least equal security.  In this connection I desire to call particular attention at this stage to the fact that the funds belonging to the Free State, which are now invested outside, include large amounts which are the property of various charities.  Now, where the money of a Free State charity is invested in the Free State, the law allows it to be exempted from income tax.  By a temporary arrangement having reciprocal effect, a similar exemption is at present allowed by the British Government where Free State charitable funds are invested in Great Britain.  But this temporary arrangement is due to expire next March, and will not be renewed.  Consequently the holders of Free State charitable moneys now invested in British securities, Government or otherwise, should take note of the fact that if they wish to continue to enjoy exemption from income tax they should transfer their investments in good time to securities within the Free State. The loan now about to be issued provides them with an opportunity of which they might be well advised to avail themselves.  Approved Societies under the Health Insurance Acts are in a position similar to that of charities and the same considerations apply.  I do not propose now to enter further into detail in regard to the loan.  I only trust that from such indications as I have been able to give and from general observations of the trend of events <Col N="678" /> in the country, all those who have money to invest will realise how important it is that they should join in making this first issue such an unquestionable success that our credit will rank from the start as highly as it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement to which the Dáil has just listened is an exceedingly important one from many points of view.  I think that the Minister is to be congratulated on making the position so plain at such an important juncture.  On the whole, I think the position hopeful.  It is not in any case such as many people had ventured to predict it would be, that is, those people who were not fully informed of what the position was.  In the early portion of his statement the Minister referred to the progress which had been made, and is being made, to deal with the payment of awards.  I think there is hardly a Deputy in this Dáil but knows that all over the country there are many complaints of delays in making payments, not only of those awards, but also of Army accounts.  I am sure there is no Deputy here but has piles of letters from different parts of his constituency calling attention to accounts which have been repeatedly sent in to the Finance Department and which have not been met.  There is no evidence that they are being met in a serious way.  That is undoubtedly causing damage to the credit of the Government, because the general doubt that is raised in the minds of those people is, &ldquo;Are the Government able to pay,&rdquo; rather than that they do not want to pay.  I think that is a matter to which the Government ought to give their very serious attention.  I do not intend to deal in anything like a general way with the statement of the Minister, except to direct attention to the fact that the only definite proposals which he has put before us this afternoon, apart from the large amount of generalisations as to the necessity for economy, are two definite proposals.  Immediately from the 1st of November a cut of 10 per cent. is to be made on the salaries of National Teachers, and a shilling is to be taken off the Old Age <Col N="679" /> Pensions.  Except in a general way he has not told us what he is going to do to bring down the internal cost of administration.  He has not given us any explanation of why it should require some thirteen to fifteen hundred servants or officials who administer the Free State service more than it took in 1914 to administer the whole Irish services.  He has told us the Civil Servants generally have suffered decreases in their income on account of cost of living bonus decreases, but no attempt has been made to show how even their existing salaries and bonus compare with the rates of those whose salaries he proposes to reduce immediately.</P>
      <P>It might be expected that in a matter of this kind the last services that should be interfered with without the fullest enquiry would be those which are most essential to the nation, and it might also be said that the very last that should suffer a reduction would be the poor old people who have just what is keeping them scarcely above starvation limit.  I have considerable doubt, indeed, not only as to the wisdom of this policy of reducing old age pensions from the Government, and the national point of view, but as to whether they can be asked to take on any portion of the sacrifices which everybody must, apparently, take.  If the income which the old age pensioner gets from the State is reduced he must get it somewhere else, and we can only have an extension of what the farmers complain of, and rightly complain of. He must go on the rates, and this must mean an extension of Home Help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will naturally be expected to say something with regard to the other definite proposition, but I would like to make it clear at the beginning that I am not here as an official, representing the people who will be affected.  I am here rather as a public representative, and it is from that point of view that I would like to approach the matter. The Minister laid great stress on the necessity for the people of the Saorstát to have faith in their Government. That is essential, but it is not a good beginning, or a good example to set to the people from whom they expect faith, to be themselves faithless. <Col N="680" /> Some years ago a certain individual announced that it was his policy to say &ldquo;To hell with contracts and to hell with agreements,&rdquo; and there was a very great outcry indeed, rightly so, in my opinion, against the adumbration of any such policy.  If these agreements and contracts are not observed there can be no stability.  The Minister has referred to a certain agreement entered into in 1920.  I have it before me as I speak.  It was entered into in a very solemn way, and it is signed by representatives of the body to which the Minister is a successor.  I hope the Dáil will bear with me for a moment if I tell, as briefly as I can, the history of that agreement.  I would like to state, in the first place, that I am sure that national teachers, just as every other body in the Saorstát, are prepared to bear their fair share of any burden which the State as a whole has to bear. I would like to emphasise that.  But if they are to be asked to do that they ought to be assured of just and fair treatment.  The Minister stated that under the agreement some teachers have salaries three to three and a half times more than they had pre-war. That is true in some instances, but he did not state that in pre-war days over 2,000 teachers had salaries&mdash;if you like to call them salaries&mdash;of £24 a year, and there are, no doubt, cases of teachers who have three and three and a half times as much as that salary. I think I need not dwell on the fact that teachers were underpaid in 1914, and that it was the policy, the stated and determined policy, of the British Government to keep them underpaid. Everybody here knows that.  In 1918 a Commission was set up, presided over by Lord Killanin, and of which Most Rev. Dr. O'Donnell, Canon Macken, the Protestant Bishop of Meath, and others interested in education were members, and if Deputies would care to interest themselves in the matter sufficiently to turn to that Commission's report they will see the studied decisions of people who went into the whole question, and the effect on education of this continual starvation of those who are engaged on the work of teaching. Repeatedly, during the years 1917, 1918, and 1919, the British Government were putting off the date on which they <Col N="681" /> would have to fix the salaries of teachers on a suitable scale.</P>
    <P>A certain body, called the Civil Service Arbitration Board, was set up by the Cabinet, to which, in 1920, the National Teachers' Organisation appealed to settle and deal with the demand for a fixed and permanent scale of salaries.  The British Treasury at the time objected to fixing a permanent scale of salaries.  They put forward various reasons, but eventually the matter came to be tried before this Board. At that trial, or hearing, were represented the British Treasury, the Commissioners of National Education and the National Teachers' Organisation, and after hearing all of them fully, the Board decided, against the British Treasury representatives, that a permanent scale of salaries should be set up.  It was as a consequence of that decision that the agreement referred to by the Minister was entered into.  The Minister says that that contained no provision for the Cost of Living Bonus. That is quite correct, and deliberately so, and it is a strange thing to note that in all agreements connected with teachers, whether in this country or not, at the time, the cost of living did not enter materially into the fixing of the rates of salary.  There must be some good reason for that.  The main consideration was to fix a rate, or a scale, which would attract to the profession the proper class of men and women.  It was not thought advisable that fluctuations of the cost of living should enter into the fixing of the scale. I want to draw particular attention to a point mentioned by the Minister.  He said that if the Civil Service Bonus were given these teachers would have much less now than they actually have.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that if in 1920, when this agreement was entered into, they had got the then Civil Service Bonus they would have got actual money increases at the time, varying from £80 to £120, whereas they actually only got something like £30 or £40. The full rate of salary was payable only from the 1st April, 1922.  That is a very important point inasmuch as it shows that while the actual terms of the decision were made in 1920 the full, or peak point of the salary was not <Col N="682" /> reached until two years afterwards.  If the cost of living factor materially entered into the fixing of the salaries at that time, naturally the peak point of the salary would be paid immediately in 1920.  That was not done, and what is the result?  During the war years, when other workers were getting the peak bonus and generally had good salaries, and business people, and farmers even, were doing very well, teachers were doing very badly, and from 1920 to 1921 they were looking forward to the year when they would get their full salary and were living largely on credit in the meantime.  That is pretty well known.</P>
    <P>I have before me the arguments which were put forward by the Treasury at that time, and the word &ldquo;permanent,&rdquo; as a description of the scales, is written all over this correspondence. When the settlement was arrived at the Department of Education issued a circular, which I have before me, and it is headed:  &ldquo;New Permanent Scale of Salaries for National Teachers.&rdquo;  I do not know what definition or meaning was put on the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; except the ordinary accepted one, but I have learnt to-day that there is a new meaning to be put on it. &ldquo;Permanent,&rdquo; if it meant anything in any case did not mean there were to be fluctuations according to the cost of living; it meant the direct opposite.  I do not wish to dwell on this matter more than is necessary.  There is a great deal I could say that I will take the opportunity of saying perhaps elsewhere, but at the moment I wish to dwell particularly on the way that this matter will be looked at.  Here is a bargain, or agreement, or decision, solemnly entered into by three or four parties. One of the parties, without any kind of consultation whatever, simply scraps the agreement.  I think that is not good policy on the part of the Government, apart from its other effects, and it will have other effects.  If the Minister had come to the Education Department and said: &ldquo;It is necessary to effect a saving,&rdquo;&mdash;and the extent of this first saving, I may mention, would be something over £300,000&mdash;&ldquo;of £300,000 on this Vote,&rdquo; I feel certain that if the matter were approached in that way, <Col N="683" /> the Department of Education and the teachers themselves would be quite prepared and quite willing to endeavour to see things from the Minister's point of view, and as far as possible to cooperate. We have for the past two years seen a very great effort on the part of the Department of Education to bring back to this country its old civilisation and its old ideals through the instrumentality of the Gaelic language, and teachers who as everybody knows had for years spent most of their energies agitating for better conditions and better salaries, had wiped the slate clean of these things, and had turned their attention to what should properly be their functions, that is, seeing how the system of education could be improved. I think we had an example of that last Easter, when two very distinguished members of the Dáil at the annual meeting of the Teachers' Congress delivered addresses relative to matters, some of which will in the very near future be that subject of discussion in the Dáil.  We had examples when the teachers, at very great inconvenience to themselves, undertook what was to them, or the majority of them, absolutely new work in the matter of the teaching of the Irish language, and preparing themselves to give instruction in it.  I can only see before me now a renewal of the old years of agitation, because the proposal here is not a 10 <i>per cent.</i> cut, nor a temporary 10 <i>per cent.</i> one, cut, but an immediate 10 <i>per cent.</i> one, with a promise of revision of the whole basis on which teachers have been paid. I need not point out that if this country is going to make the progress which we all hope it will make, it must depend on the education of its people. Education, in the true and proper sense of the word, lies not so much in reading and writing and arithmetic, for that after all is not education, as in the character of the men and women engaged in the important work of education. You are not going to get men to lay down their minds to this important work if agreements entered into by them are simply scrapped without any proper consideration of the merits of the case, for I do allege that there has not been any proper consideration given <Col N="684" /> to the facts.  Most of the statements made by the Minister in reference to that can be controverted.  This is not the place to do that, and I do not intend to do it.  Deputy Bryan Cooper, speaking earlier in the day, urged the advisability of the appointment of a small committee to go into the estimates of Government expenditure in order to see where the savings could be made.  I think that the statement and the action of the Minister proves very conclusively the necessity for such a Committee.  If it were appointed it could go over the whole field of educational expenditure and see whether or not economies equal to the amount which could be gained in this way could not be saved in another way.  Repeatedly in the Dáil, and elsewhere, I and other Deputies have pointed out that economies could be effected in many ways to get that particular amount of money he is looking for, if that is the intention or desire of the Minister.</P>
    <P>He may possibly have other intentions. He has referred to the necessity, as I said, of faith in the Government and for the organising of interest in the Government's proposals for a loan and the sale of Saving Certificates.  I made a suggestion on one occasion that there was no method of organising in the country whereby the sale of Saving Certificates could be so well encouraged as through the schools and through the teacher.  That is one of the ways that would recommend itself to a Minister who would know exactly the facts of the situation.  There is nobody who is more closely in touch with the people in every little village or town than the teachers, and if the teachers were got to interest themselves; if it were put before them in this way: &ldquo;Here is something that you can do to strengthen the financial position of the country,&rdquo; I have no doubt whatsoever that the teachers approached in that way would do it, and do it to a much larger extent than they can be expected to do it under the present circumstances. I will conclude by quoting what the Minister for Education said on the last occasion, I think it was when he was speaking on the estimates here. What he said was that the bottom of <Col N="685" /> education, as everybody knows, is good teachers, and when you obtain them you have to sustain them.  The Minister for Finance is probably of a different frame of mind.  There was one important statement made by the Minister in the course of his remarks.  He said that &ldquo;We know that the day of destruction has gone.&rdquo;  I think that that statement ought to be emphasised.  It is very important. But, in that connection, one will wonder why it is still necessary to spend something like between four and six millions a year on an army.  I think that before essential services, such as education, and such things as old age pensions, should definitely come under the axe, the Dáil and the country should be assured that practically and actually steps have been taken to make equal savings in other Departments.  It is not fair that old age pensioners should be asked to bear such a heavy share proportionately of this burden while having no evidence that the Minister's economies in other Departments are taking practical shape.</P>

      <P>In any event, the debate must be adjourned at 4 o'clock.  To move the adjournment of the debate now merely deprives the Dáil of a further three-quarters of an hour debate to-day.  If it is the desire to adjourn the debate that could be agreed to.  The question of the date to which the Dáil will be adjourned, which is really the same question, could then be discussed, and Deputies would be in a better position to discuss it if we give this three-quarters of an hour for that purpose, rather than if the adjournment were moved at five minutes to four.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move an Amendment, that the Dáil do adjourn until next Tuesday at 3 o'clock.  I do so because the statement which we have just heard is one that will require to be discussed in the Dáil to prevent the possibility of the Ministry doing much more harm to the credit of the country and to its own credit than may have been done by the statement which has been made.  I think it is necessary the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing this statement and expressing its views upon it, and not allow the matter to be held over a fortnight.  I, therefore, move that the adjournment be only until 3 o'clock on Tuesday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that.  It is well known that the adjournments of this Dáil since it has met have not redounded entirely to its credit.  Whatever excuse there might have been on an earlier occasion, which was that there was certain business to be transacted at Geneva, does not now exist.  The Dáil was then agreeable to that, because the people who were to go there were people whose presence in the Dáil was judged necessary to the proceedings.  The Dáil was adjourned while they were away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case that excuse, justified or unjustified, is now no longer available. Very important matters have been <Col N="688" /> raised here to-day, matters of the very first importance.  There is business before the Dáil.  The statement made by the Minister provides in itself sufficient business for discussion.  There is no reason why we should not meet next Tuesday at 3 o'clock and proceed with the discussion on the Governor-General's speech, following a discussion upon the very important statement that has been made by the Minister for Finance.  For that reason I second the proposal to adjourn until Tuesday at 3 o'clock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is in the Government's own interest that we should not have so long an adjournment as what is called a fortnight, but what is in reality three weeks all but two days.  This immensely important statement of the Finance Minister's is going to be discussed whether we like it or not.  It will be discussed in the Press, by the National Teachers, and by people all over the country.  Surely, it is better that it should be discussed here, where misconceptions can be corrected, and where the Government can continue to make their case.  If it is discussed outside you will see interviews given to the Press correcting misconceptions. The Dáil is the place where the Ministers should make their case, and correct misconceptions, and for that reason I think a shorter adjournment than three weeks is needed.</P>

      <P>I desire to suggest that the adjournment should be only until next Wednesday week.  I would also suggest that when the Governor-General's address is taken up let it be finished, and not, as in the last Dáil and this Dáil, be under discussion at different intervals.  It is a most unsatisfactory way, and it does not reflect credit on the Dáil and our conduct of business.  Let us take this matter up and finish it once for all.  The method we have been adopting in regard to the Address is most unsatisfactory and undignified. As a compromise I would suggest Wednesday week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I have yet to be convinced ín regard to the necessity for an adjournment at all.  I think it is due to the Dáil, when an adjournment of this length is proposed, that we should be given some explanation. I think the Minister has given an explanation now to a certain extent, and that means that the legislation which is proposed in the Governor-General's speech is not quite ready.</P>
      <P>If this is the rate at which we are going to proceed with the enormous programme laid down in the Governor-General's Address, I think it will take us a good deal longer than the time of the present session to get through anything like that programme.  I think that in the interests of the Government and the Dáil, it would be wise in future for the Government, when proposing an adjournment of any length, to give the Dáil some reason for their proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the statement has been made on the Governor-General's Address, and I think it is relevant to the terms of the Address, stating that economies would be effected, and since the Address concerns the Government's general policy and the Minister's speech concerns the Government's general policy on finance, it is clearly relevant.  I had <Col N="690" /> intended, in view of the importance of the speech, not to insist that Deputies who had previously spoken should be precluded from speaking on this particular matter of finance, merely as a matter of fairness to Deputies.  The only other matter on the Motion of Thanks for the Governor-General's Address is the question of fisheries which is raised on an amendment by Deputy O'Connell.  Before I put the amendment, I desire to know if there is any agreement as to whether we could meet next week, and if so, shall it be Tuesday or Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of having this matter discussed at the earliest possible date is that it is so serious a statement.  If we may postpone it until Wednesday, then we might as well postpone it to Wednesday fortnight or even to the Greek Kalends. Unless the Dáil can bring some influence to bear upon the Ministry to save it from what I consider a calamity, we need not discuss it at all.  I feel the matter is one that requires the earliest possible discussion, and in view of the practice of the Dáil that we cannot meet satisfactorily on Mondays, I have suggested Tuesday.</P>

It is necessary that the Minister's speech be circulated to us, and that we should have an opportunity of studying it, and it is possible that if we met on Wednesday we would have an opportunity <Col N="691" /> of studying the statement better than if we met on Tuesday.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy moved Wednesday week, and I would be prepared to accept Wednesday week.  I understood that was the proposal Deputy Gorey made before. I should say that the machine that is turning out legislation has been working at a fairly high pressure. Something like 43 Acts were passed, I think, in the last Dáil, and two Acts have already been passed in this Dáil. During the period that has elapsed since the Dáil was elected there have been other occupations for Ministers, apart from the consideration of the ordinary business of the Dáil, which have absorbed a great deal of time. We realise the necessity for an early discussion of the statement of the <Col N="693" /> Minister for Finance, but if we were to come back on Tuesday next there would be no business other than this discussion on the Governor-General's Speech, and I do not think the large expenditure of time and money would be warranted for that, having regard to the fact that in the ordinary business of the Dáil here the discussion on the subject of the Governor-General's Address or the consideration of Estimates forms very useful material for utilising when dealing with a number of Bills.  The great number of Bills of which notice has been given in the Governor-General's Speech necessitate First and Second Readings, with intervals between them, which some people might call waste of time, but which are necessary under the Standing Orders, and which it is only fair that members should have in order to enable them to form judgments, propose amendments, or discuss the Bills.  I think on Wednesday week we might be in a position to have some other measures in a fair state for presentation, and I propose to accept that if the Dáil will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a substantial reason, I think, for having given notice that I would raise this question on the Adjournment.  A very important statement, or at least, a statement which has very important implications, has appeared in the daily papers.  I hope the matter of Ulster and the Northern question is of sufficient interest to retain the attention of Deputies in this <Col N="694" /> assembly of the Irish Free State. Announcements have appeared in the Press which, as I said, have important implications.  The Dáil is now adjourning for a period, that I had anticipated would be longer, but at any rate it will be of sufficient duration to allow of possibly very mischievous speculations to be indulged in, unless some authoritative statement was made by the responsible head of the Free State Government.  It is for that reason, mainly, that I have raised this question to-day.  Before I give way to the President to make a statement I should like to make one or two remarks upon this question of North-East Ulster.  I am greatly afraid that many people in Ireland, whether in the Free State or in the other section at the moment outside the Free State, have suffered for some time from the illusion that the Free State, and those responsible for it, were going to acquiesce in allowing the Ulster provisions of the Treaty to become a dead letter.  If I thought that was possible I would sit in a very different part of the Dáil, if I sat in it at all.  It is because I have implicit faith and confidence in the Government to see that Clause 12 is carried out in the letter and in the spirit that I have refrained from raising this matter sooner.  Ireland and Britain on the 6th of December, 1921, entered into a solemn International compact.  As regards this particular Clause, with which I am dealing, I, myself, had some slight minor responsibility in assenting to it when it was being drafted, and therefore I take more than a superficial interest in it.  That compact was entered into on the understanding that everyone of its Clauses would be honoured, that it would not be a question of honouring one and cancelling or ignoring another, but that every one would be carried out in the letter and the spirit that animated the men who brought to an end the conflict between the two countries.  I believe that England will carry out her part of the compact with regard to Clause 12.  I believe it will be in her interest to carry out Clause 12 of the Treaty, for the Free State has given pledges of its desire to honour the Treaty in every Clause, given pledges in blood and treasure that we cannot yet compute <Col N="695" /> the value or the volume of.  We are not going to allow these sacrifices &mdash;which we made in men and money, in suffering and in sacrifice&mdash;to go for nought.</P>
      <P>If England should dare to attempt to violate Clause 12, or escape its implications, then we tell her that there are other Clauses in the Treaty which will go by the board if Clause 12 goes by the board.  I think it is time that this sentiment was uttered emphatically and without any equivocation whatever, because there has gone abroad a feeling in England that, after all, we here should not expect that England would take seriously her commitments with regard to Clause 12.  We will take her seriously, but the manner in which she has so far adhered to her part of the bargain gives me confidence that it will be rather the sense of honour than the threat of consequences that will keep her to the faith to which she is pledged in this matter.  Now, a great delay has taken place with regard to this matter, but I think so far as the Free State is concerned that the time of delay has terminated.  The Minister for Home Affairs recently, in a statement reviewing the national position, said in regard to this particular matter, &ldquo;The case is prepared, the facts are collated, and the relevant statistics are available.&rdquo;  That seems to be really equivalent to an announcement of &ldquo;Seconds out of the ring.&rdquo;  So far as we are concerned there is no further reason for delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen that the Press has stated that a conference is to be held some date in the future&mdash;I hope it will be in the near future&mdash;between representatives of the Free State and representatives of the Belfast Parliament. I am glad that our Government has not turned down such a conference.  I believe it will be a good thing that representatives of the heads of the Free State Government and of the Northern Parliament should come together and discuss matters which are of common interest to both, because the interests of Ireland as a whole are dear to both, whether they are people from the Free State or people from the North.  If we could once break down that damnable barrier which <Col N="696" /> sectarian bigotry and intriguing politicians have made, we would soon put an end to the divisions between the two sections of the country.  The more association there is of members of the Free State with those of the North to discuss matters of common interest the sooner will we bring an end to this division that has separated us heretofore.  I know, at any rate, that the late President Griffith and the late Michael Collins would certainly have supported the idea of such a conference. After all, even if the Boundary Commission operates, it will not bring that ideal of national unity in the full sense, because it will only deal with certain areas of territory which are in dispute, whether they should come into the Free State or remain under the Northern Parliament.  After that is over there will still remain a matter that will require tact, confidence, and understanding between the two sections of the country in order to evolve that ideal unity of territory and civic interest which is the hope and the dream, I think, of every well-disposed citizen in the whole thirty-two counties. This, I do say, that while I commend the idea of this conference, I do not see where it is going to bring us in regard to the real, concrete, practical question which we are up against.  Clause 12 must stand.  The Boundary Commission must operate, and must operate equitably, or the Treaty has been violated, and who can say what will be the consequences if that transpires?  We cannot afford to allow our rights under the Treaty, and established in Clause 12, to be diminished or altered in the slightest degree. We have stood by the Treaty at, as I have said, great cost in blood and treasure and national agony, and the price that has been paid for our honouring the Treaty has been too great to allow it to be violated now with our consent.</P>
    <P>I welcome those conferences.  I have raised this matter so that the President may put us in possession of some slight indication of what are the facts. The person representing this Government who goes into conference will thereby possibly have an indication of what is the mind of the people behind him in this matter.  That will <Col N="697" /> strengthen his attitude there.  When he returns I hope he will return not with an accomplished fact to which we have been committed, but with proposals for our consideration, and we will decide upon them in the real interest of Ireland according to our judgment. There must be no prejudicing of Clause 12.  There must be nothing done that will give credit to those pessimists who have told the people in the North that we had let them down.  There must be nothing now or hereafter that will vindicate those pessimistic falsehoods.  We have not let the people in the North down; we have not abandoned them.  Clause 12 can be made not only their charter of liberty, but also can be made the instrument by which that artificial division can be broken, and by which ultimately the nation's unity can be restored on even a greater and nobler plane than that on which it existed before it was ever challenged.</P>

      <P>Personally, I am very glad Deputy Milroy has raised this question.  I feel sorry that it has not been raised long ago.  I come from Deputy Milroy's constituency, and up there we feel and know what it means to be living along a hostile border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It struck me when this question was raised, and when I saw the exodus of Deputies from this Dáil that many of the Southern, Midland and Western Deputies are not as interested in the North as they might be and should be, and perhaps it would be better if some Deputy from the parts of Ireland I mention should raise this question rather than that a Deputy from the North should be called upon to do it. Deputy Milroy says that there are feelings in the minds of the people in the North that they have been let down.  I am afraid that no matter what effort is made to re-arrange the border that some people in the North will be let down.  That is a fact we must recognise at the moment.  We will be glad for a statement from the President on the question of the boundary re-arrangement. But there is one point in particular that I want to bring under his notice.  I have been discussing it along with other Deputies in the constituency with the men engaged in the boundary <Col N="698" /> work.  We had occasion to bring under their notice that all along the border of my county for a distance of 42 miles it is not possible to cross into the North of Ireland.  I wonder how would any of the Deputies from other constituencies feel here if for a distance of 42 miles along two counties they could not cross over into their neighbour's farm.  We have no approved road in West Cavan from Swanlinbar up to the Monaghan border.</P>

      <P>I do agree that the whole question of the differences separating North and South are not differences that can be composed by force of arms.  We can never successfully agree on any matter if we have to fight to the death to find agreement.  I agree with Deputy Milroy when he says that it is possible conferences may do good.  I think if people are able to meet and discuss common problems there may be a possibility of an understanding being reached, and it would be good that they could meet in that spirit. But it is absolutely essential that the point of view of the people who stand for a united Ireland should be regarded at all times as the dominant thought in the minds of those who go from here to meet the men who live in the North-East corner.  Those who live adjacent to the boundary know the troubles and <Col N="699" /> the hardships imposed by its existence. It is making matters very complicated for the traders, businessmen and farmers in that part of Ireland.  It is of such serious moment to many of the people in my constituency that business in some of our towns is now not more than 40 per cent. of what it used to be. It is a very urgent matter for people in my county, and I do hope that if nothing can be done in the near future to have an agreement on this matter, an agreement that will be more satisfactory than the present state, that and effort will be made to have that Article of the Treaty complied with.  There are many misgivings in the minds of the people up there that it is a dead letter, that the boundary is marked out at present and will remain where it is. Something has to be done to disprove that, and the people down here have to give an earnest of their sincerity, if there is sincerity in this matter.  They have to show us that this Article of the Treaty is to be complied with, and I think the sooner they get a move on the better it will be for their reputation.</P>

      <P>Press references have been made to communications between the British Government and the Government of Saorstát Eireann. Any information which has been secured has not been furnished directly or indirectly by the Irish Government. There have been letters on this subject, some of which have been already published. There has not been agreement as to the date of further publication. There have been references in the Press to statements alleged to have been made by Sir James Craig, both on behalf of the Northern Government and of Ulster.  Sir James has the right to speak on behalf of the Northern Government&mdash;as to Ulster he has not the right to speak.  There are three Ulster counties out of nine in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State. Two others have also unmistakably shown their determination to be included in the area of the jurisdiction of the Free State, that is five counties out of nine.  As to the matter of a conference, let me say that there has been no question of a conference on the basis of the agreement of January, 1922, and there will be none.  If there be a conference the Oireachtas is the final arbiter in matters dealt with by the Government at the conference.  We have not been appointed by the Dáil as Plenipotentiaries in any conference which may be held.  The persons appointed by the <Col N="701" /> Dáil as plenipotentiaries to negotiate and conclude a Treaty with Great Britain were in a different position.  They negotiated and concluded a Treaty.  It has been ratified by both countries.  Its terms are binding&mdash;it is the law.  The Government have not the power, if they <Col N="702" /> had the will, to alter the terms of this Treaty.  If any proposal should be made for any further agreement such proposal must be submitted to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>With reference to your starred question for Friday, the 2nd instant, on the subject of Corporal Christopher Mullaly's claim to unemployment benefit, I have had enquiry made and find that as no contribution under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was ever paid for him before he joined the Army, he is not eligible at all for unemployment benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923.  He has previously received Uncovenanted Benefit, i.e., benefit not supported by contributions in the years 1921 and 1922, but all schemes of Uncovenanted Benefit have been definitely terminated, and, as you are aware, benefit is now only payable strictly in proportion to unexhausted contributions. No contributions are payable by the Army in respect of Mr. Mullaly's army service, because he was not normally engaged in an insurable occupation before he enlisted.</P>
      <P>In the above circumstances it will be appreciated that there is no ground whatever for the suggestion in the last part of your question that any such cases are not thoroughly investigated and promptly paid where payment is due.</P>

      <P>Mr. John Trahy, Watergate Street, Bandon, <Col N="625" /> claimed an old age pension and was allowed, on the 29th September last, a pension of 6/- a week by the Bandon North Pension Sub-Committee.  An appeal was lodged for a higher rate by the claimant, and also one by the Pension Officer against a grant of any pension. The means consist of the profits of a licensed house at Whitegate Street, Bandon, and £13 a year in respect of a son killed in the European War.  The question at issue was limited to the estimate of the profits from the licensed house.  The Pension Officer, in his report, estimated the profits at £100 a year, and he furnished details of the sales.  The claimant did not furnish an alternative estimate, but stated that no allowance had been made for daughter's help in the shop.</P>
      <P>£100 a year appeared to be a very moderate estimate of the profit from the sales, even after a reasonable allowance for the daughter's services, and the claim to a pension was accordingly disallowed on the 27th ultimo.  A further inquiry does not seem necessary, as the main facts are not in dispute.</P>
