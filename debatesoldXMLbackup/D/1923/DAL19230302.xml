      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether the estimate for the year 1923-24 in respect of the upkeep of the Cork Mental District Hospital as approved at a meeting of the Committee of Management on the 16th January was £116,300, whether the estimate submitted to the Committee by the Resident Medical Superintendent was £85,946, and whether at a special meeting of the Committee on January 26th the Committee decided that £60,740 would suffice, whether this last sum, representing a decrease of £55,560 on the original estimate would be inadequate and result in hardship to the patients, or whether in the past few years there has been extravagant expenditure and gross mismanagement.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Cork District Mental Hospital Committee held on the 15th January, the Resident Medical Superintendent reported that a sum of £116,300 would be necessary to meet the commitments of the Committee for the year 1923-1924. Consideration of the matter was deferred to a special meeting on the 25th January. Some misapprehension appears to have arisen locally, as it was not clearly understood that the amount of £116,300 was reducible by the estimated revenue for the year from paying patients and other sources, together with an estimated credit balance at bank on the 31st March, 1923, and in addition the amount of the Capitation Grant.  The estimated expenditure was also reduced by £9,712 in <Col N="1928" /> view of lower costs.  The net amount determined as payable by the contributory bodies was £79,510, of which £60,740 is referable to the Cork Hospital, and £18,770 to Youghal Auxiliary.  The figure of £85,946 quoted in the question was the amount of the demand in respect of the Cork Hospital for 1922-1923, and was not, as stated, an estimate for the year 1923-24. The preparation of the estimate is a matter for which the Committee bear sole responsibility.  Until I have an opportunity of looking into the figures on which the findings of the Committee were based an opinion cannot be expressed.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the question I may say I have already had reports of the damage caused by seals and cormorants in the area mentioned, and I have made a suggestion which has been favourably received by the Ministry of Defence, that a number of Army marksmen should be told off to arass these pests.  I may add, however, that the seal and cormorant are both extremely wary, and that any local campaign against them heretofore has produced results wholly incommensurate with the expenditure of time and labour involved.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the question I have to say it is a fact that steam trawlers of different nationalities have seized the opportunity presented by the recent absence of the Fishery Patrol steamer to contravene our By-laws in the area off the Waterford coast.  I am handing the Deputy some particulars of measures which are now being taken to counter this illegal activity on the part of the trawlers, and which I hope will speedily result in a very considerable diminution of it.</P>

      <P>It is not alleged that the revolver and ammunition were found in the apartment occupied by the late Thomas M`Keown. They were, however, found in the house occupied by him.  Neither is it alleged that the ammunition fitted the revolver. The unauthorised possession of either would, however, under the terms of the Army Council Proclamation of the 7th December, 1922, render the possessor liable to the death penalty.</P>

Either there was a misapprehension in the drafting of it in regard to the question of an interval between the going out of office of the Minister for Local Government of the Provisional Government and the definite appointment of the Minister for Local Government of <Col N="1945" /> Saorstát Eireann or else it was a mistake arising from the fact that when this particular Clause was being drafted it was believed that the Ministry's Bill would have been before the Dáil and, perhaps, would have been given effect to.  I think it would be necessary to make a small change in the drafting of that.  The necessity for the Clause is to give sanction to the acts that were done before the Treaty and before the coming into being of Saorstát Eireann by the Minister who was exercising his functions under the authority of Dáil Eireann.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Every Order made by the Minister under Sections 11, 13, and 19 of this Act, and every Rule made by the <Col N="1946" /> Minister for Education under Section 16 of this Act, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas within the next twentyone days on which each House has sat annulling such Order or Rule, such Order or Rule shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>

There are so many suggestions in the Bill for giving permission to the Minister to make Orders of a very comprehensive and important character that it seems necessary there should be some provision made for such Rules and Orders to be laid on the Table.

      <P>I could not accept it as it stands.  I have already agreed in regard to Section 4 that an Order confirming the scheme should be laid on the Table of the Dáil and that provision should be made for its publication.  I quite accept the view that Orders made under Section 19 ought to be laid on the Table of the Dáil, but I am not inclined to agree that Orders under Section 11 should be laid on the Table. Heretofore this power of appointing Commissioners has been exercised as an Executive Act and it has not been necessary to do anything that would be equivalent to laying the Orders on the Table of the Dáil.  I think if the Minister were exceeding his powers in this direction he should be met by a frontal attack.  I would not be inclined to accept that nor yet in regard to Section 16.  I think that that would be merely an executive act of the Minister for Education which would have no sort of legislative change and I do not think should be required to be laid on the Table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be inclined to accept it.  Certainly at the moment I am all against it.  I think that this power existed in the past in regard to a very large number of local bodies&mdash; that is Poor Law Guardians&mdash;and no such formality was required, and I do not think that any case has been made out by anybody to whom I was talking for any such formality in the present case. I think it is a question for the exercise of the ordinary executive powers of the Minister.  I do not think that it is one of the things that is properly a matter that ought to be laid on the Table of the Dáil. There are things that are clearly of such a character where there are rules being made or the adaptation of enactments or anything of that sort.  These are clearly matters that it is proper to lay on the Table of the Dáil.  But other actions of an executive character are part of the ordinary administration of the Minister's office, and he should have to answer for them as part of the ordinary carrying on of his duties.  I do not think this is a power that is likely to be exercised very largely.  But where it is to be exercised he must, for instance, select very reputable people to carry on the work of the Commission.  I think it would be almost impossible to get any man of the standing required to take on the work of Commissioner in any locality if he did not certainly think that he would be able to go on with that work&mdash;probably unpopular and difficult work at present&mdash;of a Commissioner in any locality, but if he was told that he was going in for six months, and would be allowed to do certain work, he may take it.  But he would be unlikely to take up the office if it was to be subject to annulment.  Then I think the position of a Minister in dealing with authorities would be extremely difficult.  If the Minister was forced to close down a local authority&mdash;if his Order dissolving that local authority were to be annulled&mdash; I do not think the Minister could continue in office.  I think this is a case that is to be met definitely by moving in this Dáil to have a new Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to be done after the act.  We could imagine a Minister acting under the authority of this section, not only dissolving a local authority and putting a Commissioner in charge, but ordering a new election, or transferring the property and the several powers and duties of such local authority to any body or person or persons he shall think fit.  If you are going to give specific authority to the Minister to transfer the property of any local authority as he shall think fit to any person or persons then the only remedy is to come after that transfer has been made and impeach the Minister.  Well, that is not a very satisfactory remedy to the local authority whose property may have been transferred.  I suggest that the power that is sought to be given in this section is much more than he has argued for. The property of a local authority might be the chairs and tables in the Council Chamber, or the money, and it may be transferred as the Minister thinks fit to any person or persons.  It is a far stretch of the imagination that anybody who would be trusted with the administration of Local Government will exercise powers in that way; but when we specifically grant those powers without any check whatever it seems to me we are exceeding our functions; and surely some kind of notice to the Legislature is required, and an opportunity to check the act before the act is committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the power must be read subject to Sub-section 5 of Section 11, which says: &ldquo;If at any time after the local authority has been dissolved under this section, the Minister may, by Order, cause a new election of members of such local authority to be held, and upon the completion of such new election all the property, powers and duties of the dissolved local authority shall vest in the body so elected, notwithstanding that the same may have been transferred by the Minister.&rdquo; So that it is quite clear that the power of transfer is simply power that is required to give the body of Commissioners, or if it should happen&mdash;I find in the old days it used to happen&mdash;to an adjoining local authority the powers for the time being. It is the only way for that authority to carry on and to use the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite the most serious section, surely, that would require the submission of Orders before the Legislature.  The Minister defends the attitude he has taken in this matter by stating that he considers the powers involved in this section constitute ordinary executive acts.  Well, if the word &ldquo;ordinary &rdquo; is to be used in this connection surely it is a very wide latitude to give to the word &ldquo;ordinary. &rdquo; I think it is an extraordinary act to supersede a local body in the way required here.  But look at the powers conferred in this section.  Take the last sub-section, 6, &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time by Order&rdquo;&mdash;such Order, be it remembered, not being submitted to the Dáil at all&mdash;&ldquo;do all such things and make all such regulations as in his opinion shall be necessary for giving full effect to any Order made by him under this section.&rdquo;  I venture to say that that is just about as wide a power as it would be possible to confer on any one single person or any one single office.  And remember this, Deputy Johnson speaks about impeaching the Minister when the act was too late.  What is he to be impreached for?  It is impossible to impeach him once the Legislature has passed this section empowering him to do these things, because he can afterwards come to the Legislature and say that all he has done is justified, because all he has done he has done according to the powers which the Legislature conferred on him. He is removed from all sense of criticism by the powers given here.  It is now, and not at a subsequent date, that this matter should be taken into revision.  I urge, as I urged once before on this particular section, that this is really a matter where it is in the interests, not only of the Legislature that such order should lie on the Table, and be open for revision or supercession as the case may be, but it is equally in the interests of the Minister himself.  He would be in a very much stronger position in setting aside any local authority if in his doing of that act he had not merely the wide and general powers conferred under a legislative act, but had the specific authority of the Legislature for the doing of that particular act.  It would be in his protection as well as in the protection of the Legislature. I am extremely sorry he has <Col N="1950" /> found himself unable to accept the amendment, because I think it was reasonable and desirable, and I venture to think if there be any one section that should require the particular and ordinary procedure outlined in the amendment it is this section rather than any other section.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we ought to be misled by Deputy Figgis's skilful play on the words &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; and &ldquo;extraordinary.&rdquo;  It is, I grant, not an ordinary matter, I am glad to say, that local authorities should prove themselves so utterly false to their trust, or so utterly incompetent to perform the duties attaching to their representative positions that such action as the closing down and appointment of a Commissioner would be necessary. That is not an ordinary thing, and consequently it has never become an ordinary thing that the consequential action would be taken.  But it is quite an ordinary or natural or routine thing that such action should be taken when and if called for.  It is a proper thing.  It is the barest justice to the ratepayers, whose money these people are handling under a stewardship or trusteeship, that such action should be taken, and taken promptly, by the responsible central authority.  To say that there is no means for impeaching the Minister if this power is wrongly exercised, exercised in circumstances and conditions which, in the judgment of the Dáil, do not justify it, is saying a thing which is not.  The Dáil can, of course, call in question and review and criticise to the point of forcing resignation the conduct of a particular Minister in the performance of his office.  It can always be done, as the Minister for Local Government has said, by a frontal attack, by a vote of no confidence, setting out in plain terms the charges which are to be made against the particular Minister concerned, but this is, as the Minister for Local Government has said, an executive act. This idea of laying Orders on the Table of the Dáil or any Parliament is a kind of silent legislation&mdash;that things would come up of not sufficient importance really to justify debates, and yet somehow the acquiescence or approval of the Dáil ought to be secured.  There is a good deal of minor legislation done in <Col N="1951" /> that way by laying Orders on the Table, it being open to any Deputy to object and to raise a debate if he thinks a debate is warranted.  That is silent or passive legislation, but this is an executive act which falls well within the duties of a Minister to perform, and perform promptly, when and if, in his opinion and the opinion of his Department, it is called for.</P>
      <P>In justice to the ratepayers it is not a thing there should be any unnecessary delay about, and it should be taken on a Minister's responsibility, and he should be prepared to face the Dáil at any time and say he acted on the responsibility attaching to his office; that he stood for and stood by that particular act, while it would be open to the Dáil to indict him on a vote of no confidence, if, in its collective opinion, it believed he exercised his powers improperly, or with a lack of discretion that should normally attach to a Minister.  I hold then that that particular action outlined in Section 11 is an executive one, attaching to the Minister rather than one for which any specific authority of the whole Parliament and the collective wisdom of the whole Parliament had to be sought. It is not a matter of legislation; it is not a matter of making new rules.  It is a matter of taking definite action for the protection of the ratepayers, an executive act rather than a legislative act, which the position and the responsibility and the discretion that is supposed to attach to a Minister, whose appointment has been endorsed by the Dáil, ought to be sufficient to cover.</P>

The argument in favour of laying Orders, dissolving a local Council and setting up a new Council, transferring authority from one Council to another, deciding upon the election of a new Council for as many local authorities as he may think fit to dissolve, is a very great power to leave in the hands of Ministers.  It is altogether too great a power, as it practically means the annulling of the Local Government Acts and setting up new authorities.  In view of the Minister's promise to accept the amendment in so far as two of the Sections are concerned. I suppose there is nothing to be done but accept them.</P>

      <P>I was inclined to support the larger part of this amendment until I heard the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs.  There is unquestionably a very marked distinction between a clause of the type of Clause 19 and one of those others mentioned in the amendment, because it is a question of adopting an enactment or applying an enactment, and inasmuch as that, as pointed out by the Minister, is in effect the creation of legislation so far as regards the particular thing in view, it should of necessity be submitted for review to this Dáil, which is <Col N="1953" /> in the first instance, at any rate, the chief Chamber of the Parliament of the Free State.  I think that Deputy Johnson has overlooked in this particular Section 10 that the Minister for Local Government is to order a local inquiry, and it may be I misread the subsequent sub-sections when I interpret them to mean that all these things he has to do are to be consequent upon the report of the local inquiry.  Consequently, if that is so, it is not an autocratic act of the Minister in the exercise of executive functions, but an act done practically by and with the advice of a Committee of Inquiry that has reported in that sense.  I may misread it, because if one turns to section 11, sub-section 1 says &ldquo;the Minister may at any time, if he think fit, order a local inquiry.&rdquo; Sub-section 2 says &ldquo;if and whenever the Minister is satisfied after the holding of such local inquiry.&rdquo; There can be no doubt about that&mdash;&ldquo;That the duties of a local authority are not being duly and effectually discharged by such local authority.&rdquo;  Here is where a possible ambiguity arises: &ldquo;Or a local authority wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order, direction or regulation.&rdquo; It is just possible to read that to mean that the Minister may, if he think fit, decide that this has occurred, and act accordingly.  It is possible also to read it&mdash;or, if you like, misread it&mdash;as after the holding of such a local inquiry.  On principle I should object to investing a Minister, however admirable, with autocratic powers, and more especially with regard to the exercise of the powers of the local authority, inasmuch as the local authority are the elected representatives of their people, and must be deemed, except in presence of very satisfactory evidence, to be carrying out their duties and discharging their trusts in relation to their own electorate; but if an inquiry is directed, and held, and reports unfavourably to them, that essentially alters the case.  As regards the impeachment of a Minister, I think we need not waste any time upon that.  Such a fancy performance is not likely to come within our range, and certainly not within the lifetime of any of us who are here.  The amendment is particularly faulty, I think, in including Section 16 within its scope, because it is manifestly undesirable that the rules made by the Ministry <Col N="1954" /> of Education in respect of educational tests&mdash;tests of ability&mdash;should be laid upon the table of the Dáil to undergo debate. They are not, and they could not be, of such a nature as to require the discussion of the Dáil.  It would not be possible to carry out the administration of an Educational Office if matters of that kind in the ordinary routine of its work had to be suspended for 21 days until, say, a full dress debate with regard to some of the standards had been carried out in the Dáil.  The acceptance of the amendment by the Minister, in so far as regards Sections 4 and 19, seems to be quite satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I think the statement the Minister for Home Affairs has made is one of some importance to this assembly.  It seems to me intellectually a good deal more interesting than it is practicably possible.  It rather reminds me of a certain type of scientific treatise that sometimes one comes across, in which it is supposed that the heart of every mystery is satisfactorily unravelled when the author has managed successfully to classify all the forms in which it has appeared.  He gives us a definition in which acts that might be undertaken under the responsibility of this legislature, appear in three forms&mdash;legislation, silent legislation, and executive action.  Ordinary legislation is put before us in the form of Bills.  Silent legislation is put before us in the form of Orders that lie upon the Table of the Dáil.  Executive action, however grave or however minute, is a matter that need not come before the previous cognisance of the Dáil.  I am not prepared to challenge the statement in respect of what has already been done by the Dáil; but if we go into the legislature of the Dáil and take all the cases in which it has been mentioned that Orders shall lie upon the Table, it will be found that they do include certain graver forms of executive action.  I think that they should include those graver forms and that it should not be assumed that because a matter is strictly, according to the classification given, an executive matter rather than a matter for silent legislation&mdash;and in practice they are hard to distinguish&mdash;it should not be brought to the previous cognisance of the Dáil.  Because a matter is supposed <Col N="1955" /> to be a purely executive action, although it may be very grave, or so grave as to require the supercession of people who have been elected by a local authority in due and correct form&mdash;a matter of executive importance of that kind should, I suggest, be brought to the previous cognisance of the Dáil in the interests of the local body, this Dáil, and the Minister.  I would be sorry if that classification were to be passed without some kind of query.</P>

      <P>I asked this question because a great many complaints have come from different counties dealing with <Col N="1956" /> the plans adopted in the scheme for the closing down of hospitals.  I think before we pass the schedule, we ought to have from the Minister some understanding of what his intention is with regard to those schedules, with regard to the schemes and the modification of the schemes which he has now power&mdash;or, rather, will have power&mdash;to insure.  I have, for instance, complaints from the Callan district regarding the closing of a local district hospital.  The claim there is that the people are unanimous in favour of retaining this hospital as being necessary for the district, and especially for the poor people in the district.  There are similar complaints from other parts, and I think we ought to have some indication from the Minister as to whether he is in agreement with the decision of counties generally to close down the district hospitals and to centralise those hospitals.  I am not going to deal with any specific case.  The Athy hospital was mentioned the other day.  There are other hospitals under consideration&mdash; Mountmellick, for instance.  There is a great deal of complaint with regard to closing down all those hospitals, and instances are adduced of where patients have actually been killed by a journey over bad roads and mountains from the local hospital, which has been closed or suspended, to the central hospital which is substituted.  I think, before we pass from those schedules, we should have from the Minister some declaration of how he is going to adapt those schemes&mdash; whether he proposes to make them conform to a particular plan, whether he intends the closing down of so many of those small local hospitals, or what other proposals he is going to make in the matter. I leave it to any members from the country districts concerned to deal with their own cases, but I urge that we should have some indication from the Minister of what the general policy is with regard to the provision of hospitals in the counties.</P>

      <P>There is one point with regard to those schedules which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  I think it should be revised, as it is a grave matter.  It is a Section dealing with the Tirconaill scheme, where it says that:&mdash;&ldquo;No person shall be eligible for admission to <Col N="1957" /> County Hospital unless resident in the County for at least three months preceding date of application for admission. Admission to be on a signed authority from a Medical Doctor or a member of County Hospital Committee, save in accident and emergency cases, when the Visiting Surgeon, Visiting Doctor, or Matron will have discretionary power.&rdquo; That is to say, that the Visiting Surgeon, the Visiting Doctor or the Matron will have discretionary power to admit in cases of accidents and emergencies. But they will only have power to admit, according to the clear statement of this Section, if the person has been resident in the county for at least three months preceding the date of application for admission.  That means that if some person, a travelling vagrant or otherwise, in the county were to be attacked with a sudden illness, or meet with an accident, it would be impossible to let that person into the hospital, even though he or she were on the point of death.  That is an exceedingly drastic provision, that I had hoped would have been impossible in this country, and I suggest that it be deleted.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the hospital at Callan, in the county I represent.  I do not know what are the facts, or what is the correspondence that Deputy Johnson has got, but it will be well to know at the beginning that Callan is the nearest centre to the central hospital.  It is also on the best road, and the reason it has taken the stand it has taken might not be altogether, perhaps, in the public interest. It is true that there are a certain number in favour of having an hospital there, but it is also true that a big section of the community who have not spoken favour the central hospital.  As a matter of fact, all the rest of the county favoured this scheme.  People have to travel from Ross, Waterford and Urlingford, and in the north, in the Castlecomer area, and go longer distances, over worse roads, than the Callan people have to go.  If it were not for the particular Medical Officer they have in Callan at present, there would not be any trouble about the hospital there.  They would not want an hospital, but they happen to have an exceptionally good man, who is the cause of this demand that is made. <Col N="1958" /> and also, perhaps, owing to the fact that it means the expenditure of some money in the town.  The Minister has more details than I have.  I thought this matter was settled, but I find now that it has been opened up again.  It ought to be settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the schemes is to have one good hospital in each county, a hospital much better equipped and better run than there has been as a rule in any county heretofore, and to have in addition to that such district or cottage hospitals as may prove to be necessary.  There have not been, in general, cottage and district hospitals heretofore.  There have been workhouse infirmaries, and these have been abolished.  Now it is very difficult to accept as being <i>bona fide</i> the local demands that would come for an hospital in any district.  Very frequently you have agitations worked up by interested parties because the expenditure on the institutions means the spending of money in the town in which it is situated. In this regard the policy has been to centralise and to abolish the workhouse infirmaries, and to set up a central hospital and to have it clearly demonstrated that in any particular district in which a demand was made for a district hospital, that there was really need for it, having regard to the expenditure that would be involved in setting one up.  It is a matter for really testing the ground and for moving along slowly before putting up district hospitals or cottage hospitals where the interests of the sick of the neighbourhood clearly demand it, but doing it with such care as not to be rushed into quite unnecessary expenditure by these spurious demands that will arise from this district and that district all over the country for the provision of an hospital in the particular town or village concerned.  I have come across cases in districts in which there have been no hospitals for years, and when the amalgamation scheme was going through they thought that there was a chance that their particular area might be selected for the county hospital, a terrible outcry arises about the hardships and the deaths that might be caused although the thing was entirely an interested clamour; and it is the <Col N="1959" /> fact that where you have the provision of institutions you have all sorts of questions and all sorts of interested agitations which makes it extremely difficult to decide whether or not there is really need for the institution.  Care has to be taken, and we have to move somewhat slowly, but there is no idea of sacrificing the sick and suffering merely to save some few pence in the rates.  On the other hand, there is no intention of allowing an interested clamour to cause unnecessary expenditure in the provision of institutions where there is no very real demand for them.  In regard to the point that was raised by Deputy Figgis, there are many of the schemes which were not drafted with legal care, and we find here that even when we have people in this Assembly, and the assistance of people outside the Assembly, who are skilled in drafting, that clauses are put down that do not exactly cover everything they are intended to cover, and do not clearly bear the meaning on scrutiny that they may have been intended to bear.  The schemes, of course, were drafted by people who had not that experience or skill in drafting, and sometimes they appear to disadvantage because of that, when in reality the intentions of the schemes are much better than one would gather from what is written down.  In regard to that Tirconaill scheme the intention, of course, was clearly that in cases of necessity people could be admitted.  I think that could be read from the provision, whether they had three months' residence or not.  In any case, the intention of the three months' provision was that the person might be admitted, free and chargeable on the county, into the County Hospital if he had been three months resident in the county, but that otherwise he should be chargeable on the county outside.  We, in the Department, know the intention of the farmers of the schemes; it may be quite freely admitted that the greatest skill is not always shown in the actual drafting of the provisions, but as far as the suggestion that people would be allowed to die on the roadside because they had not been three months resident in Tirconaill is concerned, that is not a thing that people need fear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I can satisfy the mind of Deputy Figgis in regard to that clause on the point that he has raised.  As one <Col N="1960" /> of the members of the Committee who had the drawing up of the scheme, I can say that there was no intention of doing anything such as Deputy Figgis has alleged, and Deputy Magennis has pointed out to me that the changing of the punctuation in the sentence will make it perfectly clear that it was the intention, where there was an accident or emergency case, that the visiting surgeon, the visiting doctor or the matron will have discretionary powers, to admit at once, but the full stop was in the wrong place. That was not the intention of the Committee that drafted the Scheme, and in the printing there may have been an error in the punctuation.  But, in any case, the Committee in charge of the hospital, or the officials in the hospital, have full power to admit any case of accident.  The provision in regard to the three months was necessary because anybody who knows the situation of the Tirconaill County Hospital will understand that there are three counties close to it.  It lies on the borderline of Tyrone and many people in that county, who are nearer to it than to their own hospital, would come in and be chargeable on the rates of Tirconaill if the Three Months Clause had not been put in.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not make it quite clear as to the intention of this Bill, because most people in the country do not understand it, or at least a good many do not.  It is quite clear that the intention behind the whole measure and behind the reforming of the Poor Law was to bring the best medical attendance to the doors, as it were, of people.  Hitherto, if they wanted the best medical service, they had to be sent to Dublin at considerable expense and at considerable danger to themselves.  What has been aimed at is to bring modern medical skill to the doors of the people and to do that you must have properly equipped hospitals and have good medical men to carry out the work.  Except in one centre of each county that cannot be efficiently done without considerable expense.  It cannot be spread about in other centres all over a county without considerable expense entailing a proper theatre, proper equipment, etc.  To have it done properly one central hospital in any ordinary county is enough and it must appear <Col N="1961" /> to the ordinary man that to expect anything more is to expect the impossible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>And Whereas in the circumstances hereinbefore recited the relief of the poor under the existing law has in several counties become wholly unworkable and in order to meet the emergency so occasioned the Councils of those counties have reorganised the administration of the relief of the poor in their respective counties and have for some time past been <Col N="1962" /> administering such relief in accordance with schemes prepared by such Councils with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, the principal provisions of which Schemes are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  the abolition of the existing system under which the poor were relieved in workhouses established in each Poor Law Union;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  the centralization of the administration under one authority in each county;</P>

    <P>(<i>d</i>)  enabling all poor persons requiring relief to be relieved either in or out of the central institution as may be thought advisable;</P>
    <P>And Whereas until a comprehensive reorganisation of the whole law of Local Government in Saorstát Eireann can be prepared and submitted to the Oireachtas it is necessary that temporary provision should be made to remedy the more serious defects in the law and in particular that legal authority should be given to the said Schemes of poor relief which have been put into operation by several County Councils as aforesaid, that power should be given to other County Councils to formulate similar schemes, that certain emergency powers should be given to Local Authorities, and that authority should be given temporarily to the Minister for Local Government to deal with Local Authorities which are forgetful of their duties and responsibilities.</P>

      <P>At the last stage of this Bill this Clause 11 was discussed by Deputy Darrell Figgis, who raised a point which the Minister effectively, as it appeared at the time, dealt with.  But it does occur to us, on further reading, that there is a possible doubt as to what the meaning is of &ldquo;whenever an applicant for compensation under the Criminal Injuries Acts in respect of an injury to which this part of this Act applies includes a claim for compensation in respect of the destruction of and damage to any documents.&rdquo; If the loss of the document entails the loss of property, can it be said that compensation claim may be made for the loss of the property because the destruction of the document involved the loss of the property?  As explained by the Minister, the intention was to pay for the re-drafting or re-preparation of the document, but there is a possible interpretation of the clause that the loss of property being in respect of the destruction of a document might be read to be included.  I draw the attention of the Minister to that, and ask him to satisfy himself in the interests of the Treasury.</P>

      <P>I move Section 12, which deals with the liabilities of the State very largely.  The State has discharged its liabilities and some moneys are due to it or to some services in respect of which the State has a certain liability, and it is to enable the Minister for Finance to deduct such charges out of compensation paid that this section is inserted.  There is an amendment, I think, to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAL O'SHANNON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment&mdash;Before Section 12 to insert the following new Section:&mdash;&ldquo;If on the hearing of an application to which this part of this Act applies the Judge is satisfied that grievous hardship would be suffered by the applicant if he were required to pay in full and immediately</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  any debt or other sum of money due or payable by or collectable from the applicant to or by the late Provisional Government of Ireland, or the Government of Saorstát Eireann, or any Department or authority of either of these Governments;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> (<i>b</i>)  any money due or payable by or collectable from the applicant to or by the Irish Land Commission;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  any money due or payable by the applicant in respect of any poor rate or other rate levied by any County or District Council or Town Commissioners,</P>
    <P>the Judge may, if he thinks it right to do so, attach to his decree a provision (hereinafter called a `relief provision') that payment of the amount or amounts due shall be partially remitted to such extent, or shall be deferred to such time, or shall be payable in such instalments and at such intervals as he may think proper to appoint, and the applicant shall have relief accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This new section pretty well explains itself.  It is quite conceivable, and I think, has happened, that for various reasons, some arising out of the recent war, and the present war, numbers of people who would be claiming compensation might have considerable sums deducted from their compensation awards either because&mdash;as, for instance, in the case of our friends, the farmers&mdash;they were a little behind with moneys due to the Land Commission, or in the case of others in respect of Poor Rates and so forth.  The amendment would provide that in these cases, where the judge thinks there is a real hardship in the deduction, he could give some relief in the matter of time, or, perhaps, in the matter of amount; but, at all events, that there should be a deferring of the payment of the amount of the deduction in full until such times or at such intervals as the judge might think would be fair, everything considered, to the applicant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to look at all favourably upon this amendment.  In the first place the Government's accounts, and the accounts of Local Authorities and their liabilities generally such as contemplated by this Act are due to be paid on exact dates, and the non-payment of them on these exact dates throws out of gear the whole finance machinery either of the State or the Local Authority.  Those who have a close and intimate experience of the finance of Local Authorities know that the ratepayer has a life only of twelve months, and that in respect to that twelve months he has all the liabilities <Col N="1969" /> which the Local Authority has to bear for that particular period, and it is an injustice, and it is unfair to the vast body of the ratepayers that you should give relief to a single one of those ratepayers making up the whole amount for his liability for a particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, so involved is such a system of finance, that there are certain funds which, properly speaking, if not spent in their own term, and if they amounted to a particular sum should actually be handed back to the ratepayers in respect of the year in which they were struck. That does not happen in practice.  The financial machinery is so regulated that each one of these individual Boards has a liability for that particular period, and you disorganise the financial machinery if you carry over an overdraft or the balance as the case may be. It is well known that local authorities have not been able to collect the rates regularly in the majority of cases, and there is a great danger that if any sort of sanction or acquiescence in such a proposal were to eventuate, this condition of affairs would arise&mdash;namely, that the local authority, in order to relieve the burden, would borrow money, and repay gradually such accumulated liabilities. That would be altogether immoral&mdash;a financial immorality of the first magnitude&mdash;because revenue which, in the ordinary way, should bear its liability for a particular year would be subsidised by capital liability, and a number of ratepayers of the future would have to discharge expenditure&mdash;normal, ordinary current expenditure&mdash;of a particular year. Local authorities should not borrow unless to spread the burden of the advantages which are derived from capital expenditure over a number of years, so that as regards the first part of the amendment, relating to the payment of rates to County and District Councils, the case for that absolutely goes.  To come to the Land Commission, this is a service which affects the credit of the whole State.  On a particular date the Land Commission annuities are to be paid, and somewhere within a fortnight or three weeks of the payment of them the State has got to discharge the whole of the sums, and sometimes more than the whole of these sums.  You are then saddling the ordinary taxpayers of the community for a service that has been <Col N="1970" /> inaugurated for a particular section of the community.  You can at once see that there is no morality behind a proposal of that sort.  If you once let the idea into people's heads that there is going to be acquiescence in that form of financial administration, there is nothing to keep them from organising a campaign to secure relief of the whole for one particular period in which they are liable to pay; and they might say, &ldquo;Let us postpone it and we will pay interest on the money.&rdquo;  That would damage the credit of the country and disorganise the finances of the State.  Now, as regards debts or other sums of money &ldquo;due or payable by or collectable from the applicant to or by the late Provisional Government of Ireland, or the Government of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; let us see where that leads to.  In some cases where a decree has been received, the Board of Works has made advances in good faith, believing that that sum will be awarded. It is obvious that the Central Fund should be reimbursed to any extent that it has made money available for that purpose. There again the same thing comes in&mdash; that, in good faith, the money was lent, and in good faith it ought to be repaid, and repaid without delay.  I would ask the Deputy, in view of the implications and the dangers which an amendment of this sort, if pressed, would give rise to, not to press his amendment.</P>

      <P>May I point out to the Minister that, while I do not want to do anything that would upset the necessary arrangements as to time, date, or anything else fixed by the local or national authorities, or even the Land Commission, numbers of cases may arise where the debts or monies payable may actually have been incurred by the inability of the applicants to pay these debts, their inability arising because of the destruction of their buildings or the machinery that brought them in money.  I do not ask for anything like what the Minister fears, but what I do ask is that some consideration be given so as to prevent hardship.  I do not think that any Judge, exercising his discretion, would do anything that would gravely upset the finances of the State.  But I do think there are possibly many cases in which actual hardship would be suffered by an applicant, because <Col N="1971" /> it was the loss of the instrument or buildings in respect of which compensation was being claimed that caused the debts to be incurred either to the Land Commission or to the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will notice that for a claim of this sort to be admitted would be the thin edge of of the wedge as regards compensation for consequential loss.  It does not enter into it.  Then the State is in this position, that it borrows money at interest and as long as that is outstanding or withheld from the Government the Government is paying interest on money the use of which is in the hands of a person whom it has compensated and the person so compensated is at an advantage as against the State.</P>

      <P>The suggestion of Deputy O'Shannon or the end that he seeks to attain by this amendment has already been attained by an amendment that was introduced into the Emergency Powers Act, one of the Bills that we passed the other day, giving County Court Judges the power which is already possessed by High Court Judges to put stays upon the execution of decrees. If this amendment were inserted it might give rise to very great difficulties. Suppose the Provisional Government or the Land Commission or a County Council proceeded in the ordinary course against a person who owes a sum of money to the Provisional Government or to the Land Commission or in respect of rates and that the Judge on a case being made to him, such as the Deputy who moves this amendment suggests ought to be made to the Compensating Judge, refuses to grant this stay or on the other hand that he was impressed by the case made, and he did grant a stay, you might in either case get the two conflicting jurisdictions. You might get the County Court Judge refusing a stay on a Civil Bill for rates and you might have an applicant coming forward in respect of compensation and applying to the Compensating Tribunal to give him a stay which the other Tribunal had refused.  It does appear to me that to introduce this into this Bill is putting upon the Tribunal that is to administer this Act a duty that clearly does not belong to it at all, and it would not have the material for granting a stay <Col N="1972" /> in an appropriate case that the other Tribunal would have.  No rates can be taken off a man except by legal process. That legal process would come before the ordinary Courts, not before this Compensation Tribunal at all, and it is before those Courts that the applicant might make the case and, in my opinion, could make the case that because his property had been destroyed a stay ought to be put on the execution of the decree or a stay ought to be put on the decree itself.  I rather fancy that there would be far more material before the regular Courts and they would be far more likely to grant this stay than the Compensatory Tribunal which would really not have the proper materials to go upon and before which evidence that might be adduced before the County Court Judge or the High Court Judge would not be admissible at all.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the time at which Deputy Gorey ought to have raised this point.  It is obvious that if on a plea of financial difficulty or strain this relief provision were asked for in the court it would amount to giving the money of the State without interest for a period to the man who had raised the case.  If the money is in effect garnisheed, the compensation which was coming to him by the operation of this clause is garnisheed, then he is put into difficulties, and he cannot pay his other debts, and he comes before the County Court.  Deputy Fitzgibbon's amendment now introduced into the Act, or part of the Act, comes to his relief.  But the need for these things ought to have been foreseen at the time, and Deputy Gorey, instead of raising it now, should have voted with us against the Bill, which required that amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move to omit Sub-section 3 (<i>a</i>).  The amendment on the paper is to omit Sub-section (3).  It should be 3 (<i>a</i>).  The Sub-section of the sub-section that I am moving to delete reads, &ldquo;any debt or other sum of money due or payable by or collectable from the applicant or other person entitled to such compensation to or by the late Provisional Government of Ireland, or the Government of Saorstát Eireann, or any Department or Authority of either of those Governments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I suggested this should be deleted is not that no money that is rightfully owing should fail to be collected, but that this particular form of collection should not be adopted, inasmuch as it is inequitable and injurious. If the money be actually owing to the State, and a certain person has compensation granted for the loss of certain premises he might have either the whole amount or part of the amount owing to the State for taxes in one form or another in dispute.  If that compensation had not been granted and if his premises had not been damaged the ordinary course would have been for the onus of suit to lie on the State.  In the ordinary course, that is if I understand the law in the matter aright, but for the introduction of this Sub-section the onus of suit would still lie in <i>garnishee</i> proceedings but the effect of this paragraph is that the money is arbitrarily deducted from the amount of compensation due, and the person who has suffered the damage, because he or she has suffered damage, has the responsibility thrown upon him or her of protesting against some action and has the instance of suits in the matter thrown upon him or her instead of its lying upon the State. I suggest that it would be more equitable if that section were left out and the State had to proceed in the normal way to prove that the debt was a right debt and a debt of substance and ought to be met instead of actually abstracting it from certain other monies admitted to be due to the person in question and then leaving the person in question the responsibility of bringing the suit himself&mdash;when <Col N="1975" /> he should be the defendant to make him the plaintiff.  I think the effect is unjust and should be omitted, and I move that that Sub-section be deleted.</P>

I understand the provision as to money due by an applicant, and as to money payable by an applicant, but what is the dark design lurking beneath the phrase &ldquo;money collectable&rdquo; from the applicant as distinct from money due to him?  In these days one is afraid of phrases such as &ldquo;money collectable.&rdquo; There is no doubt there is an explanation, but I confess it is a little difficult to follow. May I also draw attention to the words &ldquo;to or by the late Provisional Government&rdquo;? I do not, I confess, see how that reads.  What are the words governing &ldquo;to or by&rdquo;?  As printed it does not seem to me that the section can be read to make sense.  There is probably some word omitted.  That &ldquo;to or by&rdquo; is in line 27.  It probably refers to &ldquo;due or payable,&rdquo; but it does not so read.</P>

If Ministers take the view, if the Dáil takes the view, that the late Dáil had no authority, had no power to issue orders or decrees dealing with monies or debts or the responsibility of any citizen to any other citizen or community outside its own authority then we will follow one course; but if we consider that that Dáil had authority and power, rightful and legal authority, then I submit that we must make a condition that the present Minister for Finance who is under this section authorised to deduct certain sums due, that debts owing <i>bona fide</i>, at least moneys withheld <i>bona fide</i> in obedience to the order of the Dáil, ought not be considered a debt by the present Government or any succeeding Government. Obviously I am thinking more of arrears of Income Tax than of anything else, and I submit that arrears of Income Tax or alleged arrears of Income Tax, that have been withheld in obedience to the orders of accredited servants of Dáil Eireann ought not to be pounced upon by the successors of the authority which gave these orders.  Many people <i>bona fide</i> acted under the implied direction of the Dáil and refused to pay Income Tax <Col N="1978" /> during the last couple of years before the establishment of Saorstát Eireann. The moneys were in many cases indeed expended in the interests of the Government of the time, applied to the funds of that Government, paid over to that Government, and I am urging that we should make a condition in this Bill that the Minister must not be allowed to impound moneys on account of such alleged debt.  The issue is a bigger one than the one ostensibly raised because it challenges the Dáil to say whether we are legalising the acts of the old Dáil or not.  I think it is time that we had some understanding whether we are to consider the acts and decrees of the Dáil of 1919-20 or the Government appointed by the Dáil as legitimate and therefore recognisible by this Dáil or whether we are to treat them as being the acts and decisions of a mere political committee which had no legal authority.  I invite the Minister to make clear what the policy of the Government is in that particular respect.</P>

      <P>The amendment reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that the powers granted to the Minister for Finance by this Sub-section shall not apply in the case of any debt or tax the payment of which has been withheld <i>bona fide</i> in obedience to any decree or order of Dáil Eireann or any person or persons acting with the express authority of Dáil Eireann or any Minister appointed by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  To that extent I would have no objection, and I could give an undertaking that such will be the case. I am perfectly satisfied to give that for these reasons:&mdash;First, that I am prepared to carry out any Order or Decree passed by Dáil Eireann that has not been repealed or amended by this Dáil, and secondly, because in this particular case the State will lose no money because it has not passed any decree and has made no Order and gave no directions at any time&mdash;either the Cabinet of the late Dáil or the previous one or the late Dáil itself or the previous one, at no time passed any decree to withhold the payment of Income Tax or Land Commission annuities. As a matter of fact, these matters were under consideration more than once in the Cabinet, I believe, of the First Dáil, and the person who objected to any such <Col N="1979" /> action being taken&mdash;I believe I am speaking in a way that will be borne out by others&mdash;was the late Minister for Defence, Cathal Brugha.  He objected, and pointed out that persons in business might have their business upset and be put to much more cost than the actual cost of the payment of income tax.  I myself said to many people, &ldquo;Withhold your payment of income tax until it is going to cost you more than the payment, and then pay it at the last moment.&rdquo; We did not advise at any time, and we did not make any order at any time, that people should not pay land annuities. We may have said, &ldquo;You can delay,&rdquo; but we never said &ldquo;You can withhold,&rdquo; because we knew perfectly well that, although the British Government would be obliged to make up the loss, it would create a reaction on our own credit here, and would be a disadvantage to us much greater than the disadvantage to the British Government in having to make up the difference between the amount collectable, the amount due, and the amount required to discharge interest on the sinking fund on the stock.  Now, taking it on the larger issue, the late Dáil did not impose taxation, and it realised that, although there was a force in this country which was looked upon and generally accepted throughout the whole country as a usurping force, it nevertheless administered certain services, and that in respect of those services there was a certain moral authority for collecting certain taxes.  It was not a case&mdash;because he is an enemy we will strike him in every possible place.  That was not the attitude.  At that time the position of affairs in this country was perfectly constitutional. It never meant anything approaching anarchy, anything approaching financial disruption, anything approaching hideous disorder.  It always had in mind a perfectly constructive policy with regard to these matters, and when the question of income tax was under consideration, it was under consideration to this extent, that persons who would be relieved by virtue of payment to the British Government would have to pay it to the Exchequer of the Dáil Eireann&mdash;it would not be lost.  It did not mean that the person relieved would be thus benefited to the extent of the tax, but that it would be administered and collected by a <Col N="1980" /> popular body for the provision of certain useful services for the nation.  Now, if there was any person or persons acting who did not act with the express authority of Dáil Eireann to the extent of ordering, advising, or decreeing a non-payment of these taxes, any Minister so acting was acting illegally and unconstitutionally, and had no authority whatever to order the non-payment of such sums.  I accept, and have accepted all through, decrees and orders of the First and Second Dáil when those orders were legally and properly carried out.  There may have been cases in which Ministers took upon themselves certain responsibilities and certain authority to which, perhaps, they were not entitled.  For these things we do not stand.  We stand for collective responsibility of the body, and the acts which the body performed when properly constituted.</P>

      <P>The amendment of Deputy Johnson, if valuable for nothing else, is eminently valuable for having drawn this explanation from the President.  When I raised a portion of this question, it was in the later hours of the debate on the draft Constitution, and the President on that occasion explained that there was no decree issued by the Second Dáil ordering, directing, or inviting anyone to withhold payment of Income Tax to the British Treasurer I need hardly say I accepted his history unquestionably, but since that I have had an opportunity, as all of us here have had, of making ourselves acquainted with the proceedings of the First Dáil, as recorded in the Official Report, and there it is made very clear that when certain Deputies proposed to make British government difficult by withholding all payments of certain moneys, the members of the Ministry at that time, notably the Minister for Defence, were strong against the issue of any such decree on the grounds given by the President, that it might endanger the credit of the country.  But I was unaware of that, nor were people in the country aware of it until long after the event.  It is only now, thanks to the courtesy of the President, that some of us are aware of it, through our reading of the proceedings.  Most of us were under the impression that the public acts, such as the burning of documents in Income <Col N="1981" /> Tax Collectors' Offices, and, above all, the burning of the Customs House, represented the policy of the Dáil at that period.  That obviously was a mistake, and the men who did these acts were not rebuked in public or proceeded against, and, consequently, we were all left under the false impression that what they did was done as an act of the Dáil through its officers or agents.  I plead guilty of having been deceived in that way.  I am now satisfied with the statement of the President.  It is quite clear that I, at any rate, as an individual, put a wrong construction upon what happened.  The men who dealt what was, after all, the fatal blow to English government in this country by the destruction of the Custom House, were acting outside the scope of their authority.  They were not authorised to do these things.  The men who destroyed Income Tax returns, and made it difficult and impossible, in some cases, for Income Tax to be collected, acted on their own initiative, and now it is the declared policy, and must be the policy of the present Dáil, to recover these moneys and secure them for the present Treasury of the Free State.  That is the policy, and now, to save litigation, and save the double hearing of cases in the Courts, Sub-section 3 enables the State to impound, and, in fact, without garnishee orders, to garnishee these moneys. In view of, and in consideration of, the depleted character of the Free State Treasury, I do not think any of us is likely to object to that.</P>

      <P>It is just a little amusing to be forced to realise that the chief significance of the past to some people is, that they may be enabled to evade their liabilities in the present. There was never any instruction issued as the Deputy who has just spoken admits, to the people of this country by the First or Second Dáil to withhold payment of either Income Tax or Land Commission annuities.  On the contrary, it is within my knowledge that deputation after deputation came up from the country to the late General Collins, who was then Minister for Finance, urging this course upon him, telling him how immensely popular it would be if he were to issue an instruction that land annuities were not to be paid; and what political support it would insure for him and his movement.  To his credit, in my opinion, he did not snap at that particular carrot. <Col N="1982" /> He was a builder, he was constructive, and he never wrecked where he had not his alternative machinery there to substitute, and he did not, so far as he could mould the development of the movement, go out at any time, in the spirit of the bull in the china shop, simply to wreck for the sake of wrecking.  He had too real a sense of his responsibilities to do anything of the kind.  He saw the danger of inculcating or propagating in this country the lesson that people should seize the excuse of the political or National situation to evade what were really liabilities; and he saw, too&mdash;for he thought in terms of achievement, unlike others who thought always of picturesque failure&mdash;that at some time in the future, probably, the responsibility of government in this country would be on us, or some of us, and he was not the kind to take steps that would make that difficult task more difficult.  That is simply by way of preface, and to emphasise the fact that at no time did we issue orders, or give encouragement to people to avail of the National situation to evade their liabilities.  I mention that as there has been a tendency lately more or less in that vague way that the present is the child of the past, to try and put on us the accusation of having sown the seeds of anarchy in Ireland.  Now, I take it, even those who said there was an implied injunction to withhold Income Tax from the British were withholding Income Tax from the British <i>qua</i> British, and were not merely seizing the National situation to put so much money into their own pockets.  I take it it was a mere temporary suspension, and that the money was put away into a separate account to be paid to the first native Administration that would come into existence as a result of the struggle going on.  I am so sure of that, that I do not wish to dwell on it for a moment, because this country I am profoundly confident, does not contain within its shores citizens whose patriotism does not run further than their own purse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been rather an evasion of the issue. Before dealing with the evasion, let me draw attention to the proceedings of the Dáil of the 19th June, 1919. There were asked certain questions regarding Income Tax, as: Is it recommended to refuse to pay; what steps are to be taken to deal with the forms, and <Col N="1983" /> so on?  The Minister for Local Government, whom the President may recognise, acting for the Minister for Finance, said, &ldquo;the Finance Ministry is considering the question of Income Tax.&rdquo;  After showing that the bulk is paid by public companies and by people who were not exactly under the influence of the Dáil then sitting, he said the principal difficulty in the case was neither the moral nor the legal objection to it, but rather to secure sufficient support for an agitation against the imposition.  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;Income Tax is illegal, and an evasion of the 7th Article of the Act of Union, but it has not been objected to in time. If there were a general strike against it we would have some hope of defeating it.&rdquo;  Then, a little later: &ldquo;the Ministry are considering the question generally.&rdquo; Now, subsequent to the consideration, the Dáil was not sitting publicly or issuing Decrees on every public hoarding, but it was advocating policies and actions through its agents and its representatives, and subsequent to the consideration by this Dáil of the illegality of the Income Tax, we had a campaign initiated against payment of the Income Tax, and the destruction of the machinery for collecting the Income Tax.  I agree with Deputy Magennis that any loyal citizen of the State at that time was justified in inferring from the discussion, agitation and propaganda by deed, that it was with the consent and implied direction of the Dáil of the time that Income Tax should not be paid to the British authorities, that Income Tax was illegal.  No Decree of the Dáil was passed, as far as I can gather, imposing Income Tax.  Therefore, no Income Tax was legally enforceable during that period from 1919 to 1920. The action that was taken against the Income Tax offices was taken because those offices were being worked for an alien authority against the will of the people.  They were collecting money from the people which they had no right to collect, and that was the purpose of the attack on the offices.  Anyone here in contact at the time with Ministers and Ministers' Secretaries and Army officers were thoroughly justified, from the directions that were given by those people as to the minds of the Ministry, in saying that it was against public policy to recognise the act of the British Parliament imposing Income Tax upon the <Col N="1984" /> Irish people.  The real question arises here: Was the tax, which was an annual tax, a legitimate burden put upon the Irish people?  It was a tax of an Act of Parliament passed after the setting up of the Dáil, when that Parliament had no authority in this country.  The Act of that alien Parliament was not ratified by the Dáil and those people who gave allegiance to the Republic, those people who acknowledge the Dáil, as the supreme authority, were perfectly right in saying that this was an imposition.  It was not a debt, and it was not legally enforceable, but now, under a new Constitution, the successors of the old Dáil come along and say that the citizens of this new State who were citizens of the Republic, are in duty bound to recognise those taxes as legally enforcable debts.  I maintain that the position is indefensible, if we are to recognise the old authority as a legitimate authority, and it cannot be legalised until this Dáil imposes a tax to cover the amount that was due, according to the taxation papers that are being sent out.</P>
      <P>Now it may be said that in one of the taking-over acts which were adopted recently, authority is given, but authority was not given by those acts, as I read them, because the phrase used is &ldquo;enforceable,&rdquo; and I maintain that they are only enforceable by illegality if the old Dáil had any real authority.  We have been discussing a Bill to-day to legalise and regularise certain acts that were done extra legally, things that were done, not by acts of the Parliament of the time, but by acts of the Executive.  I want to suggest that we shall have to be consistent in our views of the legitimacy or otherwise of the old Dáil, and I want also to suggest that it is arguable and, I think, probably easily proveable, that at least as large a sum of money, perhaps a larger sum of money, would be collectable from the people who owe Income Tax, say, from the period when the Provisional Government was established, when there was reasonably proveable and legitimate authority in the country.  From that date taxation might be legally enforceable, but anything prior to that should not be demanded.</P>

      <P>This question of Income Tax was under consideration by the old Dáil and by the Cabinet of the old Dáil on many occasions, and they always <Col N="1985" /> looked at the realities of the matter, and they always looked at it from the point of view that was taken by the late General Collins, who never had any doubt of our success, and who never had any doubt, as the Minister for Home Affairs indicated, that some of us would soon be engaged in carrying on the government of the country.  The idea was never entertained seriously, at any rate, of asking the people not to pay Income Tax or Land Commission Annuities, because I have frequently heard the late General Collins say: &ldquo;it will be easier to get the people to stop paying than to get them to commence again.&rdquo; The present President said the Cabinet of the Ministry had the question of Income Tax under consideration.  We had the question of Income Tax under consideration in this way, that a scheme was in preparation for the collection of this Income Tax, imposed by British law, by Dáil Eireann for the purposes of Dáil Eireann.  That was under consideration at the time when the President spoke in June, and was not finally abandoned until a considerable time later, when the activities of the Black and Tans became so intense that we were convinced that the collection would be impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was intended to collect the tax, and out of the money collected to indemnify people who suffered.  If the British Government, for instance, attempted to make an example of a man and to terrorise the income-tax payers by coming down very hard on certain people, it was intended to indemnify those people out of any taxes that would be collected. Some time in 1921 the project for collecting the tax was abandoned, but that abandonment was not regarded as final. I remember the late General Collins saying that he was convinced that for the present it would be impossible to collect the tax.  As far as the Dáil and the Cabinet were then concerned the question of legality did not arise.  We were prepared to accept the Acts that had been passed by the British Government, for the purpose of getting any income-tax that we might collect for the use of the Dáil and its Executive, assessed. The intention always was that if the tax were not paid to the British Government that it should be paid to the Exchequer of the Dáil.  There never was, on the part of any responsible section of the <Col N="1986" /> Dáil, an intention of allowing people to get off and to put the tax into their own pockets.  In insisting now that the tax should be paid we are following precisely the line of policy that was always in the mind of the First and Second Dáil, and of the Ministries of the First and Second Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really very refreshing to hear Ministers justify their actions on the grounds of the policy of the First and Second Dáil.  What the Minister for Finance has told us just now amounted to this: that he sees no objection to the amendment if you stop at the last line and leave out the words &ldquo;or any Minister appointed by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  In other words that he agrees that any money withheld under order of the Dáil, or of a person acting within the express authority of the Dáil, is properly withheld, but objects that in some cases a Minister or other person may have given an order which is <i>ultra vires.</i>  In effect I take it the President, as Minister for Finance, accepts everything in the amendment except the last few words. The question raised by Deputy Johnson is a very much more important one than the little question raised in this amendment, and I do not feel that one may discuss it satisfactorily or seriously on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It is, I suppose, sufficiently obvious to every one that but for the civil war there would have been no question of the status of the First Dáil and the status of the Second Dáil.  Some of us had thought it would be necessary to wait until the next Dáil before the status of the First and Second Dáil was properly recognised.  The President's statement just now is an exceedingly welcome one, because he has told us he recognises, and has always recognised, every decree of the two previous Assemblies.  The immediate importance of the matter, apart from the question of national dignity&mdash; and it is due to ourselves and to the country that the two Assemblies that preceded the present one should be put in their proper perspective&mdash;is this, and I desire to direct the attention of the Ministry to it, since the question has been raised here: Owing to the circumstances of the time, this Dáil has been very remiss in giving effect to certain things decreed by its predecessor.  A great many decrees <Col N="1987" /> were made by Courts appointed by its predecessor, and the point has arisen acutely owing to a recent case decided in the King's Bench, where the decision of a Dáil Land Court was overruled on the ground that a Land Court had no jurisdiction whatever.  Of course, such a thing should not be, and I know that there are plenty of excuses to be made for the delay in putting this matter right.  The matter has, however, now become acute, when you remember that a great number of decrees have been made by these Land Courts, and these Land Courts formed the most successful branch of the legal administration of the late Dáil.  It is obvious monies must be due under such decrees, and monies may be due under what I may call English law which would not be due if such decrees are recognised within the meaning of this section.  It is also obvious such decrees ought to be recognised, with, possibly, some exceptions for which provision can be made. From the fact that we have taken over the Judges who administered English law, who do not recognise the laws made by the Dáil before the present Assembly met, and who, from their standpoint, will continue to declare void any acts done under those Irish laws made in the last two or three years, it is very necessary that steps should be taken speedily to put that position right.  There should, of course, be no necessity to question the status of the previous Dáil; but really there is, from the fact that we have taken over those Judges who do not recognise our law.  I know a Commission has been sitting to try and put this matter right, but I do urge that it is a matter of very great moment, now that the decision <Col N="1988" /> come to the other day in the Courts will encourage numbers of people, against whom decrees were given by the Land Judges of the Dáil, to come along and claim that those decrees should be declared void and <i>ultra vires</i>, and they will be declared void and <i>ultra vires</i> by the present Judges as long as these Judges continue to administer only the English law which we have taken over, and not the Irish law we have made ourselves.</P>

Many citizens paid their income tax and paid their land annuities during the war, and did not contravene any decree or order of the Dáil.  Other citizens escaped these liabilities; and it just happens now that it is to the benefit of the Irish State to get in these liabilities of citizens who escaped payment during these periods, and I strongly advise them the sooner they pay the better.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief in my remarks.  I desire again to thank individually the Deputies who saw their way to vote on the First Reading of the Bill, and I hope that those Deputies will stand by the Bill till, I trust, it is passed by the Dáil.  I wish it to be clearly understood that this is not a party measure, and I think that this Bill should be considered and judged individually by the Deputies on its merits.  I might add that if I for a moment thought that this Bill was unduly repugnant to the Government I would not proceed with it.  I know that the Bill as it stands is not perfect, but is far from perfect, and it is the desire of my colleagues that every reasonable amendment and proposition to be put forward, if at all practicable, be embodied in the Bill.  As I remarked the last day, in olden times, before the so-called Union existed, hospitals and other public buildings were built from the proceeds of lotteries, so that this process of public lotteries is not unknown in Ireland, and I think that if our forefathers thought well to institute lotteries for such a deserving charity as hospitals, I respectfully submit that we should not cavil with that.  There is no doubt whatever that this Dáil&mdash;or, rather, the Executive of the Dáil&mdash;since it came into being, has overcome practically insurmountable obstacles. It has, I think any reasonable person will admit, legislated wisely and well for its people.  Now, the three great divisions of any nation&mdash;the three most important services&mdash;are the Church and the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And I again submit respectfully that the medical arm of the nation is of the utmost importance.  I submit, too, that a paternal Government, like every other Government, will do its utmost to see that the public health of the community is attended to.  At present we have no Public Health Department in the Government, but I am sure that later on, when we are settled more on our feet, the Department will be instituted. The care of the people and the looking after their welfare and their good health are certainly very important factors in the well-being of the nation, and it is because these hospitals play such an important part in the life of the <Col N="1991" /> nation that I suggest that it is imperative that this Bill should go through, or at least some other alternative should be put forward.  Money for consequential losses and other things cannot be paid by the Executive, and the money required for the public hospitals, and particularly for the metropolitan hospitals, would be fairly large and therefore it will be conceded that at present we cannot get the required amount of money.  Another point in connection with this Bill which should not be forgotten is that it is a purely temporary measure.  From the time of its passing &mdash;and I hope it will be passed&mdash;it will only last for a year, and I submit that the passing and enactment of this Bill would be good constructive legislation. There may be a point against that, but on the whole I think that no reasonable person will conceive that this is not constructive legislation.  There is no doubt whatever that if financial support is not given to some of the metropolitan hospitals they will have to close, and again that will mean unnecessary suffering to some of the poorest of our people. Another point that may not be of such great importance is this, that many of our metropolitan hospitals are hospitals of international repute, and if they have to close their doors many medical people, post-graduates long over their postgraduate courses, and students from practically all parts of the world will be unable to attend the clinics.  Of course that is only secondary, and I am only concerned on the hardship that will be entailed on the poor of our cities and on poor people coming up to Dublin from the country.  The gravity of the financial position of the hospitals is so acute and urgent that it requires to be seen to at once.  When we hear the discussion for and against the Bill I am perfectly satisfied that few points can be put up against it and on the whole when you consider the object of the Bill and when you recollect that our forefathers here in old Dublin did not consider it <i>outre</i> or an impracticable proposition then I think we should not cavil at it.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. For many years it has been admitted that the Dublin hospitals have attained a high standard of efficiency.  They are a credit <Col N="1992" /> to the city.  What is most striking about the Dublin Hospitals is that they have been maintained with such generosity by the people of Dublin.  Before I came to live in Dublin I often wondered at the generosity of the people who maintained these hospitals.  Now, when I heard during the last few years that they were in dire circumstances, and not able to meet their bills in many cases, and to keep abreast of the times because voluntary support had fallen short, I sympathised greatly with them, and felt it was to some extent a great disgrace to the Irish nation that it was not able to maintain these hospitals as they should be maintained.  If a man or woman in the country falls sick, and requires an operation, if he is a man of means he can come to Dublin to be operated upon.  But it costs a considerable sum of money to bring a person from the country to Dublin, and to maintain such a person in a private home here for some weeks.  Now, if anything happened these hospitals it would not be possible for the poor person to come up to Dublin and undergo an operation.  It is inconsistent of us not to come to the aid of the Dublin hospitals seeing that all through the country the hospitals are supported through the rates.  The scheme of amalgamation which was discussed here for the last few days gives us ground for hope that in a year's time, or certainly two or three years' time we may have in every county in Ireland properly equipped hospitals that will render it unnecessary for people to come up from the provinces so frequently as they did before to the Dublin hospitals.  But, in the meantime, something must be done to keep the Dublin hospitals open.  No one proposes at present that they should get a grant from the State.  I have the greatest possible sympathy with the Dublin hospitals, and I am not in favour of any form of gambling.  I might almost class myself as an anti-gambler, but I will put up no barrier against the hospitals getting some money, and that is why I support this motion.  If the way of getting the money is not quite the proper way, well then let some suggestion be made to provide the money in some other way.  The hospitals deserve the money, and need the money, and I think the people who object to it on the ground of morality are over-straining the point.  I have heard men denouncing these things who have gone to one <Col N="1993" /> hundred races for the one I went to, and who will continue to attend races at the same rate.  If this scheme is not good enough let us have a better scheme.  I am seconding this motion, and supporting the Second Reading of this Bill, and I hope that those who are promoting the Bill will do something to meet objections raised on the ground of gambling and corruption.  I do not believe much in those gentlemen who promoted recent Sweeps&mdash;I have no faith in their newfound love for medical science or charity. I grant all that.  I ask those promoting the Bill to submit a clause providing that a full statement will be submitted by the medical committee showing the money received, and all the money expended, and then we will know where we stand with regard to Sweeps.  It is a difficult matter I admit to carefully check these transactions, but it should not be beyond human wit to do so, and if we have a full statement of the money expended we will see what Sweeps are worth, or whether we should permit men for a purpose of this kind to run them.  I am supporting this for this year only, and this Bill only, and only on account of the worthy object at which it aims.</P>

    <P>I am going to oppose this Bill.  To assume that its sponsors are in earnest would be stretching things, for it is probably a joke, but it is not a timely one; the atmosphere is not congenial to levity. Even the barometer is in trouble.  All assemblies are probably liable to the raid of the humourist, and we can scarcely hope for immunity.  The actors here deserve congratulation, in so far as they have dressed their designs in an attractive garb.  We are all attracted to charity. <Col N="1994" /> There is probably no higher form of charity than suffering humanity.  To alleviate misery, in disease and disablement, appeals to everyone, and it is surely a crude joke to suggest, as these proposals imply, that our nature is irresponsive to such fine feelings except through an appeal to its cupidity.  The inherent weaknesses of the gambler are to be subsidised.  That unfortunate propensity, which produces more disaster for our people and more suffering than our combined hospitals are called upon to relieve, is to be exploited.  Our national characteristics exhibit a strong disposition to take risks and a pride in doing so; our temperament is extreme in this line. It is in the recognition, in the fertility, of this field that our wager-laying friends rightfully placed confidence, and they want permission in a small way for a very laudable object to utilise this propensity. With the acceptance of the principle and the establishment of the precedent the small way can develop and the object become reconcilable with the real designs of those who engineer these schemes. The money comes largely from outside the country, they will say: Perhaps so; but if the principle be wrong, there is no exemption even should the money come from Russia.  The principle of indirectly sanctioning gambling which is here jocularly proposed cannot be confused or confounded with the object for which funds are needed.  Bazaars, they say, are similar.  No doubt; and I hope that we are reaching the stage when even sanction for bazaars will not be sought seriously on the responsibility of this nation.  This is a falling into line with the doctrine of &ldquo;the end justifies the means.&rdquo;  It is a doctrine pressing for acceptance presently in much more serious matters in this country.  Whatever sanction is sought for such a doctrine, it should meet with the opposition of all such responsible authorities.  Hospitals have suffered latterly and have served strenuously.  Their financial needs cannot be left unattended to.  If a Bill is brought forward to secure for them national recognition proportionate to their services, and conditional with acceptable national control, it is likely to be unanimously accepted here, and it is neither rational, just, nor politic to cast them on the waves of chance and make them incorporated agents in an absurd <Col N="1995" /> game of chance in the exceptional position in which they find themselves to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is a great day for Ireland.  The Dáil has been engaged for some time in passing legislation which in the main has had to do with public affairs, the transfer of authority, the regularising of politics and administration.  But here we have the first fruits of freedom.  I can imagine that Deputy Doctor White has been thinking how best to celebrate the achievement of freedom by the Free State.  I can imagine him looking at Reginald's Tower and thinking down the centuries, the long procession of heroes, patriots, poets and martyrs, and saying &ldquo;here we have the one far-off divine event to which this long procession moves&mdash;the emancipation of Ireland from the Lottery Act.&rdquo;  The day will come, I am sure, if this Bill become an Act, when Deputy Doctor White will quote or adapt, or his friends, or his children's children will adapt Shakespeare&mdash;&ldquo;He that shall live this day and see old age will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbours, and say, `to-morrow is Saint Vincent's Day.' &rdquo;  I want to deal with the matter seriously.  This Bill is intended to give to a certain committee who I presume are doctors&mdash;although they are not <Col N="1996" /> described&mdash;authority to run sweepstakes; and the plea is made that the hospitals for which those sweepstakes are to be run are in great need of money, and that they are essential to the life of the State. Nobody is denying or doubting for a moment the great need of the hospitals and the necessity that money should be found to provide for them.  But this Bill is the outcome of a series of sweepstakes and their suppression.  And what are the facts about these sweepstakes?  The facts are that to raise large sums of money the whole world must be scoured. I have been told on excellent authority, almost the highest, that fully eighty per cent. of the money that has been obtained by the sale of sweepstake tickets comes from England or Scotland and about ten to fifteen per cent.  from the United States of America and the British Dominions; and not more than five to ten per cent. from Ireland.  Now that is a very important fact; it is put forward as though it were something to commend the Bill.  But I say that it is the most damnable fact about the whole question.  The first Act of a private nature in the Dáil is to give permission, authority, to exhibit the sores of Ireland and the poverty of Ireland to the world and as a beggar to ask the world to come to the aid of the hospitals of this country. But it may be said that this is not begging.  Perhaps not.  Then it is an appeal, as Deputy McGoldrick has said, to the cupidity of persons who have no concern with Irish hospitals, but who are simply hoping to get very big prizes for a very small amount of money.  But this is a consideration which I want the Dáil as a whole to bear in mind &mdash;that it is an utter denial of the doctrine of self-reliance, that it is an utter denial of the doctrine of self-help.  It is simply telling people that Ireland, having got this measure of freedom, immediately proceeds to throw the responsibility for maintaining her hospitals upon other people.  Is that a thing to be proud of?  Is that a desirable movement?  But worse than that, you are dependent, I say, for eighty per cent. of your income upon subscribers in England; you are dependent upon the Postmaster-General of England as to whether your Bill is to be a success.  It is a contravention of the Lottery Acts, and you are simply putting your whole institution at the mercy of the Postmaster-General <Col N="1997" /> or Home Secretary of England, to say whether these tickets shall be allowed to be distributed, and whether the Post Office shall be at your disposal.  Is that a desirable position in which to place yourselves?  What would be the position of the Oireachtas if they passed this into an Act and then, when you had got your thousands or millions of books out, the Postmaster-General of England said &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;? Where should we be?  I say it is a shameful proposition.  Self reliance! Sinn Féin!  and you throw yourselves freely upon the mercy of an alien administrator. It has been put to me that this is the means of giving a large amount of employment.  The people that make that kind of argument to any Trade Unionist or labour advocate, entirely misconceive the position that Trade Unionists and labour advocates hold. Six hundred clerks, I am told, have been employed at this particular job.  Six hundred clerks may continue to be employed, but if you do not legalise this procedure, then six hundred clerks are going to lose their employment.  Vested interest is being created, and at the end of a year, we are told, that these interests will be dispersed.  But you can create vested interests by any kind of proceeding.  You can create employment by all kinds of undesirable practices, and by allowing all kinds of obscenities to take place and to go through your institutions.  We are not going to advocate or support any proposition for the mere creating of employment which is not for the good of the community.  In the promotion of these sweepstakes we have seen the most horrible competition amongst the promoters to get hold of a charity that they can exploit, and we are told quite frankly that it cannot be done by voluntary agencies, that it cannot be done by people who are interested merely in the charitable side of the movement. You must have professional men who can organise this kind of an institution, these sweepstakes.  It must be done in a business-like way by really well organised men that are specialists in the work. We have them tumbling over each other to get hold of a charity which they can exploit before the world.  We are asked to legalise that kind of thing here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Milroy says &ldquo;no, no,&rdquo; Will the promoters of the Bill say that they are prepared to leave the Doctors, or any other set of voluntary workers, to run this business, and to run it within Ireland?  If they will do that, a good deal of the opposition, my opposition at any rate, would be withdrawn, But they dare not do that, because they would not get the money they want.  You have got to do a degrading thing to get the money, or you will not get the money. One has seen the professional beggar getting possession of the most decrepit and ill-kempt child for the purpose of exciting the charity of the public.  That is an analogy to what these people are doing who are toppling over each other to try to get hold of the opportunity to run a sweepstake.  The Doctors interested in this, no doubt, are going to select the organiser, and they are going to select the most respectable of the organisers, the most honest and decent, and, no doubt, they will see that it is all done decently and in order, and thus they will alienate all the rest.  Then, we are to have a Committee which is to decide for itself how the money which has been collected in this way is to be expended.  The Oireachtas of the Free State is to hand over to them full authority for the distribution of the money, to select what hospitals they like, and to distribute it in any manner they like, having raised the money in any manner they like, all with the authority of Dáil Eireann. We will then find squabbles between the hospitals.  We will find a rivalry between a hospital in Dublin and a hospital in Cork or a hospital in Waterford; between a private hospital and a semiprivate hospital, between a hospital and a convalescent home, between a nursing institution and some other kind of medical institution.  That will come about, and we will find that the Committee which has got authority from the Dáil is going to be placed in hot water, and further demands will be made for freedom to organise further sweepstakes.  I believe these hospitals must be maintained. and I believe money must be found for them.  They are not the only hospitals that are in need of money.  Hospitals in England are making the same complaint, and they are endeavouring to run sweepstakes and endeavouring to evade the <Col N="1999" /> Lottery Act in England, and no doubt there will be rival sweepstakes going on. But Ireland is to be the happy hunting ground in regard to sweepstakes.  They are to be legalised here, and it is not to be merely a winking or a blinking or a putting of the telescope to the blind eye, as has been done in the past.  Sweepstakes are to be actually legalised here. and, therefore, I say Ireland is to be the happy hunting ground of this particular kind of &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; as it is called.  We are challenged to find an alternative means of financing the hospitals.  For my part, I am prepared to make a suggestion, and to support the suggestion individually to the utmost.  There are something like 450,000 or 460,000 health-insured persons in Ireland.  A penny per week for a year, half subscribed by employers and half by employees, would produce £100,000 in the year.  That is a fund that I believe could be obtainable, and I believe the workers generally would be willing to subscribe to it, knowing the need.  I submit that this whole hospital position has got to be considered in relation to the Health Insurance under a Health Ministry, and I hope the Ministers, when making proposals under their Ministries Bill, will make provision for a Health Ministry, which will bring within its purview the hospitals and health insurance.  Let there be some real national responsibility for the upkeep of these hospitals.  But the mean way we are proposing to do it &mdash;to throw them upon the charity of England, Scotland, America and Canada, and we will give 5 per cent.&mdash;I say that is not worthy of the Dáil or of the Oireachtas; it is not worthy of Ireland, and it is not worthy of the promoter of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The proposer of this Bill asked us to consider it on its merits.  I am almost in agreement with him except that I would ask the Dáil to consider it on its demerits.  He told us that in olden times our forefathers used to disport themselves after this fashion.  I do not know much about olden times, but I do know a certain amount about more recent times and about the activities of certain members of the community with regard to sweepstakes. The carpet in my office has been worn by people coming to me with reference to this particular business and they were <Col N="2000" /> people whom I never suspected of being philantropists, and who had not the reputation generally.  But they wept about the condition of medical charities, and I attribute a cold I contracted some time back to the damp atmosphere they created in my office.  They were touched to the quick about the conditions of the hospitals and particularly the condition of the Dublin hospitals.  They told me just how many days and hours they were from closing down, and that they were to be let run a little sweepstake to prevent the calamity to the community and to the metropolis.  My construction of the present Bill is that when I proved so flinty-hearted that appeals in the name of individual charities failed, then they take to the hospitals collectively and hope that when beaten in detail they are going to win when they come en masse.  Now the &ldquo;drive&rdquo; behind this Bill is not the &ldquo;drive&rdquo; of medical charities, but it is the &ldquo;drive&rdquo; of people who have made a profession or occupation or livelihood out of promoting sweepstakes; people who have at their disposal the organisation, the huge lists of addresses and agencies that are necessary for the running of sweepstakes as sweepstakes are run in these, our days.  This Bill is a simple Bill&mdash;one of the most naive documents I have ever had the privilege of reading.  It meets the point, if I might perpetrate a bull, by evading it. One would not think by reading this Bill that there was any corruption or fraud or looseness attributed in the public mind to sweepstakes.  There are no regulations or conditions here to counter any such evils.  It is a very simple Bill and set out at the foot of it we have 10 or 12 names.  I only know one of these gentlemen personally, but I am prepared to accept offhand that they are all very good and upright and respectable men, though only one of them is a Knight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we are asked to believe that these gentlemen will run sweepstakes, that these busy Dublin surgeons and physicians, are going to sit down and personally conduct a sweepstake, or sweepstakes. We know that that is not the position at all, that in fact they will go to one of these gentlemen, who has at his disposal all these addresses and agencies all over the world, and say, &ldquo;run a sweepstake for us.&rdquo;  They could <Col N="2001" /> not do it otherwise.  They could not do it themselves, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out.  They would not have the time, and they would not have the knowledge nor the organisation necessary. Now, I will probably be acquitted of having any prejudice against the medical profession, or of having any deep-seated antipathy to hospitals.  Any day I may personally require the services of one or more of these hospitals, but I do not think that this is the way to cater for them.  A Deputy here said he was not in favour of any form of gambling; he was, in fact, an anti-gambler.  But people are not entitled to come along with a Bill and say, &ldquo;If you do not like this, put up something else.&rdquo;  We are entitled to say: &ldquo;Not this.&rdquo;  That is all we are asked to do&mdash;to vote &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;against&rdquo; this measure.  Personally, I intend to vote against it.  Deputy Dr. White, the proposer of the Bill, came to me and asked, &ldquo;would it be any embarrassment to put it forward,&rdquo; and my answer was that it was better discuss and thrash it out, but that personally I would oppose the Bill, because of my experience during the last four or five months&mdash;oppose it if you like, on account of the people who gravitated towards my office in this particular class of business; oppose it because I am not satisfied that the &ldquo;drive&rdquo; really comes from people interested in medical charities, and that, in any case, I do not think that the care for the physical welfare of the citizens ought to lead us to do a thing which is not healthy for the body politic.</P>

      <P>I do not like to give a vote on this occasion without saying something.  I voted for the introduction of the Bill.  I am going to vote against it now.  I think, perhaps, my experience of the general working of hospitals in Dublin is greater than anyone in this gallery.  I know that they are very much in need of money, and I know that it would be extremely difficult to raise that money.  I know, if we turned to the State and asked for a subsidy, the answer we would get from the Minister for Finance at the present moment.  I deplore the idea of the care of the sick being thrown back on any money raised in any objectionable way.  The Minister for Home Affairs has made a greater impression on me than anyone else in regard to the matter.  I do not see how it <Col N="2002" /> would be possible for me to support the Bill after he had stated his experience, and said that after careful consideration of the matter he did not see how it would be possible to eliminate the question of fraud.  If that is so, I do not feel that I could support it.  I have one or two objections that I would like to raise.  I do not think the hospitals have been consulted as to whether they would wish to have money collected in this way.  I see by to-day's papers that one hospital has refused to have anything to do with it. Up to the present I have no guarantee that there is a general desire on the part of the Managing Committees of hospitals to support the Bill.  I am sorry that I should have to oppose the raising of money to help hospitals, no matter in what way the money is to be raised, but I cannot see my way to support the Bill in the present case.</P>

      <P>I have just a few observations to make about this Bill. I rise to try to disinfect this Assembly from the poisonous gas we have had from those opposed to the Bill.  I was really sorry Deputy McGoldrick was not allowed to read the full text of his pontifical letter on Faith and Knowledge, and I was also sorry that this Dáil had not amongst the other Ministries a Ministry of Public Worship, so that it could be circulated as a tract amongst the erring members of the community who strayed from the paths of righteousness.  There is one argument that might have been put forward, which would have met fully and logically and satisfactorily the contentions of the promoters of the Bill.  I waited to hear that answer from the Minister for Home Affairs.  That answer would have been that this Bill was unnecessary; that the State would rise to that sense of responsibility which Deputy McGoldrick claimed it possessed and come to the aid of these institutions.  A few days ago, discussing another measure, the Malicious Injuries Bill, when there was certain criticism passed upon the exclusion of certain forms of injuries as a basis of compensation, the President, in arguing in favour of the exclusion of these, said, &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the money to come from to support these institutions?  I do not think anyone here will contend for a <Col N="2003" /> moment&mdash;even those who share the strange delusions of Deputy Johnson that we are upon the brink of an abyss of iniquity and that we ought to pause before we hurl the country into that abyss&mdash;that money is not needed for those Institutions and needed urgently. If you can show that money is to be forthcoming, that these Institutions are going to be maintained, that they will function with all the essential requisites of such Institutions, and that they shall be fully equipped to do the services that the nation needs, then you have met, in the only way in which you could logically meet, the arguments in support of this Bill, and there will be no necessity to proceed with it.  I have here the balance sheet of Mercer's Hospital, showing a very heavy debt to the Bank, and also showing that the ordinary expenses are far in excess of the ordinary income.  This is not a Bill to legalise sweepstakes, as such.  It is an emergency measure to come to the aid of Institutions that are in a state of crying financial distress.  I have no affiliation or acquaintance with any sweepstake interest, though I have no doubt there will be some moral philosophers from Leopardstown to-day who will vote against the Bill&mdash;probably some who never missed a race either there or at Baldoyle.  They will doubt the morality of this Bill.  I do not charge them all with that, but I heard some people who think it is almost immoral to miss a race meeting, denouncing the iniquity of this Bill.  To say the least of it, that is not logical or consistent, and it is not representative of a considered judgment or an impartial mind.  To put it mildly, the Minister for Home Affairs did not treat the Dáil to what I call a serious examination of the Bill.  There is no one here, whose argument is more conclusive, when he has a good case, than the Minister for Home Affairs; there is no one whose reasoning is so putrid as his when he has a bad case and when he is trying to substitute imagination for logic and facts.  In Dublin there is an eminent divine who recently pronounced upon the Bill.  He said, &ldquo;What shall it profit the State if the Hospital heal the citizens' bodies and heal them at the cost of their souls.&rdquo;  I want to know have the souls of the patients who passed through the Mater Hospital since <Col N="2004" /> it was erected been damned?  An eminent writer in a daily paper says that the first Dublin Hospital lottery ticket was issued in 1847, and that from 1853 to 1857 a series of annual Dublin lotteries raised funds for the equipment of the Lying-In Hospital, now known as the Rotunda, the second maternity hospital erected in the world's history.  Mercer's Hospital followed the Rotunda, and then came the Hospital for Incurables.  These were erected largely with the assistance of funds raised in a somewhat similar manner, and possibly with less precautions against corruption than we can take in this enlightened age.  I want to know where is the logic of utilising now those institutions that were built largely out of the proceeds of lotteries, and that derived their source of support from the very thing we are suggesting now? Those who are opposed to this Bill on principle, should now proceed to advocate that those Institutions, erected by means of funds derived from such iniquitous sources, should be demolished, and that the philanthropists who are so conspicuous by their absence in the subscription lists of the hospitals should proceed to erect alternative institutions in their places.  We are told by the Minister for Home Affairs that it is impossible to close all loopholes to fraud and corruption that might be opened by the Bill.  I do not believe the resources of civilisation, or the wit and ingenuity of the Minister for Home Affairs are so bankrupt or scanty as that.  If that argument held, it is practically an argument that there is a certain curious thing known as original sin that still remains in Ireland, and that there must be no legislation until that original sin has been eliminated from the denizens of this unfortunate country.</P>
    <P>If that argument is good, and that is, in reality, the principal argument he puts forward, all legislation should be suspended until that marvellous achievement is arrived at.  Our legislators would have a good long holiday, and the community might be delighted if that took place.  It is quite possible to take precautions against all outstanding and almost minute attempts at corruption or fraud.  All the accounts of these sweepstakes for charitable institutions can be supervised by public accountants. <Col N="2005" /> Every penny brought into their coffers can be scrutinised and examined, and the personnel of the Executive Council directing and controlling such projects, can be made such as would meet the satisfaction of every person who is not, in this matter, looking at it rather from the point of view of anti-race meetings, <i>i.e..</i>, one who is opposed to all the things that are supposed to accumulate around race meetings.  Practical steps can be taken to safeguard public rights and finances, and I think the financial council can be made such as would meet the requirements of all.</P>
    <P>Certain names are mentioned in the Schedule of the Bill, but there is no reason why they could not be altered or added to, and I believe the Committee did contemplate some change in their body by, at least, giving to the other provinces representation that would be adequate, to see that the other provinces would have their interests safeguarded in the matter.  I am afraid that I am distracting the attention of this Assembly at a considerable length, but the adverse comments on this Bill have been so sweeping, so largely detached from actual facts and common-sense, that I did not want this Assembly to finish its discussion here to-night with these delusions of the imaginations of Deputy McGoldrick, Deputy Johnson, and the Minister for Home Affairs.  I would like that this Assembly would come back and consider the fact that what this Bill asks is not to attempt to give legislative sanction to sweepstakes as such, but that it is an honest intention and effort to try and meet the crying need and the serious financial necessities of institutions that are essential to the well-being of the community. No one denies that they are in need of funds, but no one has put forward a practical alternative to the solution. I am not overlooking the alternative that Deputy Johnson suggests, but I am afraid that that suggestion would take a very long time to materialise, and that the immediate necessities of those institutions would not be met in the degree to which, I am informed, at any rate that they are essential.  I do not know if Deputy Johnson or any other Deputy contemplates that calamity. Theseinstitutions are in financial distress, and that distress is becoming more acute. <Col N="2006" /> I do not know that we can allow the opportunity of assisting them to pass, or to reject such an opportunity and see an added acuteness of financial distress coming about without feeling some serious responsibility for it.  I do not know that Deputy Johnson and his friends on the other side of the Dáil will hail with satisfaction&mdash;at least, I feel they will not&mdash;a situation in which the coffers of these institutions become so depleted that the employees of these institutions cannot be paid a living wage in order to discharge their duties.  Deputy McGoldrick said the circumstances were not such as lend themselves to levity. Certainly I do not approach this in any spirit of levity, and I think I have what might be called a flippant nature.  The levity that has been introduced has been all on the side of those who oppose the Bill, and who tried to evade the fact that these institutions are up against a serious crisis, and that it is the duty of this Assembly to safeguard them against bankruptcy or inefficiency.  As I say, there are three alternatives.  Let the Government state that they can finance these institutions.  If they cannot, let them show us another avenue or source from which funds can come to subsidise or finance these institutions.  If they can do neither one nor the other of these, then let them give those who are trying to meet the situation with a practical solution a chance to do that which they admit they are incapable of doing.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote for the measure on this occasion, but not because of the convincing nature of the sermons that have been preached here to-night in support of the Bill.  We have been reminded of the fact already that in the first Seanad which has been set up under the Free State some of the wealthiest men in this country are members, and if we are sporty enough, as I believe this Dáil is, to send the Bill along to the Seanad that body will provide it with a sponsor to put the case in the same way that Deputy Milroy has put it this evening.  They will realise that this is the first opportunity that they as wealthy capitalists and honoured citizens of the country have had to com pensate for the honour that has been done them by electing them to the first Seanad.  Deputy Johnson has asked me <Col N="2007" /> if I meant out of their private purse, and I certainly say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  We have in the Seanad also some very good sporting men, as we have here in the Dáil.  I am not now referring to Deputy Gorey, although he is looking at me.  I am quite satisfied that if the Dáil sends up this Bill, which, in my opinion, and, as quite truly said by Deputy Milroy, is not a Bill to legalise sweeps, the gentlemen there, with very few exceptions, who represent the capitalistic interests of this country, and who are, no doubt, every one of them philanthropists, will find a way out of the difficulty for the Minister for Home Affairs by turning down the Bill, and finding sufficient money to keep the hospitals going until such time as the State is able to provide them with funds.</P>

      <P>What I said was, &ldquo;if we had not had the text before us,&rdquo; but we have had it.  A very strong case has been made out against the Bill, and no attempt whatever has been made good, bad or indifferent to meet that case on the part of the promoters of the Bill.  If the Bill fulfils certain conditions, it has been stated that it would have a considerable amount of support in the Dáil, but the promoters of the Bill turn round and tell you you can change it and make it anything you like.  It is not the Dáil's business to make it anything it likes; it is the business of the promoters of such a Bill to come forward with a Bill that will carry conviction to the Dáil, and will stand criticism and will not in any sense be anything to the discredit of those who back it in the Dáil or elsewhere.  Now, as the Minister for Home Affairs has said, all the gentlemen whose names are on the Schedule are highly respected and decent gentlemen, but officially they are not known to us.  Whom do they represent, what interests do they represent, and what direct authority from those institutions <Col N="2008" /> have they got behind them?  We do not know.  I want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very pertinent point indeed was made by those Deputies who said that these things are run by professional sweepstakers and that they are not run out of bigness of heart in the interests of charity.  But nobody on behalf of the Bill has stood up here and said that &ldquo;that sort of thing will not happen now and we have taken steps; we have Sections or Clauses in the Bill to prevent that.&rdquo;  You have not.  You have a Bill that might be for anything.  As a matter of fact, except the good names of the gentlemen who are mentioned in the Schedule, there is nothing at all to indicate that 80 per cent. of the proceeds of sweepstakes should not go to some private people and not to institutions at all.  But the promoters say &ldquo;We can change all that in Committee.&rdquo;  It is not our business to wait until the Committee Stage to do that; it is their business to have the thing in workman-like shape in the Bill.  I voted for the First Reading of the Bill to give it a chance. We had not the text or anything else before us.  We have had the text since and we have heard the advocacy on behalf of the Bill.  There is one great argument in favour of the Bill, and one only, and that is that the hospitals and other institutions in Dublin are desperately in need of money.  Most of us know they are, and it is a crying shame and scandal that they are not financed on a much sounder basis than they have been.  Personally I agree that the community through the State, perhaps, also, through the municipalities or local authorities, should finance the hospitals and should provide, not only an efficient but a sufficient medical service right throughout the country.  The only argument, the only solid argument, is the urgency and the desperateness of the case.  I would be prepared to back Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  He calculates, I suppose, that anything upwards of £100,000 could be got.  Can the promoters of the Bill give us any idea whatever of the amount of money no matter where it comes from that will go into those institutions from the sweepstakes?  They cannot.  The fact of the thing is that the pretty big gamble in that sense is an argument against the Bill.  I do not think at all that it is a matter of gambling.  If anyone goes <Col N="2009" /> down to Leopardstown or Baldoyle and takes a flutter in that way, I am not against him or against anyone who desires to take a flutter, or against anyone who wants to have 10/- on a sweepstake when the chances are 1,000 to 1, if he wants to do that, but here the gamble is very big as against the hospitals.  Let the promoters of the Bill satisfy us that the objections made by Deputy Johnson and by the Minister for Home Affairs are not sound objections, that we can all be sure that there will be no private profit-making out of this business and that there will be none of the defects that have been pointed out to us.  We are are told about the Metropolitan hospitals, but what about other hospitals, in Cork and Waterford and various other places?  Are they going to be left out?</P>

      <P>Well, I shall be very happy, indeed, to find even a professional sweepstaker who inside twelve months, will be able to raise and give to all the hospitals in Ireland that need the money sufficient to remove the complaint they make that they cannot make ends meet.  Deputy Milroy says that nobody on this side of the Dáil would like to see the people employed in the hospitals deprived of a living wage.  I wonder how many of them have had a living wage as it is, even at the best of times?  We know perfectly well that because of the scandalous state of affairs that prevents the hospitals getting sufficient money, many of those who do the hardest and most arduous work in the hospitals work for very little, and work terribly long hours.  I refer to those on whom throughout the night the health of the patients, under the supervision of the medical staff depends.  But there is not even a guarantee from anybody that their state, or anybody's state in the hospital will be improved.  They cannot even tell us that £50,000 will actually be handed over to the Dublin hospitals out of a Sweep, because they do not know.  They depend on somebody else.  The gentlemen whose names are in the Schedule do not know; they are dependent on somebody else.  That is not the kind of proposition that should be brought before us; the gamble is too big.  I am not against a decent gamble, but so far as the hospitals are concerned the gamble is too <Col N="2010" /> big, yet I think the thing should get a chance.</P>

      <P>I will not detain you very long.  I agree with a good deal of the last speaker's remarks, but I would point out that it is an urgent necessity to keep the hospitals going, and the proposition that is made is to wait for twelve months, and you will get £100,000 perhaps, if the employers give ½d. and the labourers give another.  Now, the proposition on the other side is to give us a chance, have a sweepstake, and we will have £10,000 a month for twelve months. There is something wrong with the Bill. Provision should have been made for the prevention of fraud, and we cannot inculcate the idea of legislating towards gambling, but at the same time the matter is urgent, and it is to be done in the interests of charity.  I will give you one text of Scripture and then I will sit down&mdash;&ldquo;Charity covers a multitude of sins.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The advocates of this measure are not to be congratulated on their advocacy.  I do not mean to make the small point of how much they differ amongst themselves.  I sympathise deeply with Deputy Sears who, as the newspapers say about certain criminals in the dock, seemed to feel his position acutely.  He is an anti-gambler, but he would relax his principles in favour of this Bill.  The seconder of it on the first occasion gave us an admirable impersonation of Sir Toby Belch.  He says, in effect, after Sir Toby, &ldquo;Do you think, because you are virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?&rdquo; And then, we have the extraordinary allegation that because the hospitals are a charity, nothing is to be said as to the morality or expediency, or advisability of the means suggested in this Bill for coming to their rescue.  The Deputy who was responsible for the Bill had the audacity to remind us of the lotteries of the eighteenth century.  I wonder has he read the history of the operations of these lotteries.  Pleasant and easy reading for him would be one of the stories of Maria Edgeworth, if he does not care to take serious history for his purpose, or, if he wishes, let him read the Preamble to the Lottery Act, which sets out, amongst various whereases, the moral depravity and the utter ruin to all trade and social <Col N="2011" /> dislocation caused by the indulgence in lotteries.  To tell us that our forefathers did these things, is pretty much the same as if he were to address us in favour of relaxing the duties say, upon Spanish wines, because his great-grandfather was an eight-bottle man and could survive the seven-bottle man at the dining tables of the eighteenth century.  There are other charities.  Supposing I was to propose that because University College, Dublin, is sadly in need of funds, due to a building debt imposed upon it by the iniquity of the British Treasury in dealing with it in the hard period of the war, and I were to point out what a noble charity that is, I venture to suggest, and I am not afraid of it appearing an exaggeration, that the education of the country is a far greater charity than the relief of the ailing and the sick.  If I were to propose to provide a measure for sweepstakes and lotteries to raise funds to pay off the debt on University College, and were to get a number of professors to put their names to the First Schedule of the Act, I wonder how much of his pontifical eloquence Deputy Milroy would expend in support of the measure?  He would realise, then, that it would be a curious inconsistency to set up an institution which would indoctrinate the growing youth with proper principles and, at the same time, procure the means therefor by something which, though not, perhaps, bad in itself, has notoriously the effect of bringing about evil.  Now, I do not want to appear as one of &ldquo;unco' good&rdquo; in this matter.  I am as much in favour as Deputy Milroy, of people spending their off-hours at Punchestown or Leopardstown, or any other race meeting. There is no harm in that, but, this is a very different matter.  I put a few pounds, let us say, which I had saved to buy a suit of clothes&mdash;being a sweated underpaid apprentice in some of the Dublin industries&mdash;I put this money into a sweepstake.  From that moment I am interested in seeing what are the probable runners, I am interested in finding out which horse is allotted to my ticket, I am interested in the race and in the odds and all about it and I become an ardent and diligent student of the Sporting Press.  In a little while you find me neglecting my work, and going where bets can be put on, and I will have what is called here, humorously, &ldquo;my <Col N="2012" /> little flutter.&rdquo;  And eventually, as has happened in thousands of cases, I am obliged to help myself from my employer's till.  It is not because sweepstakes are bad in themselves, or that backing horses or horse racing is bad, but it is because of the evils that come in the train of these things that they are objectionable.  Why should a man work for a miserable return if he can, by the mere purchase of a ticket, have a chance of winning £5,000.  That is the unsettlement of the public mind which is highly deleterious to public morals.  The only case that was attempted to be put up for this Bill was the case put up by Deputy Milroy.  Queen Anne is dead, there are four seasons in the year, the hospitals are in a very bad state, they want money.  He began with the obvious fact, which we do not need to be told about, and then his argument was that unless the sweepstakes were promoted by legislation in this Dáil, that no relief should be forthcoming.  Why not rob a bank?  There are banks in the country.  Why not rob them?  There are members of the Seanad who are wealthy men, as Deputy Davin told us.  Why not rob them; hold them up and make them subscribe?  That is the only way, I allege, that you can get the money readily and swiftly.  Deputy Wilson dwelt on the urgency.  Very well, I admit the urgency.  Here is an obvious way to deal with an urgent necessity. Call upon the Seanad at the point of the gun.  It is the same thing.</P>

      <P>This is not the place to come for oracular answers to questions.  I throw out one which I dogmatically assert to be a useful method. Let him show that it is not practicable <Col N="2013" /> or advisable.  According to the argument of Deputy Milroy, anything which seems to him or to the abettors of this motion to be the only way of securing the desirable end, is a straight way to be voted for in this Dáil, and is to be adopted.  He spoke of logic, but there is no logic in that.  There is no logic in his speech, there is defiance of logic, if that be logic.  We are told by some of the advocates of this measure that the strictest viligance would be exercised to secure that there would be no fraud.  I personally do not care whether the thing is conducted with the utmost purity or not, that is not the point.  I have not the slightest wish to doubt the probity, the public spirit or the charitable sentiments of the book-makers, or commission agents as they are called, who would organise this thing on behalf of the gentlemen mentioned in the Schedule. I know nothing about them, and consequently I have no reason to question their honesty or to suspect that any of the moneys would find a way into their coffers, but, to my mind, that is not the point.  The point is this: Are you, as Deputy Sears admitted, going to legalise, on the ground of being a temporary measure, something which he by putting forward the argument of being only temporary, in effect admits not to be defensible in itself.  There is a question of principle and public policy in this matter.  To me the fact that Deputy Sir James Craig is against this, outweighs the arguments of a thousand Deputy Milroys.  There is no one in the Dáil more intimately acquainted with the state of the hospitals, their needs and their value to the community, than Deputy Sir James Craig, and he will not give his vote on this occasion in support of this expedient.  Even if I were not able to think about the matter for myself, his authority would weigh with me to an enormous extent.</P>

      <P>I think there is one thing to be said which has not been touched upon so far, as to why this Bill should not be given a Second Reading here.  I think it is extremely undesirable that legislation of this nature should be put through by ordinary methods of legislation. This is not merely a private member's Bill; it is really a private Bill that is to give exemptions from the provisions of the general law to certain people. <Col N="2014" /> It gives them privileges over other people, and over everybody, and a measure of that sort should be brought in under provisions that will very soon I hope be adopted for Private Bill legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if that is so the Dáil should be extremely careful about passing legislation which would give exemption from the general law to any persons whatever.  It is extremely easy in that way to open a door which was n ver intended to be open.  There are other charities in the country as deserving as the hospitals, and as urgently in need of assistance, and if these hospitals are to be exempt from the provisions of the general law as asked it would be extremely hard to resist those other applications, and in that way, have the general law repealed bit by bit, not as the result of any considered policy, but simply as the result of inadvertence, and a certain amount of carelessness in opening the door by giving exemption to one particular institution or one particular body of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, and unless we had a very carefully thought cut measure put before this Dáil, with every safeguard and every consideration brought in that could be brought in in the case of a Private Bill, after careful examination, and by all the parties concerned having joined together and settled any differences there might be among themselves, and, having used every safeguard, and satisfied themselves in advance that everything was safe and secure, I think the Dáil should not pass it merely in the interests of these gentlemen.  If it were a general public law in the interests of the whole community, and applying to everybody, it might be right to proceed with such a Bill; but when it is a measure of privilege, to give exemption to certain individuals, unless everything is in order, and has been looked into very carefully, and put into some sort of decent shape. so that it could be passed, the Dáil should not, in the interests of a group, through Deputies who drafted the Bill, spend its time trying to make that measure somewhat <Col N="2015" /> acceptable, and, I think, a second reading should not be given to it.  If any such measure is prepared it should be prepared by people outside, and then some regular scheme should be brought up, and the Dáil should not be asked to legislate for a group of individuals, but should stand for legislation in the general interest.</P>

It is neither gambling nor sport.  It is an insult to sportsmen to call this gambling or sport.  It is not betting or sport, and when we are told that we are dealing with a sporting fraternity, I refute it.  I voted upon this measure on the First Reading, in order to give certain Deputies an opportunity of proving their consistency.  We heard about all the fabulous sums made by private individuals over a recent big sweepstake in Dublin.  We heard figures of £38,000, and we heard figures up to £95,000.  I do not know how true the one or the other is, but when people make these statements they ought to come here and prove them.  I listened to Deputy McGoldrick and Deputy Sears, and I heard them state their pious objection to gambling.  These old maids object to a decent bet.  They remind me of religious old maids.  It is all right to go to a race meeting and have a bet where a man can see what he is doing, and can get a run for his money.</P>

      <P>In the case of a sweep it is a million to one chance against you. These sweeps have been a scandal for years.  Tickets have been coming into this country from India, Switzerland and elsewhere until legislation had to be passed against it.  This is not gambling. It is a proposition put up to enable somebody to make a good thing out of it. Some particular individual thinks that he is going to make a good thing and to make it easily without any risk.  I do not think a proposition like this adds to <Col N="2016" /> the dignity of the Dáil.  I think it makes this country more of a Monte Carlo or Switzerland than anything else I can conceive.  I do not think that is fair.  I think that the proposition that Deputy Johnson put up as an alternative is not the only alternative, as a matter of fact it is not a fair proposition at all.  The people who employ persons in this country and the people who work are not the only people in this country and they are not the people with the most means. The people with the most means in this country are very often the people who employ only one servant or, perhaps, two.  I see no reason in the world, why this State should not subsidise and take charge of the whole public health of the country.  I think that is one of most pressing needs there is in the country.  I think it is a thing which ought to be tackled by the State and that it ought to be as pressing a service as any other National service in the State, perhaps one of the most pressing. For goodness sake when you are talking about this Bill do not call it sport.  It is not sport, and as a sportsman I object to it.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two points about this Bill which are not, perhaps, clear to some of the Deputies. It is suggested, and it will be done, if, as I hope, this Bill gets through this Reading, that three representatives from each province from outside Leinster be added to the present committee, these representatives to be selected by the Governing Bodies of the Public Charitable Hospitals within each province.  I think it was Deputy Johnson raised that point.  Therefore, there will be representation from outside the Metropolis.  I am not a bit perturbed, and I am not a bit more convinced now than I was when I came into the Dáil this evening.  I am quite satisfied that this is a Bill that should go through.  Some of the Deputies have seen well to make it a matter of jest, that this Bill was not drawn up perhaps as perfectly as it should have been, and when I made a few opening remarks this evening, those opening remarks seemed to be the pendulum for jests on the part of some of these Deputies, because it was <Col N="2017" /> suggested that the Medical Committee, and the colleagues working with them, were not magnificent draughtsmen of these measures.</P>

    <P>Before we finally vote on this Bill tonight, I would respectfully suggest that we be given an opportunity of overhauling the Bill, and I promise you that on the next reading it will be as watertight as possible, as far as it is possible to make a Bill of this kind watertight.  The point raised by Deputy Johnson as to the contributions by the workers and employers is an admirable one; but, I think, that the time does not admit of it&mdash;his suggestion is not practicable at the <Col N="2018" /> moment.  Under this Bill it is quite possible that on a big race in two or three months' time you may have, perhaps, thirty or forty thousand pounds or more than that, and that would be a considerable sum to the Metropolitan hospitals to go on with, not to speak of any hospitals in the country.  Then, if I am in order, I would appeal individually to the members of the Dáil to give us an opportunity of endeavouring to stop up those loopholes, and, as I remarked before, of making this Bill as watertight as it is possible to make a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That Michael Kilroy was taken prisoner near Newport on 24th November, 1922, and confined in Custume Barracks, Athlone, until about the 1st day of February, 1923, when he was removed to Mountjoy Prison, Dublin.</P>
      <P>(2)  That on the 8th February, 1923, the prisoner was handed a charge sheet, containing three charges alleged to have been incurred near Newport, on 24th November, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> (3)  That on the 9th February, 1923, the prisoner wrote to the Prison Governor, asking for facilities to prepare his defence, but that the first intimation received by the prisoner's solicitor of his desire to instruct him was given to the solicitor at 5 o'clock in the afternoon of 13th February, 1923, whereas the trial of the prisoner was fixed for and took place at 11 o'clock on 14th February, 1923.</P>
    <P>(4)  That accordingly no fair opportunity was given to the solicitor to prepare the prisoner's defence.</P>
    <P>(5)  That an application for an adjournment of the trial to enable the defence to be prepared was made on behalf of the prisoner to the Military Tribunal, and refused.</P>
    <P>(6)  That one of the preliminary objections, taken on behalf of the prisoner, to the proceedings was that the Court was convened by a person other than the Officer Commanding the area in which the offences were charged to have been committed, as required by the regulations as to the trial of civilians by Military Tribunals; that the objection was over-ruled on the ground that a special order had been made taking the case out of this regulation; that such order was not produced, and was not proved in any way; and that such an order, if made, would be <i>ultra vires</i> and void; and</P>
    <P>(7)  That all civil courts are open or capable of being held in Dublin; and whether, upon these facts, he will see the propriety of having the proceedings in question set aside and quashed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the first and second parts of the question are in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the third and fourth parts of the question:&mdash;The officer who delivered the charge sheet to the accused asked him upon doing so whether he wished to have a solicitor to defend him, and if so, to give the name of any solicitor so that facilities could be given such solicitor to interview the accused and prepare his defence.  The accused replied that he did not wish to be defended and stated that he would not recognise the court.  At the same time he mentioned the names of some military witnesses he desired to have summoned. The accused subsequently wrote two letters to the Governor of <Col N="1935" /> Mountjoy Gaol.  In one of these he asked for a copy of the regulations under which he was to be tried.  These were duly furnished him.  In neither letter did the accused ask for an interview with any counsel or solicitor nor did he give the name of any counsel or solicitor whom he wished to defend him.  It was not until the 13th February that the accused wrote a letter to Mr. Sean O h-Uadhaigh regarding his defence. This was immediately transmitted to Mr. h-Uadhaigh, as a result of which Mr. Conor Maguire, counsel for the accused, interviewed the accused at 10.20 a.m. upon the 14th February.  The delay in communicating with his legal advisers was due to the hesitation of the accused in deciding whether he would be defended or not.  It may be added that the trial of the accused was postponed from the 9th February to the 14th February, to endeavour to secure the attendance of military witnesses mentioned by the accused.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fifth part of the question: the application for an adjournment was made at the trial.  Counsel for the accused, when asked for the grounds of his application, stated that he wished to have certain witnesses present to prove an <i>alibi</i> upon the first charge.  The Legal Officer stated that he intended to direct an acquittal upon the first charge owing to lack of evidence to sustain it and an acquittal was directed.  As no sufficient grounds for granting an adjournment were stated, and in view of the facts already stated, the application was refused.  It may be added that the accused, though he might have done so, did not give evidence to deny any of the charges.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sixth part of the question: Upon the 12th February an Order was made by the Army Council providing that their previous Regulations as to Military Courts being convened by the General Officer Commanding the Command in which the offence was alleged to have been committed, should not apply to the trial of the accused, and expressly authorising the General Officer Commanding the Dublin Command to convene a Court for the trial of the accused.  Counsel objected to this Order as being <i>ultra vires</i> because it was not laid upon the Table <Col N="1936" /> of An Dáil for four days as provided by the Army Emergency Powers Resolution of An Dáil.  As this provision obviously applied only to Regulations the breach of which was triable as an offence by Military Court, the objection was over-ruled.  The Order of the Army Council was not required to be proved as the Court held that they were satisfied as to their jurisdiction and would not require the presence of the Army Council as witnesses to prove their Order.  The Court made a note of the objection so that it could be considered by the Army Council when the proceedings of the Court came before the Army Council for confirmation.  It may be added that between the time the accused was arrested and the date of his trial the Commands were reorganised, the area and character of the old Western Command in which the offences charged against the accused were alleged to have been committed being entirely altered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the seventh part of the question, I would refer to the answer given to the previous question of the Deputy for County Dublin upon the same point.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Defence whether Ald.  Thomas O'Reilly, an official of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, was arrested in Dublin on January 27th, and is still in custody; whether the Ministry of Defence has informed the above Union that Ald.  O'Reilly &ldquo;was previously in custody and was released only after signing the usual Form of Undertaking,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;he was rearrested, as some of his recent actions were inconsistent with this declaration&rdquo;; what were the &ldquo;recent actions&rdquo; referred to, and whether it is proposed to bring him to trial on a definite charge.</P>

      <P>Alderman Thomas O'Reilly was taken prisoner at the general surrender at the Four Courts on the 30th June last.  He was released on the 17th August on his signing an undertaking to the effect that he would not use arms against the Parliament elected by the Irish people or the Government for the time being responsible to that Parliament, and that he would not support in any way such action, nor would he interfere unlawfully with the property or the persons of others.</P>
      <P>In view of his having taken part with the Irregulars in the fighting at the Four Courts, his action on the 22nd January, when at the Dublin Corporation he proposed the adoption of a report recommending the payment of half pay in the case of untried employés in jail, had implications that similar action by one unconnected with the Irregulars might not have and it was clearly contrary to his undertaking not to support in any way Irregular activity and, in the opinion of the Army Authorities, warranted his re-arrest and his internment.</P>
