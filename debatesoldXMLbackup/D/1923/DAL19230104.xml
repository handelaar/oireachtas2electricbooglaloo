      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government what legislation the Government propose to introduce to increase the capitation grant to Mental Hospitals; whether he is aware that during the British regime strong representations were made by conferences of the Governors of these institutions to secure increases in the grants which were fixed at a time when the cost of upkeep was considerably lower, and, even then, the grants were entirely inadequate; whether he is aware that most of the institutions referred to are at present in a serious financial position, and whether the Government propose immediately to do something to relieve the position of these very necessary and humane institutions?</P>

      <P>The rate of the capitation grant to Mental Hospitals is relevant to a future revised basis of allocation of grants in aid of Local Taxation which will become necessary by reason of reforms in local administration, and the position of the Mental Hospitals will receive careful consideration.</P>
      <P>I am informed that representations were frequently made to the British Authorities urging the inadequacy of the capitation grant.  The financial position of some of the mental hospitals is undoubtedly serious.  This arises mainly from non-payment of rates, a cause which, it is hoped, will shortly be removed by the steps to be taken against the defaulting ratepayers.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether <Col N="486" /> he is aware that in many districts local public bodies have superannuated comparatively young officials, physically and otherwise fit for many years more of useful public service, and appointed new officials in their place, thus creating a double set of officials, and, consequently, adding unnecessarily to the burden which the taxpayers are called upon to pay; whether the Minister recognises that this practice is an abuse of the system of awarding pensions, and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to check this abuse?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the second stage of this Amnesty Bill we expect the Dáil will agree that it is not so much the terms of an Act of Parliament in a case such as this, but rather the meaning we attach to a proposal of this sort, which really matters.  This Act is for the purpose of indemnifying persons who supported the British Government for the last few years, by carrying out orders, or being in any way responsible for acts, which would be or might be the subject of legal proceedings. The terms of the proclamation of the late Commander-in-Chief were a little bit wider than what was proposed in the Act.  It was the spirit of the proclamation that he wished to see carried out in asking every citizen to assist and support the underlying principle that was embodied in a proclamation of that sort.  This is a cold, legal, formal Amnesty Bill, and it is in that spirit that it is put forward.  It simply insures persons who have been engaged on the British side for the last few years against actions at law for acts which may have been done.  I am glad to be able to announce the release of the Connaught Rangers, which is agreed to be a further proof of the British Government's desire to efface bitter memories of the recent trouble.  The difficulties in the way of a complete amnesty were known, having regard to the way with which the case was viewed from the severe standpoint of the British Army, and in ordering the <Col N="488" /> release of those prisoners the British Government gave proof that it has acted in the spirit of goodwill towards us and towards the Irish people everywhere. We are now carrying out our own side of the contract, and in that spirit I put it to the Dáil and formally move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>While offering no particular objection to the principles of the Bill, and not much objection, perhaps, to the details, and while saying we are all very glad to hear of the release of the Connaught Rangers, I would be glad if the President would be able to say whether there is any likelihood of some other prisoners still in British custody being released.  I think, if my recollection is right, that Dowling who landed on the coast of Clare in 1918, about the Conscription period, is still in prison.  In addition to that&mdash;I do not know whether anything could be done at the moment&mdash;but I would like an assurance that the Government is not passing the matter over without consideration, the fact that a number, not a very large number of prisoners, citizens of the Free State are in the custody of the Belfast Government.  There are one or two&mdash; one at all events to my own knowledge, who is undergoing a very long sentence of penal servitude altogether out of proportion to the offence, if there was any offence committed, and I should like an assurance from the President that these cases will be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one small point, or two, perhaps&mdash; the first is really a Committee point which I will raise later.  The question I would like to raise now, is in regard to a particular class of cases which were ruled out of the compensation claims, and of which there are a very large number of instances.  These were cases of theft&mdash; commandeering without authority of motor cars, and the taking of goods out of shops, not coming under the title of official looting, but known to everybody in the neighbourhood as looting.  I understand that there is no claim against any fund whatever in regard to these cases, although it is known quite well that the culprits were servants under the British Crown at the time.  It seems to me if we pass this Bill in this form we cut off any chance of relief to those who <Col N="489" /> suffered this loss, and we are exonerating crime.  These acts, no doubt, were not accepted as being committed by servants of the British Crown in Ireland, and by passing this Bill in this form we are exonerating those people, who happen to have been British servants, and the claim that I am putting forward is that if there is going to be a general amnesty against all persons who happen to have been British servants, there ought to be some way of compensating those who suffered from thefts committed by those people, and where the case is clearly provable to the ordinary citizen, although perhaps not legally provable against any individual, I hope that a way will be found to compensate in some fashion or other those who suffered.  The class of case I am referring to is that in which claims for damages, when put forward in the courts, have been ruled out as mere larceny, but larceny that is known in a general way to be attributable to men who were then servants of the British Crown, but to whom individual guilt could not be applied.  I think there ought to be some way found for compensating the sufferers to some degree, at any rate, in such cases.</P>

      <P>While not in any way objecting to the general spirit of this Bill, but arising out of the announcement which the President made, which we were all very glad to hear, I think that Deputy Cathal O'Shannon has rendered service in drawing the attention to one or two outstanding cases which ought to be emphasised at this stage.  He referred to the case of Dowling. Those of us who had occasion to remember Dowling's landing in Clare know that he did at that time stand his ground as a man and should not be forgotten, and, I hope, will not be forgotten. I remember when the late Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence McSwiney, was in jail at Brixton, one of the visitors to him told me that she had heard there were some other Irish prisoners who had been taken in connection with the Rising in 1916, and who were still there, and that these cases had passed altogether from attention. I think it is quite possible there may be a number of cases of that kind, where very considerable hardship may have occurred not through neglect on this side, but inevitably from oversight. I think, probably, there are a number of persons in this country who could give <Col N="490" /> information in regard to such odd cases. I do know with regard to two of them that Deputy Gavan Duffy had been interesting himself when in London in 1917.  I am afraid there may be a large number of cases dating right back to 1916, of men who may be obscure, but who did service for their country, or were suspected of having done service for their country, and whose cases have been overlooked altogether.  I think some method ought to be adopted by which the possibility of such cases could be searched out, and I am perfectly sure the President will give them his attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right to ease immediately the minds of Deputies and remove any impression that Deputy Figgis's statement may have created.  There are no cases of obscure men languishing in English jails, and forgotten by the Irish Government.  Most exhaustive enquiries have been made and the British Home Office put at the disposal of our representatives a complete list of the prisoners in the various jails, and when the first preliminary amnesty took place we had every opportunity of going through such lists of prisoners and of the names of those whom we definitely claimed as being political prisoners.  There were certain exceptions. There were the Connaught Rangers, and there was the man Dowling from Maryborough, who landed on Clare Island in 1917 or 1918.  There was a sailor named Mara from Bagnalstown, and there were three men in Scotland whose cases were considered doubtful, at the time, by the British authorities, and were ruled out. The Connaughts and Dowling were a class to themselves, inasmuch as they were in under separate military jurisdiction, and I take it that the Army people in England were jealous of that separate military jurisdiction, and were anxious to establish the principle that political amnesty did not, and could not, be held to cover cases of that kind. Now, we hold no brief for that particular point of view.  Since the Provisional Government was set up we have pressed the cases of all these prisoners by every means at our disposal, by correspondence and personal interviews, and on all possible and even impossible occasions.  Now, as to the Connaught Rangers, the most that we succeeded in doing in regard to <Col N="491" /> them was in getting very considerable reductions in their sentences, which involved the release of some thirty or forty of them, and now the complete release is given.  I cannot believe that either the British Government or the British military authorities, having swallowed what must have seemed to them the camel&mdash;the release of the Connaught Rangers&mdash;will strain at what is comparatively the gnat &mdash; release of this poor man who has served his four or five years' imprisonment and whose offence, as of course from their particular angle it was an offence, arose from the circumstances of the struggle of the last four or five years which is now officially closed.  The sailor, Bernard Mara, was, of course, a sailor in the British Navy, from H.M.S.  &ldquo;Resolution,&rdquo; I think.  He was home on leave and he attempted to use an influence which he imagined he possessed with a soldier to induce him to sell his arms to the local I.R.A.  He did not succeed and the soldier informed on him and he was tried by courtmartial and sentenced.  Certainly that does not seem a case so grave that they would have grounds for claiming that it did not come within the circle of general amnesty.  I am sure that the release of both Mara and Dowling and the three men in Scotland whose cases were considered doubtful, but which have since been inquired into, will rapidly follow on the release of the Connaughts. There is no case, there could not be a case, so obscure that our investigations could have failed to reach it, and they were those only too anxious to place all possible information at our disposal and to throw open lists for investigation and say, &ldquo;There are the lists, go through them, call in the Irish representatives in England and search out the men you claim as political prisoners.&rdquo;  I am certainly prepared to state in the most emphatic way that there could not be any such cases as Deputy Figgis has mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wm. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say one word to express the satisfaction at the release of the Connaught Rangers. I think there is no act that the English have done for the last twelve months, to my mind, which indicates more their change of mind and change of attitude towards this country.  I think their case <Col N="492" /> was particularly difficult to the British Government.  They released the prisoners they had in the convict prisons in England immediately after the Treaty was signed, but in regard to the Connaught Rangers they were in a very difficult position.  These men were out in India and had sworn allegiance to England when they joined up, and they not alone fought against England, but they broke that pledge, so that the English could have charged them with a double offence.  Therefore, I think their release is a token of a very good spirit and I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill on that account.  Their release will be received with great pleasure in Connaught and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put an aspect of the case which has, perhaps, been lost sight of in this discussion.  If my estimate be correct, the officers and men in the service of the British Government had a larger number of casualties, and sustained a larger number of deaths in the struggle than was sustained on our side, and they held a very much larger number of prisoners on their side than we held.  In the case of prisoners whom they held, scarcely any parallel would exist as far as our side is concerned, but I think disciplinary action taken against a prisoner charged in the same way as the Connaught Rangers were, or the persons mentioned by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon would be much severer on our side, so from their point of view, having regard to the circumstances which they must consider, the act as far as they are concerned is a gracious act.  This Bill that we put forward is in effect what Deputies have urged us to secure for the Connaught Rangers and others like them, and it would be unfortunate if we would not now consent on our side to give what we ask in these cases.  What is asked in the Bill is a free pardon and freedom from legal proceedings of persons who were engaged, or who assisted the British in the struggle that has gone on for the last few years.  As to the case mentioned by Deputy Johnson, it is not the case that we ask for amnesty for persons who have been guilty of criminal acts. That is to say it is the legal side, in which the individual himself would be made responsible for an action at law, rather than a criminal proceeding, and nothing is given away in this Amnesty Act which deprives a person of rights he <Col N="493" /> had before this Act was passed.  In other words, if a man suffered loss of property, and I am sure many members perhaps on all sides of the Dáil did suffer something, their rights are not interfered with by this Amnesty Bill.  We are not removing from them any opportunity they would have of securing compensation or money for the loss so sustained, and any person guilty of criminal acts, if there were any criminal acts committed, is not given an absolution by the passing of this Amnesty Bill.  A Deputy asked me if those engaged in the diabolical attempt to remove a certain portion of the anatomy of a particular member of this Dáil would be included in the Amnesty.  I do not think they would.  This is a point I would like to draw the particular attention of the Deputies to.  In this Amnesty Bill we are asking the Dáil to do a generous act towards those who were recently engaged in the struggle on the other side.</P>
      <P>Motion made, and question put:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Amnesty (British Military) Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The last day I was supporting Deputy Johnson's amendment in so far as it expressed disagreement with the fact that the Governor-General's Speech did not lay down a policy for dealing with the evils of widespread unemployment.  Now, a good many speeches were made on that particular day, and many Deputies here, I am sure, think that unemployment is not a thing that should get too much stress. On the day previous to the adjournment of the debate Mr. Bonar Law, at a meeting of the National Unionist Association in London, talking about unemployment, stated that it was a terrible problem, and he said that there were losses due to unemployment, not merely the losses of spending money that should be taken into consideration when dealing with it, but that they should take into consideration the fact that there would be a great loss for the nation at large, as the result of workmen losing the habit of work.  He went on to state that any Government should do its very best to deal with this question; that there were certain proposals that had been made in the House of Commons, but that they were not the last word.  Now, I would like Deputies here to consider the fact, prior to the last election in England, that Mr. Bonar Law stated definitely that he had no policy at all for dealing with the unemployment problem and since then he has come to the conclusion, as a result of pressure being brought to bear on him from various sources, that it is such an awful thing that they must do their very best, at whatever cost, to try and relieve it. Speaking on the last occasion I was giving a quotation from a paper called &ldquo;Business Organization and Management,&rdquo;<Col N="496" /> where a well-known business man in England, who is Chairman of Lowther and Chairman of the Nitrate Produce Company, was dealing with unemployment, and he appeared to think, and tried to make everyone else believe, that the unemployment problem was incapable of solution.  Now, it is a very sorry state of affairs to think that business men, who claim to possess practically, if not all, of the best brains of the community should make such a statement as that.  He told us about unemployment in England, and, as I said before, stated that much of the present unemployment was unavoidable, and more of it was due to the Labour policy, through inefficiency on the part of the workers, and through the regrettable ignorance amongst the British workers.  He also mentioned that the tragedy of Russia appeared to be without meaning to the workers; that manufacturers, shipowners and traders generally are alive to the fact that after war, living conditions must be on a lower scale than in pre-war days.  He contended from that, as some of the Deputies in this Dáil did on the last occasion, that the only real remedy for the relief of unemployment was the wholesale reduction of the wages of the working classes in Great Britain.  Now, I think myself that it is an awful thing to consider that a prominent business man, or any business man, whether prominent or not, should make a statement to the effect that living conditions must necessarily be on a lower scale now than they were in 1913 and the years previous.  In view of the fact that it was stated at the Food Prices Commission here recently that in Britain at any rate&mdash;this, I admit, does not apply to Ireland, because Ireland is not an industrial country in the same sense as Britain&mdash;that the productive ability of the workers as a whole had increased by 50 per cent.  It is rather a peculiar thing that with added methods of producing the necessaries of life, improved machinery and the like, that the effective productivity of the workers has increased 50 per cent., but at the same time they must accept a lower standard of living.  He went on also to state that no artificial standard of living, however desirable in itself, can withstand the remorseless pressure of foreign competition, and he pointed out, of course, that in America they were able to adapt <Col N="497" /> themselves to the changed conditions owing to the fact that the workers in America were willing to work harder&mdash; Deputy Gorey gave us as an instance that of the building trade workers&mdash;were able to do considerably more than the workers in this country and to work for less wages, and as a result of that they captured the trade in the Far East that was formerly catered for by Great Britain. Now, any individual like myself, or any ordinary working-man, finds it peculiar when he reads statements like that and he is apt to think that in the event of the American workers, by working harder, having less wages, and working more up-to-date methods, even if they had not used these methods and had not been able to capture the trade from Britain, that there would be unemployment in America to the extent of the unemployment in Great Britain due to Britain being able to keep the Far Eastern trade. We are led to believe that that remedy, so called, which is suggested to be put into operation in one country or one part of one country only means that for the amount of employment given there under present conditions there must be unemployment in some other parts of the country.  As that applies between Great Britain and America and between one country and another, so it applies between different parts of the one country. I am inclined to think that even if we accepted that statement made regarding a reduction of wages and got an increased output, even if you got that increased output by the workers working for nothing, as they may be asked to do one of these days, it would only mean that there would be considerably more unemployment in another part of the country, as a result, and certainly I think it is not any remedy at all.  Now he has generally followed Deputy Gorey's and other Deputies' lines, and suggested that there must be wholesale reduction of wages; and he accused bodies of workers, like Deputy Gorey did the railway workers, of profiteering scandalously at the expense of other workers.  Now I would like to mention very briefly the reason I have quoted him as saying that the workers in Britain do not appear to understand the tragedy of Russia.  About two or three months ago in this Dáil there was some discussion on unemployment, <Col N="498" /> and one Deputy in a passing remark pointed out Russia as an example of irregularism gone mad.  Now we claim that it is a great pity that the masses in this country and in Britain do not appear to understand what is happening in Russia.  I will not go so far as to call the tragedy in Russia as irregularism gone mad, as described in this Dáil.  Actually Russia is in her present plight, not because of the actions of the Soviet Government and the people there who tried the problem of making ends meet for the people as a whole and not for the favoured few or classes, as the railway shareholders mentioned yesterday, and the Soviet Government, which represents the majority of the people of the country, but because of the actions of the counter revolutionaries, Dennikin, Koltchak and others, helped by Britain, America and other countries.  For instance, Great Britain gave over one hundred millions to help to overthrow the Soviet Government, while twenty millions of people, owing to natural causes, were starving in Russia, while in the United States and South America millions of bushels of wheat were being burned as fuel for locomotives.  Now, irregularism gone mad is what Russia has been described as, but the Soviet Government were in the same position as the present Government is here and the people who were attacking the Soviet Government were in the very same position as the people who are attacking the soldiers of the present Government in Ireland.  It is rather a peculiar thing to think that the Deputy who opposed the rule of majority in Ireland, and denounced all those who use force against those who are sent to uphold the rule of the majority, should make a <i>volte face</i>, so to speak, and uphold the rules of the minority in Russia when it is backed up by the militarists of other countries&mdash;such as America and Great Britain.  Now, another reason&mdash;and I would like this to sink into the minds of the Deputies here&mdash;why there was a lot of unemployment and chaos in Russia, is because a number of the Governments refused to trade with Russia, and because they thought that if Russia was allowed to go on progressing she might become a headline for the peoples of other countries, with the inevitable result that the people who were living on the rent and interest and profits <Col N="499" /> in these other countries would have to go down to the superior forces of the proletariat in these countries when they saw what had happened in Russia.  Consequently in Britain they were willing to allow a lot of unemployment, because they refused to trade with Russia in order to stave off the demands of social revolution in Britain.  Now, the workers in Britain&mdash;and some, of course, in Ireland might have benefited from it&mdash;could have been working all the time in supplying engineering goods for Russia, and up-to-date farming necessities, but the British capitalists could not see any sense in doing that.  I saw in a paper during the last week that the firm of Krupp, in Germany, found that they are likely to make something by trading with Russia, with the result that for 36 years they have leased 25,000 acres from the Russian Government, and intend to send the most up-to-date machinery from their factories in Germany in order to get what they possibly can out of that 25,000 acres in Russia.  Now, Deputy Gorey, and why I refer to Deputy Gorey so often is not that I have any disregard for him, but he is the only Farming member present who discussed the question, as Deputy O'Shannon said, with an intelligence that would entitle him to sit on our Benches.  Deputy Gorey made a statement regarding unemployment and he gave as one instance the cost of the building of houses and he stated that houses were dear because of the small output of the building tradesmen, and he particularly mentioned bricklayers in this country, and he stated that because of houses being dear owing to this building cost and as a result of this people who might be induced to build had no encouragement to build houses; consequently there is unemployment in the building trade.  He gave us some instances in proof of these assertions, he told us that the Irish bricklayers lay two hundred and forty bricks in the day, English bricklayers 1,200, and the American bricklayers some thousands a day.  That statement has been trotted out so often that it has become old.  Mr. Lloyd George on some occasions since the end of the European War made similar charges against English bricklayers and gave it as a reason for the reduction in building operations in recent years and he compared the <Col N="500" /> English bricklayers with the German and Belgian workers.  He pointed out that the Belgian workers did considerably more work than the building tradesmen in England and that consequently there was comparatively no shortage of houses in Belgium, Germany, and other places. I would not be a bit surprised if I were in New York or Chicago and picked up some one of those business journals there issued by the American building trades to find that the Americans were comparing their building workers perhaps with the Irish and the Co. Kilkenny to the detriment of the American worker.</P>

      <P>That is the usual thing that goes on all over the world.  For the honour of the Dublin tradesman I would like to state I was speaking to a building contractor in Dublin a month ago.  I met him accidentally and I had occasion to inquire of him how the men in his particular employment were going on and his words were that they were magnificent, that they were doing as much as they did in pre-war days. There may have been some slackness during the war in this country and in England.  There is a certain reason for that.  When we consider that the building contractors got a percentage on what they expended, and that the man who would expend £2,000 would get twice as much profit as the man who expended only £1,000, we can understand that naturally he wanted to get as little work as possible done by the men.  It was up to the building contractors in Great Britain and Ireland when they were doing Government jobs to reduce the output of work.  It was the greed of the building contractors in Great Britain and Ireland who were doing Government jobs, when there was no limit to the amount of money available, that did reduce the output of work. But when they had contract work the builders' men in this country never get an opportunity of slacking.  I know that myself, because I worked for twelve years for building contractors in this country and across the water.  Mr. Gorey also mentioned about the rights of the State as against the rights of the workers.  I would like to remind Deputy Gorey and every other Deputy that the workers' rights are greater than the rights of the State by virtue of the fact <Col N="501" /> that the people are older than the State. Man is older than the State.  Man himself or a combination of men established the State and they established it for their own benefit and they used the State in a sense in certain directions for their own benefit throughout the ages. If at any time man collectively decides to get better conditions by changing his attitude towards the State, he is perfectly entitled to do so.  If he finds that by using the State in one direction he gets a certain return and if he finds at the end of a certain time that the pendulum is against him and he is not getting as good value as formerly, then he is perfectly justified in deciding to act against the State in any way he pleases. Deputy Gorey speaks as if the State were above us all.  The State is not above us all.  It is made by men in general, it is supported by men and it could be smashed by men whenever they find they can gain more by smashing it than by keeping it in existence.  The people of Ireland would be perfectly justified in smashing it when they think it desirable to do so.  In the meantime I think they are perfectly justified in using it in any way they like.  In the past the State was under control of a comparatively small class in the community. This small class used all the appurtenances of the State, the Police and the Army, for their own benefit as against the interests of the common people. The common people are now coming into their own.  One day they are going to reverse the whole order of things and they are going to use the State for their own benefit, that is for the benefit of the people at large, so as to give the right to live while the right to live is in the country.  They could do this by distributing the surplus foodstuffs in the country to persons who are at present without food and to whom the employing class in the country refuse the right to work and consequently the right to earn wages.  Now, this unemployment problem, as the Minister of Industry and Commerce said a while ago, is not a new problem.  It is not a problem that has existed only since the war or during the past three or four years in Ireland.  It existed all the time continually for the last few hundred years in Great Britain and Ireland.  There are many ideas as to the method of solving the unemployment problem.  Personally, <Col N="502" /> I myself do not think it is quite so necessary to look for work as to look for the right to live and I would be quite willing to waive on behalf of the people out of work at present in Ireland the demand for work if I thought they would be granted the right to live without working. If you look at it that way, and consider it carefully you will find that it is not such a big problem as it looks.  I am rather amazed to think that in 1923 there are more than enough of the necessaries of life in any particular country&mdash;in fact they are being dumped into the sea, and millions and millions of bushels of wheat are being burned for fuel for railway engines in South America for the last couple of years, simply because the employing classes there could not see their way to make a profit by shipping that stuff to Russia where there are millions starving. I am rather surprised that anyone should insist that a man should work in order to get the right to purchase foodstuffs while the foodstuffs are in such super-abundance that many of them are rotting.  I was reading recently in an English paper that farmers who would not dispose of their cabbages because of the small prices offered, actually dug them into the ground for manure.  I think that is a shame, and it speaks ill for the intelligence of those who are in power that they would allow men to starve in the country when such things could happen.  I was reading recently a book on unemployment by a gentleman named Kitson.  I mention the book because Mr. Kitson states definitely in the preface that he is a business man who is not in favour of the extremist in the labour movement.  He states he wants to stave off social revolution in Britain, and wants to conserve the property and property rights of property owners who at present exist in Britain.  At the same time he puts forward certain remedies for dealing with unemployment, and he does so solely to enable the people of the country to live decently in the country without being at the mercy of the Bolsheviks and Communists who attempt to stir up bloody revolution.  He was at a dinner party in London in February, 1920, and there were seven other gentlemen present.  They came to discuss the question of unemployment.  They were financiers and merchants.  One, a merchant, said unemployment and trade <Col N="503" /> depression were the result of natural laws, and had occurred every ten or twelve years for over 100 years and were unavoidable.  Another said that such conditions were the result of war and were inevitable.  A third said they were due to currency inflation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is as good for me to give the views of a gentleman who has studied the question of unemployment as it is for Deputy Gorey to say that unemployment is due to the high rate of wages the workers are getting and the small output they are giving in return.  Another gentleman, a financier, said it was due to currency inflation and paper money.  Yet another said it was due to the unreasonable demands of labour in regard to wages. Another claimed free and unrestricted trade was the only remedy.  Mr. Kitson disagreed with all those gentlemen, and he gave his views on the matter.  The result was that he was challenged to produce a remedy for unemployment.  I hold no brief for Mr. Kitson.  I do not believe in a lot of his premises.  In the first case, if a prominent business man comes forward and suggests a remedy for unemployment and gives as his reason the fact that he wants the present system to continue and to stave off social revolution, any Government that is anxious to attempt to solve the problem should certainly give some consideration to any claims that he would put forward.  I could put forward certain views which perhaps would be called socialistic or communistic.  I do not intend to do so because they would have absolutely no effect.  I am not going to try the impossible and to try to convert the Deputies and the Government here in the direction of socialistic views.  But if views are expressed by a well-known business man who states definitely that his only object is to get something to do away with unemployment and to stave off social revolution, then those views should be seriously considered by the members of any Government who want <Col N="504" /> to do the right thing by the people of the country whom they are supposed to govern.  He stated definitely he was no socialist and merely wanted to preserve the present system.  This gentleman gave certain remedies.  He based his whole theory on the system known as social credit, and gave quotations from a book written by Major Douglas, an ex-Flying Corps Officer, who claimed that he had found the real remedy.  He also stated definitely that no good orthodox economist would sanction methods that would solve the problem.  Briefly, what he actually aimed at was that it was not so much necessary to improve production, but that you wanted to improve distribution of the necessaries of life that had already been and were being produced.  He insisted it was necessary to give the people of the country an opportunity of buying the goods that had already been produced, and it was necessary to do that before you could give an encouragement to the producers to continue to produce more. He stated definitely, and this is a point I would like to make plain, that reductions of wages tended to have the very reverse effect to that which was claimed for them&mdash;that it would be far better to increase wages if one wanted to solve, or wanted to help to solve, in a small way the unemployment problem, than to reduce wages.  He said that you want to make the power to purchase of the people generally greater than it was at present in order to use up all the goods that have been produced in abundance. Deputy Gorey and Deputy Wilson stated time and time again, and other members of the Farmers' Union, told me personally at conferences in the past few years that they had more farm produce than they could get rid of.  Is it not reasonable to expect where there are so many people even who are at work in this country, but who have not sufficient wages to enable them to buy the necessaries of life that if they had more money they would be able to purchase more with the result that there may not be any surplus produce? That is the gist of Kitson's claim, that there should be a better opportunity for distributing the necessaries of life than there is at present.  I think myself the unemployment problem is a very simple one.  I think that man only works &mdash;in fact I am sure of it&mdash;in order to live. If you give a man the right to live without <Col N="505" /> working he can very easily do without work, because work in a good many cases is not a very desirable thing at all.</P>

      <P>When you consider that the University educated people want to get more leisure in order to do things that are outside the usual scope of ordinary work, then we must realise that work in itself may not be a very desirable thing&mdash;that slavery may not be a very desirable thing&mdash;and that a man should not be despised for wanting to dodge work.  If the Government take the matter in hands it is quite possible to do away with quite a lot of unemployment in this country.  There are brick-fields at present completely shut up.  Now, in the very near future when there will be some kind of military peace in the country you will have a great need for building houses.  In the meantime, I think it would be quite possible, and very desirable, that these brick fields should be used for the purpose of preparing bricks in order to have them ready when the people would be ready to build houses.  There are practically all the means for building houses in Ireland at the present time except timber which would have to be imported.  There are quarries, sand pits and other things which might be used to provide employment for men on State credits if necessary, and it would help to get rid of what Bonar Law described as the demoralisation of doing nothing and the fear that they might lose the ability to work.  By this means the desire for work could be kept up and the Government would be doing a good thing for itself and the country.  Farming also could be encouraged.  Deputy Gorey and other farmers here ought to be able to make farming pay.  I know myself that there are very many men in this country who would be quite glad of the opportunity of working a small patch of land in order to produce the necessaries of life for themselves, and I think that the Government should take that matter in hands as soon as possible.  Of course I understand an Agricultural Commission <Col N="506" /> has been established and is about to sit on either Tuesday or Wednesday next, but we should not wait until we get the reports from the Agricultural or other Commissions.  We should start immediately. There is plenty of land in this country idle at the present time, and there are plenty of men idle also who could work the land, and who would be quite willing to do so if the farmers or other employers could not give them work.  They would be quite willing to devote their energies to producing food stuffs for themselves and their families out of the land that in many cases is lying waste at the present time.  These&mdash; perhaps vaguely and imperfectly put&mdash; are some of the reasons why I support the amendment of Deputy Johnson, and I hope the Government will give more consideration to the question of unemployment. I hope that they will not merely set up a Commission to deal with the matter, but that in the meantime they will avail themselves of any opportunity, however small, to help to solve the question even in isolated instances.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to endeavour to follow Deputy Nagle, and I have an idea that if I tried I would probably get lost in the bye-roads.  I am not a profound economist.  I can make that admission now.  I could not make it when I was Minister for Economic Affairs.  When I pass out from the Home Affairs Ministry I shall have equally interesting revelations to make.  I have tried to look the big human fact of unemployment that is so rife in this country in the eye, and I have tried, according to my own lights or twilights, to see the remedy.  One thing that I feel here when an amendment of this kind is put up &mdash; I do not suppose it is specially devised to do that&mdash;is that it has the effect of placing this Government as if it were a Government of a class, a Government of a section, and as if it had as its primary consideration the interests of a class or <Col N="507" /> section.  Now, that is not accurate.  Individually or collectively we have no brief for a section of the citizens of this country, and one would say, perhaps, sizing us up, that from our antecedents and traditions our sympathies would not lie with the upper rather than the under dog.  &ldquo;The people existed before the State,&rdquo; said Deputy Nagle.  Undoubtedly. And casting back and trying to form a picture of the state of affairs that must have existed when people existed without a State, we will suppose that it was from necessity that they formed a State, that it was because they realised that if there was to be peace and order and prosperity they must organise themselves, so that matters would not be settled by the stone axe.  That is all that matters, because it shows a lack of a sense of proportion to settle all quarrels with a stone axe.  You have no reserve left for a really big thing.  You can only use the stone axe again, and it probably became monotonous, and it was certainly wasteful in human life and in human energy and in human happiness.  So gradually, I suppose, and after a very bitter experience, and a rather rough time of it, man threw away his stone axe and formed a State that he might govern himself, and that he might organise his life, and that things would be no longer settled by the strongest arm, and that the internal quarrels of man with man would be settled on some peaceable basis and principle rather than by recourse to violence. That, of course, is a mere surmise. We can only surmise about the beginning of ordered society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming nearer home, and facing our own situation to-day, the prime necessity to meet the unemployment question &mdash; and the sooner we all face it the better &mdash; is order in the country and the cessation of outrage in the country, and of the man or the combination of men that cut the roads and the railways of the country, it is scarcely a figure of speech to say that they are cutting the throat of the country, and it is scarcely a figure of speech to say that they are cutting the throats of the poor people in the country, and the throats of the manual workers in the country.  If reason could prevail with the people who are doing that, they would have stopped it long ago.  Reason has failed to prevail, and so the people who have a mandate <Col N="508" />&mdash; whatever their qualifications and whatever their limitations are &mdash; the people who have a mandate to preserve this country, and to preserve the lives of its inhabitants, and to give them scope and opportunity for ordered development, have had to resort to force to stop deeds of that kind, to stop the warfare on the country and on the resources of the country and on the material wealth of the country.  And we were ill-fitted at the commencement to face a situation of that kind.  Of course the improvement has been gradual and painful.  We are getting forward towards our objective and that prime necessity of peace and order in the country seems in sight. Now this country is at once undeveloped and under-populated, and I do not see how with the country at once undeveloped and under-populated there could be a serious unemployment question, if a native administration got under way. I do not see it.  You have in this country a population of little over four millions, where there was once more than double that population, and it is capable of bearing a population of probably five times that.  Now there ought not to be in this country an unemployment question.  I do not believe for one moment that if a native administration responsible to the people got a chance there would be an unemployment question.  I do not believe that if a Government spending the revenues of the country in the country &mdash;a situation we have not had here for many a long year &mdash; were under way that there could be a serious, critical unemployment question.  The State exists for the people, and that is the mistake that is being made in this country now. Men are acting and advocating that the people exist for the State, and that to secure one particular form of State, one particular kind of machinery rather than another kind of machinery, the people must be sacrificed.  &ldquo;This generation,&rdquo; said one Deputy, &ldquo;must all perish, and the next generation will do great things,&rdquo; and the reply of the late Arthur Griffith to that was &ldquo;That is not good statesmanship, that is not sane leadership, that is not even good biology,&rdquo; and it is not sane leadership and it is not good politics and it is not nationality and not humanity to say that people exist to be slaughtered for one particular kind of machinery rather than another kind of <Col N="509" /> machinery.  The essence and basis of struggle against the British was to put them and their administration out of the country in order that, that administration being really out, the interests of the citizens of this country might have an opportunity to function.  It is due to lack of clear thought; it is because people are not getting down to the fundamental things, down to the kernel of the problem, down to the reason of the things said, that we have a situation like this in Ireland to-day.  The people do not exist for the State or to be slaughtered for one particular kind of State rather than another.  If the State, such as it is, that has been achieved is good enough for the people, that is the thing that matters.  Even if it is not good enough for the people it is the right of the people to say whether it is so bad that they will squander their blood and their fortunes to obtain a better.  I am not a profound economist, and I could not follow Deputy Nagle and some others who spoke from those benches opposite. Neither have I the intention of talking the clap-trap of reaction, but I simply ask that there be reasonable appreciation of the difficulties we have had in getting under way.  I would ask, too, that people realise that a big change has come; that you have now a country in which all the revenue collected will be spent in the place of collection; that you have an administration here responsible through representatives to the people and that that administration, taking it at the very least, is likely to be more than beneficent and more benevolent in the real sense than any administration we have had in this country for many and many a decade.  What is wanted is peace &mdash; real peace and real order &mdash; and when I talk of order I do not only mean the cessation of bank robberies or the burning of babies or the cessation of bombing or sniping.  I mean the orderly outlook when the people will realise that the State exists for the benefit of all, and that if a particular law is unsuited there is in the hands of the people the means of altering it, but there must be a normal orderly outlook if the normal orderly life of the country is to go on.  When there is order, when there is peace, then there will be undoubtedly enterprise.  Then there will be undoubtedly development, but <Col N="510" /> there can be no development, and there can be no enterprise, where there is no order and no security.  And on this question of security, without wishing to be in any way aggressive or truculent or even controversial.  I would ask whether organised labour, as such, is creating or helping to create security, and I do not even refer to the fact that there are, as Deputy Shannon has said, &ldquo;black sheep,&rdquo; or people who are definitely siding with the Irregulars in the conflict, and I am not referring directly to the physical conflict at the moment, but I am referring to their own propaganda and literature.  A man will not sow unless he has reasonable prospect of reaping. It is only natural to expect that, and a man will not put money into a commercial enterprise unless he has a reasonable prospect of getting his return. It is not natural to expect him.  We came near mental touch when Deputy Nagle said the incentive of work is the individual interest.  Men do not work from broad philanthropic motives; they work for their own ultimate good, and perhaps that of their own immediate kin.  Men do not go out into business enterprises from any other motives than the motives of the man who works, and the farmer does not break up his lea land and sow his corn and other crops unless he expects to derive benefit from it, and so you get to the kernel of the thing, that lack of security kills enterprise, kills development, creates an unhealthy atmosphere in which development and enterprise die, and then you have unemployment. Now, I occasionally read a Labour journal, not regularly, but occasionally, and one particular journal strikes me from week to week as calculated to create anything but an atmosphere of security.  Personally if I were in the farming line, and if in the early Spring I was laying my plans for the year, and if it were a question whether I would break a particular field of lea ground or not, and if that journal were to fall into my hands occasionally and if I took from it the general tone and outlook of organised labour in the country, I would reflect very seriously about whether I would break the field, because I would consider it was questionable whether I would reap what I sowed or not, whether I would have a disastrous strike that would leave my produce <Col N="511" /> caught by the weather, and if not caught by the weather, and if I had cut it in safety and got it into stocks, whether there might not be some disastrous spontaneous combustion that would leave things equally bad.  I prefaced my remarks by stating that I had not been a close student of social theories and am more or less groping for light on the whole question.  I repeat that now, and I have probably given evidence of it in the course of my remarks, but it does seem to me we must have a more orderly outlook, a more kindly feeling amongst all ranks before you will have the security that will make for enterprise &mdash; that enterprise that will once and for all end unemployment.</P>

      <P>It is with extreme reluctance that I join in this debate.  At the same time, I feel unwilling to give a silent vote.  My reluctance is partly due to a natural distaste for speech-making; but in a large measure it is due to disinclination to take part in any discussion upon this address, because of the character of the ritual to which it belongs.  I made &mdash; no doubt unnoticed&mdash;an individual protest against that ritual by not attending here upon the occasion on which it was put into practice.  I accept, of course, as I repeatedly declared here, all that is rationally incident to the Treaty, the natural and inevitable consequence of it, but I object to the title of Governor-General, as much as I dislike the institution.  We must perforce accept the institution under some title, but, as was pointed out, it was not necessary to join the tradition of the British Houses of Parliament with such fidelity, or to travel in the ruts traversed by other Governments, so as to make it inevitable for us to have the actual presence here of the representative of the Crown, and to be obliged to hear the programme of legislation of our Ministry uttered through his voice, and not through that of the President of the Dáil. But my greatest and strongest reason for disinclination to join in the debate is the consciousness of the utter unreality of the whole thing.  I do not suggest that those who have already spoken in the debate have not been sincere, and did not express their most thorough convictions.  No! The unreality <Col N="512" /> I attribute to the situation, because as the Minister for Home Affairs has told us, there is no security for the investment of capital &mdash; capital which is so often justly styled a shy bird will not come to rest and brood here.  While in a state of war we were actually engaged yesterday evening giving support to an emergency measure by which funds raised out of the taxation of the people are to be applied to making good losses on a railway system, which is a private enterprise, and it is useless for us to discuss legislative programmes in such circumstances, and all the more so, since men are looking forward to an early election in the Saorstát Eireann by virtue of which we shall put an end to the disorder.  Then not a single individual can make a claim to say that the majority of the people are not in favour of the system of Government which we had the privilege to institute.  And confronted by the fact that we are in a state of not perhaps of war, but of armed insurrection, where life and property are absolutely insecure, particularly life, and that we are looking forward to a general election at the earliest date we can secure, I do not think it is fair or reasonable to complain that the Government has not put forward a programme of measures that would commend themselves to us.  At the same time I think, if only as a political device as indicating their mind on the matter, it might have been advisable for the Government to have projected a fuller scheme.  I am sorry the Minister for Finance has not declared himself with regard to one positive evil, of which we are aware.  There is no lack of money in the country, but that money is not being employed in the most fruitful way.  A great deal of it is in the banks on deposit, by virtue of which arrangement the Minister for Finance is cheated out of a large amount of his Income Tax returns.  All that money is not being invested in Irish enterprise at the present moment. I am not going to follow Deputy Nagle in his interesting speech.  It was interesting because of the mass of excellent matter it contained in close collocation with extraordinary theories, which I am quite confident he has given little thought to, otherwise he would not advocate them.  But he dealt with one thing which I had in my mind and that was <Col N="513" /> the using of Irish building material. There is no country in the world, more particularly in Western Europe, not suffering from lack of housing at the present moment &mdash; Ireland, particularly so.  Now I happen to know that the equivalent to Portland cement can be manufactured profitably in Ireland.  All that is required is the investment of the money.  The money is there, the materials are there, the brains and the knowledge are there; the combination of them is required.  Now that is one thing to which attention might be given, it would relieve unemployment considerably and it would also be a great encouragement to the people at large, because there is no doubt about it, the psychological effect on an onlooker's mind of seeing building carried on is one that makes him feel that things are going well.  Only the time is so short I would like to appeal to the experience of other countries similar to ours, more particularly to Belgium, a little country somewhat in size equivalent to the province of Munster and yet one of the most progressive, one of the happiest and one of the wealthiest countries of Europe.  There, by virtue of the combination of popular banks, public banks, and State credit and building enterprise it is possible to have no city slums and to provide the workman with an excellent home a considerable number of miles away from the centre of his occupation so that his family and himself sleep in wholesome country air and his family have a little parcel of land which occupies them in agriculture and horticulture which is profitable in every sense.  By means of subsidies to railways that distance from the centre of the man's occupation does not make a large inroad on his income.  That is something that can be organised here.  Now many years ago, as you are probably aware, when Norway was under the domination of Denmark, precisely as Ireland was under that of Great Britain, the Norwegians had the same national failing as the Danes.  They drank deep.  And Norway was one of the most drunken countries in the world until the reform was instituted of giving the State control of the drink traffic.  The liquor traffic became a State concern and everyone employed in it, a Civil Servant.  One of the arrangements was that if a man was served with too much drink in any particular <Col N="514" /> public house or was found drunk on the premises, the salesman who served him became incapable of public employment thereafter.  All the profits of the drink traffic were applied to road-making, and anyone who has been in Norway knows what a feature of the landscape is the magnificent system of roads.  They are among the best roads in the world.  It seemed a jest to apply the proceeds of the liquor traffic to the making of better roads, but it was a double improvement on the way for &ldquo;going home.&rdquo;  This bears upon the question which we debated yesterday.  It strikes me that the iron railroad system was always crude. This arrangement of laying down steel lines and hedging them from the public was always crude, as it is to-day.  In Ireland the larger centres of population are miles away from the railway stations &mdash; that is one of the distinctive features of the Irish landscape, just as good roads are the distinctive feature of Norway.  If you want to go to Newry, for instance, the Great Northern Railway line leaves you at Goraghwood, because you remember some Director of the Company happen to have a special interest in that locality and wished to develop it at the expense of Newry.  So you have a bye-road from Goraghwood to Newry.  With our little towns badly served by the railway system the development of motor traffic and the development also of coastal service become urgent that we may not be dependent on railways. All these developments mean work for employees, but there is no use in our beginning to create fine highways and steam-rolled roads if we only provide them everywhere for the destructive exercise of the extremists, so here again the reconstruction of the country and the making of life possible at its highest and best depend on the securing of peace.  I feel always up against this difficulty.  It is idle to talk about development until the conditions so necessary for it are assured.  Before I sit down I should just like to congratulate Deputy Nagle on having the courage to make what seemed to some of the Deputies an unfavourable admission, that it is the desire of working men to have leisure.  It ought indeed to be the desire of every man to have leisure.  That is one of the diabolical arrangements of <Col N="515" /> modern life: the type of leisure allowed to the workingman is such as to react unfavourably on him as a man. So that the type of education he should get should fit him to enjoy leisure, and the opportunities for a properly civilised, cultured leisure are things the workingman is entitled to demand and entitled to expect.  It seems to some that to ask for leisure is to declare a love for idleness.  They are sometimes best occupied who indulge in cultured leisure &mdash;they are helping to make civilisation and to promote the sweetness of life. Feeling that the Ministry should be attacked for not giving us an extensive programme of reform yet at the same time wishing to make a protest against the procedure which has been used and which I hope will not be used again &mdash; I hope this occasion will not serve as a precedent &mdash; I intend to vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>Some members may think that this is rather an academic discussion that will lead nowhere, but to my mind it is of great use. It is useful to have had the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs, and to know what is in the mind of the Government with regard to dealing with this serious problem.  We naturally expected to hear what he has told us about the impossibility of doing anything under present conditions.  That may seem a fairly plausible explanation or excuse, but I would put it to the Government that they can hardly afford to take up that attitude.  Unless they attempt to do what can be done under present conditions, those conditions will get steadily worse than they are.  We are more concerned with the larger question, and with what policy they propose to adopt when things are once again somewhat normal. Members were somewhat amused at the remarks of colleague Deputy Nagle when he told of the desire of people to dodge work, but Deputies must realise that work is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end.  If it was not necessary to work in order to live we would not have the burning desire to work unless possibly to keep ourselves in condition. On this question of unemployment let us ask ourselves a few simple questions. Why should there be any people unemployed? Why should we be called upon to deal with such a problem at all? Deputies may reply that there has always <Col N="516" /> been an unemployment problem.  I question that very much.  There was a period in the world's history when there was no unemployment, and it is only as a direct result of the industrial system that exists in this and other countries that the unemployment problem has been created.  The increased productivity has created the unemployment problem.  The fact that it is much easier now to produce things which men have to live on has created the problem of unemployment. When there was no machinery there was no unemployment, and it is because of the invention of machinery and the increased productivity of the soil and because things are produced more quickly to-day that we have that problem. Is it not a remarkable state of affairs that instead of adding to the comfort of man and making everybody better off and more comfortable that this increase of productivity and the invention of machinery have only impoverished the great mass of mankind?  We are able to produce things so easily that people are not able to get them.  We are producing so much of everything we cannot get enough of anything.  We on these benches are not satisfied with this state of affairs, and if the Government say to us, &ldquo;Do you expect us to do something which no other country in the world so far has been able to do?&rdquo; we frankly answer, &ldquo;Yes, we do, we ask you to make an original contribution to the solution of this question, and no matter what happens in other countries we are, in so far as we have the power, going to prevent our class from being degraded to the conditions which now prevail in other countries.&rdquo;  You will probably reply that this is a poor country, and that other and richer countries have not found a solution of the problem.  What test are you going to apply to find out whether the other countries are rich or poor?  I am not prepared to admit that Ireland is a poor country.  Taking England and America, or any of the leading countries, you will probabily reply that England is a very rich and prosperous country.  You may remember that a few years ago a British Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, complained that one-third of the population in England lived below the poverty line. Is that a sign of wealth?  England has a greater pauper population per thousand than any other country in the <Col N="517" /> world.  Now take America; it is supposed to be the wealthiest country in the world, yet it has the greatest number of tramps according to population.  Its tramps have increased in number side by side with its wealth.  When there was less wealth, and when there were no millionaires, there were no tramps. The tramp is the complement to the millionaire.  Is the ideal we are going to aim at for Ireland to be the ideal of America or of England, or rather that of some of the smaller countries such as those to which Professor Magennis has referred, where there are not such extremes of wealth and poverty?  I would like to know on what lines the Ministry would propose to run the country, and in what way they propose to develop their policy.  We have heard in the discussions on this motion and on the agricultural situation about the fact that the farmers of Ireland are unable to find a market for their produce. Yet people are starving for want of it. Why is this?  The farmer produces not in order to supply the needs of the country but to make a profit.  I suppose a good many Deputies have read John Mitchel's &ldquo;Last Conquest of Ireland,&rdquo; and read his description of the famine years.  One and a half millions of the Irish people died between the years '47 and '49.  Mitchell points out that there were more cattle and grain exported from Ireland then than in the preceding or succeeding years.  That was not an evidence of famine, but it was, as he pointed out, an artificial famine due to the failure of the potato crop.  The other wealth of Ireland was there as it was during the preceding years.  In these years also the banks were bursting with money.  What is the state of Ireland to-day?  Are not the banks bursting with money?  Is it not a fact that we have agricultural produce and a huge cattle trade?  Is it not a fact that many of the leading industries are paying high dividends?  Is it not a fact that Messrs. Guinness made a nett profit last year of three million?  These things are not evidence of poverty: These are evidence of the unequal distribution of wealth.  The Minister for Home Affairs refers to our propaganda. He tells us that capital will fly away; that farmers will not till.  I do not know whether he means that the land will fly away or not.  We imagine the land will <Col N="518" /> remain, and we imagine that there is some truth in the doctrine Fintan Lalor preached some years ago.  We have got indications of the kind of security some people would like.  Deputy Gorey told us yesterday that the workers should be beaten down to £2 a week, and should work longer hours.</P>

      <P>If that is the kind of security you want, we on these benches will take good care that that security is not forthcoming.  We on our part will do our best to convince the workers that they are entitled to the best this land can give.  The wealth of this country, as that of every other country, is produced by the labour of these people, and the bees are entitled to the honey. If the Ministry is prepared to set itself to this task of making Ireland as self-supporting as possible, realising that the people have the first claim to the wealth of Ireland, realising that John Mitchel spoke the truth when he said, &ldquo;No Nation but a Nation of slaves exports its produce until it sees that the needs of its own people are seen to first,&rdquo; until they realise that it is not national greatness in the way that England and America are great which we are after, but rather the peace and happiness of the people, so long as the soil of Ireland does not fail, so long as there is machinery here and willing workers to work it this land is capable of producing wealth and enabling the people to live in peace and happiness, as long as that is so we will demand that those who produce this wealth will enjoy it before any capitalists and others come along to create this so-called problem of unemployment.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points I should like to refer to.  In one part of Mr. O'Brien's address he referred to the class he represents and in another part he referred to the people of Ireland.  I very much regret that any one in this Dáil should refer to a class, because I take it this Dáil as a whole has the interest of the whole Nation at heart, the interest of all the people, and before I come to details I should like to say I am one who holds that the wage earner, the worker, has certainly a right to an honest day's wage for his work. I hold equally that the worker <Col N="519" /> owes an honest day's work to the man who pays him an honest day's wage. Some points were made by Mr. O'Brien about farmers having food which they did not give to the people who are idle and unemployed and who, he says, are starving.  The farmers might equally well say, we have work we want done; there are many people unemployed throughout the country, why do they not come and work for us?</P>
      <P>He referred again to a time in the world's history when there was no unemployment. Surely he would not have us go back to the conditions under which workers lived when such times existed, when there was no machinery?  The condition of the worker at the present day has improved very materially since those times, and I am glad it has improved, and I hold that in a prosperous Ireland, which we all, please God, hope to have, that there is even greater room for improvements in conditions of those who work in the State, whether with hand or brain.  In dealing with the amendment there are just two points with which I should like to treat.  Deputy Johnson regrets that the policy of the Executive Council &ldquo;should consist in deferring to an indefinite future any attempt to remedy social and economic difficulties of the people.&rdquo;  Now, in the first instance I would like to know who are we to understand by the people of Ireland.  From what I have been listening to I am more or less driven to the conclusion that the mover of this amendment means by the people of Ireland a certain section of the people of Ireland.  I should like to know does he mean the whole people throughout the length and breadth of the land, or does he mean organised labour alone.  I hold that when we speak of the people of Ireland we mean the people who are forced to live on the rocks of Connemara.</P>

      <P>Or in the valleys or on the bleak mountain sides of Mayo, of Kerry, and of Donegal.  These are the people of Ireland and I do hold that if we mean by such the people of Ireland, there is a promise, there is a definite reference to a scheme to relieve the social and economic condition of the most helpless section of the people.  For these people are unorganised and are the <Col N="520" /> most helpless section.  Let me give Deputy Johnson a few figures as to the condition of these people in Connemara, in Galway, in Mayo, in Donegal, and in Cork.  In Galway the latest returns show that 30,818 agricultural holdings have a valuation of less than £4; that 11,070 agricultural holdings are of a valuation between £4 and £10. In County Mayo we find 16,578 agricultural holdings with a valuation of less than £4, and 12,245 with a valuation between £4 and £10.  In Donegal we find 16,886 holdings with valuations of less than £4, and 8,636 with valuations between £4 and £10.  In Cork, 10,786 less than £4, and 6,381 between £4 and £10.  In Kerry, 7,842 less than £4, and 5,760 between £4 and £10.  In the province of Connaught we find 45,549 holdings of less than £4 valuation, and 43,140 between £4 and £10 valuation. And in all Ireland 161,096 holdings of under £4 valuation, and 147,710 between £4 and £10 valuation.  Hundreds of thousands of people have agricultural holdings in Ireland which are uneconomic. The Government has promised a scheme to relieve the social and economic condition of those people.  It is a big scheme, which requires courage on the part of the Government, and I suggest that Deputy Johnson is altogether inaccurate when he suggests that there has been no communication of any attempt to remedy the social and economic conditions of the people, if he holds that those are the people of Ireland as I am sure he will hold.  Last evening a Deputy gave us here returns for certain organised labour showing that 49/6 per week was paid to Railway workers, 45/6 for porters, and for foreman porters 62/-, and to the Dublin postmen 75/-.  I do not say that that is a wage that these people ought not to have.  If the economic condition of the country permitted they certainly ought to have a higher one, but I would remind Deputy Johnson that there are tens of thousands of people living on agricultural holdings in Connaught, Donegal, Cork and Kerry who have not 75/- per month as their income.  They are actually at the present moment starving, and periodically we have outbreaks of fever there.  I hold and shall insist as far as one representative from Connaught can insist in this Dáil that it is the duty of this Government in relieving social and economic <Col N="521" /> distress, that it shall be applied, in the first instance, to the relief of those most in need of immediate relief, the uneconomic holders along the whole sea front from Cork to Donegal.</P>

      <P>I beg to move &mdash;&ldquo;To omit all after the word `Dáil' and to insert:&mdash; `regrets that the programme of legislation outlined in the speech of the Governor-General contains no proposals for the reform of the present educational system, including the provision of an effective scheme of compulsory school attendance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had since our first meeting here last autumn many debates on various subjects of importance, and on most of these subjects we have had divided opinions, but whenever the question of education came before the Dáil, I was always pleased to note the practical unanimity with which it was put forward from all sides that a very grave necessity existed for educational reform.  That was nothing new. It is a matter, I think, on which there has been general agreement for very many years.  I was pleased to hear during the course of the debate on the last amendment my friend, Deputy Gorey, making the statement that education was all wrong&mdash;I took note of it at the time&mdash; and that most of the present evils were due to the want of education.  I think it was Deputy Milroy who spoke of the necessity for a great scheme of national reconstruction.  The foundation of any scheme of National reconstruction must be a thorough scheme of educational reform in the country.  It was, therefore, with very great surprise, indeed, and with very great regret that I discovered in the programme of legislation outlined by the <Col N="523" /> Ministry, that no reference whatsoever was made to the question of educational reform.  I had hopes from the debates which took place in the Dáil or from the statement from the Government side that this would be one of the first questions to be tackled.  I might quote as a sample the statement made by the Minister for Education on the occasion of a recent debate.  Speaking of some things that had to be dealt with, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;I trust that the Deputies belonging to this Assembly will bear it in mind that one of the heavy responsibilities that will lie upon them in the future will be to make all the provision, financial and otherwise, that is necessary, and that, in their judgment they can make to remedy this very faulty state of things.&rdquo;  I regret this Dáil has not been given an opportunity of doing what the Minister is anxious should be done.  In the course of the debate on the Estimates it was pointed out and admitted by the Ministry that we had in educational affairs in this country a very anomalous state of things, inasmuch as we have four, five, or more different departments &mdash; different branches of the Government service dealing with educational matters.  We have what is called Primary Education, and what is called Secondary Education, and Technical Education, all at the present time controlled and administered by what are practically watertight compartments quite independent of one another.  We have also had Estimates before us for Industrial Schools and, I think, there were one or two other branches of Departments like the Endowed School Commissioners.  The first and great and urgent necessity if we are to prevent the uneconomical working of the systems of education, and if we are to prevent needless overlapping, and needless waste of energy and effort and money is to unify and bring under one control all the Departments of the State which deal with education.  To show the necessity that there is for urgent action let us take any of these divisions&mdash;these arbitrary divisions I might say, for I regard them as arbitrary divisions.  In the Primary Departments at the present time, they are simply carrying on. We do not know exactly where we are in the matter.  We do not know what is the exact legal position.  We do not know what is the position with regard <Col N="524" /> to the Commissioners of National Education. I believe it is essential that their position should be regularised at the earliest possible opportunity.  There is at present no educational code properly speaking. The code in existence, I believe, is five or six years' old, and if anybody unacquainted with Irish education at the present time found themselves in the position that he had to inquire as to what the situation was with regard to our educational code he would find himself in very great difficulty, indeed.  For all the regulations, or most of them, which are printed in the present code &mdash; at all events a very large number of them are &mdash; obsolete. That Department is administered at the present time through the Regulations which are contained in the various circulars issued from time to time by the Department.  It tends to very great confusion in the case of both the Administration and those who carry on the work of Education.  That is one of the first things that the Ministry should tackle.  We have heard a lot in this Dáil about Secondary Education.  There is, in fact, really no Secondary system&mdash; no system of Secondary Education.  It is not correct at all to speak of the Secondary Education system, because we have no such thing.  I need not, I think, dwell on that particular phase of the question.  That surely is admitted. Technical Education is under the control of, or administered by, the Department of Agriculture.  I think it is necessary that this branch of education should be taken from the control of the Department and put under the control of the Ministry of Education. Then we have attempts made in various parts of the country at a so-called Scholarship system.  Various County Councils and other bodies strike rates to establish Scholarships from the Primary and Secondary Schools.  They have done that within the last year I understand. I do not know what is the position of the law regarding that.  I doubt very much whether that position is regular. I would like to say with regard to the Scholarship system generally what may appear to be a heresy coming from people who from time to time did advocate this scheme of Scholarship or a scheme of Scholarships, that I at any rate have ever regarded the Scholarship scheme as a makeshift scheme.  I do not believe in the system of taking boys <Col N="525" /> or selecting from a class of boys or girls at the early age of 12 or 13 years; I do not believe in selecting precocious boys and taking them away from their homes perhaps and sending them to a Boarding School.  I do not believe that is good; I do not believe it is good for education. I do not believe it is good for the boys themselves.  I never could feel satisfied that boys so selected were the right selection.  Because I hold that at that age it is not possible to judge fairly the boys or girls who will benefit most by Secondary or Higher Education.  But apart from that I hold that those who are left behind are equally entitled to receive the benefits of Higher Education. It might be asked if they cannot be awarded scholarships or sent away to Boarding Schools for their Secondary Education, what is the alternative?  My alternative, in any case, would be to bring the facilities.  Rather than to send the boy to the school, I would bring the school to the boy.  I would bring the facilities within the reach of the children in their own homes, and I believe that can be done, and that it is quite practicable.  I believe we have the machinery already, and that is why I said, earlier in my remarks, that I believe this distinction between primary and secondary education is very largely arbitrary.  I believe the village school should provide a good and sufficient education for a boy or girl up to the age of 16, 17 or 18 years.  I believe that is possible, and it is the right way to tackle this question; that rather than set up a system of so-called Colleges or Boarding Schools or Secondary Schools, we should develop the existing schools as we find them, so that the children could find in their village school all the education which it is proper they should receive up to the age of 16, 17 or 18 years.  That does not necessarily mean, and I do not intend it to mean at this stage, that education should be compulsory up to that age; but if boys or girls are prepared to attend school, or their parents are prepared to do without their services and give them the fair chance they should get in life, the facilities for availing of that should be at their doors.  It does not mean either that every little school should provide these privileges.  Certainly the schools established in our towns or villages should provide these facilities, and the grown pupils in the <Col N="526" /> smaller schools, when they come to the age of 14, 15 or 16 years, could very easily go to the central school in the town or village at a distance of five or six miles.  It would have many advantages, but the greatest advantage I see is the boy would not be rooted out of his home at the early age of 12, 13 or 14 years.  He has to leave his home at the present time, if he seeks a secondary education or an education higher than that up to the compulsory attendance age, and I think that is bad for the boy, for the country, and for education generally. Another phase of the educational question that I would like to see tackled is the question of administration.  I believe we have had too much centralisation in the past.  Everything has been done from headquarters in Dublin. There is the necessity, undoubtedly, for directional control, if I may say so, and in some aspects national control is important and necessary.  But there are many aspects connected with education in which the local people should be brought into much more direct touch than has been done in the past.  The only branch of education in which local interest has been touched, and in which the local people have been encouraged to interest themselves, is on the technical side.  So far as my experience goes, I think it is generally agreed that on that side the work of the technical branch is much more satisfactory, and has been on the whole more successful than in either of the other two branches, and it is quite possible this bringing of the local people into touch with the educational problems that present themselves may be responsible to some extent for that. I do not know what was the reason&mdash;it may have been historical; it may have been otherwise&mdash;but the fact remains that the ordinary layman regarded education as forbidden ground, something that was outside his purview, and that he was not to touch.  It was too thorny a problem for the layman to touch, and he kept clear of it.  The net result of that is that there has been and is very great apathy indeed on the part of the people generally with regard to educational questions, and, while they may have general ideas as to the necessity and advisability of education and educational reform, they have never come down to tackle this problem in a practical way or interested themselves in the <Col N="527" /> matter.  Who ever heard of a meeting of people to deal with the question of education unless it was got up by people who might be supposed, rightly or wrongly, to be directly interested in the question?  There are some matters which should, in my opinion, specially interest the local bodies and the local people&mdash; questions such as the provision of material for school buildings and the finding of buildings.  I do not mean that the cost of the building should be met by the locality.  That would be impracticable, and I think that should be the duty of the State.  What I mean is the type of school, and, above all, the maintenance of the fabric when it is provided. That surely should be the duty of the local bodies.  Most of us in the Dáil know that you have all through the country buildings doing duty for schools which are little, if indeed anything, better than barns&mdash;miserable hovels called schools which are repellant even to the children, and which beget disgust with everything connected with the school on the part of the children who come and spend the greater part of the day in such buildings.  Apart from that, there is the question of the health of the nation, and we know the foundations of many of the diseases which attack children and growing people are laid in these insanitary hovels which serve at the present time for schools.  Nobody has any interest in these things; it is left largely to local voluntary effort.  The clergyman of the district is supposed to collect or raise funds in any way that seems to him best to provide or maintain these public buildings.  On a former occasion I paid a tribute to these men, who for many years have undertaken this onerous task, and I do so again here.  They have done their best, on the whole, to meet the situation and to carry out a duty which should never have been placed upon their shoulders.  But this voluntary system of carrying on the ordinary repairs of schools, of keeping them sanitary, has, in my opinion, completely broken down; and it is necessary that steps should be taken to make provision by which this important work should be carried on.  That can only be done by legislation.  It should not be left to voluntary effort.  It is simply and solely a question of rates.  That may frighten some people, but when we <Col N="528" /> come down to examine it we find that that is the only solution.  It is not fair that the parents of the children should be asked to pay subscriptions from year to year for the maintenance of these buildings while the man who may be in the fortunate&mdash;or unfortunate&mdash;position of not having any children at school gets off scot free.  You may have poor parents having to contribute to such collections, while the big landholder, or the company perhaps, that owns property in the district does not contribute one penny.  I certainly think it would be more equitable, and certainly it is necessary, that legislation should be introduced at as early a date as possible to meet these needs.  I might add to that the necessity for the provision of suitable playgrounds. We know that in many of the schools there are no playgrounds provided. The children play on the road, to the very great danger and risk of their lives; either that or they play in a muddy schoolyard, and in winter time they have to stay inside rather than be admitted to the playgrounds.  The local bodies should also provide for school plots in rural districts, especially school plots which could be made, and it is necessary that they should be made, where there is a rural population such as in this country, of very great educational advantage.  Then there is the question of school meals.  That is a very urgent question indeed in some of our poorer districts; but I personally would be glad to see provision made whereby all children could have a meal provided for them during the school interval. Some days ago I came across an interesting extract from a statement by Michael Davitt in this connection. He says that &ldquo;up to the age of fifteen I would have all education compulsory and free, and, moreover, I would provide a free meal in the middle of the day for all the children.  This latter provision I hold to be an indispensable one in any scheme of enlightened educational reform.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there is also a matter which I mentioned some days ago, and which perhaps would arise more correctly in connection with the question of health; but it touches the school and educational question intimately, and that is the provision of medical and dental inspection of school children.  I do not see any reference to these in the proposed scheme <Col N="529" /> of legislation.  I only hope that it may not be necessary to pass legislation.  I hope it may be possible to adapt an Act which I understand is already there, in order to introduce medical and dental inspection in our schools.  There is also a question&mdash;and this surely causes me surprise&mdash;with reference to the subject of compulsory attendance.  I wonder how it was that the Ministry forgot the unanimous resolution that was passed in the Dáil on, I think, the 17th of November last.  Perhaps I should read it.  This was the resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, inasmuch as the attendance of children at school has of late been notoriously irregular, and as the present Compulsory Attendance Law has proved to be inadequate to deal with the situation thus created, it is the desire of this Dáil that the Compulsory Attendance Clauses of the Irish Education Act of 1892 should, at the earliest available opportunity, be amended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet, while we have a long programme of legislation outlined, we have no reference in that programme, or no intention set forward in that programme of giving effect to this resolution which the Dáil passed on the 17th of November.  I need not go into the necessity of that again.  It was fully debated on that occasion, and the opinion of the Dáil is expressed in that resolution.  I shall only content myself by expressing my surprise that a resolution so definite, so clear, and, above all, a unanimous resolution of that kind seems to have been forgotten by the Ministry in arranging their programme of legislation.  Now, in view of this, I think the amendment which stands in my name, and which I am proposing, is eminently justified, if we are not to take it that, like all the other plans, schemes, and proposals which used to be the stock arguments of those who now sit in the Government benches before they came to sit on these benches, are not to be regarded as all wiped away, because they have got control of the Government into their hands. Perhaps in connection with this matter, especially in view of some statements that have been made from time to time in this Dáil and elsewhere, it might be of interest to refer to what is sometimes spoken of as an educational objective. There is hardly any question, I think, on which there are so many varied <Col N="530" /> opinions, even amongst those who pose as experts, as on this question of an educational objective.  The examination of these opinions and statements made from time to time shows, further, that these varying ideas range themselves largely under two heads.  We have those who believe that the chief aim of education should be to train the child to take its place in the army of workers, and that all educatinal schemes and curricula should be directed towards producing a skilful and competent industrial unit, one who will be ready and trained to do useful work, either as a mechanic, or craftsman, or a professional man, in adding to the wealth and comfort and prosperity of the country as a whole.  That is what I might call the utilitarian idea of education.  Then we have, on the other hand, a smaller body of opinion, who believe that education and all that true education connotes, the pursuit of knowledge, is in itself an object eminently worthy of attainment, quite apart from, and independent of, its utilitarian aspect altogether.</P>
    <P>Now, we may ask which of those is going to obtain in this country, because it is necessary, if we set out on the road to educational reform, to have an objective before us.  To my mind in any case, it will depend entirely on the nature of the civilisation which we hope to establish in this country under our new-found liberty.  If we are to have what Deputy O'Brien spoke of earlier this evening, the industrialism of America or England, if that is our aim in life, if the pursuit of what is now called wealth, and the comforts and pleasures which such wealth brings in its train, if that is to be our object, we must obviously shape our educational outlook, so as to attain that object, and in that case the utilitarian ideal will be uppermost, and will prevail.  If, on the other hand, we are anxious to have a distinctive Gaelic State, a distinctive Gaelic civilisation, different from the industrial States of England or America, or even of Belgium, if we are to have a self-contained nation, that will be little influenced by the industrial movements or the markets of the world, if we are to have a country, or if we hope to build up a country, in which wealth and the products of wealth, as we know and speak of wealth at the present time, will be subordinate to the higher things, the <Col N="531" /> higher spiritual things, and a community in which spiritual ideals of existence will count for more than what might be regarded as physical or bodily comforts; if that is to be our aim, we will come to realise that the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge and the shaping of our system of education so as to provide for mental and moral training and the formation of character, the mental training of the citizen in the higher things of life, and not only individual character, but national character, if that is to be our aim, then that must be our objective, and we must discard the utilitarian idea.  I think that if we come to examine the matter fully that there can be no doubt which of these ideals ought to be our aim and our object.  In this connection I might be permitted to quote from an article that appeared in <i>Sinn Fein</i> so far back as 1906.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ancient Irish,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;like the modern French, recognise an aristocracy of intellect as distinguished from an aristocracy of birth, and did not recognise an aristocracy of wealth at all.  Into the first aristocracy they have afforded every man an opportunity of entrance by making education free to all.  It never entered into our ancestors' heads that higher education was a thing to be set apart for those whose fathers were wealthier than their neighbours, or that the end of education was to qualify a man to earn money.  Like the Greeks, they knew that the one end of education is to perfect the man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are some people in this country who think that the one and only ideal of education is to qualify a man to earn a living and become a better unit and a better machine in the industrial system. As I say, I hope that will not be our ideal.  Our independence, our separation from England, which has been the object of our struggles for the past centuries, will not make any distinctive mark in history if we are simply going to use that independence and that separation in order to cultivate the same ideals, or, rather, cultivate the ideals that have been planted in this country during the years of the British occupation. It is our duty to show to the world that we here in Ireland are a distinctive race.  It will be necessary in <Col N="532" /> order to prove our age-long claim to independence, to show that we are a distinctive race, a distinctive nation, and a people with ideals and aspirations differing widely from those who held us in bondage through the centuries.  We can only do this by building up within this country a distinctive Gaelic culture and giving our people a new outlook in life, and showing that, after all, the attainment of wealth and riches is not the ultimate object of human existence. I hope that the Ministry will see the necessity at the earliest possible opportunity of taking up this whole problem of education in a constructive and thorough way, and this to my mind is not one of the matters, although it is a very big and important matter in which it is necessary to adopt the usual method&mdash;what has come to be the usual method&mdash;of setting up a Commission.  I have stated before, and state again, that in my opinion there is no necessity for setting up a Commission, especially on the lines of some of the Commissions that have already been set up, because the material is there and the evidence is there as a result of previous Commissions, out of which nothing came.  It may require, perhaps, a small representative Committee which will collate material at hand and advise the Ministry as to the best way in which the very urgent question of Educational Reform might be tackled.</P>

      <P>I beg to second Deputy O'Connell's amendment. As regards this amendment, my attitude must be wholly different from that which I was obliged to take up with regard to Deputy Johnson's.  There I was overwhelmed with a sense of the unreality of the discussion.  Here I feel I am justified in joining Deputy O'Connell in pressing on the Ministry attention to what, I think, avoiding the use of strong language, I might describe as proleptic dereliction of duty, because when I read the legislative Programme I found these words which, had they been used in regard to Education, might have been adopted by myself: &ldquo;Considering and establishing under the Constitution a judicial system specially adapted to the requirements of this country is <i>a matter of immediate necessity.</i> As soon as possible a Bill for the establishment of an Irish Judiciary will be submitted to you.  Notwithstanding <Col N="533" /> the state of rebellion, and notwithstanding the imminence of a General Election, the Ministry recognises that life must go on, and the requirements of the Public Service and of the future, too, must be attended to.  They are alive to the necessity of a Judicial procedure, of the hearing and consideration of cases, but apparently, if we were to judge them by this programme, they do not realise that the country has been, and is, perishing for want of attention to education. There is <i>no</i> educational <i>system</i> in this country, and that is why we stand here to plead for the construction and establishment under the Constitution of an Educational System specially adapted to the requirements of this country, and we say <i>it is of immediate and urgent necessity.&rdquo;</i>  I adopt the phraseology of the address.  There is a great deal of criticism about the educational system of the country which gives the false impression that there is a system, and what we protest against, and what I have protested against for more than a quarter of a century, is the entire absence of anything entitled to be called a system which has coherence and co-ordination. The only slightest trace of co-ordination is myself.  I cannot make the thing more concrete or more ludicrous than by putting it in that form. There is no point of contact between Primary, Secondary and University Education except what is constituted in my own person.  I do not say that by way of making a boast.  On the contrary, I put it before you to show you how pitiful is the condition of education in this country. I happen to be a member of the National Board for Primary Education, a member of the Intermediate Board, that concerns itself with Secondary Education, and a member of the Senate of the National University, which concerns itself with Higher Education, in so far as that comes within the bailiwick of the National University.  Except for that, there is no contact, artificial or vital, between these different Departments. Now, Primary Education hangs loose at both ends.  It leads nowhere as education.  It leads a long way, I admit, so far as regards instruction, and what the public mind has not grasped is the vast difference between Education and Instruction.  We cannot get the public to evince any interest in the problem of Education itself.  It is <Col N="534" /> notorious that in other legislatures you have empty houses when the Educational Estimates are under consideration, just as we have an empty house here now, or practically an empty house.  The apathy is due to the conceit of people that they themselves have done very well without education, to the sophistry that education is a luxury for the few, and that practical men can dispense with it.  They see that Higher Education is regarded as making for a vague thing called Culture.  They do not inquire or wish to know what culture is.  They believe it is the privilege of the so-called higher classes, and that it is bought somehow at the expense of the worker, and it is supposed too to be hostile to the worker, and when we make a claim for the workers' share in culture we are regarded as dreamers and visionaries. My indictment against the &ldquo;National System&rdquo; is not merely that the system was not national, but that it was denationalising, and that it was not education at all.  We devoted huge sums of money, three millions annually, for imparting instruction, and here and there, where the education was given, it was because of the personality of the teacher, and it was in no way attributable to the State organisation itself.  I have always believed that the British Government did not care how many millions it spent on education in Ireland so long as it was not productive, so long as the money did not produce men who, in the realm of commerce, industry and manufacture might compete with England. So long as it provided Civil Servants for the Civil Service of the Empire and clerks who could go into the large towns of Great Britain and be of service to the big business men, it was quite satisfactory. Secondary Education has been largely starved and ignored.  The attempts by the Intermediate Commissioners to create it have been nullified or very much impeded by want of funds, and want also of sympathy from the educated classes of the country.  Now, the Deputy who has spoken devoted himself almost exclusively to the question of Primary Education.</P>

      <P>I said <i>almost.</i> Of course it is an exaggeration to say that he devoted himself only to it. <Col N="535" /> But he did not take into consideration the question of University education, and, therefore, I think I ought to concentrate on that.  Now, first I complained that Primary education does not lead to Secondary,&mdash;Secondary in some respects does lead on to University education. There was a certain amount of organisation there, but that was due to the fact that the Intermediate Commissioners had fashioned it so.  Where failure lay was in not providing for adjustment between Primary and Secondary and Technical education. Here, happily, we have the support of one Minister, fortunately the Minister most concerned.  The Minister for Agriculture told us on a recent occasion that he advocated the removal of the Technical Education Department from the administration of his Ministry.  That would be better for agriculture, and certainly it would be better for technical education.  Now, the majority of people in Ireland who have ever given any attention whatsoever to the educational problem have read speeches in which this illustration occurs repeatedly that we have a building with a foundation and walls, but the roof is absent. That has been reiterated so constantly that it becomes absolutely necessary to counteract the effect of that illustration at every possible opportunity.  Those who framed that illustration had in view the order of time in which instruction is imparted.  The child begins with Primary education, and if he is fortunate enough he goes on to the Secondary School, and after that to the University, but in the creation of an educational system that is not the order, and, unfortunately, politicians who have been sufficiently large-minded and tried to come to the aid of educational reform have been misled by it, and have made confusion worse confounded in a well-meant effort to do good.  You must, as the present Minister for Education put it, in a recent debate, work from above. He used the illustration of the sunshine &mdash;the vivifying effect of the sunshine upon all beneath.  I have used, and may be pardoned for using again, a different illustration: What the brain and the nervous system are in the organisation of the human body, that to the education of the nation is the relation which the University bears.  If we are <Col N="536" /> to make a Gaelic State and to construct Irish civilisation again, it must be through the University.  When we who represent the Universities use this language we are regarded merely as the ordinary advertiser of wares, who claims that his stuff is the only thing that should be allowed upon the market.  All those who have given close attention to educational matters are well aware that unless the teacher in the Primary School is something more than a mere retailer of goods in handing out information that other men have achieved, unless he is an influence educative in the better sense of education he is not fit for his position.  I include a great deal more than intellectual development in education.  Education regarded rightly is to make a man a real man, and the education that is primary should largely consist in imparting instruction in such wise as to train the mind of the recipient, so that when he leaves the school he is able to teach himself.  The ideal teacher, not merely in primary education, but all through every grade of education, is the teacher who makes himself most easily dispensed with at the earliest possible moment on the part of the student. The growth of the individual, the growth from within, is the aim of education, and the whole machinery of education is to help that growth to go on.  Hence education is an Art, and it is an Art best learned in University.  What has been done for University education in Ireland?  Any money given at first was given grudgingly.  I speak here of the National University.  When as a result of half a century of continuous propaganda work and continuous agitation and great sacrifices on the part of our people, at last the University was created of which we could make use, it was at first starved.  The funds provided were entirely insufficient.  Mr. Birrell, when he was creating the National University with three constituent Colleges, admitted privately that was so when some of us made representations as to the utter impossibility of making a great modern University with all the equipment for science and for the application of science to industry on the money allowed us, and he told us that on account of political exigencies more could not be granted, and as a matter of policy he asked us to work it, and <Col N="537" /> that when we produced results appeal could be made to the British House of Commons and more money would be forthcoming.  That admittedly meagre initial endowment was given with the promise of more, and now, when we stand here in our own Legislature, we are told that &ldquo;we are not to be plunderers of the public purse.&rdquo; I believe that all reconstruction must be through education.  There are ever so many social wrongs and social deficiencies that would right themselves in great part if only there was a proper System of Education.  The housing question, the drink question, the proper idea about the relation of citizenship&mdash; the duty of employer and employed&mdash; these would not be such terrible problems as they are if a better mind and a right mind were produced in all concerned by a higher conception of citizenship and all it involves, and if they were part of what the student carried away from his school.  I speak particularly with a sense of grievance as regards my own University.  The public are not sufficiently interested to know the difference between the University called the National University and its constituent Colleges.  There are three constituent Colleges, the College in Dublin is called the National University by casual observers; the result is confusion. Now when we began in University College, Dublin, we had the first year, contrary to expectation, a very much larger number than we budgeted for&mdash;we had 530 students.  Now we have over 1,200, close on 1,300.  This is a tremendous and unexpected development in the course of something less than 13 years.  The chief part of our work is at the School of Medicine.  We have a huge roll in Medicine, but the material equipment for it and instruments are sadly lacking.  I hardly care to make public in the interests of the Medical School what the actualities of the situation are.  The Government allowed a sum of £150,000 for building the University and the Dublin College.  We managed to make an unequal division between the University and the College, and £110,000 were secured for the Dublin College.  We had barely begun to build when the war broke out, and prices went up month by month, and practically stopped building operations. <Col N="538" /> The contractor threatened to remove his plant, and the building, thousands of pounds worth of it, would in that event have been lost.  In that dilemma we were obliged to go on with the contract and save expense on the living fabric, the staff of the College, to try to meet the requirements of the builder.  In spite of our efforts we were left with a building debt which ought to be regarded as a war debt, and dealt with as a war debt.  In the Estimates recently presented you will see there was a special non-recurring grant given us, and we were obliged to pledge ourselves that it would be devoted to the building debt.  With all respect to the Minister, instead of giving a pledge of that sort, we should have received a pledge that the whole debt with regard to the building would be treated as a war debt, and should be part of the money set off in the financial adjustment with Great Britain. Now, we cannot work a great Medical School and have no provision for housing it and for the equipment and material that are necessary in advanced scientific work of a kind involved in a great School of Surgery and Medicine.  In that building of which I spoke we have no room for anatomy, physiology, pharmacology.  All these things are housed, if I could call it housed, in the obsolete, almost toppling building, the old Catholic University School in Cecilia Street.  The money was wholly insufficient.  Our staff of professors is insufficient in point of number, and the money for the payment of adequate salaries is also insufficient.  Now, apart from that, suppose that we had all the wealth of the Indies at our disposal in the University and the Colleges, we are not able to do all that work which we feel we could do for the betterment of the country because of the dislocation in educational affairs.  The Minister for Agriculture was good enough to promise a Committee of Inquiry to determine the relation that ought to exist between what was the College of Science and the University, because he recognised the need for a great national physical laboratory, and realised also that in a country such as this there should be no educational overlapping, and that there should be true economy in education.  Although the Minister, in his enlightenment, made that promise, there is no reference to it in the Address.  As if confusion were not <Col N="539" /> sufficiently regnant in educational affairs the first thing the Provisional Government did was to suspend the National Board.  I have made my plaint about that already.  The National Board&mdash;I do not say it had been excellent in its personnel because of the presence of Professor Thrift and myself on the Board, making a vicious thing good&mdash;but undoubtedly it is admitted on all hands, and Deputy O'Connell, who represents the National School Teachers, will bear me out, that as regards personnel and spirit it had become quite a new Board, and was engaged in excellent work.  Without considering what it was doing or attempting to do, it was suspended, and only when it was suspended was the discovery made that it had a legal position which could not be tampered with.  Now, it is not for me to defend these Boards.  I have stormed against them in my time as strenuously as most people, but I am willing to admit, having seen them from inside, that there are on these Commissions men animated by genuine public spirit, who give their time and their knowledge and experience, who give their best, in short, to the public service without remuneration, and receive nothing but adverse and unfriendly criticism from the public.  What they do constructively is never recognised.  The mistakes they make, which may sometimes be many and obvious, are continually harped upon. Quite recently the Intermediate Board was put into this miserable position.  We were engaged in creating a new programme of studies, when we read in the newspaper a publication by the Minister for Education what the new programme was.  Those who take up the programme for 1923 will find everything issued in the name of the Ministry of Education.  Meanwhile the Intermediate Board functions, and has all the odium, if there be odium, and much of the responsibility. Surely the Government is going to make up its mind one way or other as to making a clean sweep of the National Board and Intermediate Board, or it is going to make use of these bodies?  It ought by this time surely to have its mind made up.  One thing is obvious, something has got to be done in the matter, as we cannot go on with an extemporised procedure unless to the detriment of the country.  I could speak for hours and hours on these <Col N="540" /> educational grievances, but I recognise the futility of speaking about them at all.  A reporter will not report a debate on education.  That is not the disability in Ireland only.  Neither will the public take any interest in it.  Parents seem to think that when they have sent their children to school, or, in the case of the higher schools, when they have paid their fees, that they have done all that concerns them in education.  They do not realise that education is a national concern.  It is a national concern.  The beginning and the middle and the end of national progress is education.  Unfortunately, as a result of the war, it is not considered a wise thing to refer to Germany as an example, but we all know very well that Germany, but for the coming of America into the war, would have won the war.  At the time when Germany was winning the war, during the first three years, everyone admitted it was largely due to the University system, through chemistry and through the application of science.  I have often contrasted the fact that Napoleon laid Prussia low, and that two Professors of Philosophy, Fichte and Von. Humboldt, recreated Prussia, and through that the German Empire had a great system of civilisation and industry.  Two Professors of a despised subject, theorists, visionaries, only that we have lived to see the result!  In this in how few years was constructive work done.  Only quite recently a man died in this city who had been alive when Napoleon died, so that actually there is only one extended life between the period of the overthrow of Prussia and the uprise of it again as one of the great figures in the world's system.  I mention that to show what education can do for a country when properly taken in hand.  Education, after all, is a thing that we ought to be interested in, as Deputy O'Connell has said, if it were only for the sake of the continuity of our national history.  Now, I do say seriously that the omission from the programme of legislation of any mention of education is a matter that we are justified in complaining of, all the more so because we have in the Minister for Education and in several of his colleagues men who are quite as much interested and as anxious about the future of Irish education, as either <Col N="541" /> of us who spoke this evening.  I frankly acknowledge that that is so, but it looks as if they had not been able to communicate to other colleagues so much of their spirit as will make those others realise that the educational problem should be the first to be tackled.</P>

      <P>I think I feel the importance and the urgency of this matter at least as much as either of the two Deputies who have spoken.  Therefore I do not like to give a silent vote on this matter if pressed to a division, and would like to explain very briefly that, although I feel with the Deputies who have spoken, I am prepared to vote against the amendment and on the side of the Government.  It is just because I feel the importance of this matter that I can take up that position.  I hope that when the Government comes to deal with this matter, as I hope they will do very shortly, that they will bring forward a really comprehensive scheme, and one argued out in all its details.  Of course we shall not all agree.  I dare say, in many of these details, but I think that any people who have reflected at all on this matter must have come to the conclusion that it is one of vital importance to the good of the country, and is of pressing urgency.  The last speaker has spoken from the point of view of one of the newer Universities as to their need for attention on the part of the Government.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Magennis has said with reference to these claims, and I would urge, at the same time, that even the older Universities are in the same position. The experience of the past few years has shown that they cannot continue their part efficiently on the old financial footing, and it has shown also the need there is for further development, if they are to fulfil properly their position in the country. Much has been said&mdash;and not too much &mdash;as to the need for culture as the ultimate and scientific end of all education, and I think that that applies to all branches, and especially to the Universities. That culture involves not alone education and instruction in the classical languages or the Gaelic language, or in literary matters, but in other things too&mdash; in the study of science for its own sake, for example.  And when I disagree on this point with Deputy O'Connell, I do not think it means that we disagree with <Col N="542" /> regard to fundamentals, but as to the practical way in which that culture is to be worked for throughout the various branches of education.  I disagree with him in this way, that he contrasted the two lines of development, the utilitarian and the cultural development.  I do not think that that is a sound division to make, because I think that these two lines should go together.  The cultural, no doubt, is the ultimate end, but if you divorce it from the utilitarian, you defeat your object in trying to reach that cultural goal which you desire.  It is impossible to secure that unless you raise the standard of living and of life throughout the whole country.  At first I did not intend to make a speech at all, but I was going to satisfy myself by saying that I want the Government, at the earliest possible moment, to deal with this problem, and to deal with it not by piecemeal, but in a comprehensive way, so as to co-ordinate the primary and secondary schools with the Universities, and not to make, as Professor Magennis very properly said, that co-ordination dependent on personal contact with the different systems.  That is what we have had in the past.  The different branches should be co-ordinated under one system. When the Government come to deal, as I hope they will at the earliest possible moment, with this problem, and with the demands of the Universities, Secondary Schools and Primary Schools, which they will have to meet if the country is to be put into a proper state&mdash; when they come to deal with these demands, I hope they will deal with them in a comprehensive way, and bring before us a completely thought-out scheme. I am prepared to vote with the Government, because I do not think that they have had time to consider such a comprehensive scheme, but, as soon as ever the position permits, I do hope they will set to work upon that problem which, perhaps, is as important as any with which the country has to deal.</P>

      <P>I do not think I should be silent on this subject.  It is one that is very near to my heart; in fact, I think it is the chief interest of my life, and yet this subject is so vast and so thorny that I am afraid to approach it at all.  The Deputy who proposed the amendment took a wide sweep, and touched on most of its <Col N="543" /> branches, and Deputy Professor Magennis impressed upon us the importance and value of education, that it is the first condition of any reconstruction, of any creation of the State that the system of education should be rightly planned and constructed.  The old Greek philosopher, a see-er of visions, some of which are realised to-day, in planning his State laid the foundation in education, and remarked incidently that in any real State the bulwarks of the State was its education.  If we are to create and defend the nation we must start with our education, and to anybody who has any acquaintance with it the situation to-day will appear a very alarming one.  The educational system in Ireland to-day is the result of compromise, botching, and hashing, shaping and mis-shaping, so that I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister whose task it is to clear away the old lumber, and produce a proper, decent structure worthy of this nation, and suitable for the future of Ireland.  So many ideas have been touched&mdash;I had nearly said so many hares had been started&mdash;that I am afraid to go into details at all.  Perhaps I had better not. There was one fruitful idea, however, which I hope will not be lost sight of, an important one that Deputy O'Connell thought of or suggested, that Secondary education might be brought down or fused into Primary education; it is a fruitful idea.  It had not occurred to me before.  The general theory amongst those I have talked to about the subject was the idea of building up Primary education into Secondary education, and there always would be a hitch.  It never seemed to me that the machine would go smoothly in that way, and I think it would be worth while exploring the possibilities of bringing down Secondary education into Primary education and see if you cannot get a new type of general school on the lines that Deputy O'Connell visioned.  Now, I really do not know how I am to vote on this amendment.  I think it is a pity, a great pity, that those who drew up the address did not think it desirable to make some reference to education, for I know that this Government, and certainly the Minister for Education, have the true interests of education at heart. I think we are fortunate that our Minister for Education is a scholar, an Irish <Col N="544" /> scholar.  He is a man of vision, and I do think that if anybody can frame the system of education that will mould the younger generation, mould the future to the desire of the Nation's heart, it is the present Minister.  He has a hard task; he will require much help and criticism, and perhaps the criticism that has been directed to-night on the motion to include a reference to education in the Address will be of some use and will keep before the eyes of the Government and of the Nation the vital necessity of attending to this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. T. JOHNSON Mr. T. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a good many suggestions and a pretty wide discussion of this question, and I do not think it is inopportune even to widen still further the discussion and generally let our thoughts run round the question of education in any aspect that might present itself.  I think we all agree that the problem is a big one, and care must be taken in dealing with it to have a pretty coherent plan, and, at least, an ultimate objective fairly clearly in mind and generally accepted before we can do the work of foundation-laying thoroughly and well.  Now, it is quite evident from those who have spoken with knowledge of the educational system from the Primary side, the Secondary side, and the University side, that there is&mdash;I was going to say nothing good, but that is perhaps an over-statement&mdash;but that there is very much bad in the general system affecting education from its three aspects, and it seemed to me by listening to the speeches from the four Deputies who have spoken that, perhaps, with one or two additional Deputies who have not yet spoken, you could obtain a really excellent Advisory Committee to the Minister for Education, to assist him in tackling this problem immediately, or even perhaps to consult with him as to the plans which he has already laid, and which, I assume, are on the stocks, before launching the ship.  If these plans have not been laid then I suggest it would not be a bad idea for him to invite the co-operation of those members of the Dáil, and, perhaps, one or two others from outside, without any formal vote, without any formal instruction from the Dáil, perhaps even without responsibility to the Dáil, but to invite their collaboration and co-operation in <Col N="545" /> framing any scheme.  Deputy Alton said a word or two about fusing Secondary and Primary education.  I do not know whether I am voicing the views of anybody else except myself, but it occurs to me that we ought to think of primary education as merely elementary, the preparation of the child for the reception of knowledge and education, and that we should not think that the duty of the State has been finished, or that the duty of the educationalists has been finished with the average child of the average man when the primary period has been passed. We ought to recognise, I think, that that is purely primary and preparatory, and that it is then the work of education has to begin, and that the State responsibility for assisting in education should be more earnestly undertaken.  The child of the average man&mdash;the average poor man, as I may say&mdash;ought not to be left out of the hands of the educational scheme until he is an adult, he ought to be educated right through and dealt with by the educational scheme until he is at manhood's age, and then he can take care of himself.  I hold that there ought not to be any sharp differentiation between the boy or girl at school and the boy or girl who is learning while working, and that we could utilise the process of learning with the process of production and work, and that the one will help the other, and that learning while in contact with realities will make learning truer and more certain.  Producing and working while learning would make that production better and more efficacious, and I hope that we shall, in time, come to the view that right from the age of six or seven years to the age of twenty years the process of education would be looked upon as normal in the career of every child.  Now, I want to put in a plea that in the discussion or consideration of any scheme of educational change or reform something ought to be done on the lines of the Danish Folk High School.  Belgium and Germany have been quoted here, but I suppose there has been no experiment in education in any country in the world for the last hundred years which has been so fruitful as the Danish High Schools, or the People's High Schools; and I hope it would be possible, within the State scheme, to assist in the establishment of some similar institution in this country.  I recognise <Col N="546" /> to the full how futile it is to talk about schemes and plans and institutions, unless you have men and women capable of doing the work of those institutions and inspiring that educational scheme.  We have not got&mdash;as far as I can see at the moment&mdash;the exact counterpart of Bishop Gruntvig, but there are educationists&mdash;men with some inspiration in Ireland&mdash;and something has been done of a similar kind here in the work of the Gaelic League and of one or two other institutions, but I should think it would be very well worth spending £1,000 on propaganda through this country to show what was done by the establishment of these Danish High Schools for Denmark.  We often point to Denmark as an example of what might be done in production and for agriculture, and what a great improvement there has been in two generations in that country.  Deputy Professor Magennis quoted Germany as having been revivified through the work of two professors of philosophy.  Denmark owes its revivification to the work, I think, more than to anything else, of Bishop Gruntvig in the establishment of Folk Schools. Now the Deputies representing farmers will be pleased to know that these schools are attended in the main by farmers' sons and daughters, in the winter time, and that these farmers' sons and daughters are willing to pay a sum of about £1 per week for three or four months for the purpose of going through a course of tuition in almost everything except agriculture.  They do not go to those schools to learn their business or their profession, or to have instruction in their calling.  They go to them for cultural education, and they come away with a better knowledge, and more capacity for dealing with their industry and their profession, by virtue of the fact that they have learned something about life&mdash;that is, the life round about them&mdash; and the literature and history of their own country and of other countries. Their vision is enlarged, and the use they make of these High Schools is to inspire rather than to instruct.  That has been the real secret of that system and of the development of Denmark on the agricultural side.  I would hope that it would be possible for the Minister to find a way to graft on to the Irish system a system that would allow even the present generation of young men and <Col N="547" /> women to get that same kind of inspiration and knowledge by continuous residential teaching at a High School of the kind, and I would hope that it will be made possible at such schools for the townsmen to mingle closely with the agriculturalist, and that it would not be a system confined to agriculturalists, or set apart in such a way that agriculturalists in the main would be the students, but that we would find a way of mingling for three or four months in the year the townsman and the countryman, so that they could begin to understand each other's ideals and outlook and help each other in the making of a new country. That, I believe, would go very far to help to undo some of the bad work that has been done in recent months and years.  There has been an experiment&mdash; almost more than an experiment&mdash;on very moderate lines, but with the same ideal, conducted in England for the last few years, but lacking the value of the residential period at college.  I am speaking of the Workers' Educational Association, the Central Labour College and the Ruskin College.  While each of these institutions has its defects, they do indicate that amongst industrial workers in England and in Scotland and in Wales, even more particularly in Wales, there has been revived a desire for education on the cultural side, a knowledge of affairs that do not directly affect the earning of a livelihood.  I know of my own knowledge that these institutions have been extremely valuable, and I believe that their adaptation to Ireland, and their extension throughout Ireland, and the co-mingling in such institutions of the agriculturists and the town workers of the country would be of the utmost value for the future development of the country.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Magennis, with all his remarkable eloquence, is able to persuade you that he speaks on this question and other questions with reluctance you may well imagine what my case must be.  There has been so much said here that I am sure the majority of the Deputies present are hoping that I am not going to make any attempt to deal with anything like the whole of it in reply.  Another remark also of Deputy Magennis which struck me was that in connection with the Address <Col N="548" /> itself.  He was overwhelmed by a sense of unreality regarding the address, he said, as a matter of ritual. Well, really, my view of the Address is that, whatever form it may follow, it was a very businesslike document, and probably the reason why the amendment is brought forward is that that document was so businesslike that it made no pretence at all at window-dressing. Otherwise it might have been possible perhaps to promise, when the possibility of accomplishing the promise would come, very great things with regard to education.  The programme that was put before you dealt with things which were intended to be brought before you without delay.  Now, in listening to the discussion that has taken place this evening, a most interesting and valuable discussion, I may say, though I was not overwhelmed, I was very much impressed by the sense of reality, of one reality in particular, and that is that the representatives of the people of Ireland here discussing the subject are under no shadow of doubt whatever that the sovereign power over their own education has at last come to the people of Ireland.  I wish the Deputies could use their eloquence and their power of persuasion to bring that home to the people of Ireland, one and all, outside of this Assembly, and to make them realise, because they really do not realise, and they cannot realise, so great and unexpected is the change that has come, that they have that sovereign power, and that along with it is cast on them enormous responsibilities.  To speak plainly, I assure you I have what I could hardly describe with any other word, a horror of State-made education.  I think the action of the State in a matter of this kind should be, as far as is possible, a response to the feeling and demand of the people.  Otherwise it would hardly be healthy, and it certainly will not produce the fruit that is expected of it. Therefore, I would ask the Deputies who have spoken this evening and the rest of the Deputies as well to do what they can to rouse up the people they represent and to throw all their power into it, all the apostolic power that they feel themselves possessed of with regard to this question of education, and to stir up the people of Ireland, the Irish Nation, into that belief which they do not possess, in the reality and importance <Col N="549" /> of education.  If we have to come here and complain that the parents and people generally and the Press reporters and others are not fully awake to all that education means, very well, let us go abroad and let us get the truth, the true view of these things, into the minds of the people, because, believe me, the right instinct is there; we are not the only perfect people in Ireland; the right instinct is outside as well as inside this Assembly; and, believe me, the people will respond ultimately.  One Deputy made use of a quotation, I think, with regard to what the people of Ireland did in ancient times.  The quotation was hardly accurate.  Certainly our ancestors here in Ireland, whatever may be thought of them for it, did not despise wealth as an element in aristocracy, but it is quite true, on the other hand, that they did appreciate learning as an element in social dignity. Practically, one of their ancient and authentic documents says there is no learning without freedom and without franchise.  The fact that a man acquires the amount of learning that was implied in the mere admission into a public school conferred on him a superior status compared with those who had not this qualification.  That learning, that was provided so remarkably in ancient Ireland, was not provided by the State, and all its extraordinary developments were not due to State influence or State control. They sprang from the instincts of the people, answering to the inspirations of good men.  I think that is the direction in which especially you are to look for educational development in Ireland now and in the future, and to trust that the people, rightly appealed to, will respond to the appeal, and will be in no degree behind their forefathers, or behind anything that you can tell them of their forefathers, in their zeal for education. To come down to details with regard to the actual purport of the amendment, one can recognise at a glance that the legislative programme that has been placed before you was intended to make the necessary provision for bringing under national control the whole public administration formerly carried on under the British Government, and, besides that, for making such adaptation and changes as may be necessary and proper.  So far as education is a matter of Government control, <Col N="550" /> it might be expected that education would be provided for in this programme, and, although the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; does not appear in the programme, I think you will find in time that it is not left unprovided for.  Amongst the measures contemplated and announced there is a Ministries Bill, and such a Bill would naturally deal with the Department of Education and with the scope of that Department.  To say any more about it would be to anticipate the occasion on which that Bill will be presented to you.  More than one Deputy, in speaking on this subject, has dwelt on the fact that Irish education has been hard pressed.  I think the word &ldquo;starved&rdquo; has been used now, as on many previous occasions.  Such expressions carry with them the belief in which we all, I think, concur, that in this matter of education any provisions, to be effective, must be accompanied by financial provisions.  I am sure that at present we have been dealing only in a provisional way with the expenditure of money.  The Estimates that came before us had relation only to the period through which we are passing.  When those Estimates were before us different Deputies were so much under the same sense of fact as I am myself, that no proposal to increase the Estimate for education came from any quarter.</P>

      <P>Well, no suggestions, shall I say?  Although there is no measure labelled by the term education on the programme that is before you, the constitution of the Ministry of Education will necessarily define the scope of that Ministry, and, consequently will, at all events, prepare the way for such co-ordination of the Educational Department as the Government is prepared to put forward.  One of the Deputies who spoke expressed the hope that the Government's educational reforms would not be attempted piecemeal, and I think that is a very sound suggestion.  Deputy Thrift expressed the opinion that the legislative proposals of the Government, while not being delayed, should be comprehensive Although several compliments have been paid to me in the course of this <Col N="551" /> discussion, I do not think that any person present thinks that I personally am competent to produce a comprehensive, all-round measure of educational reform within such a short space of time as I have been occupying this position, nor do I think that a single one of the Deputies who have spoken this evening imagines that even in a very much longer space of time I could bring forward a comprehensive scheme unaided. Deputy Johnson made the suggestion that I should be assisted, in considering the educational programme of the Government, by the Deputies who have spoken here this evening, or a number of them, together with others inside and outside the Dáil.  My own intention has been&mdash;and I have not kept it back from any members of the Dáil who have been in consultation with me about it&mdash;to take such advice as I can get from persons of experience who have an anxious desire at the same time to see reforms in Irish education.  I do not know whether it would be wise on my part, or wise from the point of view of the Dáil, that those persons should be selected from the membership of the Dáil.  It would probably be better, without drawing any lines inclusive or exclusive, that I should be left free to make the selection, and that the members of the Dáil who are capable of criticising should be as free as possible to criticise afterwards when the scheme comes forward.  Without attempting to deal with this business of future Irish educational reform by proposing the creation of another Commission&mdash;for Commissions have, I think, rather a bad name with the public generally; they are looked upon as devices for getting rid of for a time or shelving difficulties rather than for meeting them&mdash;I think I may say that first of all a great deal of enquiry has been made, and a great deal of the results of the enquiries that have been made are available.  The proper means of giving effect to these results, and of drawing the right conclusions from them in concrete form, is to put them in the form of legislative proposals. I do not think it would be contended that those means exist at present, and certainly before I would venture to shape legislative proposals on education I would consider it a duty to look for the best advice that I could get, and I intend to do so.  I have already <Col N="552" /> been taking steps towards doing so, and while I do not intend to announce the names of a Commission, or anything of that kind to the Dáil, I assure them it will be my endeavour to look around impartially to get the soundest advice and constructive proposals, not enquiring and not taking evidence or anything of that kind.  At the same time if there be others who have good advice to give, advice that I do not happen to possess, I would apply directly to such persons for that advice, and I hope they themselves, having the advice which they think will be fruitful, will not withhold it from me.  Besides legislative measures, you all know that a great deal can be done by administrative measures, and Deputy Magennis has spoken of some of the administrative measures which have taken place already in a way which leaves us in a doubt as to whether he wholly disapproves of them, partly disapproves of them, or approves of them. I suppose it is sad to see these ancient Boards&mdash;they are almost ancient now&mdash; passing away.  I say I do not at all pretend to scoff at their personnel, but I think the conviction has been before the public for a long time that these Boards, their multiplicity, and, in some cases the multiplicity of their members, did not constitute a good basis for an educational system, and that the passing away of those Boards at some time or another was inevitable.  A great deal of administrative work has taken place.  We have heard the new programmes; they may have come forward in a way which was as characteristic of the stormy times through which we are passing as many other events that you are familiar with. By and bye we will settle down into a much more formal way, a more ritual way of doing these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it will be expected, especially of me, as this responsibility has been placed on me, to make some statement to the Dáil with regard to the position of the National language in the schools.  I need hardly state to those who are familiar with the facts, that the position of the Irish language in the schools is steadily improving.  Many schools which had not formerly taken up the teaching of Irish are taking it up now.  The number of schools teaching Irish is increasing, the extent to which Irish is being taught in the schools <Col N="553" /> is increasing, and I think I can say, with confidence, that the quality of the teaching is improving.  It is obvious that the next few years will be a time of great and critical importance with regard to the Irish language in the schools.  That we have all before us. Now the provisions that have already been made in favour of teaching Irish, and the provisions already made for the training of teachers for the teaching of Irish, and through Irish, those provisions or not less effective provisions will, I trust, be maintained with the support of this Assembly and with the support of the people.  There is one aspect in particular in which a new development must arise, and will arise without the necessity, I think, of any special legislation. It follows naturally from one of the Articles of the Constitution which deals with the language.  From that Article it follows that in future Civil Service examinations in Ireland the Irish language will be a standard subject.  Again, those who are familiar with the general course of education in this country know that hardly any influence has so profoundly shaped education in the Universities, in the Secondary Schools, and in the Primary Schools as the examinations of the British Civil Service hitherto.  I remember giving evidence on behalf of the Gaelic League a number of years ago before a Commission which was appointed especially in connection with the Universities and the higher Civil Service, and an Englishman who sat in that Commission thought that I rather over-stated the case when I said to him that the Civil Service programme&mdash;the Civil Service year book&mdash;very deeply influenced even Irish primary education in the most remote parts of Ireland.  He said he could hardly believe that, and in order to persuade him of it I told him a little anecdote which, I am sure, is familiar to some of you&mdash;I daresay it was an invention, but it illustrated the fact, at all events&mdash;about people coming into a country house after a baby had arrived in the house, and how one of the neighbours remarked to the parents, &ldquo;What a grand sorter he will make.&rdquo;  If it had been in County Galway he would have been a gauger, I am told.  At all events, the joke illustrates the fact that the Civil Service programme goes right into the villages and remote country districts <Col N="554" /> in Ireland in its influence in the schools. If it has done that in the past it will do it in the future, and I look forward to the Irish language obtaining that position of a standard subject as one of the most effective means in giving the language a position of advantage in the schools.</P>
    <P>Many other things have been mentioned in regard to the educational ideal, and with regard to the general lines of educational reform.  Really, these things have been so well discussed this evening that it will hardly be necessary to add anything to the discussion.  As to primary and secondary education, for my part I do not see why there should be any division between them.  I do not know where the dividing line begins and ends.  I do not know what part of mathematics is primary and what part is secondary.  If a child of eight years of age commences to learn French, and if that be primary instruction in French, what time does it pass into secondary? Or if another child does not commence French until 15 years of age, then French is secondary for that child, whereas it was primary for the other. This whole division between primary and secondary education seems to me to be totally artificial, and if a fusion can be accomplished, and I think it can, I think we should aim at it&mdash;I am not going to pretend to lay down the ways and means here&mdash;I think we should aim at such a fusion and that it would be altogether desirable.  The question of the Universities is a different one.  They are autonomous bodies, and I think it is best that they are autonomous bodies, and the fact that the University men present are so thoroughly convinced of that fact should bear out for the rest of you the truth of what I put forward as an axiom at the commencement of my remarks, and that is that autonomous education, believe me, is better than State-made education.</P>

      <P>While the statement made by the Minister for Education is not to my mind, in any case, altogether satisfactory, it does certainly clear up some points of doubt and some <Col N="555" /> progress has been indicated.  He has recalled to our mind what I must confess I did not advert to, that by the introduction of the Ministries Bill the position of the Education Department will be regularised, and I hope when that particular phase of the Ministries Bill is going through that we will have a full opportunity of debating the matter and criticising the proposals of the Government with regard to that.  He also showed that something pretty tangible was being done in the way of enquiring into the position with a view to preparing legislation and setting about the work of educational legislation at the earliest possible moment.  I may say, if I might be permitted, that there was one particular point which he stressed very much, which seemed rather strange to me.  That was that this work was for the people outside rather than for this Parliament.  I look upon the Parliament here as the mouthpiece of the people, and, therefore, it is the duty and the privilege of this Parliament to speak for the people and to promulgate their educational legislation for them. But I propose in view of what the Minister has said not to press my amendment to a division.  I may say that what has impelled me most to that decision is the difficulty which it would create for Deputies like Deputy Thrift, and others too who have not spoken, in having to vote in this particular matter against what, perhaps, are their own best feelings in the matter.  I feel that they are, or, most of them, all, perhaps, as anxious as I am to get and see this through at the earliest possible moment. I do not want, therefore, to put them into a position whereby they might be misunderstood in any vote they might give, and I therefore ask leave of the Dáil to withdraw my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment by leave withdrawn.</P>

      <P>For the information of the Dáil, I just want to say that the President has received a letter from the Chairman of the Great Southern and Western Railway pointing out that, in view of the statement made here yesterday, his Board has considered the matter very fully, and, in view of the difficulties that might be placed in the way of all parties, that they have decided on carrying on from the 8th, that is the date on which their notice expires, and in which they guarantee to pay the same wages as the other companies, and carry on, as far as possible, as far as their financial resources will allow.  That means that the question of control lapses.</P>
