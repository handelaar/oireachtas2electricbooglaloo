      <P>(An Clár) asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that considerable dissatisfaction is expressed by the residents of Miltown-Malbay, Lahinch, and Ennistymon, in respect of the awards made to them in respect of the destruction of their property by British Forces in September, 1920, that it is claimed that awards were made without any evidence being heard from the applicants, and that the Commission actually refused to hear their evidence; whether, in consideration of the awards made by the County Court Judge at Ennis, and the absence of the applicants' evidence at the Commission, further inquiry will be made.</P>

      <P>The Compensation (Ireland) Commission is an independent tribunal set up by agreement between the British Government and the Government of Saorstát Eireann, and is not, therefore, under the control of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that in individual cases claimants have expressed dissatisfaction with the awards of the Commission, but there is no reason to believe that their awards are otherwise than fair and reasonable.  There is no appeal against a decision made by the Commission, and no further inquiry is, therefore, possible in the cases alluded to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the <Col N="1181" /> new regulations governing appointments to the permanent Prisons Service are such as to debar practically all the temporary warders now serving; whether the great majority of these temporary warders volunteered to join the National Army last year and were requested to remain at their posts; and whether, in view of the valuable experience they have gained, he will consider the desirability of making them eligible for the permanent service, subject to their passing a medical test.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing appointments to the permanent Prisons Service do not debar temporary warders who are within the prescribed limits of age (i.e., 20 to 30 years).  Before appointment to the permanent service candidates will be required to satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners that their character and health are satisfactory, and that they are sufficiently educated in certain prescribed subjects.  In the cases of persons who have practical experience of a trade, or who have served with the National Forces, the maximum limit of age is extended to 35 years.  I am not prepared to authorise a similar extension for all temporary warders.  In July, 1922, a number of temporary warders volunteered for service in the Army, but it was not convenient to release these men from the Prisons Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The alterations in the regulations were made to enable the men who served with the National Forces to be employed up to 35 years of age.  The suggestion underlying the question was that because some temporary warders volunteered for service in the Army and were not released no age limit should apply to any temporary <Col N="1182" /> warder for appointment to the permanent service.  That is something that we are not prepared to concede. The records of the Department show that not more than 29 volunteered on the 22nd of July, and of these eight were over the age of 40.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been called to the large number of unemployed persons who have been disqualified from receiving Unemployment Insurance Benefit under Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, on the ground that twelve contributions have not been paid during the current insurance year, and whether he is aware of the hardship suffered by many people as a result of this provision, and if he intends to amend the law in this respect?</P>

      <P>A certain number of persons are no doubt, disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit under Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, but the benefit year, which only began on 17th October last, has been too short a period in operation for any statistics to be available as to the number of such persons.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to revert to a system of benefit not supported by contributions, which would appear to be the only amendment of the present law relating to unemployment insurance that would afford the relief contemplated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The intentions of the Government in regard to assisting unemployment were indicated generally in the course of the statement made by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil on the 2nd November, when it was explained that the initiation of any measures of housing or road expenditure would be contingent upon the Government being satisfied that a reasonable adjustment had been reached both of prices and wages.  It is hoped that the proposals then referred to will be fully elaborated at a very early date. It is not intended to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, by reverting to any system of benefit not supported by contributions.</P>

There is therefore no money at present available for the relief of distress in this district.  Should a fund become available in the future the claims of this district will have due consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why an Old Age Pension award made in respect of Mrs. Winifred Hehir, of 1 Corkally Lane, Ennis, by the Co.

      <P>A claim from Mrs. Winifred Hehir for the old age pension <Col N="1185" /> was disallowed on the 30th January, 1923, and her case has not since come up on appeal.  A previous pension claim from her was disallowed on the 19th April, 1917.  The baptismal certificate of the claimant was not produced. No record of her marriage could be traced in the General Register Office, Dublin, and her name was not included in the return of her family at the Census of March, 1851.  It does not appear from the official papers that any evidence of age was put forward in this case.  The Co. Clare Pension Committee stated that they were satisfied on appearance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy McGoldrick in answer to his question of the 27th March last in regard to proof of age of claimants for the old age pension.  I shall give the Deputy a copy of that reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the practice when a birth or baptismal certificate cannot be procured, and the Census records are not available, to consider, in conjunction with the other facts of the case, affidavits from persons of standing who have known the claimant for a sufficiently long time, and who testify as to his age from knowledge based on definite past events.  The affidavits should give in detail the grounds for <Col N="1186" /> the opinions expressed and statements made therein, and should set forth relevant facts bearing on the life history of the claimant, such as date of marriage of his parents, and his own position amongst the children, especially as compared with a brother or sister whose age had been established.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in the reply to Deputy McGoldrick, it is obvious that an affidavit would not of itself suffice to establish age, and would require verification.</P>

      <P>The baptismal certificate of the claimant was not produced, and his age at marriage, on the 31st January, 1882, was then recorded as 25 years.</P>
      <P>A sister of the claimant was baptised on the 30th July, 1855, and his brother furnished an affidavit dated 7th September, 1923, in which he stated that he was an old age pensioner and would be 73 years old in October, 1923; that his brother John was the next born in the family after deponent and before the sister, and that he had heard old people say there was a period of two years between his age and that of the claimant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Finance to make a short explanatory statement with regard to the Loan which is about to be issued.</P>
      <P>The Loan consists of ten millions of 5 per cent. stock issued at 95 per cent. These terms are very favourable to investors in comparision with gilt edged issues at present on the market.  The British 5 per cent.  War Loan is quoted at over 100.  The Commonwealth Government of Australia recently issued a 5 per cent.  Loan in London at 99, and the present quotation is nearly 100.  South Africa also issued recently a 5 per cent. Loan at 99½, and the present quotation is slightly in excess of the issue price.</P>
      <P>The better terms granted by the Free State are due, primarily, to the fact that the credit of the country is an unknown factor in the outside world. In fact the financial position of the Free State should be at least as sound as that of the Dominion Governments mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and the actual security afforded for the present Loan, namely, the Central Fund, may be regarded as absolute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial Sinking Fund is provided in connection with this Loan. This will tend to keep up the market price after issue, as the Sinking Fund <Col N="1193" /> will be used to purchase stock that may be quoted on the market at or under par.  For the purposes of the Loan generally, £750,000 a year is set aside. Out of this, the interest on outstanding stock will be paid, and the balance, which will increase automatically as the years go on, will be used for the purpose of the Sinking Fund.</P>
    <P>The Loan is a Trustee security for Trustees in the Free State.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of Southern subscribers, and of the Cork Stock Exchange, a Register of the Loan is being established in Cork.  This is the first time that a Government Stock Register is being maintained in that city. It will enable dealings in the Loan to take place expeditiously in Cork, and without any necessity for brokers having to pass on their business to outside centres.</P>
    <P>Dividends will be paid without any deduction of income tax at the source. Persons receiving such dividends, who are not within the income tax limit, will, therefore, be saved any trouble about applying for refunds of tax.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of the Loan is that there is a prospect that the substantial yield which it allows will be payable over a considerable period of years.  The Loan is not bound to be redeemed until 1945, but the Government has an option of redemption in 1935, or later.  It is probable that holders can count upon keeping the Loan until 1945.  In the case of the British 5 per cent.  War Loan, the position in this respect is much less satisfactory. In that case, redemption must take place not later than 1947, but the Government may redeem in 1929.  It is highly probable that the power to redeem in 1929 will be exercised by the British Government in that case.</P>
    <P>This characteristic of the Free State Loan makes it of special value to Trustees and others who want to obtain a good income over a considerable period.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Loan is primarily an internal issue has several advantages. An issue abroad would have to be made at a less favourable rate.  This would directly result in imposing a heavier burden on the E chequer, and, <Col N="1194" /> therefore, in tending to keep taxation at a high level.  Moreover, the dividends received by home subscribers will swell their, income and assist the yield of income tax, whereas dividends paid to foreigners produce no similar return for this country.  Again, borrowing abroad is one of several methods by which inflation can most readily be achieved.  This evil is far less likely to arise when the Government borrows from the savings of the country itself.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the Government should go directly to the banks for the money that it requires and ask them to supply its needs out of the large deposits that they hold.  The answer is that the Government have already done this on the limited scale on which alone it is justifiable.  Larger borrowing by the Government from the banks would be directly inflationary, and could not be reconciled with sound principles of finance.  The same objections do not arise if individuals, who have deposits in the bank, take steps to transfer them to the Government by way of subscription to the Loan.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of all substantial holders of money is very important for the Loan, and it is very desirable that they should understand that the commercial interests of the country will benefit greatly through the Loan being a success.  Taxation will thereby tend to be kept down, and the credit and stability of the country assured. The establishing of a sound credit now will contribute directly towards the financing of the State on a cheaper basis in future.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Loan, however, make special provision also for attracting small investors.  The Loan can be obtained in blocks as small as £10, and even that amount can be subscribed by instalments spread over a period of three months.  The numerous advantages of having many small investors in Government securities scattered throughout the country need no emphasis.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked me to add that he invites the hearty co-operation of all members of the Dáil and Seanad towards making the Loan the success it ought to be, towards making it a great act of faith on the part of the <Col N="1195" /> people of the country in their own future as a self-governing community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking the leave of the Dáil to introduce this Bill I desire to make a few preliminary observations describing the scope of the Bill, so that I can, with confidence, ask the Dáil to give it a First Reading. It is a Bill that fulfils, or attempts to fulfil, the promises of many people, not only upon these benches, but on other benches.  It is a Bill, which if passed, will mean the Nationalisation of the Irish Railways, and the co-ordination of all the transport services of the country, including all communications, that is to say, railways, canals, roads, postal service, aerial communication and the like.  It will be said that this is a considerable undertaking, and I agree it is; but it is not proposed in the Bill that all this work of co-ordination will be accomplished on a given date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended, shortly, that there shall be established a Ministry of Transport and Communication, and that that Ministry will be responsible to the Oireachtas for all the Departments that come within its scope, including posts and postal services.  It would eventually mean the absorption of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs into the Ministry of Transport and Communication.  It is intended that the railway undertakings shall be transferred on appointed dates to the care and charge of the Ministry of Transport.  The Minister for Transport will be responsible to the Oireachtas. He may or may not be, as may be decided, a member of the Dáil.  He will be a Minister, not a member of the Executive Council.  The actual management of the railways will be undertaken by a Director of Railways, who will be in supreme command of the actual workings, subject to the Minister of Transport and Communication.  The Director of Railways will be assisted and advised by a Council, or Board, representative of the interests concerned in the railway traffic, agriculture, commerce, manufacture and workers generally and the Treasury.  The intention is that the transfer shall be on a basis to be fixed by a tribunal consisting of three persons, the chairman being one who has held a high judicial office and <Col N="1197" /> two competent accountants, one of whom shall be nominated by, or approved by the railway companies.</P>
    <P>It is intended that railway stock will be issued by the State in exchange for present holdings, the stock being either in the form of redeemable stock certificates carrying 4½ per cent. or terminable annuity certificates carrying 4½ per cent. for the first five years and 4¾ per cent. for sixty-seven years.  The financial effect of this option upon the State being identical, terminable annuity certificates being probably in many cases desired by the present stock holders, in other cases the redeemable certificates at 4½ per cent. with ¼ per cent. of Sinking Fund being preferred. It is proposed that the tribunal to be set up to decide the price at which the railways will be taken over by the State will determine the value according to all the circumstances, but imposing upon the tribunal a maximum price, such maximum to be based upon the average profits earned and distributed during the five years preceding 1914. It is calculated that the railways will by this means be enabled to carry on in such a manner as will allow of a reduction in railway charges, improvement in the services, dealing fairly with stock-holders, and generally serving the interests both of the community as a whole and the industrial, agricultural, and passenger interests at the same time.  It is proposed to set up a rates tribunal, a rates tribunal being a semi-independent body whose functions will be to fix rates in such a manner as will pay the charges without seeking any margin.  The rates tribunal proposition is one which, I think, should commend itself to all agricultural and industrial interests.  It is proposed also that charges upon county councils or baronies in respect of those railways which have been guaranteed shall be removed and that the county councils shall be relieved of any liability in respect of their guarantees.  The position of the employees of the railway companies is safeguarded on much the same lines as have been agreed upon and decided by the recent Bill passed in Great Britain touching the amalgamation of the companies over there.  It is intended that, so far as respects the railways over which at present the Oireachtas has no jurisdiction, <Col N="1198" /> the date of transfer to the State shall be deferred until a decision is taken as to the transfer of those railways or such portion of them as may be decided upon.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if it receives the First Reading, will be printed and a memorandum will be circulated with it describing succinctly the intentions of the Bill.  I may say that we have been living for a year in expectation that the Government would have introduced a Bill to deal with railways in the Saortat.  That hope has not been fulfilled yet, and we have sought therefore to fill the gap and to submit such a Bill as we would reasonably expect the Government, not a Labour Government, might themselves introduce.</P>
    <P>This, I may tell the Dáil, is not a Bill which fulfils all the equities, as I would conceive them.  It is very generous in its interpretation of the rights of stockholders.  It is such a Bill as might, without any stretch of imagination, have been introduced by Deputy Hewat combined with Deputy Gorey. It is not, as I say, a Bill which fulfils all the equities as I conceive them, but it is a Bill designed to secure general support.  Certainly such a Bill as I would like to see enacted would require a considerable period of education of the public, and the circumstances of the day do not justify, perhaps, experiments of a kind which might be risky. In introducing the Bill we have sought to avoid extravagances or experiments which would lead the public or members of the Dáil to shy off because of its experimental nature.  If the Bill is granted a First Reading, as I confidently hope, I would ask the Dáil and the Government to consider very carefully the proposals of the Bill, and perhaps one may hope that it may even be taken over as a Government measure after the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>We recognise quite clearly that a Bill of this kind, imposing a charge upon the State, cannot get beyond a Second Reading unless the Government is prepared to move the Financial Resolution which is requisite.  I plead at least for careful consideration of the proposals of this Bill, and if it cannot be taken over as a whole that it will be considered as a serious attempt to meet <Col N="1199" /> the transport problem and a serious proposal for the co-ordination of all those services which are requisite to carry on the trade, commerce and social life of the community, those services of transport and communication.  So far from the Bill being a real charge upon the community it will be, as I contend, a valuable asset, and will enable the credit of the community to stand higher, so that future loans may be floated on more favourable terms for the State.  I beg to move that leave be granted to introduce &ldquo;A Bill to provide for the acquisition by the State of Railways in Saorstat Eireann, for the management of such Railways and the Post Office, and for the co-ordination of Road, Motor, Aerial and other transport services and for purposes connected therewith.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Government Electors Registration Bill.  I was obliged to make a Second Reading statement when introducing this Bill last Wednesday, so that I have not very much new to add to what I said on that occasion.  The object of this Bill is to legalise the position with regard to the preparation of the Register for Local Government electors.  If the letter of the law had been complied with, this <Col N="1200" /> Register should have come into force on the 15th October, but the Electoral Bill does not apply to Local Government electors, and the Representation of the People Act is to that extent still in operation.  Owing to the dissolution of the Dáil, to the high pressure of other legislative duties, and to the fact that in actual practice it has been found impossible to prepare a Register in the period elapsing between the 15th July, the end of the qualifying period under the Representation of the People Act, and the 15th October, the Register did not come into operation.  Accordingly it now devolves upon us to amend the Representation of the People Act retrospectively, that is, by fixing a date later than the 15th July as the date for the end of the qualifying period, and for the beginning of the Register of Local Government electors.  The Electoral Act fixes November 15th as the date for the beginning of the Register of Dáil electors, and that is the obvious date for starting the preparation of the Register of Local Government Electors also.  It is obvious from the point of view of time, since it is certainly to the interest of all of us to have this Local Government Register compiled as soon as possible, obvious from the point of view of economy, since otherwise additional expenditure will have to be incurred in the way of paying officials for double work, double travelling, and for double printing.  I can see no valid reason why those two Registers should not be compiled at the same time, and if any Deputy does see a reason, I think the onus is on him to prove it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Elections Postponement (Amendment) Bill.  This <Col N="1201" /> Bill, as is obvious to everybody, does not necessarily of itself postpone the Local Government elections beyond January 1st: all it does is to give power to do so if circumstances make it necessary.  The fact that the new register will not be in force by that date, the fact that a large portion of the current rate is still outstanding, and that an election held at present would give an excuse to defaulters for withholding payment still longer and thus put an unfair burden on newly elected bodies, and also the fact that several emergency measures, such as the Local Authorities Indemnity Bill which, amongst other things, protects local authorities from surcharges for acts done under the authority of the old Dáil are reasons why this Bill should, if possible, be passed before asking people to incur the responsibility of seeking election to these public bodies.  All these facts constitute, I believe, a sufficient argument for not having the Local Government elections before January 1st, even if Deputies were agreed that the Christmas holidays is a convenient time to hold such elections.  One Deputy complained that this election is hanging like the Sword of Damocles over the heads of the representatives of local bodies, but it might be well for all of us occasionally to reflect that that is a condition incidental to public life in general, and is not confined to representatives of local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another Deputy has complained that in this Bill no mention has been made of a change in the franchise.  Now, such a change is one of the most fundamental and revolutionary acts that any Government can undertake, and would cut right across the whole field of local government administration.  Before making such a change, it should certainly be very well weighed and long considered.  For me, at this stage, to introduce such a revolutionary measure in this perfunctory manner, after being scarcely a month in office, would amount to little less than an insult to every Deputy.  This Bill is a purely emergency measure.  It is not intended in any way to be contentious, and I hope to get it through without any opposition. That being so, it would be <Col N="1202" /> very illogical for me to confuse the issue by introducing any contentious matter.</P>

      <P>I do not think that really fits conveniently into the discussion. I have not been able to fix on any period for holding these elections. It depends on how I fare after getting certain Bills through.  It is generally admitted that local government at present is not in a satisfactory condition. Some people blame the personnel, and some the system.  It is not much use holding an election until we are sure that the bodies returned will give satisfaction. If in the meantime we find that it will be necessary to change the system and to find some means of changing the personnel we will be obliged to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can plainly conceive that the reasons given by the Minister are sufficient for the postponement of the elections, but when passing the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill we passed Clause 14, which specified that no person should hold an office of profit under a local authority <Col N="1203" /> until after an election held after the passing of that Act.  At the time we passed that provision we understood an election would have taken place in September or October, but now, for reasons which it is not for me to state, the election is to be postponed for probably another year.  I contend it is not right that any member of a public board should be at present in a position of holding an office of profit when he is at the same time a member of the board, in a position of master, an employee of himself, and in a position to grant the man who is supervising him a rise of salary.  That is what is taking place.  If the Minister would amend Clause 14 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 9 so that no person shall hold any office of profit under, or be employed for remuneration by, any local authority of which he is a member, then we would be quite satisfied.</P>
      <P>Then it goes on: &ldquo;from and after the holding of an election or appointment of members of such local authority next held after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  That is the law at the moment, so that at present a person can be a member of a local body and, at the same time, receive payment from that body.  I do not think that is right. While this Bill legalises a number of irregularities, we never conceived that that sort of thing would be continued for such a long period.</P>

      <P>I have not got a legal mind, but I think if I read it again the Minister will see that it can happen.  It is happening at present, and I can give instances of it.  I know several members of local boards working for local authorities of which they are members. The Section reads: &ldquo;No person shall hold any office of profit under, or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority from and after the holding of an election or appointment of members of such local authority next held after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  Does that not mean that he can hold it until the election after the passing of this Act?  There has been no election since.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in view of the attempt to postpone the elections still further the operation of the law as it stands &mdash; not the law as Deputy Wilson reads it &mdash; is depleting the local boards of useful members without being able to put others in their places.  The Government are, as a matter of fact, by the carrying out of the law as it stands, interpreting it as they are doing, depriving the local authorities of the assistance and help of qualified members and postponing the chances of replacing those members by others who <Col N="1205" /> may be as competent to carry on their operation.  I would suggest that the proviso in the Act that is referred to should be made to read that until the new franchise and the new Local Government Bill is passed the present members of the councils should be allowed to continue to sit.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson has succeeded admirably in causing a certain amount of confusion.  At no time could a member of a public body, a member of a local authority, be in the employment or be in contractual relations with a public body of which he was a member.  The provision in the Act went somewhat further, and stated that a member of a local authority could not be an employee of another local authority in the same or an adjoining county.  That means that an official of the Dublin County Council could not be a member of the Dublin Corporation, and vice versa.  Not in my memory, at any rate, has there ever been the position in which a member of a specific local authority could be in the employment of that local authority or be in contractual relations with that local authority.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Authorities (Indemnity) Bill, 1923.  I think most Deputies are familiar with the facts that led up to the situation this Bill is intended to remedy.  During the period that elapsed between the summer of 1920 and the coming into operation of the Treaty two authorities were struggling for supreme control of Local Government in Ireland.  You had on the one hand the British Local Government Board, supported by British law and by British bayonets, and on the other hand the Irish Local Government Department, supported by public opinion, by the Dáil Courts and by the <Col N="1207" /> Irish Republican Army.  Throughout the territory at present comprised in the Irish Free State, and in some areas outside it, the public bodies were almost unanimous in giving their allegiance to the Irish Local Government Department.  In order to make for continuity of administration it was necessary for the Dáil Local Government Department to adopt the greater portion of the legal code of the British Local Government Board.  Accordingly, by decree number I. of the First Session of 1921 the Dáil enacted as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is hereby declared that the Local Government code of law in operation in Ireland up to and including the 17th day of September, 1920, be and is hereby adopted, subject to such amendment and alteration as may be directed by order of the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann, with the approval of the Minister, such order or orders to be ratified at the first meeting of the Dáil following the making of same.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not come within the provisions of this Bill. Under the powers conferred by this Decree orders were issued, inconsistent with the ordinary Local Government Statutes, by the Dáil Local Government Department to local authorities throughout the country.  I may say that the British Local Government Board <Col N="1208" /> offended in a similar way against its own Statutes.  Owing to the circumstances under which this Department was carried on, it was not always possible to conform to these regulations in issuing these Orders, which are usually and properly associated with the administration and legislation of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>Owing to the deficiency and imperfection of the records of the period, it is very difficult to verify these orders by legal evidence.  The following are a few examples of the kind of illegalities which arose out of the situation, and which this Bill is intended to remedy. To begin with, superannuation granted by local authorities as a general rule required to be sanctioned by the British Local Government Board.  The local bodies who gave their allegiance to Dáil Eireann were unable and unwilling to ask for such sanction, and accordingly sanction was not given.  Most of those acts were sanctioned by the Dáil Local Government Department, but evidence of such sanction is not always to be found.</P>
      <P>The same situation arises with regard to loans and to increases of salaries. The present position is that all such payments were illegal payments and must be surcharged by the auditor. Moreover, any rates struck on estimates of which such extra legal payment formed a part, are illegal and may be quashed on <i>certiorari.</i>  Other difficulties arise owing to the fact that certain officials refused to carry out the orders of Dáil Eireann, and consequently local authorities were asked to undertake duties which were outside their statutory powers.  For example, County Councils were asked to begin the preparation of a Register through their Secretaries, although this was a duty for the Clerk of the Crown and Peace, and, <i>ultra vires</i>, of the Council.  Several acts of a similar kind were committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty arose owing to the fact that because of the passing of the Criminal Injuries Act by the British Parliament, it became necessary for local authorities to conceal the whereabouts of their funds.  The Dáil ordered those authorities to transfer their funds from their local treasurer to un-named trustees.  The present <Col N="1209" /> position actually is that all such transfers were illegal and must be surcharged against the individuals concerned.  To enforce such surcharges would be obviously unfair and unjust. At the same time, if we remit all those surcharges under this Bill, there will be no means of coming at those individuals who have been guilty of misappropriation.  Efforts have been made unsuccessfully to find some test or criterion other than the Minister's simple approval of the legality of those acts which it is intended to regularise. So many different kinds of acts are involved and so many grounds for illegalities exist, and, as I said before, the documentary evidence of records is so imperfect, it has been found necessary to ask for those powers, admittedly very wide, in order to clear up the confusion.</P>

      <P>The other day, on the introduction of the Bill, I asked the Minister if it would make any provision to have County Councils indemnified against any claim rate-collectors might have against them because of the fact that they refused to carry out the duties they were asked to carry out in 1920.  He has pointed out that in that period, soon after the County Council elections, garnishee orders were secured against County Councils and other bodies with a view to securing payments in respect of claims for malicious injuries.  An order was sent from the Dáil Local Government Department ordering County Councils to change their funds from the National Bank, as it was in many cases, to trustees whose names were not disclosed.  Speaking for Co. Wexford, I know that that order was carried out immediately.  We were also told to ask rate-collectors if they were prepared to carry out any instructions in that direction, and if they were not prepared to do that we should inform them that we were not in a position to superannuate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was closely in touch with the thing all the time in Co. Wexford, and I am aware that all but four men refused to carry out the instructions.  They refused to resign, but they kept their <Col N="1210" /> books and their homes had to be raided to secure the books.  During the present year these men, through their Solicitors, made application to the County Councils for superannuation, which, I think, they are entitled to under British Law.  An inquiry was held under the presidency of Mr. Justice While and he made an award giving these people the maximum pension.  If this is going to be carried into effect it will cost the County Council something in the vicinity of 3d. in the £.  I would like to know definitely if the Minister has power to prevent the payment of this.  I do not think it is fair to ask the County Councils, who carried out definite instructions, to pay those people, and it is not fair to encourage those people, who refused to help the Council when we were in the throes of the war with the British.</P>
    <P>If it is absolutely mandatory that these people should get superannuated, the matter should be considered under the financial clauses of the Treaty, or whatever Article of the Treaty makes Provision for the compensation of certain officials.  At any rate this should not be a local charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that any other decrees issued by that authority will be made available.  It has been very difficult to obtain access to those decrees, and if one decree can be made the basis of a Bill, other decrees may, for all we know, affect our consideration of this Bill.  There may have been decrees contradictory to the first decree.  In any case, if they are to be considered as part of the Governmental Acts of the last few years, they ought to be available to the members of the Dáil and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Bill before us seeks, on behalf of the Local Government Ministry, to make valid any act of the local authority, or to remit any penalty that may have been incurred by the failure <Col N="1211" /> to carry out any duty that was imposed upon the local authority during certain years.  It seems to me that complementary to this Bill, and it ought to be part of the Bill, there should be a provision of this kind, that any act of a local authority which was validated by the Minister at the time should be considered to be valid, and ought not to be annullable, if that is a word which is allowable, by the present Minister without authority.  I am referring to the decisions that were taken by the local authority in regard to payments for services rendered to those local authorities by employees of those local authorities.</P>
    <P>Proposals were made and orders given which were sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government, and on that sanction being given, rates of pay for nurses and others were fixed.  The Minister comes along to-day and says notwithstanding the fact that the local authority was acting in accordance with its powers, and that it submitted its proposals to the Ministry for Local Government at the time, and those proposals were sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government at the time, those decisions are now being declared invalid and annulled by the present Minister for Local Government, or by the late Minister for Local Government. I submit that there should be embodied in this Bill, and it should be complementary to the proposals in the Bill, that where the Minister for Local Government validated an action of the local authorities in this period, from the 31st March, 1920, to the 6th December, 1922, that these decisions of the existing Local Government Minister should be declared in this Bill to be valid.  It seems to me that that is a reasonable proposition, and ought, on the face of it, to be acceptable.  I hope the Minister, in reply, will intimate to the Dáil that he is prepared to accept or embody in the Bill on the next Reading some Clause to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the point raised by Deputy Corish, because I have some special, intimate knowledge of the state of affairs that existed in the Local Government sphere in the year 1920.  The <Col N="1212" /> position of rate collectors throughout the country, after the break with the British Local Government Board, was an extremely difficult one, and one that I had considerable sympathy with, although, in the position I occupied at the time, I could not give rein to that sympathy.  Here were men who had entered into bonds, men who had gone to their friends and neighbours and asked them to stand as their securities, and because a political movement arose in the country advocating a certain course, with which they might or might not be personally in agreement, they were invited by their local authorities to act in a manner contrary to the bonds into which they had entered, and contrary to the law as it stood, without any real confidence that that law and the authority behind it would ultimately be upset and overwhelmed.  Now, naturally we brought considerable pressure, amounting almost to compulsion, on these people.  Naturally we fulminated against them, against their treachery and disloyalty, and against their unpatriotic conduct, and so on. But all the time anyone with a real grasp of the situation knew that from the human point of view these men were in a serious predicament.  Some of them may not have been thinking entirely of themselves.  They were probably thinking a good deal of those who had been so good to them as to become their sureties.  And while a man might be willing to incur considerable loss himself, he is less willing to involve in loss people who had befriended him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the situation, and that was the position of the rate collectors, and most of the rate collectors through the country gave trouble.  Most of them hung back in dismay at this extra-legal course which they were expected to take.  Some of them were dismissed, until we found that it was bad business to dismiss them.  We found the following week in the local papers a notice from the Local Government Board warning the people against paying to the new rate collectors, and pointing out to them that they might find themselves in the position of having to pay again to a duly and legally appointed rate collector.  A good many anomalies cropped up in the course of that <Col N="1213" /> struggle and a good many points of friction arose.  But it does not become us, who, after all, won that struggle, to try and go back now and in any way victimise or in any way lean against the people with whom we had differences. And now at any rate, if not then when the strife was on, we should realise that these men were placed in a very difficult position indeed, and we should realise that not all the country was Sinn Fein, not all the country approved of the course that we were taking, and that the rate collector as much as anyone else was entitled to his individual views.  There was the further fact of his bond, the consideration which he ought to have for his sureties. That is his side of the thing, and I am putting it because the other side has been put so strongly by Deputy Corish. I am putting it also because I cannot be expected to have any considerable amount of sympathy with these people who are causing the President and myself, in the position we held then, the utmost embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I take it that Deputy Corish is speaking from a brief, from the point of view of his own particular Local Authority, which is in danger of being mulcted to compensate people who, as he would put it, and the members of his Local Authority would put it, let them down in the past.  That would be a matter which I suggest Deputy Corish should take up with the Minister for Local Government.  But I stand for this that either by the Local Authority or the Central Authority those men should be compensated, and there should be no victimisation now, and no leaning against these men now.  They were simply the victims of circumstances. They had their own views at the time.  But we won that struggle, and we should not be ungenerous now, and advocate or give any countenance to a policy of <i>vac victis.</i></P>

      <P>It is not my intention at all to do these people out of any remuneration if they were deserving of it. I say that that was a national matter, and the local authorities should not be called upon to pay it.  It has created a great amount of discontent.  Deputy Doyle knows that we had great difficulty with it in the Co. Council, and that we <Col N="1214" /> had difficulty in preventing the whole Council from resigning over the matter.</P>

It is not a matter on which you can lay down any hard and fast rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MICHAEL DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can bear out fully the statement made by Deputy Corish.  We carried out the orders which we received from the Dáil as faithfully as they could be carried out by any county, and we carried them out within six inches of British bayonets. I do not for one moment want to deprive the Rate Collectors who did not do the work of their rights, or to do them any injustice; but if they are to be compensated it is not fair to mulct the County Wexford ratepayers for this compensation.  Their representatives did this, and did it to the best of their ability and in good faith, under the instructions of the Dáil at that time, and I hold it would be a great injustice to the ratepayers to be asked now to compensate these men.  They should be compensated from a national fund, if there is such a thing, or the money should be found from some national sources.  The ratepayers should not be mulcted, and if we in County Wexford thought at the last meeting of the County Council that the ratepayers were to be mulcted in this sum because they faithfully abided by the decision of the Dáil at the time, not a single member would have remained a member of the Council for five minutes.  It was with the greatest difficulty, and only after the <Col N="1215" /> greatest persuasion from the Chairman, that we induced the Council to hold on until the matter was considered here in the Dáil.  The whole Council would have resigned otherwise.  Probably the Minister might say that would be a good thing, but we in Wexford do not think so, because the Council has done its duty, and is doing its duty at the present time.</P>

      <P>I ask leave to take my two amendments together. They are (1) in sub-section (2) line 23, to delete the words &ldquo;not at any time,&rdquo; and (2) In sub-section (2) line 24 to delete the words &ldquo;more than.&rdquo; The object of these amendments is to establish the principle that there shall always be three Commissioners.  Under the Bill as it stands, it would be possible that there might be merely one Commissioner, and that is a matter to which the Civil Service, in so far as their views are represented by the Civil Service Federation, attach considerable importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They feel that though they are beyond the reach of examination themselves that recruitment of the service is a matter of considerable importance to them both as regards the efficiency of their work and as regards the prestige of the service, and they are anxious to preserve this independence and the independence of the Civil Service Commissioners as far as possible. I think the amendment has another <Col N="1217" /> point in its favour, and it is that we have in this country two systems certainly not hostile, not conflicting, but slightly divergent types of University education, the system represented by Trinity and the system represented by the National University.  It is desirable, I think, that one of the Commissioners should represent each of these points of view, and that the third Commissioner, attached to neither school, should act as arbiter between them.  I ask the Minister for Finance if he will consider, and make it quite clear in the Bill, that the normal number of Commissioners should be three instead of &ldquo;not more than&rdquo; three; and also if he will secure that under no circumstances will this vast and considerable power be entrusted to one Commissioner only.</P>

      <P>I thought it was common knowledge, but, if the Deputy contradicts me, I will take his word for it, because I had not the advantage of a University education.  I have read that there is a certain peculiar mould into which Trinity, at any rate, casts its Graduates, and I assume that the National University, though young, is in <Col N="1218" /> process of acquiring a somewhat similar, but not identical, mould.  I expressly said that there was no hostility between the two Universities, but you might have a difference in point of view, and I think it would be undesirable if one Commissioner, representing one University, were to be appointed to the exclusion of the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The volume of work which the Commissioners will have to carry out will be small, comparatively.  Even at the present time, when there are arrears of work to be undertaken, the work of the Civil Service Commissioners is very much part-time work. As a matter of fact, at the present time, the work is being carried out by three Commissioners who have other responsibilities and greater responsibilities, and it is possible for them to do it.  When we have settled down, the holding of examinations, at regular intervals, will be, for the most part, the work of the Commission, and will require a very small amount of time from the Commissioners themselves, and consequently, from the point of view of the volume of work, there is nothing to be said for binding ourselves to three.  It might quite well be desirable in the future that we would rather have one than three, and I do not see that we need actually bind ourselves to any particular number.  We might very well be able to get on with two, and in fact we might cease to employ Civil Service Commissioners at all, and get in people from outside.  It may not be desirable then that we should actually have three, because the question of remuneration in that case might be a somewhat serious one.  I think there is going to be no disposition to make the Civil Service Commission other than a reasonable body or a reasonable institution, to carry on the work which is to be carried on, and I think we may leave it to the Government, or to the Executive Council that may be in existence at any particular time, to make the best arrangements they can for the carrying out of that work.  It seems to me to be entirely wrong to take up the point of view, as some Deputies appear to do, that the Civil Service Commissioners <Col N="1219" /> will continually have to fight the Government of the day.  I think that point of view is entirely fallacious and that we should not act on it.  If we are not going to have Governments that will observe the letter and also the spirit of the law, I think we will not be able to have our Civil Service what it ought to be, and I think that we will gain nothing by trying to hedge round these Civil Service Commissioners with too many precautions and safeguards.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides in this Section the machinery for holding examinations, and for the holding of them with fair and reasonable safeguards.  I think we ought to take the point of view that every Government, and not alone the Civil Service Commissioners, will desire to have its Civil Service recruited so that it will get the best possible material, and that it will give an equal and a fair opportunity to all classes of citizens, and one also that will make the arrangements that may be necessary to have the work done efficiently. For that reason I see no need for specifying three in particular.  There is a reason for specifying that there should not be more than three, because there may be a question of salaries and charges, and I think it is necessary to limit the maximum number.  I see no reason for fixing a minimum number, and I really look upon this amendment as one that is unnecessary, and one that might tie up the hands of the Executive for making what it may regard as the best arrangement, from time to time, for carrying on the work of the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move as an amendment to delete sub-section (3), and to add at the end of the Section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The office of any person appointed under this section to be a Commissioner may be vacated by resignation in writing under his hand, but failing such resignation no Commissioner shall be removed from <Col N="1220" /> his office save for incapacity or physical or mental infirmity, or misbehaviour in office or misconduct, which shall be certified under the hand of the Minister for Finance.  It shall be the duty of the Minister for Finance to give such certificate in case he is satisfied that such incapacity or infirmity exists or that such misbehaviour or misconduct has taken place.  No such certificate shall be questioned or made the subject of proceedings in any Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In moving this, I have, first of all, to apologise to the Minister and to the Dáil for a mis-statement I made in my speech on the Second Reading.  I said I was under the impression that in England the Commissioners do not hold office permanently.  My memory misled me, but that is not to be wondered at when one has to read eight or nine Bills in a few days.  Now, with regard to this question, I was told by Deputy Johnson on the Second Reading that I was exaggerating the importance of the Civil Service Commission, and that they were really only persons for conducting examinations.  I do not think that is entirely correct, because of an answer to a question which I put to the Minister for Home Affairs to-day.  I did not put the question for that purpose, but in his answer he stated that &ldquo;before appointment to the permanent Civil Service candidates will be required to satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners that their character and health are satisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Besides conducting examinations, the Commissioners will have to inquire into the character and health of the candidates.  That means that they will have to arrange for the holding of a medical examination, and will require to have a certificate of character from some person knowing the candidate, such as a clergyman.  If it were only a question of conducting examinations, I have sat for a good many examinations with varying success, and I can assure Deputy Johnson that it makes a good deal of difference as to who sets the examination papers.  If I were to imagine the ghastly possibility that all members of the Dáil had to pass an examination in the subject, say of <Col N="1221" /> economies, it would, I suggest, make a big difference as to whether the papers were set by Deputy Johnson or by Deputy Gorey.  The only prophecy I can make is that the Minister for Agriculture would probably be plucked by both of them.  If you had the examiners selected from a certain school of thought, it would be regarded as a grievance by those educated under another system.  As regards the body that selects the examiners, it is very desirable that it should be in a position of absolute independence.  I am not suggesting, as Deputy Johnson assumed, that the examiners should take the status of a Judge of the High Court. I have taken a very much humbler official, the District Justice, as my model in this amendment, but the Sub-section in the Bill is modelled on a Section in the Courts of Justice Bill which gives the District Justice precisely the same immunity from removal from office.  The Minister, on the Second Reading of the Bill, and also inferentially to-day, said something about Governments always acting for the best, and trying to establish the best kind of Civil Service.  That is not the case in the United States of America.  The Government of the United States, under the influence of the founders of the Constitution, just as we are now under the influence of the founders of this State, set up an impartial and excellent Civil Service Commission which made its appointments in the most laudable manner, and these appointments were permanent.</P>
    <P>After the Constitution had been in existence about 40 years, there came a wild man from the West called Andrew Jackson &mdash; not Johnson &mdash; who swept out every office-holder and every Civil Service Commissioner and introduced the &ldquo;spoil&rdquo; system, which made every Civil Service appointment &mdash; postmaster, Customs officer and others&mdash;dependent on the support of the party which was victorious.  From that day until this the United States have been struggling to free themselves from that system and have not completely succeeded.  If that state of affairs can exist in the United States, which has a rather larger Irish population than the Saorstát, it might conceivably exist here.  I, like the Minister, would prefer to rely on the spirit in which the Act would be <Col N="1222" /> administered.  I have no love of paper safeguards.  But when you have a paper Constitution you must have paper safeguards.  The spirit of the Constitution is what counts.  But when you have a Constitution on paper you must have paper safeguards.  I do most earnestly ask the Minister to consider this question of making the Civil Service Commissioners immune and safe from removal upon any change of Government. I am not censuring the Government. I am expressing the most extreme confidence in it.  I want to see the persons they nominate remain in office for the rest of their lives.  I am perfectly sure they will make a good selection.  I do not want the Commissioners, who will have to determine the different standards of examination, to go out every time there is a change of Government or any time a Government may think it necessary to reward its own supporters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to go a little way to meet Deputy Bryan Cooper in this matter.  I would be prepared, on the Report Stage, to introduce a provision that the appointment and removal of every Civil Service Commissioner should be gazetted. That would mean that it would be assured that it would be done as a public act.  There are other officials, just as important as the Civil Service Commissioners, who are removable at the pleasure of the Executive Council &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners, for instance. The Revenue Commissioners discharge extremely responsible duties, and duties in which the Executive Council might be tempted to interfere far more than in the case of the Civil Service Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners are removable at pleasure.  I do not know that what Deputy Cooper has said about the Civil Service of the United States tells against my point of view at all, which is that if you provide the machinery and system for doing things you have to rely on the Government observing the spirit of that system in using the machinery. The Government may change the system, and if you have a Government that desires to change the system it will change it in spite of any safeguards you provide.  There may be reasons &mdash;<Col N="1223" /> very good reasons &mdash; why you would change your Civil Service Commissioners, without any question of incapacity or misconduct being involved. It might be done simply for convenience. For instance, the Ceann Comhairle, who is a Civil Service Commissioner at the moment, might cease to be Ceann Comhairle here.</P>
      <P>He might, perhaps, be engaged in some business elsewhere in the country, which would make it difficult and perhaps costly and inconvenient for him to act as Civil Service Commissioner. Still, he could do the work and he could not be removed, although he would not be on the spot.  He might not want to resign.  You might have a situation of that sort.  You might have a Commissioner who is a Civil Servant&mdash;say, the Secretary of the Ministry of Education. He might cease to be in the Ministry of Education and it might be considered desirable that the new Secretary of the Ministry of Education should take up his duties.  Remember, that as Secretary to the Ministry of Education he is under the will and pleasure of the Executive Council, and his services can be dispensed with at any time.  I think it would be somewhat absurd to have the Executive Council able to dismiss him from the lucrative position and not able to dismiss him from the honorary position. I think what I suggested might meet Deputy Bryan Cooper, that any changes in the personnel of the Civil Service Commission should be required to be mentioned in the &ldquo;Gazette.&rdquo;  That would give an opportunity to any Deputy who thought there was anything queer about the matter to have it thrashed out in the Dáil.  After all, the Dáil will be the ultimate tribunal, and if it does not deal with the matter there will be no hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Minister argued very cogently against constituting the Civil Service Commission in the way he at present contends. If the Secretary of the Ministry of Education is to be a Civil Service Commissioner, and if he is to be gazetted as removed because he has ceased to be Secretary of the Ministry of Education, it follows, I think, very clearly, <Col N="1224" /> that in the mind of the Minister for Finance it is an <i>ex-officio</i> office.  I see that he dissents from that.  It is true that I have over-stated the case.  It is not necessarily true that it will be always an <i>ex-officio</i> office, but it leaves room for removing a Commissioner merely because he has ceased to hold the Secretaryship of the Education Ministry.  The Minister spoke also on the last amendment as if he conceived the Civil Service Commissioners as always part-time officials.  When going into this question of &ldquo;the spoils to the victors&rdquo; and &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; and all the rest, is it a good thing for the staffing of the Civil Service of the nation that the entire administration of it, on the side of determination of programmes and standards for all posts, and the conduct of examinations, should be in the hands of part-time officials?  Is it desirable that these men should occupy other public offices from which they are dismissable on other grounds?  It does not seem to be an ideal system to set up.</P>
      <P>I should have preferred if the Minister had, in the interests of economy, appointed only one Commissioner and had put an Advisory Board, constituted in whatever way might be determined, at the service of such one Commissioner.  The entire responsibility would then be placed upon him. I think that what he proposed leads in that direction &mdash; I mean not what he proposed officially but what he proposed in reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is really consequential on the previous one, which I have withdrawn.  It is obviously necessary where you make a Commissioner a permanent official that you should fix some retiring age, when he will become pensionable. I am not much in love with this part-time system in regard to the Commissioners. They may be too much under official influence.  It would be much better to have an independent Civil Service Commission, composed of independent officials who would become pensionable at the normal pensionable age.  I took the District Justice as my model and I followed the Courts of Justice Bill as far as I could.  As the previous amendment has been withdrawn, I do not see that there would be <Col N="1226" /> any use in pressing this amendment and therefore I withdraw it.</P>

      <P>Here I am on stronger ground, and I hope very much that the Minister will accept this amendment.  Surely the ordinary staff of the Commissioners should be appointed by the Commissioners themselves.  The Commissioners should appoint them because the staff have to work under them.  Surely they should select the men they think most fit for the work, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This would give the Minister for Finance the power of exercising his veto.  As the thing stands the Minister for Finance may &mdash; I am sure in the present case he would not &mdash; appoint anybody on the staff of the Commissioners.  The Commissioners might have to accept unsuitable men according to the provisions of this Bill.  I think the rule in every other Government Department is that the staff is appointed by the people for whom they are to work.  In practice, I suppose, the Commissioners would make recommendations to the Minister for Finance, but this should be included in the Bill.  I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment arises from a difference in point of view.  The Minister for Finance will be the Minister responsible.  He is the Minister who will answer in the Dáil. That is one aspect of it.  Then it should be remembered that in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General, where there would be a much stronger case for not vesting the appointment in the Minister for Finance, the appointment of the staff is actually vested in the Minister for Finance.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer, as you might say, of a much higher status than the Civil Service Commissioner.  He is appointed by, and responsible to the Dáil.  He is <Col N="1227" /> irremovable.  He has the standing almost of a Judge.  Yet his staff is appointed by the Minister for Finance. I think there is no case for the appointment of the staff by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Then there is the other fact that you would have a part-time staff.  You will have some of your staff that will be working in the Civil Service.  You may have one person permanently employed in the Civil Service, others will be employed only from time to time.  It is obvious they should not be appointed by the Commissioners. You would have your difficulties about putting them on to other work when not required for the work of the Civil Service Commission. I do not think that there would be any throwing of duds on the Commission, so that it would be prevented from doing its work.  I do not think that could occur.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 7 merely seeks to place the Staff of the Commissioners of the Civil Service in the same position as any other civil servants.  It seeks to establish that they shall be entitled to all the privileges of the Civil Service and not merely liable to dismissal.  The functions they have to perform are important and they should not be allowed to become the subject of undue influence. There was an American politician who said he did not care how the elections were carried on, provided he counted the votes.  Those officials will have to count the marks, and it is desirable that they should be removed from the influence of candidates.  If they are part-time officials they are already <Col N="1229" /> entitled to those rights.  If you take on a man to act as Secretary to the Commission, he should have the same pensionable rights, surely, as any other civil servant.  It is highly desirable that the body recruiting the Civil Service should not be inferior to any other body in the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the Deputy is our intention, but this amendment goes a little further than he intends.  The amendment talks of the same tenure, and the same terms and conditions as other civil servants in the Saorstát.  There are various sorts of civil servants, and civil servants who hold varying sorts of tenure.  Prison warders are civil servants for the purpose of the Superannuation Acts, and have peculiar rights.  The civil servants who are transferred on a change of Government have peculiar tenure and rights.  There is a further point.  It is an objection to the use of the words &ldquo;Civil Service.&rdquo;  Under the Superannuation Acts, a civil servant is an officer who is entitled to a pension as holding a permanent and established post.  Now the words of the amendment might tend to convert a temporary clerk or temporary typist into a person holding &ldquo;a permanent and established post.&rdquo;  I think there is no necessity for the amendment.  If a person is appointed to a permanent and established post, he is entitled to superannuation, as a right, under the Superannuation Acts.  The Minister for Finance, of course, is entitled to prescribe terms and conditions, just as in the case of other civil servants.  I think the Staff of the Civil Service Commission will be suitable persons drawn from the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The amendment which I have is a very small one, but it is really a drafting one, and I hope the Minister's heart will melt towards it. It is, in sub-section (1), line 31, after <Col N="1231" /> the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or other authority,&rdquo; and it is to meet the case of examinations prescribed by Order in Council, or anything else of that kind.  The Civil Service Commission were themselves in Great Britain created by Order in Council and not by statute, and it is just possible that under some Order in Council that we do not know of there may be some provision for examinations.  I do not see that the insertion of these words can possibly injure the Bill in any way, and they leave it so that if anything of the kind is found it will not be necessary to bring in an amending Bill to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I am not able to understand the intention of the amendment, and I do not like it because I do not know what it means, or what its effect would or might be.  If there is any examination which the Civil Service Commissioners were, by Order in Council, required to hold, the Executive Council could now, by Order in Council, require them to hold it; and I do not know that we ought to pass an amendment without knowing that it will serve a purpose, or what particular purpose it will serve.  The particular passage, &ldquo;The Commissioners shall conduct all examinations in Saorstát Eireann which are now by statute required to be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners&rdquo; was put in to cover, I think, the County Surveyors; that is, it was necessary that a man should pass a Civil Service examination before he could be appointed a County Surveyor, and this particular phrase was put in, obliging the Civil Service Commissioners to hold such examinations.</P>
      <P>If there are any other examinations which they ought to hold, the Executive Council can direct them to do so, and I think that that is sufficient.  I do not think this matters, but as I do not really know what the effect, if any, would be, I rather object to it.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question under Section 8, because it seems to lay down that the Civil Service Commissioners may institute examinations for anybody in the Civil Service, and any local authority or authorities, but in the margin it merely says County Surveyors. I think it would be a very desirable thing to have Civil Service examinations not merely for County Surveyors but for clerkships and secretaryships in local bodies, and to bring these things into the sphere of competitive examination and out of the sphere of jobbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that perhaps the marginal note requires amendment, and I will look into it.  There is power under the Clause to require the Commissioners to hold an examination for any position under a local authority, but I think that certain legislation will be necessary from the Local Government side to oblige a local authority to appoint persons who might pass an examination.  At present the local authorities might ask the Commissioners to hold an examination, or the Executive Council might require them to do it, but when it was held the local authority might refuse to appoint the person who had passed, so that legislation from the Local Government side would be necessary before we do that.</P>
      <P>Question &mdash;&ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may from time to time make regulations for controlling the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann and providing for the classification, remuneration and other conditions and terms of service of all persons employed therein whether permanently or temporarily; and may at any time revoke or vary any such regulation.</P>

It is to cover the setting up of any new departments, so that conditions may be laid down in advance, and Civil Servants will know what they have to expect if they transfer to this department, or if they are going up for examination.  It is merely, in case a new Government department is found necessary, that the Civil Service Commissioners will be able to make regulations in advance and people in the Civil Service will know where they are.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made by the Minister for Finance under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before it becomes operative, and if both such Houses shall, within the next 21 days on which either House has sat after such regulation is laid before both Houses, pass resolutions annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment laying down that all regulations made by the Minister for Finance under this Section shall be laid on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas at least one month before they become operative, and if both Houses pass resolutions annulling them that they shall be void. I think it is necessary to have both the Dáil and the Seanad in agreement <Col N="1234" /> upon this.  I am not trying to limit the Government unduly and it is only in a case where both the Dáil and the Seanad agree in annulling them that they will be annulled.  I think we should have some cognisance of the conditions of employment in the Civil Service, and I think it is desirable that these regulations should be laid on the Table and that we should have an opportunity for discussing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Clause 9, to which it is sought to add a new paragraph, deals with the functions of the Minister for Finance in controlling the public services. It has no relation really to the Civil Service Commission, which is purely a body for controlling the recruitment of the services.  The Clause does no more than express in a statutory form the power of the Minister for Finance to control staff expenditure, both as regards the number of officers to be employed, salaries, conditions of employment, hours of service, etc.  It is identical with the power vested in the Chancellor of the Exchequer under the British Government for controlling staff expenditure in the British service.  The proposed addition would have the effect that the Minister for Finance could not fix the hours of service, or numbers of staff, or any matter relating to staff expenditure, without putting his proposals before the Dáil from time to time, and waiting 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also, of course, have the effect of giving an opportunity to the Civil Service Commissioners, or any such body, to have all sorts of such matters thrashed out in a way that would probably be satisfactory to them, but of no particular benefit to anybody else.  It would enable a sort of agitation to be got up, that we know could very well be got up, and turn the Dáil into a debating society for dealing with some matters it would not be worth the while of the Dáil wasting its time on.  We know we always can get people to take up any point put to them, and a good deal of time may be wasted.  I think it is not desirable that the functions of the Minister for Finance in dealing with this matter of staffs, which is always a delicate and difficult matter, and which could be made a great deal <Col N="1235" /> more difficult by unnecessary discussions at critical junctures, should be interfered with.  If the Dáil does not like the way the Minister for Finance deals with the matter, it can easily deal with the Minister for Finance.  I think that is the way the matter should remain. The British arrangement, which we adopt here, is, I think, an arrangement which has worked well enough, and at any rate at present we would not be disposed to change it.  If we felt after our Government had been functioning, and our services had been working for some time, it was desirable to make a change, we could and will make the change.</P>

      <P>The voice is the voice of the Minister, but the words are the words of the permanent official which I have been hearing all my life: &ldquo;No Parliamentary interference with Government offices.&rdquo;  I cannot accept the Minister's reply.  I think there is a great question of principle at stake in this, and though I am loath to embarrass the Government, I will not withdraw the amendment without a more satisfactory and convincing reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, and I am urged to do so by the example of very recent history. &ldquo;The Minister may, from time to time, make regulations providing for the remuneration and other conditions and terms of service of all persons employed in the Civil Service.&rdquo;  The Minister for Education made a statement the week before last, I think, which made it clear to me that in his view, and I presume in the view of the Minister for Finance, it is not only competent, but reasonable for the Minister for the time being to be able to say that a man who is to-day working for £1,000 a year, next week will work for £100 a year, that the salaries of Civil Servants may be cut down 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 per cent., as he wishes, without any reference to the Dáil or to anybody but his own conscience.  That was the implication of the statement of the Minister for Education when he said that the State was sovereign, and there was and could be no such thing as agreement or contract between the servants of the State and the State which the State <Col N="1236" /> could not annul at will.  Something like that was implied by the statement of the Minister for Education on the discussion regarding teachers' salaries. The clause asks the Dail to agree that the Minister for Finance may, from time to time, without any reference, or any period of suspense, declare that salaries and terms of service are alterable at his will.  I do not think that that is a position we should agree to, and I think that the proposed amendment is one which would at least limit the power of the Minister in that respect. The Minister may say, as he said earlier, that the Government or the Executive Council for the time being must be trusted to use ordinary discretion, and if they cannot be so trusted they ought to be removed.  That is very nice theoretically, but unfortunately the Minister may do a very unjust thing in its application to a single individual which may not warrant the dismissal of the Government.  After all, I imagine we would have new Governments every week if every unjust act of the Government was followed by dismissal from office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the interruption, whether the interrupter was asking me to keep to the question, or whether he is querying the statement I made.  It is a fact that under this Section as it stands the Minister would have the power, without notice, to alter the remuneration and terms of service of any servant.  That, I think, is not a power which should be continued, and consequently I support the amendment, which seeks to impose upon the Minister the obligation, before making any new regulation, that he should lay it before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment as I consider it is necessary. Indeed, had I the framing of it, I would go somewhat further.  The whole curse of the Civil Service, so far as I have known, lay in the fact that official insolence on the part of superiors has no redress on the part of the Civil Service.  To some extent the amendment provides against that.  Though the present Minister for Finance would do nothing to interfere with the Civil <Col N="1237" /> Service, yet a new Minister may follow who would do so.  I think it is well that the provision in this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that support from the Government benches justifies me in pressing the amendment. Earlier in the debate the Minister asked us to rely on the spirit of Governments in future.  Cannot we rely on the spirit of the Oireachtas in future?  What is there wrong in suggesting that?  Nothing but a manifest scandal would induce both Houses to annul a regulation of this kind.  That is certain.  You have got the Seanad as a conservative force and the Dáil as a democratic one. If they are both in agreement, therefore, a very strong case will have been made.  It will not be a matter of a snap division.  You must get both Houses.  It does give some control over the proceedings of an arbitrary Minister, and that is a constitutional point of great importance.  The individual Civil Servant has very little remedy against injustice. He is one man against an organised department, and the existence of this power&mdash;which may never be used, which probably never will be used &mdash; will in the last resort assist him to obtain justice.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment, if only in the interests of what I have stood for so frequently here, and that is democratic control as against bureaucracy. I cannot see that anyone is aggrieved who is a permanent official or a Minister, if he is subject to what, after all, is in the spirit of the Constitution, that regulations that are practically given the force of law should, before becoming operative, have the endorsement of the Houses of Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount of misapprehension about this, and I think it would be very undesirable that the Executive should be hampered in carrying out its executive duties in this way.  We have had in the past several difficulties.  We had, for instance, a very considerable difficulty in the Post Office strike of last year.  I think that when we have had experience of that we should give the Executive Minister responsible the <Col N="1238" /> necessary authority to deal with any situation that may arise &mdash; to deal with the whole question of regulating the staff which I think is necessary to ensure that we shall not have trouble created which might not arise if we do not invite debate.  Dealing with staffs, and especially with large orgainsed staffs, is a matter of considerable difficulty.  It is a matter in which you want somebody to have authority and to be able to act without leaving intervals in which all sorts of trouble might possibly be organised.  I believe that the essence of democratic government is to control your Executive.  It is not necessarily in curbing or limiting the functions of your Executive.  It is in holding them responsible; in watching them; in deposing them if you disapprove of what they are doing.  But I entirely reject the notion that there is anything essentially democratic in curbing the functions of an executive officer, especially an executive officer holding office from day to day at the will of a majority.  If you had executive officers, as they have in the United States and other places, who are not responsible to a Parliament in the way that the Executive Ministers here are, who cannot be removed at any time, the way the Ministers can be removed here, there would be a case, in many instances, for limitations of powers, that are not necessary or justifiable here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole idea in our Constitution is that executive functions should rest with the Executive as far as possible without limitation, and that the Executive should be held responsible. There is nothing in this that has got anything to do with matters that are at all in the nature of making legislation. It is not a matter to be threshed out here, necessarily, whether a lunch-hour shall be one and a quarter or one hour.  That is a matter which the Minister for Finance should have power to deal with from time to time, as he thinks desirable, and, then, if the Dáil disapproves of what he is doing, it can deal with him.  But there are a multitude of matters arising that the Minister for Finance should have power to deal with, and that he should be responsible for.  Even the making of arrangements about pay, about <Col N="1239" /> numbers, or grading is a matter that ought to be left to the responsible Minister to deal with in the first instance as part of his ordinary everyday routine, and if there is disapproval of his act he can certainly be held up to criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment, and in doing so I might venture to remark that this seems to me to be one of the occasions on which the Government are unnecessarily following the British precedent. That may seem so upon the surface, but as far as I know, according to the spirit of the British system no civil servant's salary can be reduced or seriously affected without his receiving compensation and, as there is no undertaking to that effect suggested by the Minister for Finance, I think that it is well for us to pass this provision.  What is the objection from the point of view of the Government?  There is no doubt that this amendment will not interfere in the slightest with the Executive in the operation of its duties.  It will only give the Oireachtas as a whole an opportunity of, shortly and within a space of time, perhaps, expressing the disapproval which the Minister for Finance has already stated they are entitled to do.  As Deputy Cooper has pointed out it surely will be an exceedingly serious question which both the Dáil and the Seanad will agree to express their disapproval of, and if it is so serious a matter, then, I think, that it should be subject to immediate approval or otherwise.  The Minister for Finance has stated that this might lead to unnecessary discussion.  Who is to be the judge of whether the discussion is to be necessary or unnecessary? I think that is a matter that rests with the Dáil as a whole and not with the Government, or even with the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, I think that it would be in no degree lessening the power or authority of the Executive; that it would in no way deprive them of their rights or the Minister for Finance of his authority in the matter, and I cannot see, except for pure official cussedness &mdash; to use a slang expression &mdash; why the Minister for Finance and the Government cannot <Col N="1240" /> accept this amendment.  I certainly hope that Deputy Cooper will put this amendment to a division.  If he does so I shall support it.</P>

      <P>In this matter I would like to say that I cannot see the point of view of the mover of the amendment considering the big responsibility that he takes upon himself in putting it forward. The amendment proposes that any alteration of the regulations shall be laid before the Dáil for a certain period.  Let us see what that would mean.  The Minister for Finance considers it necessary to make some trivial alteration in the regulations governing the Civil Service&mdash;it may be trivial or a matter of greater importance &mdash; but at all events every alteration that he requires to make in the regulations will have to be brought before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am glad of the interruption by Deputy Redmond, but I think in principle it is brought before the Dáil.  The disgruntled civil servants get busy immediately amongst Deputies and by the time the Minister could act we would be all ready for a full dress debate on perhaps a matter of very little importance, as far as the alteration is concerned, but a vital matter in connection with the discipline of the Civil Service.  This is the sort of thing that would tend to cut at the root of discipline in every office in connection with the Civil Service.  And what is it for?  If there is general dissatisfaction in the Civil Service, and with the treatment meted out to civil servants, surely there is not much difficulty in bringing forward the grievance as a whole.  I should think not.  There will be plenty of sympathisers in the Dáil who will do it readily.  To put in the Bill a Section such as this Section, if amended, would weaken the whole administration very much.  As far as I am concerned I will vote with the Government in opposing this amendment.</P>

      <P>I will support this amendment.  It seems to me the question <Col N="1241" /> involved is who is to control &mdash; the Oireachtas or the Ministry?  That seems to be the issue.  The amendment only seeks to bring under review an action of the Ministry with regard to any particular service or body of civil servants. If no injustice is done the matter would not come before the Dáil.  If an injustice is done it is right that it should come before the Dáil.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Redmond when he stated that the Dáil, and the Dáil alone, must be the judge of the importance of any matter which a Deputy thinks it right should be brought before it.  If it is unimportant the Dáil will know how to deal with it, but it should not rest with the Ministry, or with any member of the Ministry, to say that any particular matter is, or is not, of importance to the country.  The Dáil is the body that has to find the money, and it has a right to call the tune in the last instance.  I think it is not unreasonable that the Dáil should be given an opportunity of knowing what is being done.  The Minister stated that if he does anything that should not be done there is a method of dealing with the matter.  But an injustice might be done or something might happen to give cause for complaint.  It might be smouldering for months before it came to the notice of the Dáil, or until an opportunity would arise for dealing with it on the Estimates or something of that kind.  Smouldering discontent in the civil service is not good for the service, and the sooner it is brought to the surface and exposed the better.  The Minister will have an opportunity of meeting any argument or agitation that might be put up, and of giving his explanation, which, I have no doubt, in the vast majority of cases, would meet with the full satisfaction of the Dáil. That, I think, will make for a healthier administration rather than trying to keep under ground any discontent that might arise from a Minister's action.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the view taken by the Minister for Finance on this particular amendment. It appears to me that if the Dáil wants to encourage and create the difficulties that have been pointed out, then it ought to pass this amendment.  The Dáil, as I understand the position, appoints a Minister to discharge certain duties.  If the Dáil on the one hand is going to appoint a Minister in whom it has confidence to discharge the duties, and is now going by amendment to take away and undermine his authority, surely it is an exceedingly weak proceeding.  To take a business <Col N="1243" /> man's view of the matter, when a question arises in a business house it is absolutely necessary to have some man to settle these questions, someone in authority whose decision is final.  After all, Government is like a big business concern, and if it is to be carried on successfully, we must trust somebody. For these reasons I will support the Government.</P>

      <P>I do not stand for any amendment that would take from the head of a Department his rightful control.  In so far as a Department is a business, it must be conducted on business principles. So far, I agree with Deputy Gorey; but it is more than a business. We are dealing here with civil servants and not with clerks.  We are not dealing with employees in the ordinary sense, and therefore the thing must be seen in its rightful perspective.  Many of those men are administrative, too, like the Minister.  It is a difference of degree merely, and the total control of administration may be vested momentarily in the Executive Council.  But that is always, under the Constitution, subject to control, when the necessity arises for it, on the part of the Dáil. By what agency or through what contrivance is the control of the Dáil to be exercised if all the administration is to be done, so to speak, in the dark?  It can only be by question asked or answered in the Dáil, or special debates raised on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these grievances can be obviated before they arise.  Prevention, says the old tag, is better than cure.  It would be much better if, in the exercise of all these administrative acts of making regulations, the Ministry or those acting in the name of the Ministry, had always before their eyes the wholesome recollection that the regulation would <Col N="1244" /> be laid on the Table of the Dáil, and that it would be canvassed and criticised, and if it were found to be faulty or ineffective or unfair, it would then become the subject of a special debate here.  Deputy Gorey forgets this is one of the most important functions of Parliament for the safeguarding of personal freedom and of efficient administration.  If we are asked to give <i>carte blanche</i> to a Minister, then we may as well close the Dáil altogether.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to support this amendment.  I would press upon the Government to consider it again.  It is not that any of us wish to interfere unreasonably with the necessary authority and disciplinary power of the Minister.  We realise, as clearly as the Minister himself does, that to produce efficiency in each Department of the Civil Service he must have certain powers; but the sweeping character of the powers we are asked to give under Section 9 would render the position of the civil servant a truly hopeless one.  Personally, if I were in the Civil Service, I would not care to think that at any time, at the whim of a Minister, my conditions of service could be altered.  We may not always have such strong and trustworthy Ministers as we have at the present time.  A civil servant might realise that any day the terms of his salary, his pension, and his promotion might be interfered with by the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister.  It is not that we want to put any trivial restrictions on the powers of the Minister, but these powers that we are asked to give in the Section should be subject to some safeguard, and I think the safeguard suggested in the amendment is a reasonable one.  I am sure that when such regulations are laid on the Table of the Dáil, no Deputy will, in a trivial or vexatious spirit, raise a question upon them.  In the interests of the Civil Service there should be given some feeling of security, and for that reason I am inclined to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey does not understand the import of the proposal contained in the Bill, and I am afraid Deputy Good has also failed to understand it.  The Minister tried to <Col N="1245" /> illustrate the case for the Bill, as it stands in opposition to the amendment, by referring to a regulation under which Civil Servants have an hour or an hour and a quarter for lunch.  If he will say that this proposal has only to do with such trivial things, then I am sure Deputy Cooper will not press the amendment.  Deputy Gorey, perhaps, if he were following the proceedings as closely as he should, would know that there have been many occasions when Bills have been passed dealing with the laying on the Table of regulations.  A considerable number of regulations have been laid upon the Table, and within my memory not once has any regulation been the subject of a debate. Therefore, it is quite foolish to suggest that because there is an amendment added to this Bill which provides for regulations being laid upon the Table, there must necessarily follow a debate. Let us read the proposal in the Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may from time to time make regulations for controlling the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann and providing for the classification, remuneration and other conditions and terms of service of all persons employed therein, whether permanently or temporarily; and may at any time revoke or vary any such regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil Servants are appointed to the Civil Service on certain understandings. There is a certain scale for a particular office, beginning at so-and-so and rising by annual increments of so-and-so. They enter the Civil Service on some general understanding of that kind under regulations that are fixed. They have a right to assume that those terms of service will be the terms of service under which they will be serving. The Minister here asks for power to alter those terms of service, to alter the rate of remuneration, to alter the conditions as he may wish, and without reference to the Dáil, or even without any period of suspension.  Deputy Gorey and Deputy Good seem to suggest that that is a normal condition of affairs that ought to apply even to private undertakings.  I do not think that Deputy Good would attempt to enforce any such provision in any private undertaking with which he is associated. <Col N="1246" /> He would not attempt to use his power of dismissal or power of altering terms of service without notice. He would not attempt to make arrangements to-day and make new arrangements to-morrow without consultation. That is what the proposition in the Bill provides for.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the amendment would have been readily acceptable.  It still remains with the Minister for Finance to regulate the conditions within the establishment and even to decide for himself that the prevailing conditions shall be altered at any time he wishes.  What we seek is that there should be a proviso that new regulations shall be brought to our notice.  The point that was made by one Deputy &mdash; I think it was Deputy Good &mdash; that any attempt to alter the terms and conditions of service would be held in suspense for this period, would very easily be met by adding to this amendment the condition which is generally added to such proposals &mdash; the condition which reads in the Judiciary Bill; &ldquo;such annulment shall not prejudice any matter or thing previously done under such regulations.&rdquo;  That is provided there has been annulment by the vote of the Dáil.  Then any matter or thing previously done during the period of suspension shall not be invalid.  That, I suggest, might well be aded to this amendment, and I asked Deputy Cooper and he agrees that that fits in with his conception. It seems to me that the Minister is asking for power and authority in this section which ought not be given.  He is asking for power to make alterations in the terms of service under which men and women have been engaged and under which they have been working, and he declines to allow these regulations to be brought formally before the Dáil.  He invites &mdash; I ask Deputies to mark this &mdash; by his refusal to accept this amendment, the very thing which Deputies deprecate; he invites civil servants, if they have grievances, to canvas the Deputies to bring those grievances before the Dáil.  That is what we are invited to do by the refusal to accept this amendment.  Papers are laid on the Table and it is our duty to know something about these regulations. If they are not laid on the <Col N="1247" /> Table civil servants, who have any grievance, have no option but go to Deputies and plead with them to make a fuss to bring the matter under the notice of the Dáil.  I wonder at Deputies who resent such action refusing to accept this amendment.  I am glad that Deputy Cooper proposes to divide the Dáil upon it if the Minister will not accept it, and I hope it will be carried.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson would seem to me, from the trend of his remarks, not to have read the amendment, because this is not the form that such provision usually takes in the Acts that have been passed in this Dáil.  It does not propose that the regulations shall be made as usual and become operative and be annulled by the Dáil, if a resolution so deciding is passed within twenty-one days.  It proposes that the regulations shall lie on the table one month before they become operative, and everybody is invited to come along and raise a row. It is quite a different thing.  I would have no objection to have the usual type of clause put in the Bill.  That is that the regulations shall lie on the table for twenty-one days, but in the meantime they should become operative. That would enable the Minister for Finance to deal with the matter. As a matter of fact regulations are in existence.  There is no reason why the form of publication should not be the laying of the regulations on the table. That is a different thing to the amendment of Deputy Cooper.</P>

      <P>I do not really see the force of this amendment, because during the course of the Committee Stage of this Bill I proposed that all the High Court Judges should be paid equal salaries with possibly one or two exceptions, and I had more than one ground for that proposal.  In England at the present time that obtains, and I think it is a very useful fact that all High Court and Supreme Court Judges should be co-equals, and I cannot see why if the necessity were to arise there would be anything against the calling in to the Supreme Court of a High Court Judge.  I really do not think that there would be that great difference between either their intelligence or capacity, or that there should be that difference between the status of the two Courts, and, therefore, I think that this amendment would require a little more explanation than the Attorney-General has given.  What is the objection either from the legal or the civil state point of view to Supreme Court Judges seeking the assistance of their own brethren in the High Court. That is a question I would like to have answered if the Attorney-General would be kind enough to explain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been more than once surprised by the line taken, in the way of criticism of proposals, by my friend, Deputy Redmond but never more surprised than on the present occasion.  The amendment here goes as nearly perfecting the original proposal as an amendment could well do.  Deputy Redmond must be fully alive to the fact of every barrister's <Col N="1250" /> experience that a Judge of first instance, a Judge of the High Court, is dealing not merely with questions of law, but with considerations of what I might briefly describe as of a psychological character.</P>
      <P>He estimates, from the manner and bearing and general behaviour of the witness, his credibility.  He has control of his Court, he deals with counsel, and he exercises a variety of qualities that are altogether different in their nature from that of being a profound or subtle lawyer.  That he should receive the same salary as the salary of the Supreme Court Judge does not arise here.  If that were the question, I should agree with Deputy Redmond that both should be paid alike as being judges of a High Court, but the point that this amendment seeks to deal with is that the Judge of first instance should not be unnecessarily brought in to be a member constituting the Supreme Court.  It is a Court really of specialisation of function, and it is only where there would be a deficiency in the number of Judges available to make up a Supreme Court for the hearing of a particular appeal, that it should be necessary at all to requisition the services of a Judge of the Supreme Court of first instance.  I think Deputy Redmond overlooked the fact that in line 19 the amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;from time to time,&rdquo; so that the result is that it is only when the illness of a Judge of Appeal makes it necessary, or some other unavoidable cause of a similar nature, that the Judge of the other Court is to be brought in to complete the number.  I think this is a most useful amendment, and one that will commend itself to the Bar of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am exceedingly indebted to my learned friend on my right for having more fully explained this amendment than did the Attorney-General when he said that High Court Judges should not be unnecessarily called in to aid their brethren in the Supreme Court.  If that is the intention of the amendment, of course, I am in complete agreement with it, but it did strike me that it was unnecessary, to use the expression again, to have a limitation of the <Col N="1251" /> powers of the Judges of the Supreme Court.  However, I am now satisfied that that is not the case, and I require no further explanation on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>One inaccuracy crept in, on an earlier stage of this Bill, as regards equal payments. The Court of Appeal in this country is intended to be, as far as possible, the final Court of Appeal.  In England the Judges in the final Court of Appeal do not receive the same salaries as the other Judges; they receive considerably larger salaries.  It is desired that this Court of Appeal, which is to be the final Court of Appeal and which is to be unlike the existing Court of Appeal constituted as a separate Court, should stand apart and should be constituted by men specially chosen for their fitness for that particular Court, and that it should not be possible to rush in High Court Judges in order to give a day's golf or a day's holiday to Judges of the Supreme Court.  It is the opinion of the Bar that, in the present existing <i>régime,</i> Judges of the High Court have been unduly called into the Court of Appeal, and it is a constant complaint of the Bar.  I do not know whether Deputy Redmond has conferred with representatives of the Bar, but I do know myself that this amendment is in accordance with the best opinion of the Bar, and I should think with a long way the majority of the Bar, that Judges of the High Court should not be called into the Court of Appeal, and that the Court of Appeal should be made a stable institution to which people can look with respect and which should not be simply a scratch collection of Judges got together to hear cases from time to time.</P>

      <P>This is a wise provision, but I should like to ask what does &ldquo;part of a county&rdquo; mean?  It is not clear, and it seems to me that you would require a more exact definition than simply &ldquo;part of a county.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will the Attorney-General say whether there is intended <Col N="1256" /> to be a prohibition against decreasing the total number of circuits by agreement, as provided.  The last line but one prevents the possibility of decreasing the total number of Circuits.  Is it intended that, no matter what the conditions may be, there shall be no change in that number?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>

      <P>I distinctly welcome this amendment, and also the remark which has just fallen from the Attorney-General, that it is inconceivable that the present number of Circuits could be reduced.  I am very glad to hear also that this amendment does not limit the possibility of a future increase in the number of Circuits, which I personally think will have to be made to make the scheme a workable one.  As regards the transferring of one County, or part of a County, from one Circuit to another, I notice that the Minister for Home Affairs, the Chief Justice, and the Judges for the time being, of the respective Circuits, are to have the sole say in this matter.  I certainly think that they should be consulted, and I think they should have a considerable voice in the question, but I must also give expression to my view that the residents of those Counties, and the people directly concerned with the operation of these courts, might also be consulted in this matter.  I think this is a matter of vital importance to the people, say of a County like Louth, which is included in a Circuit extending to the County Wexford, through the counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  It is an important question to the people concerned, as to whether Louth should or could be advantageously transferred to another Circuit.  Therefore, if it were at all possible, I would suggest to the Attorney-General that the proposed change, if any, should not be necessarily limited to the consent or to the approval of the people mentioned in this amendment.  If it be possible to get the opinion &mdash; as I think it might be &mdash; of the would-be, future or potential litigants <Col N="1257" /> in those various areas directly concerned, I certainly think they should have a voice in the matter.  I would, therefore, ask the Attorney-General, if possible, to consider this matter, and if he comes to the same conclusion, perhaps he might be able to extend and widen the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know how Deputy Redmond proposes exactly that all future litigants' views are to be taken as to alteration of the Circuits.  I do not know whether he proposes to send snowball resolutions round to Board of Guardians.  Of course, all representations and views locally that may be sent forward will be fully considered, and a change of this kind will hardly be made in face of opinion that should be given weight to.  I think the amendment as it stands is a good one and a reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a perfectly reasonable amendment, but, without being hyper-critical, I might suggest that there is one slight flaw in it.  It has been the practice with regard to County Court Judges not to remove the Judge from one area to another without his consent.  One can easily see here if a portion of a district were to be removed from a Circuit Judge, he might feel aggrieved, and create considerable difficulty in blocking what, in the public interest, would be a desirable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment says that &ldquo;the Minister may, with the consent of the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Circuits involved.&rdquo;  That implies, as I take it, the unanímous consent.  If one of them be a dissentient then the Minister cannot make this alteration.  Yet the alteration may be very necessary in the interests of better judicial administration. Then there is a deadlock, and it will become necessary to introduce a Bill to deal with it.  There would have to be a short Act doing this in spite of the dissentients.  Why not have a majority vote in the matter, or restrict in some way the vetoing power of a Circuit Judge who might feel himself aggrieved?  In other words, we are giving too much blocking power to the sense of grievance of <Col N="1258" /> men who might have no other objection but merely that he felt his importance diminished by having the area of his Circuit diminished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the consent of the Judges affected, should there be Judges in occupation of the Circuits at the moment, should be required before their position would be affected in this particular way.  Otherwise it could be suggested that things of that kind were done with ulterior motives, or to bring pressure of one kind or another on the Judges.  If a more workable arrangement is in view the probability is that the Judges would be only too happy to fall in with it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask may a Circuit Judge be changed from one Circuit to another or is this the only method?  It ought to follow, as a corollary, from the fact that there is only one Court, and that all these constitute the Court that he could be changed.</P>
