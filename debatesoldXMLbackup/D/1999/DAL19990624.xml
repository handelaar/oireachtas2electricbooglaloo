      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann Governor Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and his delegation who are here with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery. In particular, I welcome Thomas Finneran, speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I extend to you a most sincere welcome to our country. I express the hope that you will find your visit to Ireland interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 12, motion re membership of An Bord Pleanála; No. 13, motion re Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam; and No. 3, Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 12, if not previously concluded, shall be <Col N="2" /> brought to a conclusion after two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. The proceedings on No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes in each case, Members may share time and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12 agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is welcome. Will the Government introduce legislation to deal with the corrupt practice of competitors financing objectors to applications from people who may be in competition with them and developers paying objectors to withdraw objections? Does the Taoiseach agree that these activities are corrupt given that they can lead to delays which, in some cases, may prove fatal to particular projects? The matter should be promptly dealt with in view of the fact that a number of people have publicly admitted to paying the costs of objectors to competitors' projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters may be raised during the debate on the Bill. Anything which causes delays or creates those kinds of difficulties should be examined. The planning process should be above board in all respects. We have attempted to ensure that over the years through our planning legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will deal with this matter. We do not object to the timetabling of this item.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to No. 12.</P>

      <P>The proposal for dealing with No. 12 is agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13 agreed to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear that we do not wish to reach the courts Bill as it concerns a <Col N="4" /> matter which is currently under consideration by an Oireachtas committee. The committee's report is ready but has not yet been presented. It is my view that the committee's report on judicial accountability for decisions of a non-judicial character should be presented to the House before we consider the issue of <i>ex gratia </i>supplemental pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The current proposal relates to No. 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. The Government has only ordered No. 3, but if No. 13 is concluded, as timetabled, we will reach No. 3. It is not our wish to do that and we cannot agree to this timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, No. 13 is connected to No. 3. A committee of this House, which has been treated with some contempt by other institutions in the State, has yet to finalise its report which has given rise to No. 3. The proposal at this late stage in the week to curtail the debate on the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam and to introduce a provision to pension off two former judges is absolutely unacceptable. We are not prepared to accept the time constraint on the debate on the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in the important work he is about to undertake in resolving the remaining difficulties concerning the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. He has the support of the entire House and no one underestimates the exceptionally difficult nature of the task. On this occasion, I hope the Taoiseach will achieve clarity, certainty and accountability with regard to putting paramilitary weapons beyond use. The lack of clarity and accountability on this issue in the Good Friday Agreement led, in part, to the current impasse. While dealing with all the other issues, I hope that between now and 30 June we will achieve clarity, definite accountability and a clear understanding of who will do what and when with regard to putting weapons out of commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish the Taoiseach and his fellow negotiators, Tony Blair and all the participants to the talks in Northern Ireland every good wish, with the hope that they will achieve success. This will not be an easy task. Both Governments chose to select 30 June as the deadline for reasons we understand. Sadly, however, it is the Taoiseach's responsibility to ensure that, if he exercises that deadline on or around 30 June, the next phase of the peace process will be as constructive as this phase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an ongoing consultative process and a decision will be made when that process is finished. I thank Deputies Bruton and Quinn for their remarks. We will try to achieve as much progress as possible and, hopefully, a conclusion. We will endeavour to do all we can to achieve clarity and accountability which is necessary if there is to be a breakthrough. Proposals will be put forward which have been <Col N="7" /> worked out. General de Chastelain, who has worked long and hard on this issue, will also play a major role. I thank the House for its constructive support throughout this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be undesirable if the national development plan was published the week after the House went into recess. This is an important document setting out the priorities for the next six years as to how money will be spent. The plan will commit the House with regard to its budgets for the next six years. To publish a document of that nature a week after the House goes into recess would be to show a lack of respect for the House. I am sure the Government would not wish to do so deliberately, but it could end up doing so by omission unless the document is published this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983 (Increase in Number of Ordinary Members of An Bord Pleanála) Order, 1999, a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 11 June 1999.</P>
      <P>The physical planning system is in many ways the key to the successful provision of housing, places of employment, transport and other infrastructure for the future. The challenge facing the planning system is to ensure this is done in an economic, efficient and environmentally sustainable way. The Government is concerned about delays in the planning system and is taking appropriate action.</P>
      <P>However, building output has increased by more than 60 per cent since 1994. This is the highest growth rate in building output in Europe and in the history of the State. Housing output has doubled, from less than 20,000 houses in 1993 to an all-time record of over 42,000 in 1998, and all the signs are that this will probably be surpassed this year. Ireland now has the highest house building rate in Europe. The planning system has done well to facilitate this unprecedented level of building activity, but this has obviously put a strain on the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central Statistics Office data show that a total of 9,214 planning permissions were granted in the first quarter of 1999 compared with 7,822 for the same period in 1998. This is an increase of 17.8 per cent. The number of new houses covered by the permissions in the first quarter of 1999 was 10,600, the highest number ever for the first quarter of the year. This was also the second highest number for any quarter ever. The highest number <Col N="12" /> of new houses covered by permissions in any quarter was 12,232 in the third quarter of 1998.</P>
    <P>While the system has coped well with this huge influx of applications and appeals, delays have arisen in processing planning applications and appeals. This is why more resources are being allocated to planning at national and local level. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has asked the local authorities to review their operations and, where necessary, employ additional planners. A survey carried out by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in mid-May this year showed that staff numbers in the larger local authority planning departments, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, had increased by some 14 per cent over the preceding year to over 750. Several of the local authorities indicated they were on the point of recruiting additional staff to their planning departments, so I am confident the situation has improved even further since then.</P>
    <P>This draft order to appoint one additional member to An Bord Pleanála, which the House is being asked to approve, is just one of many measures being put in place to bolster the efficiency and timeliness of the board's service. An Bord Pleanála, its staff and board members play a crucial role in the planning system. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to their hard work and for the enormous efforts they have made in coping with the huge increase in planning appeals in recent years.</P>
    <P>While we may disagree with individual decisions of the board from time to time, it is fair to say that the board has won widespread respect for doing its job with scrupulous impartiality. It is unrealistic to expect that there would be unanimity throughout the country in relation to all planning decisions. What is required is an independent consideration of the planning authorities' decisions. However, we must ultimately accept that different people will arrive at different decisions in respect of the same facts. The courts have accepted this and ruled that, provided the board adopts due process and bases its decisions on the facts before it, they will not question the planning merits of its decisions.</P>
    <P>Through its work, An Bord Pleanála has played an essential role in ensuring that the best qualities of the Irish planning system are preserved and upheld. For a small fee, people seeking planning permission and third parties who feel that the proper principles of planning and development are not being upheld have an opportunity to appeal local authority planning decisions to a completely independent body. This third party right of appeal is almost unheard of in most other European countries.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is, of course, very concerned, along with An Bord Pleanála, at the deterioration in the time taken by the board to determine appeals. Last year the Minister increased the number of board members by 50 per cent to the current level of <Col N="13" /> nine and approved all the board's proposals for additional staffing. The board's Exchequer grant has almost doubled over the period 1995-99. The growth in this grant mainly reflects the increased pay and non-pay costs arising from the additional staffing measures which have been approved. Since 1995 staff numbers have increased from 70.5 to a currently approved staffing level of 105. That number excludes the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The continuous increase in the number of appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála is continuing in 1999, although at a reduced rate. It is expected that appeals in 1999 will be in the region of 5,230. The estimated intake for 1999 represents a doubling of the average intake over the recent ten year period from 1986 to 1995. This increase in appeals has seriously affected the ability of the board to fulfil its statutory objective of determining appeals within four months. At the end of May 1999 the four month rate had dropped to 41 per cent, which is unacceptable to the Minister and the board. Further increased staffing to deal with the increase in appeals has been approved and the board is recruiting this staff.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the present level of arrears is the long delay in 1998 and 1999 in recruiting extra staff, particularly additional inspectors. The board had experienced difficulties in recruiting experienced professional planners. To overcome these difficulties, it advertised in the UK for planners. There were 29 inspectors at the end of May 1999 compared with an average of 26.8 during 1998. Four further inspectors from an existing panel are expected to take up duty by early July. Offers have been made for a further four extra jobs following recent interviews for senior planning inspector and planning inspector posts. Six additional fee-per-case inspectors have been engaged. Offers have also been made for nine administrative assistant jobs following interviews held at the end of May. This additional staff will help considerably with reducing the backlog in the processing of appeals but will, in turn, increase the pressure on the board in deciding cases.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998, enables the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to increase the number of board members to meet the demands of the increased workload. Three additional members were appointed in 1999 for a period of three years up to 6 November 2001 and it is proposed that the additional member now being sought should serve for the same period. The chairman of the board and the Minister are of the view that an additional board member is required in order to achieve the necessary improvements in performance.</P>
    <P>In order to explain why an additional board member is required, I wish to briefly outline the workings of the board. An Bord Pleanála is a full-time board. Its procedures are such that no single person, be they a board member, inspector or other staff member, can ensure what the board's <Col N="14" /> decision will be in a particular appeal. While the quorum for a board meeting is three, all members would usually attend a meeting where a particularly complex or sensitive case is involved.</P>
    <P>In considering an appeal, account is taken of all submissions on the file, together with the inspector's report and recommendation. The board gives due consideration to the report but its decision may at times be at variance with the recommendation of an inspector. For example, in 1998 the board accepted the general thrust of an inspector's recommendation in 91 per cent of cases. It can be seen that these carefully balanced procedures place considerable obligations on all board members. After all, there would be no point in having a board if it was bound to accept the recommendations of an inspector. However, in overruling the recommendation of an inspector, the board must be satisfied that the facts before it support such a decision.</P>
    <P>The board is required to give reasons for its decisions, but some might not be as clear as they could be. The chairman of the board has acknowledged this criticism and said the board would give clearer reasons in the future. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The most recent measures taken have not given better results for a number of reasons. First, there is the ongoing increase in the number of appeals. It might be noted that the number of cases disposed of by the board in 1998 was 4,057, the highest number in any year and an increase of 12 per cent on 1997. As already stated, the board has experienced difficulties in recruiting planners but has advertised vacancies in the UK to overcome this problem. In addition, the recruitment of new staff necessarily entails a timelag due to the need to train staff in the board's procedures. However, the rate of increase in the number of appeals is now falling and with the additional staff being put in place I am confident that the situation will show considerable improvement before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Up-to-date legislation also has a role to play in an efficient planning system. Immediately upon coming into office the Government initiated a comprehensive review of planning legislation. Arising out of that review the Government approved the heads of a planning and development Bill on 19 January 1999 to replace the current planning code in Ireland. The Bill will substantially revise, update, modernise and consolidate existing planning legislation. I expect it to be published within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give us an opportunity to discuss all aspects of the planning code, including the provisions in relation to An Bord Pleanála. I know that the Minister looks forward to discussing those issues when we deal with the Bill in the House. While we cannot pre-empt publication of the Bill, among its objectives is the more efficient adoption of development plans and improvements in the procedures for granting planning permissions. The powers for enforce<Col N="15" /> ment of the planning code will also be strengthened.</P>
    <P>In addition to reforming and updating planning legislation, the planning system must be underpinned by better guidance, which reflects national priorities and international experience. Such guidance also provides certainty for local authorities, developers and the general public in respect of policies and standards.</P>
    <P>On the question of planning guidance, a number of important initiatives are under way. Deputies will be aware that public consultation draft guidelines on increasing residential densities have been issued. Increased densities in appropriate locations such as those adjacent to public transport can ensure a more sustainable pattern of development and optimal use of serviced land.</P>
    <P>Increasing densities can also facilitate varying house types to provide for differing household sizes and needs. Good design, however, is of crucial importance to ensure a high quality living environment and public acceptability of higher densities. The submissions received in relation to the residential density guidelines are currently being considered in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and a final version will be issued as soon as possible. Guidelines for consultation on retail development have also issued. The location of large scale retail development has a strong influence on the viability and vitality of town centres, the accessibility of services, traffic flows and on the sustainability of our development generally.</P>
    <P>An important recent development was the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area which were launched in March. We can see the pressures of rapidly expanding development and economic activity all around us in the Dublin area as spare infrastructural capacity is taken up and congestion becomes a damper on future growth. The population of the greater Dublin area is set to grow by more than 250,000 people by 2011. Even more significantly, we will have four additional households for every ten in 1996.</P>
    <P>These guidelines are based on the principles of social cohesion, sustainability and competitiveness. These goals are to be delivered through a logical development strategy of maintaining a compact metropolitan area while developing strong growth centres in the hinterland area. The development of the metropolitan area is based on the consolidation of the existing built up areas with further development being located where it can be served by an enhanced public transport system.</P>
    <P>The policy for the hinterland area aims to build up a number of dynamic satellite towns such as Drogheda, Navan, Naas and Wicklow. Each of these towns is on an existing transportation corridor and the intention is that in the long-term they would have a strong measure of self-sufficiency including a high level of employment activities, high order shopping and a full range of educational and social facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The Government is committed to the implementation of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. The successful implementation of the guidelines will depend on the commitment of central Government, the relevant local authorities and the private sector. The role of central Government will be to ensure that the necessary strategic infrastructural investments are undertaken. Local authorities will be the driving force in ensuring that development plans are up to date and in harmony with the guidelines and in ensuring that the infrastructure is put in place. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has written to all the local authorities in the greater Dublin area asking them to review their development plans to ensure that they are in harmony with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>Subject to the approval of this motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will appoint the additional member in accordance with the 1998 Act from a list of nominees selected by the organisations on the Economic Development and Construction Panel prescribed in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994. This is because the three board members appointed this year were from the other three panels. The organisations involved in the Economic Development and Construction Panel will have two months in which to submit two nominations for consideration by the Minister. Nominations will be sought immediately.</P>
    <P>Pending a permanent appointment, it is, however, open to the Minister to appoint an official of his Department to fill the position temporarily and that is what he intends to do. The board will, therefore, have an additional member available for the beginning of July.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House of this Government's continuing efforts to ensure an effective and up to date planning system which meets the needs of our growing economy while protecting our high environmental quality. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister of State present this motion has been a very frustrating experience. I appreciate he is on a mission for a colleague, which is outside his area of responsibility. I am not making any personal remarks about him, but this is a very bad presentation of the motion before the House. It touches on a series of issues and then moves on without ever giving us a real insight into what the Government's thinking happens to be on some very important issues. The Minister of State made some points today about the way An Bord Pleanála goes about its business and some of the Government's views on these matters, which we have not heard before. We had some information about An Bord Pleanála which confirmed our fears that, instead of getting better, the position in relation to dealing with planning appeals was rapidly getting worse. We find that even those of us who com<Col N="17" /> plained most about it tended, if anything, to underestimate the difficulties.</P>
      <P>This statement gave some justification for the step that is being taken, but it was an odd experience to sit here and listen to the Minister of State give a justification for what is being proposed and say, in effect, that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government knows that what he is putting before us will not resolve the problem in a satisfactory way because there is a series of other measures that have yet to be done.  I strongly advise the Minister of State, on a purely personal level, to go back to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and ask him to stop sending people out to say we will have the new planning legislation mid-year when it is already three days after midsummer's day. That is a joke.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government was very coy earlier this year when we asked him when we could see the new planning Bill to which he replied &ldquo;by the middle of the year&rdquo;. Being the suspicious people we are, we asked him if that meant before or after the local elections and he said &ldquo;by the middle of the year&rdquo;. The middle of the year has come and gone and we still do not have the Bill. I would be prepared to bet a fair amount of money on the proposition that we are most unlikely to see that Bill before the end of July. We will have plenty of time over the summer to consider it.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister of State has given us some information here, he has made a weak presentation on what is proposed to be done. He said that what is proposed is not the answer to the problem. I want to recall that the first approach made to me about this motion was a proposal last week that it be taken in this House without debate, to which I objected because I felt it was wrong to take a step like this without debate. The Government wants us to put this measure through the House without telling us, for example, what is the rate of decision on appeals within the statutory four month period. The rate of determination of appeals within the four month period is now far lower than it was in January and February 1998 when we last discussed these issues and it has been getting worse at a rate of knots. The Minister of State has tried to explain that this was due to difficulties in appointing planners and finding planners. He has given us much wisdom about prospecting for planners in various parts of the world in order us solve the problem. That problem did not arise overnight. It was seen coming along time previously. To use one of the favourite phrases of the Minister of State's partners in Government, this was coming down the tracks a long time ago and the Government is only now trying to put a barrier in the way of this runaway train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this morning's Order of Business, my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of the Opposition, raised some issues which are very germane to what is being dealt with in this motion. He referred to the functions of An Bord <Col N="18" /> Pleanála and to what the Minister of State said about the intentions of the measure that is proposed. The Minister of State said that we need &ldquo;an independent consideration of the planning authorities' decisions&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the courts have accepted this and ruled that provided the board adopts due process and bases its decisions on the facts before it, it will not question the planning merits of the board's decisions&rdquo;. He reminded us that we have a right of third party appeal in this country, which is an important right that does not have many parallels elsewhere, and I agree that is the case.  He went on to deal with the way the board does its business using due process and he spoke about a quorum. He said:</P>
    <P>In considering an appeal, all submissions on the file are considered, together with the inspector's report and recommendation. The board gives due consideration to the report but the decision may at times be at variance with the recommendation of the inspector.</P>
    <P>With respect, I suggest the Minister of State tells his colleagues in the Department that in saying &ldquo;the decision may at times be at variance with the recommendation of the inspector&rdquo; they have dribbled a bibful, as we used to describe an indiscretion when I was in school. There has been case after case where decisions made by An Bord Pleanála do not only seem to be at variance with the recommendation of the inspector but are glaringly so.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The board is required to give reasons for its decisions, but some might not be as clear as they could be. The chairman of the board has acknowledged this criticism and said it would give clearer reasons in the future. This is a welcome move by the board.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in the Minister's office there is a person who deserves to be garlanded as the master of understatement. Some decisions might not be as clear as they could be &ndash; one can put that up in lights. In how many cases have decisions been made by An Bord Pleanála that run directly counter to the recommendations of the inspector? The chairman of the board said it would give clearer reasons in the future &ndash; I wonder what he means by clearer reasons. There are many cases where decisions made by An Bord Pleanála are incomprehensible to the public and where the reasons given for the divergence between decisions and the recommendations of the inspector are unfathomable.</P>
    <P>This could be dealt with in a manner beyond the grudging acceptance indicated in the Minister of State's contribution. For example, An Bord Pleanála could adopt a clearer and more consistent approach to requests for oral hearings. There are many cases where an oral hearing would add substantially to public understanding of a decision, although it would not necessarily add to the acceptance of it. If there was an oral hearing there might be some possibility that we could <Col N="19" /> begin, in some cases, to understand the reasons for the difference between the decision finally made by the board and the recommendation of the inspector.</P>

      <P>This morning, Deputy John Bruton raised two issues which are important in this process. There are cases on record, and admissions to that effect, where people have objected to planning decisions of local authorities at the behest of people who are in competition with those who sought the permission. People have admitted on record that they objected to a planning application for a commercial or industrial project because a competitor paid them. There are also cases on record where people have admitted they withdrew objections to planning applications or appeals because they were given inducements, in some cases cash inducements. This is a difficult area.</P>
      <P>There have been cases where housing developers have made it clear to local authorities and groups that as a part of a development and to mark their commitment to concerns in the area they will fund the provision of certain amenities and in some cases construct them. That may well be legitimate because some of the concern people have about housing developments is directly linked to the level of provision of housing amenities. As all Members know, there are many areas earmarked for new housing developments where existing residents say schools, green and recreational areas and amenities of all kinds are already inadequate. It seems reasonable for a developer to undertake to provide amenities, a community centre, playground or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems, and this was the thrust of Deputy John Bruton's contribution this morning, that we should look again at how these matters are handled, particularly the propriety of cash payments to cover the cost of lodging or withdrawing objections. This is important if we are to arrive at a point where there is due process by An Bord Pleanála and all the considerations affecting the appeal are considered. As the Minister of State said: &ldquo;In considering an appeal, all submissions on the file are considered, together with the inspector's report and recommendation&rdquo;. That could well be bona fide as regards the operations of the board. However, I am not convinced. I suspect the evidence is there to suggest the contrary <Col N="20" />&ndash; that the board is always aware of payments being made as regards appeals.</P>
    <P>For example, if an application for a commercial development is appealed to the board and the objection has been made, financed and solicited by a competitor of the appellant, will the board deal with that in considering the appeal? If the appeal concerns a substantial housing development where the developer has offered an inducement in cash or kind, in terms of amenities, to the existing residents, will it be made known to the board in its consideration of the appeal? If it is made known, does it affect how the board views the inspector's report or recommendations and how it makes its decision? These issues need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>It goes beyond the scope of the motion but we debated this issue last January and February when we passed the current legislation. We also debated some relevant issues during the passage of the last Local Government (Planning and Development) Act and we will return to them during the debate on the new legislation which we were promised would be introduced in midsummer, which is already gone. We need greater transparency about the way the board makes its decisions, their content and the way it views the advice given to it by its inspectors. I hope the Minister will agree that when it comes to dealing with that legislation, the board should have oral hearings more often and that in any case where the board makes a decision contrary to the recommendation of the inspector, it should produce a detailed, motivated explanation of the reason for the difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I that one should not be compelled to accept the advice and recommendations of one's technical experts. The other day I even heard the Tánaiste waxing almost lyrical on this in the context of the question of financial regulation. Nevertheless, given that we provide for the employment of people with particular qualifications who can give expert advice and expect their expert advice to be relevant and to take account of the objectives we have set out in the relevant legislation, we should have a good reason for going against their advice, whether we are a Minister, Minister of State or the board of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The proposed measure will not solve the problem. The Minister of State has clearly said this. If my memory does not deceive me, he said the four month rate of clearance of appeals by An Bord Pleanála has been reduced below 94 per cent. Am I right in saying that?</P>

      <P>It has got worse since last year and since we first gave the Government the authority to add new members to the board. It has got worse because there is a backlog from previous years. That was entirely foreseeable. We knew when we passed the Act last year that this backlog existed and precious little has been done to <Col N="21" /> reduce it. I do not see much proposed in this motion &ndash; although it is not part of the motion &ndash; that will sort it out.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has informed us it is the Government's view that &ldquo;as well as reforming and updating planning legislation, the planning system must be underpinned by better guidance, which reflects national priorities and international experience&rdquo;. More than better guidance is needed. We need a clear expression by the Government of development objectives, the quality criteria it expects to impose on development and some strategic thinking.</P>
      <P>It is idle, at this point, to ask the local authorities in the greater Dublin area &ldquo;to review their development plans to ensure that they are in harmony with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines&rdquo;. I do not pretend to be intimately acquainted with the development plans of the local authorities in the Dublin area but, as far as I know, they have all agreed their development plans. We have in place a detailed body of legislation that determines and regulates reviews of development plans. It is not an easy process. The Dublin local authorities cannot say to their members next week that, as the Minister of State said in the Dáil that they must be in harmony with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines, they must go back and examine the development plan again. That would be a recipe for chaos. The Government has lost that opportunity to influence matters.</P>
      <P>The Government has not given any real sense of its strategic guidelines for the Dublin area. I say that, partly because I believe it is time to take a much more hard-headed view of the development of the Dublin area and to place limits on it, but also because I firmly believe the lack of clarity in these guidelines will produce a situation in which there will be more rather than less appeals, and in which this proposed measure will be shown to be inadequate rather than solving the problem, which is what the Minister of State should be setting out to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the appointment of an additional member of An Bord Pleanála. It gives us an opportunity to discuss the work of An Bord Pleanála and to touch on some wider issues relating to planning and development.</P>
      <P>The specific Government proposal is to appoint one additional member to An Bord Pleanála. Given what the Minister of State has told us this morning and what we know about the delays in the planning process, this measure is simply not sufficient to deal with what is clearly a crisis in the processing of planning appeals by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>The extent of the problem was outlined by the Minister of State in his speech, when he stated &ldquo;At the end of May 1999, the four month rate had dropped to 41 per cent, which is unacceptable, both to the Minister and to the board itself&rdquo;. It is unacceptable that six out of ten planning appeals are now taking longer than the statutory four month period to determine. In a country where we have an acknowledged housing problem, where &ndash; irrespective of the view one takes of the housing crisis &ndash; housing supply is part of the solution, and where we pride ourselves on a high level of economic growth and where economic development is clearly important, it is unacceptable that we have a blockage in our planning system which delays the processing and determining of planning decisions. We simply cannot have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not just talking here about the four month period it takes to determine the appeal &ndash; we are talking about the pre-planning application period of time for the erection of notices and the placement of advertisements and the two month minimum period it takes for a decision to be made by a local authority. In practice, many planning authorities are also taking longer than the two month period to make a planning decision, in some cases for the same reasons An Bord Pleanála is having a difficulty. It is now quite regular for planning authorities to either extend the period of time in which a decision is made or to seek additional information on a planning application, which is another way of extending the time period for a decision. There is then a period of months in which an appeal can be lodged. It takes a minimum of four months and, as the Minister of State acknowledged, in 60 per cent of cases it now takes longer than four months to determine the application. In other words, from the moment a person decides to proceed with a development, it takes almost a year to complete the planning process. <Col N="23" /> Given what we know about the housing situation and the general desire of the House and the public for economic development and prosperity to continue, this country cannot afford such delays in our planning process.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what is being proposed this morning will resolve the problem. All that is being proposed is that we appoint one additional member to An Bord Pleanála. I agree with that and the Labour Party intends to support the motion. However, the Minister of State has also indicated there is a further problem in An Bord Pleanála, in that the board has experienced difficulties in recruiting professional planners. The proposed solution is to recruit in the United Kingdom. That may provide some short-term relief. However, we need to look at this in a much wider and more long-term context. This problem has not arisen overnight. We have known for some time that delays have been occurring in the entire planning system. Anybody who has knowledge of the local authority system or the construction industry here knows there have been delays in our planning process for quite some time and that those delays are directly attributable to a shortage of staff and resources in the local planning authorities in the first instance and in An Bord Pleanála specifically. I cannot understand why we have not made better provision in the longer term for the training, education and provision of a corps of professional planners in order to meet this growing need.</P>
    <P>A cohort of students have just sat their leaving certificate and are anxiously awaiting their results to see whether they acquired the number of points necessary to get onto various professional courses, including the courses that train and educate people to be professional planners in our planning system. It is quite inexplicable that on the one hand we are telling young people who have just sat their leaving certificate that they have to reach such enormously high standards in order to get onto the courses that will qualify them as planners and on the other hand we do not have enough planners in the country to the extent that we have to recruit abroad.</P>
    <P>There are two measures that could be taken, and I am disappointed the Minister has not addressed them this morning. What are we doing about the training and education of additional people with the professional qualifications to qualify them as planners in the longer term? What is our anticipation of the needs over the next ten to 15 years and what provision is being made in our education system in order to equip us with the corps of professionals that is required to meet that need?</P>
    <P>Are there measures that can be taken now to bring into the planning system people who, perhaps, have not gone through the full professional training in planning in the normal post-school circumstances but who, through their own professional careers or involvement with or knowledge of planning, might be in a position where <Col N="24" /> they could, with shorter courses, be brought to a level of competence to work in our planning systems? Is it a problem of pay? Is it the case that the levels of pay which are paid to professionals in the public service are no longer sufficiently attractive to the numbers required in the public service planning system at a time when, perhaps, there are more attractive offers and more attractive opportunities available to people with planning qualifications in the private sector? That issue needs to be addressed. Not only does this problem exist in An Bord Pleanála, it also exists in local authorities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said about the increase in the number of staff who are being recruited in local authorities, but it is generally accepted and known that throughout the local authority system there is a shortage of professional planners, and local authorities are having difficulties in recruiting professional planners at this time. That, in turn, is delaying the processing of planning applications, but it is also creating dangerous short-cuts which will ultimately undermine the public credibility of the planning process and the quality of good planning in our local authorities. Planners no longer have the time that is required to have pre-planning discussions with developers, to talk to third party objectors about planning applications or, in some cases, to deal with the queries and representations made by public representatives in relation to planning applications.</P>
    <P>I suspect that if there were better resourcing of the planning system and more planners at local level, the number of appeals might be reduced. If one can deal with some of the problems in the planning application as it is going through the local authority system, if one can deal, for example, with some of the objections from third parties by the placement of conditions on the planning permission which is granted, and if there were a greater degree of consultation at local level, perhaps the scope and extent of appeals which are subsequently lodged to An Bord Pleanála might be reduced.</P>
    <P>There is a further issue which also arises as a result of the shortage of resources in the planning departments of local authorities, and that has to do with the enforcement of planning decisions. There has been a very significant deterioration in the degree of enforcement of planning permissions, in the conditions attaching to planning permissions in recent years. That is directly attributable to the inadequate resources which are available at local level as against the increased number of planning applications which are being submitted and the complexity of many of these planning applications, many now carrying either as a requirement or on a voluntary basis the submission of quite detailed environmental impact studies. Planners at local level simply do not have the time or the resources to follow up on the enforcement of planning decisions. This undermines confidence in the planning system and encourages appeals to An Bord Pleanála. People <Col N="25" /> see that a development has occurred where conditions have not been enforced, where inspectors of the local authority have not come out when requested to do so to look at some aspect or other of the development. Inevitably, when the next development comes up in that locality, there is an automatic encouragement for people to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the resourcing of our planning system needs to be addressed given the increased construction activity, with increases in the amount of residential development as well as physical development which is taking place for economic purposes. It is no longer a question of shortage of resources because planning fees are submitted and developers have to pay various levies and contributions to planning authorities in order to get planning permission. It is lack of organisation, lack of preparedness and lack of good government which has resulted in a mess as far as the processing of planning applications is concerned, with delays occurring, an inadequate enforcement regime and other problems such as those we all encounter in our work.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála fashions and shapes the entire complexion of the planning system. It interprets the planning Acts and regulations and, at a practical level, the guidelines which are issued. In many ways it functions similarly to the Supreme Court in relation to our general body of law. Before this motion was tabled for discussion in the House, I had asked at the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government that the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála should be invited by the committee to address it to deal with some of the issues in the planning process that are of concern to us as public representatives and as Members of the House. I understand that meeting is being arranged for next week and I look forward to it. I very much respect the independence of An Bord Pleanála and the integrity of its members and staff. I would not wish in any way to get involved in a discussion at the committee about individual planning decisions, because they are matters to be decided on their own merits by the board. These are issues which need to be addressed and I hope the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála will address them when he appears before the committee.</P>
    <P>Circumstances in planning have changed. In addition to the Planning Acts and the normal regulations, there is now a body of guidelines on residential density and retail development, there are strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, a new planning Bill will shortly be published and unprecedented levels of residential development and construction activity are under way. There is also increased pressure to integrate residential, economic and transport factors into planning.</P>
    <P>How does An Bord Pleanála deal with applications in that context? How is its thinking changing? We need to know that. As the Minister pointed out, the reasons given by An Bord Plean<Col N="26" /> ála are often difficult to understand. The rationale of An Bord Pleanála must be spelt out in its decisions. We need to know what it thinks because that thinking will shape the ideas of planners at local level which, in turn, will influence the applications submitted by developers.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in the Labour Party, Deputies, Senators and members of local authorities, in the few months I have held the environment and local government portfolio have drawn to my attention cases in which An Bord Pleanála's decisions are not only at variance with the recommendations made by the inspector, but in some cases stand the inspector's recommendation on its head. I accept that the way in which An Bord Pleanála operates allows for it to make decisions which are at variance with the inspector's report but anecdotal evidence points to an increase in the incidence of decisions being made which overturn the inspector's recommendation. The incomprehension of the logic for the overturning of the inspector's recommendation gives rise to a requirement that, where An Bord Pleanála is going to depart from the recommendations made by an inspector, it should explain in detail why it has departed from the recommendation. If it does not do that, it leaves open the possibility of reasons being attributed to it which may be unfair but which will undermine public confidence in An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>We have been promised a new planning and development Bill for some time. The consultative work about the planning system was begun by my colleague Deputy Howlin when he was Minister for the Environment. I am disappointed that it is taking the Government so long to produce this Bill. The Minister told us today that the heads of the Bill were approved by the Government in January. What is causing the delay? I asked the Minister when he appeared before the Committee on the Environment and Local Government some weeks ago if he would make the heads of the Bill available. I still think they should be made available to us. We are now told that the Bill will be published in a few weeks time. It is a pity that we have lost the opportunity of the past six months when the Minister might have usefully taken on board some of the suggestions of Members for the heads of the Bill before final drafting takes place.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be published soon. There is need for a comprehensive debate on planning. The 1963 Act was introduced when this State was changing from a rural to an industrial base. This State has changed in many ways since 1963. We need a new legislative framework for planning which integrates with social needs to bring us through the next quarter of a century. The sooner the Bill is published and we can begin to debate it properly, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála by one. I only do so because the increase will assist <Col N="27" /> in dealing with the backlog of appeals and applications currently before the board.</P>
      <P>I join previous speakers in their analyses of the workings of An Bord Pleanála; there is a great deal of public anger about how it operates. There are many examples which explain why that anger is running at such a high level. The fact that local authorities can pass or refuse an application, submit it to An Bord Pleanála to be dealt with by an inspector and that inspector's report can be overturned is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The time has come to overhaul the board. In my own county the local authority refused planning permission to a development. Consideration was given to the application by the members of the authority, the engineering staff and the county manager. It was then sent to An Bord Pleanála, where a 20 page report signed by the inspector recommended refusal. A single page attached to that report issued permission for the development. It gave no reasons to support the granting of permission. When the local community tried to determine why such a decision had been taken, they were not given any reason.</P>
      <P>There was a similar case in County Carlow with the same result. Because of cases of that type, confidence in An Bord Pleanála is at an all time low. To correct the anomalies we must look at the board itself. That a quorum of three can adjudicate on an application which has come from the local authority through the inspectors to the board gives rise to many questions. Procedure within the board must be examined.</P>
      <P>Although comprehensive legislation is being prepared, there is a need for a Bill between now and the completion of that legislation to deal with the serious situation which exists in planning. There is a need to look at local authorities and ensure they are properly resourced so they can play a more proactive role in planning applications.</P>
      <P>There is an immediate need to ensure An Bord Pleanála takes into account county and city development plans because, at the moment, it totally ignores those plans. In one county, an application was refused by An Bord Pleanála but a similar one made in the same location was granted. It used the opposite argument to grant the permission than it had used to refuse it almost 12 months earlier.</P>
      <P>Because the public can access information and see the files, I clearly understand why they cannot comprehend what method is used to grant or refuse these permissions. There is a need to establish proper staffing levels within local authorities. There is also a need to ensure there are town planners in planning sections so that an application can be teased out with the applicant prior to being considered by the local authority. Any assistance necessary should be given to the applicant or the local community so that they understand exactly what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for An Bord Pleanála to have a special unit to deal with applications relative to <Col N="28" /> medieval cities, such as Kilkenny. Professor John Bradley from NUI Maynooth gave a lecture recently in which he said that more damage was done to Kilkenny in the past 20 years than was done by Cromwell when he visited the city. That comment forced me to look at the applications. I found that most of the applications which were successful and granted by An Bord Pleanála were more offensive to the development of Kilkenny. To add insult to injury, the board did not deal with the issues, as the local authority did, when granting the applications. It ignored the traffic implications and the issues with which the local authority had dealt and said they were issues for the local authority. I find that unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I have served on a local authority for 20 years and I do not understand how an outside body dealing with a medieval city like Kilkenny can begin to understand from where we are coming or how we feel about the fabric of the city. An Bord Pleanála deals with an application from afar and does not understand or have to take into consideration our city development plan and what we are trying to do in terms of protecting the heritage there. It ignored the fact that some of these buildings were beside heritage sites and included listed buildings. In one instance, it allowed a shopping centre to be developed on lands behind the High Street in Kilkenny. It gave no consideration to the traffic problems or the historical element of that site. In fact, it gave permission to take down a shop front which was listed and have it erected elsewhere. It gave no assistance to the local authority in policing that development or in enforcing the conditions laid down. All in all, there is a serious problem with planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to satellite towns. We must take into consideration that people will no longer buy into that concept and will live in a place where they will have the quality of life they require. They will no longer go to where the jobs are and are prepared to travel to their place of employment so that they can enjoy a good quality of life. If we continue to move the problem out of Dublin, surely it is reasonable to expect that cities, such as Kilkenny and Carlow, will begin to prosper and feel the pinch of extra development and high density. If that is the case, what protection will legislation extend to those counties, and to the planning and development of those counties, particularly when one considers the present law which allows An Bord Pleanála to ignore city and county development plans. We must put in place a plan which will look at the impact of this new development on rural towns and cities, such as those I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The judicial review process which is open to any member of the public after An Bord Pleanála makes its decision is deplorable. Effectively, it is open only to those with money and who can afford to engage in that process. Local communities, because of the cost, are almost debarred from engaging in the legal process and end up running race nights and cabarets to take on the large developers and developments. Any new <Col N="29" /> legislation will have to deal with those issues. I am happy to see that across the political divide in this House there is a reasonable understanding that something needs to be done urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion will make very little difference in terms of the planning and development problems faced by every county council, particularly those in the Dublin area. If there is one issue which can affect people's quality of life it is planning. Some monumentally disastrous decisions taken in this city and county in the 1960s have affected the quality of life of the people and have caused unbelievable prejudice within our communities. The Minister has been around long enough to know of the decisions taken in this city which resulted in the destruction of some of the finest buildings of which any European Union capital would be proud to boast. Some of these decisions were taken in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</P>
      <P>In my area, there was virtually a mushrooming of a new conurbation in the south-west of the city. The problems associated with some of those estates were caused by bad planning. It is virtually impossible to get agreement on additional local authority housing, in-fill housing or large scale public housing because of the prejudice which exists within residential communities and the fact we do not have mixed development. In many parts of the European Union, there is good quality mixed development which brings together public and private housing and people of different ages. A community cannot be created with only one age group or one type of social housing; it needs a variety of uses and attachments.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report published recently states very clearly what needs to be done. We need additional housing, infrastructure, transport routes and so on. Everyone is agreed on what needs to be done but when it comes to the implementation of those plans at local authority level, some members move away from those objectives. As we face the new millennium, we need to debate what needs to be done at an infrastructural level and how we will implement those plans. There is no point in the ESRI telling us or lecturing us, quite frankly, on what needs to be done from a residential or transport point of view if the proper mechanism is not in place to implement those decisions. We must concentrate on this issue as much as we talk about how we are going to find additional houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that one of the reasons house prices continue to spiral out of the grasp of most people on average incomes relates to supply. The Minister said there has been an additional supply of housing, which is welcome, but one of the reasons supply has not been more forthcoming is the slow rate at which planning applications are processed by local authorities in Dublin city and county. This must be addressed. People must recognise that a component of increasing house prices is the stagnation in planning departments throughout the country. The issue cannot be <Col N="30" /> addressed simply by appointing additional planning officers, although that is essential. We must also streamline the resources of planning and development departments in local authorities.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Gilmore refer to the need for additional planning officers, which is self-evident. What work is being done in terms of recruiting additional planning officers? Have negotiations been taking place between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Education and Science in terms of making a career in planning more attractive to young people? There must be a positive campaign, in the third level sector in particular, to encourage more people to take up a career in planning. There are people working in development who could become planners following a one or two year training course. We must consider how we can best use the available employees in local authorities. We must address the issue of planning delays as it is part and parcel of the house prices issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise third party rights of appeal. I think Ireland is the only EU member state where somebody from Malin Head, for example, can oppose a development taking place in my constituency or in west Cork. This has led to quite a number of vexatious appeals to An Bord Pleanála. As the leader of my party said on this morning's Order of Business, there are already cases of developers using the appeal mechanism to delay developments by competitors. This is a corrupt practice which must be addressed. Is the appeals system being used against the common good? Is it being used directly by people against competitors? If this is happening, and I believe it is, it must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>This is related to one of the reasons the Government has been criticised in the debate, namely, that it has not yet published the planning legislation. The Government has been in office for two years and it is unbelievable that the legislation has not been presented to the House. The Minister said the legislation will be published and presented in the very near future, I suspect during the summer recess. It is major legislation on which substantial work will be required on Committee Stage and it is unlikely to be in force before well into next year. How seriously can we take the Government's commitment to streamline, modernise and make more effective the planning laws when two years into office this legislation has not been presented? As Deputy Gilmore said, in January this year the heads of the Bill were agreed in the Department, so why has it taken so long for the legislation to be published? If the Government is serious about addressing, reforming and modernising planning, it should have published the legislation in the period from January. The Government stands indicted for not publishing it and failure to do so is directly contributing to the levels of disenchantment concerning the planning process.</P>
    <P>We must look in a radical way at the manner in which local authority planning departments are <Col N="31" /> advancing planning applications. On 1 April I proposed that a specific section in the Department of the Environment and Local Government should be established to monitor the progress taking place in key areas throughout the country where housing applications are required. This hands on approach by the Department is necessary in terms of local planning departments, particularly in areas where there is a substantial need for additional housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned two matters close to my heart and on which I would like to make brief comments. The first is the issue of increased densities. It is necessary that the new planning legislation sets out specific obligations on developers to provide social housing or a substantial contribution towards social housing in all new major developments. I would argue that this does not require legislation and that it is quite possible that a general directive from the Department of the Environment and Local Government could be given to local authorities mandating them and demanding that all major developments in future have a social housing component, or that a contribution be made towards social housing. Recently I met a local authority official in Belfast who told me that in Belfast the local authority is making provision whereby developers would provide schools and community services and facilities as part of the conditions under the planning laws. Developers are making substantial amounts of money in Dublin city and it is only right that they give something back.</P>

      <P>I welcome the proposal to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála because the board's operations at present are slow and cumbersome. I hope this measure, small though it is, will in some way speed up and make more efficient the system which exists. The system has slowed down to an extent because of the rate of development which we have had over recent years. While growth is welcome, there is always the challenge of achieving balance between protecting the environment and preserving the surrounding area while at the same time meeting the needs and demands of housing development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing applications have caused the system to grind very slowly. In particular the Dublin area is witnessing such change that we will end up with a situation where it will stretch from Dundalk to Arklow and as far as Mullingar. Yet we still cannot meet the requirements and demands for housing, particularly from young couples. We could increase supply by increasing density. It is important to acknowledge that increasing housing density does not mean decreasing quality. Good quality houses can be provided at lower cost in <Col N="32" /> areas where they are urgently needed. Given that we do not have a huge land bank in the Dublin area, it is very important that we apply our minds to this issue very quickly.</P>
    <P>The problems with An Bord Pleanála relate not only to the rate of reply to applications, another problem arises where people submit simultaneous applications. During the week we read about a man who objected to permission granted by his local council. This was refused by An Bord Pleanála. What he did not notice was that an identical application had been submitted at the same time and of which he was given no notice. If somebody is trying to get around the system by submitting simultaneous applications, at least the covering notice on the premises should be in a different colour and should be notified to the objector to the original development.</P>
    <P>I often question why an inspector from An Bord Pleanála recommends one decision while the board, in its wisdom, gives an entirely opposite view. In those circumstances it is necessary for the board to outline in detail the reason for its decision rather than just saying the proposal is not in keeping with the development of the area.</P>
    <P>A third problem concerns enforceability when An Bord Pleanála makes a decision. An individual or developer may go ahead with an application and months later nobody has decided to enforce the decision taken. There is not enough correlation between the work on the ground and the decisions being made by the board.</P>
    <P>In the area of planning related to the child care issue, an area where we have fallen down seriously in recent years, we have reached a crisis where couples cannot find a place for their children. It is not only a finance issue, it is a planning issue.</P>
    <P>When we consider the Bill on the wider planning issue, I hope we will insist that each new housing estate must provide a child care facility and a crèche. Currently there is not any co-ordination between the planning authorities and the the Department of Health and Children. People are working in opposite directions. I recommend some co-ordination between them. The responsibility should lie with the planners, who would give guidelines to people on how to fulfil Department of Health and Children, fire and safety, and planning regulations.</P>
    <P>In the Dún Laoghaire development plan, there is a ludicrous suggestion that permission will not be granted for a crèche with more than eight children. If we are serious about tackling the problem, while acknowledging the reservations of residents, we need to ensure that a place which is suitable for a crèche is allowed to take the number of children recommended by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>More particularly, I want the Minister to address the fact that if a woman decides to look after one child in her home and is paid for it, she must seek planning permission to do so. A woman could have ten children of her own in the <Col N="33" /> house and would not need planning permission to look after them, but because the word &ldquo;crèche&rdquo; is listed in the Planning Acts but is not defined to mean a particular number of children, child minders throughout the country could be affected by the planning laws. These are issues which are relevant not just to An Bord Pleanála but to the whole idea of planning. The Minister should redefine the use of the word &ldquo;crèche&rdquo; for child care purposes, allow tax relief on premises purchased for child care facilities, and recommend to the Minister for Finance that tax relief be given to those for which it is not currently available under the Bacon proposals and that co-ordination of the system between planning regulations, health regulations, etc., is taken into account.</P>
    <P>Having referred already to decisions not being enforced, the opposite seems to apply regarding child care. Recently a crèche had to close its doors on a Monday night because it had been refused planning permission. When parents arrived on the Tuesday morning to drop off the children they received an apology and were told they must take their children home. It simply is not good enough that no account is taken of the critical child care situation. It is an issue which relates to many Departments but particularly to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the work of all involved in processing planning applications. By and large they do a good job. I am particularly proud of my association with Dublin Corporation and with the assistant city manager in charge of planning, Mr. Seán Carey, and his principal officer, Mr. Geoghegan, both of whom have proved to be dedicated and committed and have a tremendous track record in the area of planning. I also congratulate all those involved in the planning department of Dublin Corporation with whom I have worked closely.</P>
      <P>I support what the Minister said regarding the challenge facing the planning system and urge him to ensure that it is done in an efficient, economical and environmentally sustainable way. I particularly noted the Minister's comment that Ireland has the highest growth rate in building output in Europe and in the history of the State. I support the view that the planning system has done well to facilitate this unprecedented level of building activity. I am pleased to note that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has asked the local authorities to review the operations and to employ additional planners.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Hanafin, referred to child care. In a unique provision in the last budget the Minister for Finance encouraged the development of crèche facilities by providing for 100 per cent capital allowances. On the other hand there are real difficulties in the planning aspect of this and this shows the contradictions involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, indicated that An Bord Pleanála has won widespread respect <Col N="34" /> for doing its job impartially and perhaps it is fair to say that. However, it is equally fair to say that, while I appreciate that the board is impartial and the inspector is there to make the report, it is a matter of serious public concern when the board does not support the inspector's recommendation. It is important to note that in 1998 the board accepted the general thrust of the inspector's recommendation in 91 per cent of cases. It is also important that we underline that the Minister also stated that in overruling the recommendation of an inspector the board must be satisfied that the facts before it support such decisions. In light of freedom of information provisions, etc., it is important that all those facts are available to people looking at the file.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I am particularly happy to note the Minister's comments regarding the guidelines for consultation on retail development and the location of large-scale retail development, and its influence on the viability of town centres and regions. It is important that we undertake more work in that area. As the House will be aware, a number of recommendations have been made.</P>
    <P>While we all appreciate that it is important that one may make a third party appeal, surely An Bord Pleanála should recognise, endorse and uphold the work which goes into development plans of local authorities. Local elected public representatives participate with local authority officials and planning departments to come up with plans, and it is important that we send a clear message to An Bord Pleanála to uphold the local development plans on all occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>I am sorry this motion comes before the House in this truncated way. The issue of planning, An Bord Pleanála and all that is associated with it requires more debate than the short time available allows.</P>
      <P>When An Bord Pleanála was set up, it was deemed necessary to take planning and development appeals out of the hands of Departments and place them in an impartial arena. In theory, that was a good idea. However, in the intervening period people have said the board should be accountable to somebody. These are not my words but the words of the public. I presume the reason is that when a decision seems at variance with commonsense, it is obvious that people will ask questions. We are not in a position to answer such questions and consequently the public criticises politicians for their alleged inability to intervene in an arena from which they are debarred in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion should have been introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. I mean no disrespect to my good neighbour and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, who resides across the <Col N="35" /> county boundary from me. Having had some experience of standing in for other people, I know that in issues of this nature the responsible Minister should be in the House. If he is not available on the day, then the item should not appear on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>A couple of things have changed since the mid-1970s. First, the rate of development has accelerated dramatically. In the 1970s a member of a local authority could look at a planning proposal and conclude in 20 minutes or less that it was either valid or invalid and that it would be successful or unsuccessful. That happened because there was consistency in the system. Then the system changed; we had court challenges to the Act and modifications were made to it. We had Part Xs, planning guidelines and exempted developments. Each of those, in turn, was challenged in court at various intervals. We no longer have the same degree of consistency as existed 25 years ago. The system has changed dramatically.</P>
    <P>We now have the phenomenon of mischievous objectors, people who object to applications for the hell of it. Such objections may hold up a particular development, such as a hospital or social housing development. By virtue of the fact that an objector recognises the power they are entitled to exercise, they hold up the entire system.</P>
    <P>We also have business objectors, people who object to other business developments which may threaten them. I can never understand why such objections are entertained because they are merely used as a means of ensuring there is no competition in the objectors' particular marketplace. People want to ensure that their businesses will not be put at risk by competition. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Particular objectors will maintain appeals to An Bord Pleanála until such time as they are compensated. Such mischievous objection is merely designed for the objector's gain. I am not criticising An Bord Pleanála or local authorities; I am merely outlining the facts.</P>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of particular industries, of crucial importance to investment in an area, which have been objected to by people seeking compensation, although the development had no bearing whatsoever on their lifestyle or quality of life, but until such objectors receive compensation, they will sustain their objections. If the business or investment goes elsewhere, those people walk away scot-free. They are not accountable to anyone. People are being paid off in some circumstances and applications are being appealed. That is not what was envisaged by the planning legislation and it is not the purpose for which An Bord Pleanála was set up.</P>
    <P>Several references were made to situations in which an inspector or technical officer of a local authority or the board makes a report. I accept the executive authority of such people but I find it difficult to understand that, where there is a pattern of recommendations in favour or against a particular development and the logical con<Col N="36" /> clusion is that a decision would be in accordance with those recommendations, that is not always the case. Some decisions made by the board turn the whole system on its head. That is extraordinary and must be changed.</P>
    <P>In order to meet today's requirements, the board needs to be totally reconstituted. The system should be changed dramatically as it is currently creaking and breaking down under the volume of objections, counter-objections, correspondence and queries. Unless the system is changed to meet the requirements of the new millennium, we will find ourselves in the same position in two or three years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing his time. It is regrettable that this motion merely deals with the numbers on An Bord Pleanála when vital planning issues and the procedures governing planning need to be discussed.</P>
      <P>I want to hammer the growing lobby to outlaw third party objections. Not all third party objections are mischievous, although some may be totally frivolous or unjustified. People who are intensely affected by developments must not lose their democratic right to object to developments. There is an agenda among powerful people in the building industry and other sectors to do away with third party objections which is particularly directed at community organisations. Such organisations may be intensely affected by developments and have every right to object to those which would be detrimental to the community. Any move to erode the right to object should be strongly rejected.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that An Bord Pleanála should not interfere with the development plan. However, in the case of Fingal in Dublin, a plan which resulted in unjustified rezoning in some cases was lashed through by a Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael coalition without proper consideration. What route of appeal do communities or members of the public, who want to see proper planning, have in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion which recognises that as a result of increased development in recent years, An Bord Pleanála is under-resourced to effectively assess and adjudicate on cases coming before it in a fair, impartial and speedy manner. The delays experienced in recent years are wholly unacceptable. We are now doing something to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the broader issue of planning. We now have a situation in which there is no accountability in the planning process due to a lack of input from elected representatives. Once a county development plan is passed, it is up to individual planners, county managers, inspectors and An Bord Pleanála to adjudicate on planning matters. When we talk about planning, we are talking about people's lives and communities. I am concerned that we do not have a consistent system in place throughout the country <Col N="37" /> which allows communities to develop, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We are trying to encourage people to settle in rural Ireland and halt depopulation along the western seaboard and other isolated parts of the country, yet, it is almost impossible for people who wish to move to those areas to acquire planning permission. We must consider this issue seriously. The opposite case applies on the eastern seaboard. The island is almost tipping into the Irish Sea because of the numbers moving into Dublin and larger urban areas, not purely to avail of the services which exist there but because they cannot obtain planning permission in the areas in which they would like to live.With modern telecommunications systems, including the Internet, there is no reason many thousands currently working in Dublin and other large urban areas could not work from isolated rural areas if planning permission could be secured. Conditions in large urban areas are not conducive to rearing a family.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of vision in the preparation of county development plans. The blame for this rests not only with the planners and management but with county councillors. As most of the land zoned for development has been developed, county councils have been asked to revise their county development plans. This should have been foreseen, given that everybody has been talking about escalating house prices for the past four or five years. We are now playing catch-up. The increase in the price of development land has been passed on to the purchaser. This is placing a heavy burden on families on average income.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to indicate that the planning system is not proactive. The housing crisis will never be resolved if it is left to the unimaginative people who draft county development plans. Guidelines should be issued to planning officials to ensure a certain percentage of land is rezoned each year for residential development. This will enable us to plan ahead taking demographic changes into account. This should be seriously considered if we do not want to place a millstone around the necks of young people of house buying age who are paying inflated prices.</P>
    <P>It appears that no one can change the system. If politicians try to be proactive, they are accused of interfering with the planning process and the rezoning of land for development. There are, however, tens of thousands on waiting lists while the cost of private housing has gone through the roof. This has a knock-on effect in increased social problems.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been introduced to ensure crèches are run in a proper manner in a healthy environment for children. Because of this it is proving difficult to secure planning permission. Most applications have been turned down. This is creating a further problem. Those who want to place their children in child care facilities and take up employment to meet exorbitant house prices cannot do so because of the inability of the planning system to look ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> The legislation has to be looked at again. Parking is cited as a problem in most areas. Most parents, however, would like to be able to drop their children off at a crèche in their residential area. There is, therefore, a need for consistency. We have to ensure applicants will be able to secure planning permission in residential areas.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of imagination when it comes to architecture. Only buildings which date from the 1800s stand out. While I appreciate that finance is a factor, planning officers and departments do not encourage the submission of imaginative projects. Few buildings erected this century could be deemed to be imaginative and will not be described as such by tourists 100 years from now. This is embarrassing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who took part in the debate on the motion. There is general agreement that An Bord Pleanála should be properly resourced at staff and board level to ensure the planning appeals process operates effectively and efficiently. I have explained the steps the Government has taken to provide extra resources at staff level in the past year. The provision in the draft order for an additional ordinary member of the board is a necessary complementary measure to the increase in staff resources.</P>
      <P>There is a noticeable sensitivity among the public to proposed development which is reflected in the increase in the number of third party appeals to An Bord Pleanála. While we all value the openness of the planning system in allowing for third party appeals &ndash; this imposes a certain discipline on developers and planning authorities &ndash; objectors must recognise the unique position granted to them under planning law. They should use their rights constructively at all times. We must guard against vexatious and mischievous appeals which introduce unnecessary delay to the planning system. Section 14 of the 1992 Planning Act allows An Bord Pleanála to dismiss appeals which it considers to be vexatious or without substance or foundation.</P>
      <P>The issues raised about the planning system generally will be addressed in the forthcoming Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which is expected to be published in the next few weeks. It will provide an opportunity to have a more comprehensive debate, for which Deputy Durkan and others called, on all aspects of the planning code, including the provisions relating to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to expect unanimity throughout the country on all planning decisions. What is required is an independent consideration of the planning authority's decisions. We must be satisfied that the board applies the principles of administrative justice in arriving at its decisions. We must accept that different people will arrive at different decisions based on the same facts. The courts have accepted this and have ruled that <Col N="39" /> as long as the board adopts due process and basis its decisions on the facts before it, they will not question the planning merits of the board's decisions.</P>
    <P>The Government is extremely concerned about the housing situation, as evidenced by the preparation and rapid implementation of the two Bacon reports. There is an obligation on us to ensure the planning system does not contribute to increasing house prices by, for example, delays in granting planning permission.</P>
    <P>Legislation and Government measures on their own will not protect our heritage. Respect for the built heritage must come from society itself, and attitudes have changed considerably over recent years. There is now more appreciation for the buildings bestowed on us by our ancestors. However, our heritage can still come under threat and, regrettably, there has been recent experience of this. It would be indefensible if anyone could benefit from illegal action in demolishing a listed building. The key to this process lies in enforcement. The greatest deterrent is the knowledge that the full force of the law will be brought against such transgressors. The planning code also provides for the reinstatement of an illegally demolished building. The existing powers are strong and it is intended to further clarify and strengthen the enforcement powers under the Planning Acts in the planning and development Bill to be published in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The powers of legislation are not sufficient in themselves &ndash; they must be used. We need a stronger enforcement culture. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, indicated that he intends to hold discussions with local authorities, the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions to see how the powers can be used most effectively. The issue of enforcement will be returned to when the House debates the planning and development Bill.</P>
    <P>The shortage of professional planners was raised by a number of Deputies. In my earlier contribution, I stated that this problem has been resolved and the board is about to appoint additional professional planners.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hanafin, Callely and Kelleher raised the issue of child care. This matter is being considered in the review of submissions on the residential density guidelines and it will be addressed in that context, at least in so far as the provision of crèches in higher density developments are concerned. Other matters regarding crèches and planning permission may be considered in the context of the planning and development Bill. Deputy McGuinness referred to a case in Kilkenny, but a Minister cannot comment on individual cases.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this worthwhile debate. I have not been able to respond to all the comments, but the views of Deputies will be taken into consideration before <Col N="40" /> the publication of the planning and development Bill.</P>

    <Title>Treaty of Amsterdam: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measures:</P>
      <P>&ndash; a proposal for a Council Directive on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (COM (1999) 219 final), and</P>
      <P>&ndash; a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children (COM (1999) 220 final),</P>
      <P>copies of which proposed measures were laid before Dáil Éireann on 15th June, 1999.</P>
      <P>The need for this motion arises because of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution which, following its adoption in a referendum, enabled Ireland to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty and allowed the State to exercise certain options contained in that treaty, including the option in the fourth protocol. Under the terms of the constitutional amendment, such exercise is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into operation on 1 May 1999, has added to the EC Treaty a new Title IV which deals with visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons including judicial co-operation in civil matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty basically establishes the positions of Ireland and the United Kingdom on the issues arising under Title IV of the treaty. Its effect is to exempt both countries from all the provisions of Title IV but to permit either or both countries to opt in to particular measures under specified terms and conditions set out in the protocol. Under Article 3 of that protocol, the State has three months from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council to notify our wish to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure. We may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted. For a transitional period of five years, the overwhelming majority of decisions on measures tabled must be on the basis of unanimity but, under the terms of the protocol, if, after a reasonable period of time, <Col N="41" /> the proposed measure cannot be adopted with the United Kingdom or Ireland taking part, other member states may go ahead with the decision in Council without their participation.</P>
    <P>The conference which adopted the Amsterdam Treaty amendments took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the EC Treaty to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area arrangements with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Under Article 65 of the Amsterdam Treaty, judicial co-operation in civil matters includes measures aimed at improving and simplifying the system for cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents, measures aimed at promoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in EU member states concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction, and initiatives aimed generally at eliminating obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings. In consequence, such measures, which until now were dealt with under the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, which was largely intergovernmental in nature, are now dealt with under the first pillar. In effect, this means the process of &ldquo;communitarising&rdquo; these matters has begun and one element in this process is that member states and the Community will share the right of initiative in this area for a transitional period of five years.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the presentation of these two measures by the European Commission to Council, which took place formally on 26 May 1999, is that if the State wishes to opt into discussions on these instruments from the beginning, we have until the end of August to inform the President of the Council of our intentions. Failure to opt in at this time would not prevent us from participating in relevant meetings of the Council working parties which will discuss these proposals. However, we would not be able to opt in until such time as the negotiations have been concluded and the measures adopted, and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited.</P>
    <P>Apart from some amendments to take account of the fact that both Ireland and the United Kingdom have not yet indicated their intention to opt into discussions on these instruments, both texts, which are the subject of the motion before the House, essentially involve the transposition of the substance of two conventions already agreed by EU member states under the third pillar of the Treaty of Maastricht. In transposing the texts into Council legal instruments, the Commission wishes to ensure they enter into force for all EU states on a date earlier than would otherwise be the case if national ratification procedures were involved.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the Service of Documents was signed by the State when it was opened for signature by EU states at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 26 May 1997. The aim of the proposed directive presented by the Commission, <Col N="42" /> like the earlier convention, is to improve and speed up the arrangements for the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents within the European Union. It is concerned with civil and commercial cases where an action is being taken in one member state against a party in another member state.</P>
    <P>The directive provides for the rapid transmission of documents, including the use of modern systems of communication, to minimise delay. As a general principle, the directive is geared towards developing decentralised systems for the service of documents within the EU. It also contains requirements relating to translations of documentation, including a provision allowing a recipient to refuse to accept a document if it is not in a language that he or she understands.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements for service of documents are contained in the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters, 1965. The Hague Convention provides for the establishment in each state of a central authority for receiving documents and sending them to the appropriate persons for service. In Ireland the central authority is the Master of the High Court. It is envisaged that, in so far as EU states are concerned, the EU directive will replace the Hague Convention.</P>
    <P>The second EU instrument, namely, the regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for joint children basically mirrors a convention, generally referred to as the Brussels II Convention, which was signed by the State when opened for signature at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 May 1998. The proposal for a regulation on the earlier convention is concerned with judgments in the area of divorce, legal separation and annulment. It is also concerned with parental responsibility issues arising in the context of such judgments which are essentially custody and access matters.</P>
    <P>At the core of the regulation are rules of direct jurisdiction which will determine which member state's court is competent to rule both on status matters and related parental responsibility matters. Habitual residence of one or other of the parties will be the primary governing criterion for jurisdiction. Judgments given in accordance with such jurisdiction will be entitled to recognition and, where appropriate, enforcement in all EU member states. In the case of recognition, no special procedure will be required, but it will be open to an interested party to apply to a court for a decision that the judgment should or should not be recognised. Recognition can be refused only on very limited grounds, such as public policy and failure to observe due process. However, the test of public policy cannot be used to check whether jurisdiction was properly taken by the foreign court. The proposed regulation assumes confidence in the ability of courts to apply the jurisdiction criteria correctly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Many Deputies will be aware, on the basis of a series of Bills which have come before the House over the past decade or so, that the State is already a party to the Brussels I Convention which provides rules of jurisdiction and procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between EU states. That convention has operated well over the years and has contributed significantly to the operation of the law internationally in a complex area. The new Brussels II Convention, now to be converged into a regulation, will mirror much of the Brussels I Convention but will be specific as to matrimonial matters.</P>
    <P>Legislation would have been required before the State could ratify both the service of documents and the Brussels II Convention. The position now is that if any legislation is required, it will only be in respect of the directive as the regulation, when agreed by Council, will have direct effect in national law and will not require any implementing provisions apart from possible amendments to rules of court. Ultimately, this will be a matter for the relevant rules committees of the courts to consider. Now that they have been presented by the Commission, work on both these instruments will be taken forward in a Council working party and the outcome of discussions at working party level will be submitted in due course for agreement by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>These proposals are among a number of EU initiatives likely to be taken in future in the context of the new Amsterdam Treaty arrangements for civil judicial co-operation aimed at both simplifying access to justice by EU citizens and eliminating obstacles in general to the efficient functioning of civil proceedings with a cross-border element in the EU. The proposed regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters in particular will facilitate widespread recognition for matrimonial judgments which are concerned with annulment, separation and divorce and which are given by a court or tribunal in an EU member state. This will introduce an element of legal certainty into this complex area of law. The proposed directive on the service of legal documents will also be of benefit to cross-border litigants due to the anticipated speeding up of service arrangements, resulting in savings both in time and costs for those involved in litigation with an intra-EU dimension.</P>
    <P>The Government is of the view that it is important that Ireland respond positively to the tabling of both these proposals by exercising the right to opt into the discussions at an early stage. This will enable the State to play a full and constructive part in the negotiations in the relevant Council working party, which are due to commence in the coming months. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the House passed a Council of Europe resolution ratifying Ireland's participation in GRECO, the group of states against corruption. Members made the valid point that often there is inadequate advance notice and that we are generally expected to rubber stamp agreements, arrangements or protocols negotiated over our heads. We are in exactly the same situation today.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday we were circulated with a one and a half page briefing note telling us that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 27 and 28 May the Commission &ldquo;are to present two new proposals for legal instruments under Article 65 of the Treaty of Amsterdam&rdquo;. Sketchy as the explanatory memorandum is, it seems clear that the note had been lying in some drawer of a desk in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform since before the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting, yet the spokespersons who were to deal with it on behalf of Opposition parties only received it through their Whips' meetings a fortnight after the Minister and his colleagues had dealt with the matter at European level. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the deadline of the end of August for Ireland's opting into the new arrangement, why were we not notified in advance instead of being told after the event and then being expected to give our imprimatur after a mere one hour debate today. It is not only the right of Parliament to know and debate in advance new arrangements into which Ireland is opting that is being repeatedly flouted, it is the obvious need for a thorough knowledge of what the new arrangements involve, what can be expected from them and to what exactly we are expected to give our imprimatur after a mere one hour's debate.</P>
      <P>Every new directive, regulation or protocol brings with it legal and administrative obligations. Instead of skimming over the surface we should be debating in detail and thoroughly analysing these obligations so that we will be fully conversant with what is involved.</P>
      <P>In this instance we are endorsing two new arrangements for the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters and the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial, divorce, legal separation and annulment matters and matters of parental responsibility. It is obvious that there are implications for a substantial number of people including litigants, applicants and their legal representatives. However, instead of a proper memorandum setting out in clear detail what exactly is involved, all we have been given is an inadequate and stale explanatory note which was issued in advance of the Council of Ministers meeting and the Minister of State's brief oral presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to indicate in his reply how the new arrangements improve existing arrangements for the service of documents abroad in civil and commercial pro<Col N="45" /> ceedings. The Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents was adopted at the 10th session of the Hague Convention on Private and International Law in 1964. Each state had to nominate a central authority to arrange for the service of documents coming from other contracting states. That authority must serve or arrange to have served documents sent to it by the authority or judicial officer competent under the law of the state in which the documents originated. The central authority may require the document to be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of the state addressed.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate if this is a requirement in the new arrangements before the House? Can the official authority require that the document to be served be translated, for example, into Irish, our first language? The Hague Convention is also quite specific in prescribing the method of service of documents. Will the Minister of State indicate what method of service is prescribed in the new arrangements under the Amsterdam Treaty? To an extent, he spelt these out in his contribution. For example, are the existing arrangements for the service of documents connected with the various domestic courts in this jurisdiction acceptable under the new arrangement?</P>
    <P>Under the Hague Convention the person effecting service must provide an affidavit of service verified by notarial certificate. In addition, the Master of the High Court must complete a certificate confirming that the service proved by the affidavit is such as required by Irish law. The Master must then send this to the Department of Foreign Affairs which will transmit it to the requisite court or tribunal.</P>
    <P>What protection will the new arrangements provide to protect defendants who may not have received notice of proceedings against them? Under the existing law in this jurisdiction this protection is afforded by the fact that proceedings cannot be legally instituted unless a document is served on the defendant in accordance with the relevant rules of court. If the defendant fails to appear in response to a summons or other originating document, judgment by default may be given against him on proof that the requisite service of the summons has taken place. Is it possible under the new arrangements to obtain a judgment in such circumstances? What will be the precise situation under the new arrangements if a defendant fails to appear? What is the maximum time allowed to enable a defendant to appeal against such judgments?</P>
    <P>I welcome the synchronisation and strengthening of mutual arrangements in judicial and legal matters in the civil, commercial, matrimonial and parental spheres. The more harmonisation we have in these areas the better and it is in the interest of the consumer that there be a maximum degree of cohesion, consolidation and interaction between member states. It would, however, have been of considerable assistance if the Law <Col N="46" /> Reform Commission had been requested to carry out a report on the implications arising from the new Council directive and the regulations.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Law Reform Commission completed a valuable report on the Hague Convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. The commission considered the operation of Irish law at that time and the rules governing the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents for the various domestic courts. It also made a number of extremely important recommendations on how procedures could be improved. The commission looked at the Irish rules in the context of expectations under the Hague Convention and it made 12 recommendations, the first of which was that Ireland should become party to the convention on the service of documents. It went on to set down the kind of structure and framework that Ireland should put in place in order to adapt to the new situation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the reason that no such study was commissioned on this occasion? Will he also indicate the respects in which the new Amsterdam Treaty arrangements differ from or improve on those of the Hague Convention? The Hague Convention has application to contracting countries outside the sphere of the EU, such as the United States. By virtue of the fact that the new arrangements were made under the Amsterdam Treaty, does that mean that the procedures under the Hague Convention which govern the exchange of judicial and extrajudicial documents will be set aside and that our relationship with the US, which has worked well under the convention, will be ruptured or terminated because the new arrangements cater for members contracting within the EU? Will the Hague Convention which has served this country so well since the 1960s be completely obliterated? Will our relationships with the United States and other countries which are contracted to the Hague Convention continue to obtain?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Higgins, I wish to complain about the late arrival of this matter before the House. I only received the background note pertaining to this matter this morning. However, I do not suggest that the Minister of State's staff are at fault. The note to which I refer is undated and it is unusual that a document of this kind would not display an origination date. From the language used in the note, it is clear that it was written at some point in May which means that it has been in existence for a month or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the issues with which we are dealing are not monumental in their impact on Irish society. Nevertheless, issues which will arise as a result of this new procedure will have a serious impact on how the Garda Síochána, for example, does its business. We are dealing with issues that the Government of which I was a member felt it could not fully enter into because of the existence of the free travel area between Britain and <Col N="47" /> Ireland and because Britain was not part of the Schengen Pillar. We need to tighten up on how we deal with these issues. In that regard, will the Minister of State indicate whether this matter has been referred in advance to the European Affairs committee? That committee has an obligation to examine and to give the House an opinion on European Union instruments. Because of the way European Union material is produced, the committee tends to deal with them after the fact rather than before they become directives or regulations. There is no reference in the Minister of State's speech to that effect and that is a serious gap in regard to how these matters should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with this issue because of a political debate around the Amsterdam Treaty and the wording it was proposed to put into the Constitution, which would have left it to the Government to decide this issue. I was then Leader of Democratic Left and my party objected to that process. The upshot of that was that the Government of the day agreed to amend the wording it proposed to put to the people to the effect that it now reads that the State may exercise the option or discretion under Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.1.5 of the treaty referred to in subsection (5) of this section and the second and fourth protocols set out in the said treaty, but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That was an important overview by this House of matters being agreed between the Government of the day and the European institutions. I draw attention to this because it is important that this House has that overview of these decisions, given that a major complaint from many people outside this House is that the Dáil and Seanad are no longer relevant when it comes to European decision-making.</P>
    <P>While the items with which we are dealing are not monumental in terms of the impact they will have on Irish society, they are important in themselves. They deal with the livelihoods of people who need to have matrimonial difficulties resolved as quickly as possible. The procedure is important because it brings this House back into the centre of decision-making on issues that were not decided by the then Government in the negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty or by the succeeding Government, which is currently in power. As circumstances arise, decisions will be made on foot of the protocol and it is important this House has an opportunity to express an opinion on those matters as they are being decided. It is, therefore, essential that the issues are brought before us in sufficient time to allow us examine them. The mere fact that we have to deal with this issue because of a political debate about the nature of an amendment which was put to the people is an example of how Opposition parties can impact on the change in policy of a Government. The role of Opposition is essential.</P>
    <P>Given the limited time we have been allowed to debate these issues and the short notice we <Col N="48" /> received about them, we do not really have an opportunity to make significant contributions on them. I urge the Minister to bring these issues to Government and to insist, as we do, that adequate time is given to consider them and that the European Affairs committee is given a chance to examine them in advance of them being brought before the House to ensure they are properly considered. The issues have been outlined and explained by the Minister of State. They relate to the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the service of documents. They will have an important impact on the daily lives of many people.</P>
    <P>This issue gives us an opportunity to raise the question of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK and the implications that has for the exercise of our policy on immigration. I had occasion to raise in the House last week the case of a Japanese women who came to Ireland to celebrate Bloomsday with her friends. She did not require a visa, as Japanese citizens do not require visas to visit Ireland, but she was refused admission by the immigration authorities. I did not get a satisfactory reply from the Minister as to why this women was refused admission, nor did I get a satisfactory reply on the way in which I, as a public representative, and my staff were dealt with by the immigration authorities, who refused to take calls from my staff on a number of occasions. While the Department of Foreign Affairs provided us with additional telephone numbers, there was no response from the numbers provided by the Department for the immigration office in Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>It seems, effectively, that our immigration policy is being decided by the UK because the person concerned had been refused permission to live in the UK, for reasons unknown to me. As I understand it, this is an upstanding Japanese citizen. She is not without means and has a good job in Japan. She was refused permission to visit Ireland to enjoy the Bloomsday festival. We cannot continue to allow our decisions on who should be granted permission to come into this State to be dictated by the UK immigration authorities. That matter needs to be seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>We also need to seriously address the manner in which our immigration authorities and the guidelines that govern them operate. There seems to be a gross lack of transparency in that regard. The Japanese woman was not informed of her legal rights. When I arranged for a solicitor to make contact with the immigration authorities, he was told there was nothing he could do as a decision had already been made. We need to address this matter. It impinges, however indirectly, on the procedure we operate here in terms of this House overviewing the manner in which we buy into the agreements made at European level.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important procedure, but it should not be treated in a cavalier manner by the Government. We should be given adequate time <Col N="49" /> to address the issues and to get full information on the background to what is being proposed. The issues should have been teased out in advance by the European Affairs committee. That committee should submit a report on these matters to the House. I thank the Minister for bringing forward this motion and I hope he will bear in mind the serious and constructive criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that it is outrageous that we are rubber-stamping this measure without knowing what it is about. This will have implications in the future. When I was canvassing in the recent European elections an issue which arose at least a hundred times was the way power in Brussels is affecting people's lives in Ireland, particularly in rural areas. Decisions are being taken in Brussels by people who do not understand what is happening on the ground. It is wrong that we are discussing a protocol on which we have not been briefed and which will have major implications for many professional people here.</P>
      <P>People accept and appreciate that the EU has been good to Ireland. I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy De Rossa on his election to the European Parliament. I wish him well and am delighted the people of Dublin chose him. He has great experience, I respect him a great deal and he will do a good job for Dublin and Ireland. I am sure he will express the same view as I have, which is that the EU must be more user friendly to people here. Decisions such as that being taken today cannot be taken without the Government and the people knowing what effect it will have on their lives. That was the big issue which arose during the European elections.</P>
      <P>Recently I dealt with a case of a family who were going on holiday. The person who was to take over the father's job had a stroke the night before they left. He could not go and a passport was needed for another child. The child had to be woken at midnight to have her photograph taken. The mother and child then had to appear in the Department of Foreign Affairs on Saturday morning. As regards the official with whom I dealt and the way he treated me on the telephone, I will take that up in a private capacity. Passports should no longer be needed to travel in the EU &ndash; we are either in the EU or not. Perhaps Deputy De Rossa will raise this issue in the European Parliament. There has been a great deal of criticism of the UK in the past, yet anyone can travel there without a passport. It is time that European citizens should be allowed move freely within member states without a passport. I hope this will be taken up at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is due to announce the new EU Commissioner this week and I wish whoever that is well. It has taken the Taoiseach some time to make that decision &ndash; he must be having difficulty in his ranks or with the Tánaiste. We do not know who the Commissioner will be, it could be the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy <Col N="50" /> Cowen or the former Deputy, Michael McDowell. However, I take this opportunity as a Mayo man to congratulate Pádraig Flynn on the job he did as EU Commissioner. The House will rise next week and we should have a new Commissioner by then. Mr. Flynn was an excellent EU Commissioner and did Mayo people proud. I wish him well in his retirement. I know he has other difficulties but they will be dealt with in another forum. I am sure I will see plenty of him at the next general election as he will have more time to canvass for his daughter, Deputy Cooper-Flynn. He was successful in local elections, by-elections and European elections. I hope he has a happy retirement. He did a good job in public life. We can be critical of public representatives and this is an opportunity to be positive.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with rubber-stamping this measure. The Department should be more informative. We should know exactly what decisions are being taken and their implications for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate on this motion. It is important we exercise this option provided by the protocol within the three month period which is stipulated so the State can play a full and constructive part in the development and finalisation of the texts of both instruments before they are presented to the Council for approval.</P>
      <P>There is some misunderstanding about what exactly we are doing. Deputies Jim Higgins and De Rossa are confused about the way in which these motions have come before the House. They are being most unfair as regards this misunderstanding. The Commission formally presented the texts to the Council on 26 May and only then was it possible to initiate the presentation of the motions to the House. This was done at the first possible opportunity. The proposal before the House relates to exercising the right to opt into the proposals. The House is not being asked to approve the substance of the instruments, which has yet to be agreed by the relevant working party. It is possible that the content of the service directives may change.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins raised a number of interesting issues including language and the protection of dependants' rights. All I can say at this preliminary stage is that these matters will be teased out in the course of negotiations. The Deputy inquired about the relationship between the Hague Convention and this directive. The Hague Convention will continue to operate in countries which are not members of the EU. In broad terms, the directive does not differ radically from the Hague Convention. Two main points of difference concern greater decentralisation which it is hoped will lead to greater efficiency, and provisions allowing for modern means of communication such as e-mail, fax etc. to be used in the service of the documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Deputy De Rossa spoke about the important exercise in democracy which the procedure before the House represents. This is the first time this procedure has been used and there may well be some teething problems. However, as we all become familiar with the procedures I am sure many of those problems will be ironed out. I noted the Deputy's comments on the common travel area, with particular emphasis on immigration. It is true that the Amsterdam Treaty contains a large number of significant provisions in relation to co-operation on justice and home affairs. In the case of Title IV, the new treaty provisions not only deal with the issue before the House today, namely judicial co-operation in civil matters, but also deal with visas, asylum, emigration and other policies relating to the free movement of persons. However, these are complicated areas which do not come within the scope of today's motion. Therefore, I do not intend to get involved in the wider issues.</P>
    <P>This is an important motion which was taken at the earliest opportunity. There is much to play for, which will be the subject of negotiations and discussions at the Council. We can be absolutely confident of the ability of our officials to ensure our interests are looked after in that respect. This motion was brought before the House at the earliest opportunity and every effort was made, because of the short timescale, to facilitate Opposition Deputies. As I said, if it had been possible to give a longer period, there would have been no difficulty in so doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement on 20 April last in connection with the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of DPP <i>v</i>. Philip Sheedy, when informing the House of the resignations of Hugh O'Flaherty, Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan <Col N="52" /> from their respective offices, I outlined the severance terms which the Government was prepared to agree. The provisions contained in the Bill, and which are for consideration by the House, spell out those terms in more detail.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been produced in difficult circumstances. I am sure Deputies would agree that the question of the severance terms must be addressed sooner rather than later and on a basis that carefully takes account of the legal and other issues surrounding the proposed payments. The Bill is very short, amounting to no more than four sections. It is, nonetheless, a technical Bill framed against the background of the law on pensions applicable to members of the Judiciary and court officers, as well as pension provisions in relation to the spouses and children of such members.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the circumstances which have caused the Bill to be introduced are controversial and exceptional in nature. However, I hope the House will recognise the purpose that the Bill fulfils and will accept the provisions it contains to meet the matters at issue.</P>
    <P>The assumption is made, for the purpose of calculating all the actual pension sums I will be mentioning, that present salary levels for judges and county registrars would remain static. Furthermore, had all three people remained in office until their statutory retirement dates, they would have all been entitled to the maximum amount of pension allowable under the scheme. Based on their current salaries alone, the figures would have amounted to, in the case of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, a pension of £47,476 and a lump sum of £142,428; for Mr. Cyril Kelly, a pension of £43,719 and a lump sum of £131,156; and, in the case of Mr. Michael Quinlan, a pension of £29,569 and a lump sum of £88,706. There would have been an entitlement in respect of all three men, in the event of their dying in service, to death gratuities and their surviving spouses and children would have been entitled to pensions.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of completeness, and before dealing with the substance of the legislation, I would like to mention briefly what the entitlements of the three persons as regards pension would be, were it not for this Bill. Those entitlements reflect their accumulated service up to the date of their resignations.</P>
    <P>Hugh O'Flaherty was appointed to the Supreme Court on 26 March 1990 and would, on the basis of his service up to the date of his resignation, have been entitled to a pension of £26,300 and a lump sum of £79,000 on 26 March 2005. Cyril Kelly was appointed to the Circuit Court on 4 June 1992 and would have been entitled, on the basis of his service up to the date of his resignation, to a pension of £17,000 and a lump sum of £51,200 on 7 June 2013; Michael Quinlan was appointed as Dublin County Registrar on 24 June 1991 and would have been entitled, on the basis of his service up to the date of his resignation, to <Col N="53" /> a pension of £11,500 and a lump sum of £34,700 on 10 January 2019.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will already be aware from previous statements that the Government considered the question of severance payments in all three cases very carefully. It took a number of matters into account, including the actual pension entitlements of the parties concerned. It also recognised that all three men had tendered their resignations &ndash; which was the right and honourable course for them to take &ndash; and that, in the case of the two judges, this avoided the need for a procedure in this House which would have been without precedent, namely, impeachment.</P>
    <P>There was no suggestion that any of the three was motivated by any prospect of achieving personal gain or reward. It is also the case that the individuals involved have undoubtedly suffered a substantial loss of earnings as a result of their resignations.</P>
    <P>The loss in annual earnings &ndash; assuming that the pensions proposed in the Bill are agreed &ndash; are, in the case of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty £54,952; Mr. Cyril Kelly, £57,437 and Mr. Michael Quinlan, £44,137. I will come to the pensions proposed in the Bill later and provide the House with information concerning the actuarial value to the three individuals concerned of those proposals, which has been requested by Deputies in earlier discussions on this subject. First, let me deal with the suggestion that conditions should be attached to the payment of pensions in the case of Hugh O'Flaherty and Cyril Kelly.</P>
    <P>I have, in previous statements, indicated that the advice available to me is that it would be unconstitutional to include in legislation providing for pensions or payments to judges or former judges any provision that payment would be dependent on the individual judges complying with any requirement that they provide some explanation or self-justification, or make themselves available to give evidence before an Oireachtas committee. It is worth reiterating that advice now. I suggest that to linger on the matter of such conditions is a fruitless exercise and would serve only to cloud the debate on the detail of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the content of the Bill, and to summarise its main effect, the severance terms for which it provides are directed towards the payment of annual pensions. There is no provision for the payment of lump sums. The pensions will be adjusted in the normal way in line with any salary increases for Supreme and High Court judges and equivalent county registrars which, in this case, would be the county registrar for Dublin. The Bill also provides for the payment of spouses' and children's benefits in accordance with current arrangements. The core of the Bill is contained in section 1 and I propose to deal with the content of that section in some detail.</P>
    <P>The legislation governing the payment of pensions, including gratuities, to members of the Judiciary and to court officers is contained in a number of different statutes, notably, the Courts <Col N="54" /> (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1991 and, most recently, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>One aim of this Bill is to ensure that, in relation to the individuals coming within its scope, the payment of pensions in respect of them will be governed solely by its provisions. This effect is achieved by subsection (1) and, for the purposes of absolute clarity, subsection (4) disapplies any gratuity, at present amounting to three times the yearly amount of pension which, in the normal course, would arise in relation to a pension granted under the relevant Acts.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out the pensions which are to be payable over a full year to each of the persons specified in the Bill for the duration of their lifetime, namely, £40,000 in the case of Hugh O'Flaherty, £30,000 in the case of Cyril Kelly and £15,000 in the case of Michael Quinlan. As I have already indicated, these amounts will be adjusted in line with adjustments in the salaries of ordinary judges of the Supreme Court, ordinary judges of the High Court and equivalent county registrars, as the case may be. This link between pension increases and salary increases is, of course, a standard one, as is the provision that any pension adjustment shall take effect from the date of the relevant salary increase. These matters are provided for in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>The matters covered by subsections (5) and (6) pertain to the payment of spouses' and children's pensions. Under existing schemes, a spouse's pension, when awarded, is one-half of the deceased's pension, while the amount of a child's pension is normally one-third of the amount of a spouse's pension. This legislation does not affect this broad entitlement. However, it is made clear that it is the figures set out in subsection (2), as may from time to time be adjusted, which will provide the basis for calculating any pension entitlement that may exist.</P>
    <P>Section 2 applies a standard provision relating to the abatement of pension. It would be triggered in the event of any of the persons to whom this Bill applies being subsequently employed in a position which is paid out of the Central Fund or the Exchequer. There is no proposal to this effect but it is considered an appropriate and desirable step to take and it is standard practice in respect of judges and court officers pensions legislation.</P>
    <P>The remaining two sections are very short and of a standard nature. They require little by way of additional explanation. Section 3 is the usual payments and expenses provision, while section 4 deals with matters such as the Short Title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is rooted in past events and I am very conscious that those events have an echo which resonates in the present and which has implications for the future. Looking to that <Col N="55" /> future, it is vitally important that we now look forward and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that confidence in our judicial system is fully restored. However, I wish to refer briefly to the background to this legislation so as to place it in full context. Before I do so, I am sure the House is as one in acknowledging that these events will have caused added distress to the Ryan family who lost a wife and mother so tragically in 1996 and whose grief has been intruded upon by subsequent unfortunate happenings.</P>
    <P>The House will know that on the evening of 10 February 1999 the Attorney General contacted me at a meeting in Berlin regarding concerns that had been raised with him relating to the case of the DPP <i>v. </i>Philip Sheedy in the Dublin Circuit Court in November 1998. I decided that an immediate inquiry should be established. The Attorney General at my request then contacted the Chief Justice who initiated an inquiry. I also instructed the Secretary General of my Department that the Garda authorities should be advised of the matter and that the Department should immediately conduct its own inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice provided the report of his inquiries to the Attorney General on 14 April and he furnished it to me. On the basis of facts either admitted or established at that stage, the Chief Justice concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that the intervention of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in the relisting of the Sheedy case was &ldquo;damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo; and that Judge Kelly, then a judge of the Circuit Court, in entering on a review of Philip Sheedy's sentence, &ldquo;failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge&rdquo;, and that Judge Kelly's handling of the matter &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report of my Department concluded that the actions of all officials bar one were carried out bona fide, in the course of what they took to be their proper duties. In relation to the Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, it concluded that &ldquo;his performance . in connection with the official level inquiry, fell well short of the standards that can be reasonably expected of a person holding the position of county registrar. In the circumstances it obstructed and misled the Department's investigation and . amounted to misbehaviour on his part&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 16 April 1999 the Government considered the contents of the Hamilton report. The departmental report was not finalised at that stage as account had to be taken of the Chief Justice's report and replies due from the County Registrar to a series of questions put to him on 9 April about his role in the matter. The Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, to approve the delivery of letters to both judges stating that, in the light of the Hamilton report, it would consider at its meeting scheduled for 20 April proposals for their removal from office under the provisions of Article 35.4.1º of the Constitution. Mr. Michael Quinlan was provided with copies of the departmental report on a confidential basis on the <Col N="56" /> evening of 19 April 1999. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty resigned on 17 April 1999. Mr. Justice Kelly and Mr. Quinlan resigned on 20 April 1999.</P>
    <P>On 20 April 1999 the matter was again considered by the Government and later that day I made a statement to this House in connection with the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of the DPP <i>v. </i>Philip Sheedy. I informed the House of the resignation of the two judges and the County Registrar and outlined the severance terms to which the Government was and is prepared to agree and which would be brought before the House in due course for approval, namely, the provisions contained in the Bill being considered here today. That, briefly, is the sequence of events which led to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid any possible confusion or misinterpretation now or later, I wish to inform the House of certain payments made recently to the former County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan. In addition to his normal duties, Mr. Quinlan, having been nominated by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, performed the duties of Dublin City Sheriff on a temporary basis between 3 January 1995 and 1 August 1995 while a vacancy existed in that office following the retirement of the previous incumbent. At the time, it was decided by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, that Mr. Quinlan would perform these duties and be remunerated on the same basis as the Cork County Registrar in similar circumstances in 1991 and 1995. This involved an<i> ex-gratia </i>payment equivalent to the amount the sheriff would have received following the collection of the fees and so on and the disbursement of all the moneys due, including payment to the staff in the office of the sheriff. The submission made to the Minister went into all these matters in detail.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the appointment of the County Registrar to the office of sheriff is effected by ministerial order and such appointment is also terminated by ministerial order. This procedure was followed by the then Minister, Deputy Owen, in this instance.</P>
    <P>Following the permanent appointment by the rainbow coalition Government to the office of sheriff in August 1995, the acting sheriff's accounts were fully audited. This process took some months and a reconciliation was required to be made which showed an amount of £140,014.89 remaining in the acting sheriff's account from collection of sheriff's fees after payment of staff and other necessary disbursements. Department of Finance sanction was sought for payment of this amount to Mr. Quinlan which was due to him in line with the conditions of his appointment to sheriff duties over the relevant period. A number of detailed queries were then raised by the Department of Finance which took some time to resolve and approval to pay was only received in my Department on 18 February 1999. Further correspondence then took place between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and <Col N="57" /> Family Affairs which were fully informed of all the details of this payment which was finally made on 18 May 1999. I stress that the sum paid to Mr. Quinlan in respect of his duties as sheriff is in respect of an entitlement which arose in 1995, some years prior to recent events, and has no connection whatsoever with those events. I am mentioning it now not because there is a connection but in order to avoid any suggestion that I failed to advise the House of the position. I repeat that we advised the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs of this payment.</P>
    <P>There are 16 sheriffs in Ireland, appointed by the Government, one in each of Dublin city and county and Cork city and county and 12 other Revenue sheriffs. The Dublin and Cork sheriffs are responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for the enforcement of court orders and civil proceedings and the enforcement of Revenue certificates issued under the income tax legislation. Sheriff duties in respect of the enforcement of court orders in civil proceedings, outside Dublin and Cork, are performed by the County Registrar. The Revenue sheriffs are responsible for the enforcement of Revenue certificates. The office of sheriff is part time and non-pensionable and a sheriff can engage in private practice. Up to November 1998 the sheriffs' income was derived from sheriffs' fees and poundage, retainer &ndash; £500 for Dublin and £400 for others &ndash; and interest on moneys prior to transfer to the creditor both in relation to Revenue cases and enforcement on foot of court orders.</P>
    <P>The method of remuneration of sheriffs was changed by me in 1998. Sheriffs no longer retain interest on moneys prior to transfer to the creditor. All funds now collected by sheriffs are immediately credited to the Exchequer. I signed an order drawn up by my Department in September 1988 changing the levels of fees and poundage due to sheriffs. Under the new system the remuneration of sheriffs comprises an annual retainer of £14,000 per annum in addition to sheriffs' fees and poundage. A joint standing committee is currently considering, <i>inter alia</i>, the remuneration of sheriffs. Its membership includes a representative of my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the sheriffs.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies opposite have queried the case for paying any pension to the individuals with whom this legislation deals, let alone pensions in the amount now proposed. Earlier I referred briefly to the considerations which persuaded the Government to propose these payments. I should now add that as well as taking account of those considerations, the Government also had regard to the family and other commitments of those concerned.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to pretend that the sums proposed represent the outcome of a set of precise actuarial calculations. Prior to Cyril Kelly's resignation there were discussions concerning pension entitlement between his counsel and counsel for the State. Those discussions were <Col N="58" /> wholly inconclusive and had broken off prior to his resignation. Having regard to the various considerations I mentioned earlier, the Government decided that a pension of £30,000 per annum should be proposed in his case. No corresponding discussions were pursued by Hugh O'Flaherty and Michael Quinlan, prior to their resignations, but the Government was satisfied that Messrs. O'Flaherty and Quinlan should not be treated less favourably, in relative terms, than Mr. Kelly. The pensions proposed in their cases, as I have already stated, are £40,000 and £15,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>As already stated, I have been asked to provide an estimate of the actuarial value of the pension benefits now being proposed in each case &ndash; in other words, an estimate of the capital sum which an individual would be required to pay for such benefits, taking account of interest and other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>As I have provided various figures earlier in my statement, it would be desirable at this point, for the sake of clarity and to ensure that like is being compared with like, not only to provide the actuarial value in each case of what is proposed in the Bill but also the actuarial value of the benefits which each man would have enjoyed had no resignations taken place. The figures which have been provided by the Department of Finance are as follows: in the case of Hugh O'Flaherty, the benefit now proposed has an actuarial value of £699,000 and the benefits lost have a value of £1,336,183; the corresponding figures in the case of Cyril Kelly are £665,000 as against £1,703,990; and in the case of Michael Quinlan the benefit is £366,000 as against £1,281,807 lost.</P>
    <P>Focusing now on the future, my Department's report on the events surrounding the relisting of the Sheedy case contained a series of far-reaching recommendations designed to prevent any recurrence of the events which I have just outlined. There are two recommendations which I would like to highlight at this juncture. One relates to the early formal transfer of responsibility for the administration of the Courts Service to the new courts board while the other relates to judicial conduct, ethics and accountability.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Courts Service Act, 1998, provides for the establishment of an independent Courts Service to manage the courts. The provision of support services for the judges will be one of the main functions of the service which will be governed by a courts service board. The board will be chaired by the Chief Justice and consist of the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts, an elected member of the Judiciary of each of the courts, a judge nominated by the Chief Justice for his or her experience in a specific area, the chief executive, a staff representative and six other members, including a practising barrister nominated by the Bar Council and a practising solicitor nominated by the Law Society. I should mention here that board membership also draws on expertise and experience beyond the legal field. This is achieved by ensur<Col N="59" /> ing that board representation encompasses consumers of the services provided by the courts, those with knowledge and experience in commerce, finance or administration, a representative of ICTU and an officer of my Department. The functions of the board are to consider and determine policy in relation to the service and to oversee the implementation of that policy by the chief executive.</P>
    <P>Much work has already been undertaken to establish the Courts Service. The transitional board, chaired by the Chief Justice and established under the 1998 Act is, in conjunction with my Department, actively involved in making the necessary arrangements for the establishment of the Courts Service. I expect that this task will be completed later this year. A very significant step towards the formal establishment of the Courts Service was taken earlier this month when 24 members of the staff of the courts division of my Department moved to new offices in Conyngham Road, which will be the future location of a number of courts service functions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new structures which are now being put in place will allow the Courts Service to meet the demands placed on it in the new millennium and that the new body will be enabled to focus on and strategically direct resources to provide an efficient, effective and accountable service to judges, practitioners, court staff and, most importantly, of course, the users of the system. With a view to the strengthening of procedures in the courts, my Department, in 1997, commissioned a major IT scoping study on the courts which was set firmly in the context of the organisational changes which are now under way. A consortium is now actively developing a range of systems including case tracking, financial management and accounts systems, production of statistics, management information and document management systems for the courts. This IT development should ensure that the structures, practice and procedures applied by the Courts Service are enhanced.</P>
    <P>In relation to judicial conduct and ethics, the sixth report of the working group on a courts commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham, dealt, among other matters, with this topic. In this context, the group was particularly concerned with the procedures which are adopted in other countries relating to the handling of judicial conduct that might be considered unsuitable for a member of the Judiciary. It recommended the establishment of a judicial committee and, on publication of that report in April, such a committee was duly established by the Chief Justice. The committee will consider the report and it will consider further the position in other jurisdictions including Canada, New South Wales, the United States of America and New Zealand. It will consult with myself as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Bar Council, the Law Society, academics and others and it will also receive submissions from interested bodies. Fur<Col N="60" /> thermore, it will advise on and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct and establish a system for the handling of complaints relating to such conduct. It will do other preparatory work, including that relating to judicial standards and ethics, and will consider matters which have arisen since the sixth report was finalised in November 1998. I have personally assured the Chief Justice that he will have every support from my Department and this Government in carrying out the work of this judicial ethics committee.</P>
    <P>It would be a common feeling among Deputies that the persons with whom this legislation deals have paid a heavy price in terms of financial loss and in terms of the anxiety and strain which they have borne over the past few months. It must also be acknowledged that, apart from the events resulting in this legislation, each of the three men made valuable contributions to the administration of justice. Hugh O'Flaherty was one of the most eminent members of the Bench and his compassion, wisdom and insight were applied in the many important cases with which he was involved. Cyril Kelly had the particular capacity to balance his efficiency in approach with his legal expertise both in his dealing in the courtroom and as chairman of the interdepartmental committee on the video-recording of evidence. Michael Quinlan dealt resolutely with the changing demands of the Dublin Circuit Court and the management of the volume of cases in that area. It would be grossly unfair to dismiss years of sterling service &ndash; which is what a decision to refuse pensions would entail &ndash; because of errors of judgment in the handling of one case.</P>
    <P>In addressing the results of the inquiries into the handling of the Sheedy case, the three men tendered their resignations with dignity and, as I have said previously, this was the right and honourable course for them to take and, in the case of the two judges, it avoided the need for a procedure in this House which would have been without precedent &ndash; that of impeachment.</P>
    <P>It is an undeniable reality that, in order to attract persons of high calibre to the Judiciary, in particular, but also to high office within the courts system, we are relying often on the willingness of individuals to embark upon a career path which in purely financial terms will be less rewarding for them than if they had chosen to advance their careers in private practice. This willingness to serve the public is to be commended, particularly where there is no economic advantage to be gained, and, indeed, some disadvantage. It reflects the best tradition of public service, a tradition which can sometimes be undervalued, even overlooked. At the same time, to be a judge is one of the most prestigious careers which one can have and it carries with it a heavy burden in terms of personal responsibility and public expectation. There is a status which goes with judicial office and, of course, a corresponding loss of status when, as in the present case, that office is vacated <Col N="61" /> in the kind of circumstances which arose here. There is the additional factor that the loss of status is compounded by the fact that it takes place under a very public spotlight. It has impacted very heavily, and in a very public way, on the personal lives of all concerned and it would be wrong, in debating the Bill now before the House, to forget this.</P>
    <P>In weighing up all the relevant issues of this very difficult situation, the Government concluded that the pensions mentioned should be payable in each case but that no gratuities should be paid. This legislation gives effect to that decision.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as the two former judges referred to in the Bill give a clear undertaking that they are prepared to make themselves available to answer questions before whatever course of enquiry is recommended by Dáil Éireann in order to establish the full truth of the involvement of both individuals in the Sheedy affair.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Government to award payment of pensions of £40,000 in the case of former Supreme Court Judge Hugh O'Flaherty and £30,000 in the case of former High Court Judge Cyril Kelly at this time is wrong and irresponsible. I wish to make it clear that Fine Gael does not have a fundamental problem with the payment of pensions once the Sheedy affair has been fully investigated and concluded. Both judges had careers of different lengths in the different courts over which they presided and they are entitled to pensions based on their years of service, but only when all aspects of their involvement in the wrongful early release of Philip Sheedy have been thoroughly investigated.</P>
      <P>The Sheedy affair has not been fully investigated. Certain aspects remain unexplored and many questions remain to be answered. Crucial to the exploration of the remaining areas and the answering of these questions is the role of the two former judges. It is not a case on our part of unwarranted curiosity. It is a case of the public interest and it is in that interest that an investigation of the remaining aspects of the Sheedy case must be reopened.</P>
      <P>The fact that both the Supreme Court Judge and the High Court Judge resigned does not mean that the shutters should come down and that this is the end of the affair. We must put this case into perspective. The report of the Chief Justice into the circumstances surrounding the release from prison of Phillip Sheedy, dated 14 April last, was clear, unequivocal and decisive. I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I therefore conclude that this case might not have been re-listed in the way it was but for the <Col N="62" /> intervention of Mr Justice O'Flaherty. I also conclude that Mr Justice O'Flaherty's intervention was inappropriate and unwise, that it left his motives and action open to mis-interpretation and that it was therefore damaging to the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in the light of the Chief Justice's summary of Mr O'Flaherty's performance and involvement, his position as a Supreme Court judge was untenable and he was left with no option but to resign from the Bench. Nevertheless, Mr. O'Flaherty went on national television on Friday, 16 April and doggedly proclaimed he had done nothing wrong, that he would fight his case and that he had no intention of resigning. Less than 24 hours later, Mr. O'Flaherty had resigned his position.</P>
    <P>What, we may ask, occurred in the meantime to bring about such a dramatic change of heart? While Mr. O'Flaherty's U-turn led to his resignation from office, he stoutly proclaimed, and presumably still stoutly proclaims, that he had done nothing wrong. I publicly welcomed Mr. O'Flaherty's resignation at the time. It was the right thing to do. On a human level, one had to feel extremely sorry for him. The Government had clearly indicated in its correspondence with him that, unless he resigned, it would have had no option but to invoke Article 35 of the Constitution. As the Minister said, I do not believe there is a person in the Oireachtas who would have relished the unsavoury prospect of impeachment proceedings.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Mr. O'Flaherty has steadfastly maintained that he had done nothing wrong. This failure to appreciate the Chief Justice's serious assessment of his actions and interventions in the Philip Sheedy case seriously calls into question his judgment. There is also the credibility of his contention that his involvement in the case arose from a chance meeting with the son of a neighbour who happened to be a friend of the Sheedy family.</P>
    <P>It was with a view to exploring his level of involvement that the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Affairs welcomed the letter from Mr. Justice O'Flaherty to the committee, dated 16 April 1999, in which he stated that he was &ldquo;now concerned to explain my position especially in the light of the many aspects of the case new to me which the Chief Justice's Report has elicited .. in an attempt to dispel as far as possible the doubt and suspicion which has accumulated around the Sheedy case in the interest of the community, justice and my own interest.&rdquo;  Later in the letter, Mr. O'Flaherty stated that to that end, and in view of the widespread concern and many questions surrounding the case, he requested the opportunity &ldquo;to make a statement to the Committee and answer any and all questions that its members may raise.&rdquo; He goes on finally to emphasise that his attendance would be &ldquo;entirely voluntary and at my own request&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> The committee agreed to accede to Mr. O'Flaherty's request. It decided that the same opportunity should be afforded to Mr. Cyril Kelly and to Mr. Michael Quinlan, the Dublin County Registrar. Letters were accordingly sent to each of them asking them if they wished to meet the committee on that basis.</P>
    <P>In the wake of Mr. O'Flaherty's letter of 16 April in which, uninvited, he volunteered to come before the committee and to tell all, the committee was amazed to read in<i> The Irish Times </i>a copy of Mr. O'Flaherty's letter to the committee, dated 5 May 1999, in which he states that he could not further help the committee as &ldquo;the Constitution did not permit him to do so.&rdquo;  There is a blatant inconsistency here. Mr. O'Flaherty saw no problem, constitutional or otherwise, in coming before the committee to make a statement and to answer &ldquo;any and all questions&rdquo;. He saw no problem whatever in outlining his full involvement in the case while he was still a serving Supreme Court judge. Yet having resigned as a judge, he now finds that there is a constitutional impediment to his so doing.</P>
    <P>In the intervening six weeks he has made absolutely no attempt to explain the reasons for his about-turn. He has not adduced any legal advice or argument to support his dramatic change of heart. He still has not advanced any argument to show he still believes he did nothing wrong in interfering in the Sheedy case. He has given absolutely no indication that he is prepared to make himself amenable to any form of further inquiry. Quite frankly, in such circumstances, the Government is entirely wrong in bringing forward this Bill to guarantee an index-linked pension of £40,000 to Mr O'Flaherty for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>People are justified in making comparisons between the financial benevolence of the State in the case of a former Supreme Court judge who, in the words of the Chief Justice, &ldquo;damaged the course of justice&rdquo; and the kind of treatment that would be meted out to somebody who had erred to a lesser extent in the lower ranks of the public service. The Government should examine the gross unexplained inconsistency of the position now being adopted by Mr. O'Flaherty where he has refused to co-operate with the Oireachtas joint committee because of so-called and spurious constitutional difficulties. Has the Government, for example, taken the trouble to take its own legal advice on whether Mr. O'Flaherty is debarred by the Constitution from explaining his actions? If so, what is this legal advice? If it has not taken legal advice, why has it now done so? Has the Government examined the legal advice given to the Oireachtas joint committee?</P>
    <P>That legal advice is to the effect that, while it would not be open to the committee to make any inquiry into a judge or former judge in the exercise of their judicial function, to suggest that under the Constitution it is not permissible to ask a person who is, or was, a judge any questions <Col N="64" /> relating to matters other than the exercise of judicial functions is to extend the independence of the Judiciary provided for in the Constitution and the theory of the separation of powers beyond the protection provided for on a literal reading of Article 35.2 of the Constitution. The legal advice goes on to state that it would appear the majority, if not all, of Mr. O'Flaherty's involvement in the Sheedy affair related to matters not connected with any exercise of his judicial function and, therefore, would properly not be capable of being considered as a violation of Article 35.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no constitutional difficulty in Mr. O'Flaherty coming forward. There is no infringement of the separation of powers. He was not exercising a judicial function. Therefore, for him to refuse to make himself available to answer the valid and legitimate questions he was so anxious to answer on 16 April last is simply unacceptable. This should have been communicated to him by the Government in anticipation of the publication of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in answer to a question from me at Question Time on Tuesday, 15 June, said his legal advice was that it would be contrary to the Constitution for the Government to build into the legislation a condition of co-operation on the part of the judges. That could well be the case, although the Minister has declined to make the legal advice available. There could, however, be no constitutional difficulty in telling Mr. O'Flaherty that the Government had taken its own legal advice, and-or the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights had legal advice, to the effect that Mr. O'Flaherty's involvement in the Sheedy case did not constitute a judicial function and in the light of this, the Government would appreciate a written undertaking from him to co-operate with whatever further inquiry would be undertaken to establish the full circumstances that surround the Sheedy affair.</P>

      <QRef>[16115/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 June 1999, I announced a list of pilot projects <Col N="65" /> which had been agreed by the Government to pilot the public private partnership approach in Ireland. The pilot projects are concentrated in the economic infrastructure sector, including transport and environmental services, with the key considerations being long-term value for money and their priority at national level. A central element in delivering value for money from PPP projects is the proper allocation of risk. One of the risks for the private sector, of course, will be on the return they achieve on their investment.</P>
      <P>The Departments directly responsible for the programme areas, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, will develop the selected projects for speedy implementation with particular reference to the potential for private sector finance, with the aim of seeking tenders or other proposals from the private sector as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>When the Government adopted the PPP approach, the potential to generate revenue to remunerate the investment was included as one of the criteria to be used in deciding on the merits of the PPP approach in any particular case. Projects can be financed from private sources, remunerated by user charges or in other ways, by payments from public sources, including the Exchequer, and by a combination of payments from both sources. The relative contributions from both sources will vary depending on the nature of the project and the feasibility of having the private sector implement steps to remunerate its contribution. This is one of the matters which will be examined in developing detailed proposals for the pilot projects.</P>
      <P>Any specific proposal relating to road tolls is subject to the relevant statutory provisions. The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Before a toll can apply to a national road, a number of procedures have to be complied with. These include the making of a toll scheme by the National Roads Authority after consultation with the local authority concerned; the giving of public notice; the submission of the scheme for consideration by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; and the holding of a public inquiry where objections are received.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister accepts that we must seek finance from other sources as a result of the scaled back funding from the EU and that in order to attract investment we must provide incentives. Is the Minister in favour of placing tolls on infrastructural development, including bridges and roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deenihan that a fair segment of funding will have to be made up by the private sector in terms of infras<Col N="66" /> tructural development in future, something I have signalled on many occasions. The issue of placing tolls and remunerating private operators will evolve over time. The Government has enunciated on many occasions in the past that where a project has already been built with either EU or Exchequer funding, it is not in favour of tolls. However, when PPPs are being developed the question of tolls or other methods through which the private sector can be remunerated will be discussed with account taken of the various policy options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will decide whether there should be a toll? Will it be the NRA or the Government? What policy has the Minister on shadow tolls? Would the Government consider shadow tolls in preference to tolls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of tolls on roads would inevitably be a matter for the National Roads Authority in the first place. This would be followed by consultation with the local authority and with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Shadow tolls, which would involve the State paying tolls on bridges, roads, etc., on the basis of usage, have been discussed for some time. I said in response to questions raised at the Committee on Finance and the Public Service that while I do not wish to rule out shadow tolls forever, and while there may be projects where shadow tolls can be considered, I am not overly keen on them. If the shadow toll concept had been agreed for the west link bridge, where PPP has operated in the past, the promoter would be making the exact profits he is now making, but taxpayers from Counties Kerry to Donegal would be paying for it on the basis of usage, which is not appropriate. I think the public is more prepared to accept user charges than in the past, although I am not sure whether politicians are more prepared to enunciate that view. While I do not want to rule out shadow tolls, they are not uppermost in my mind.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, the report to which the Deputy refers was published yesterday in order to facilitate public consideration of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The report was finalised by the McDowell group on 19 May 1999 and submitted to myself and the Tánaiste the following day. The report contains a considerable number of recommendations and these are now being examined in both my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to making recommendations to Government.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of the financial services sector to Ireland, it is essential that we be very careful in considering the full implications of any decision in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the Tánaiste and I will shortly be in a position to submit joint proposals to Government as regards the next steps that must be taken towards implementing the recommendations of the report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before asking Mr. McDowell to prepare this report the Government had agreed on the principle of establishing a single regulatory authority. Mr. McDowell and his group were asked to consider how this might be implemented. It was not possible for the group to reach unanimity on the location of this single regulatory authority. All the pros and cons are set forth in the report published yesterday and I will be giving due consideration to the matter. I hope in future to be able to send a joint memorandum to the Government on the matter and allow the Government to fully consider it.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply and in interviews I gave yesterday, this is a very serious matter. Ireland has an international reputation in financial regulation and we must consider the matter fully and take everything into account, something I intend doing. I do not intend recommending to the Government something which might be regarded as populist and thereby damage the long-term interest of the country. I will take all the matters into consideration, including the majority recommendation made by the McDowell group. However, I stress that the nine person committee produced three recommendations.</P>

      <P>I anticipated that the Minister might not respond to the question and therefore, with the permission of the Chair, I wish to provide an answer. I put it to the Minister that he intends seeking, presumably in conjunction with <Col N="68" /> the Central Bank, a means by which an independent regulatory authority can be accommodated within the Central Bank, which would act as a second pillar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my response. The second option, which was supported by the Department of Finance representative and the Central Bank representative, is that it would be a division within the Central Bank. The third option, which was put forward by the representative of the Department of the Taoiseach, is referred to as the &ldquo;twin pillars&rdquo; approach. The nine person group could not get unanimity on the way we wish to proceed. It was my intention not to make any comment about this matter until we brought the report to Government but it came into the public domain. Perhaps I should have expected that it would come into the public domain earlier. Perhaps the more sensible approach would have been to publish it the day I received it, but I did not do so.</P>
      <P>I will consider all these matters. I have given an indication of the approach I will take in deciding on a final recommendation. It will be done in conjunction with the Tánaiste.</P>

Was his Department's representative representing the Minister's view in the minority report which he submitted?</P>

That has been my position or wont since I first became a public representative. I will take into account the recommendations of the six persons of the nine person McDowell committee. I will also consider the other recommendations put forward there. It should not be beyond the wit of the Tánaiste and me to arrive at a satisfactory outcome.</P>

      <P>The primary principles underlying our approach to electronic business are the same as those for traditional business and this is in line EU and OECD norms in this regard. In other words, the current tax rules and systems are applied as far as is possible to e-commerce and where difficulties are encountered with this approach some fine tuning may be necessary. The aim is to ensure a neutrality of treatment of transactions whether carried out by e-commerce or by more traditional commercial methods. For Irish businesses, it is expected that the current taxation rules will be robust enough to cope with any increase in e-commerce transactions.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a possibility that there may be some problems with collecting taxes from outside the EU. At the moment much e-commerce transactions relate to the on-line ordering and physical delivery of goods. If there is a significant increase in the amount of goods physically delivered, this could cause some distortion of trade between EU and non-EU traders and this may require further examination. Solutions in the area of e-commerce will require international action and Ireland has been contributing to the debates on solutions at EU and wider international levels.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that there may be a need for future changes to direct and indirect taxes to ensure the effective taxation of e-commerce. We also recognise the advantages of encouraging this sector to grow and the possible competitive opportunities there are for Irish-based businesses in this field. This issue and the need for balance has been examined by the Tax Strategy Group and in a recently published discussion paper by the Revenue Commissioners on electronic commerce and the Irish tax system. I will arrange to have these documents forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The e-commerce market is estimated to be worth between $8 billion and $40 billion at present. Future projections are equally wide-ranging with probably the most conservative estimates coming from the US Government, which stated that it would be worth $365 billion by 2002. The Irish market was valued at less than £10 million in 1997 but this figure is expected to rise to £400 million by 2001. The area will grow considerably.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question is timely in that it refers to ensuring that the relevant tax is paid by companies in this area. The matter is being considered both by the EU and the OECD and it was recently discussed at a conference in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>We think we can handle the present tax position but there will be a considerable increase in business in this field. It is an area of taxation which is not just of interest to Ireland but to all our EU partners and our partners in the OECD.

      <P>We are not considering the setting up of a regulator, but the taxation matter is of considerable interest to us and our EU partners. As matters develop we will be looking at this aspect again to see if there is any tax evasion or avoidance which may accrue to member states of the EU.</P>
      <P>At the moment the EU is concentrating mostly on the VAT aspect of e-commerce to ensure there are no distortions of trade or losses to the national exchequers. My EU partners and I believe that the current rules are adequate but, since this field is developing so quickly and it is so far-reaching, we may need to revisit the matter in the near future. If we do so, it is likely that it would have to be done at EU level and further afield at OECD level. It is not a matter which the Irish authorities, or for that matter other authorities or member states, would be able to tackle alone.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to Taxation of Energy Products, which the Commission published in March 1997 and not to the earlier proposals relating to carbon energy tax which are not being actively pursued by the Commission but which have not been formally withdrawn either.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the earlier carbon energy tax that was proposed by the European Commission in 1992 and on which no agreement was reached. Following the failure to reach agreement on that proposal, the Commission introduced the proposed directive on the taxation of energy products in March 1997. The proposed directive suggested both increased taxes on items such as petrol and proposed new taxes on coal, gas and electricity. There were also complex arrangements to assist energy intensive industries with both obligatory and optional provisions for relief from the tax suggested. EU excise directives already require minimum rates for taxes on mineral oils, but taxes on electricity, natural gas or on coal etc. are not required. Ireland does not impose any additional excise taxes on natural gas, electricity, coal or turf. The Commission proposal provided for a three phased increase in existing mineral oil tax minima, the first of which was to come into effect on 1 January 1998. EU excises are expressed as minima and no upper limit is generally specified.</P>
      <P>Ireland has expressed concerns on a number of occasions about the proposed directive. Our concerns relate to our peripheral status, the greater dispersal of population which adds to transport costs and the need to maintain competitiveness in the EU <i>versus </i>third countries. My particular concern as Minister for Finance is to ensure that any measures advanced to promote energy saving do not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have very low taxes on energy. I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of any such energy tax would have on the consumer price index and how increased tax and new taxes would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that Ireland already has relatively high taxes on energy use, particularly those relating to motoring &ndash; value added tax at 21 per cent and vehicle registration tax at rates up to 30 per cent. Motor fuel taxes, while high, are significantly lower here than those applied in the United Kingdom, for example.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that Spain and Ireland had difficulties at ECOFIN.</P>

      </i>Spain has raised problems with the underlying principles of the proposal. At the ECOFIN meeting in May 1999, Spain referred to the negative effect the proposal may have on its economy in terms of inflation, loss of competitiveness, transport costs and consumer purchasing power. At the European Council summit in Cologne earlier this month, direction was given for a continuation of work on the framework proposals, bearing in mind the impact any agreement may have on the environment. My Department looks forward to working with the Finnish Presidency in this regard.</P>
    <P>During his attendance at a conference in Dublin last Friday, I met with Commissioner Monti, who has responsibility for this area in the EU Commission. I made clear my reservations on the issue. However, I indicated to the Commissioner that Ireland would not wish to hold back the remainder of the Community and, therefore, would be willing to make every effort to reach agreement on the framework document bearing in mind, of course, my earlier remarks with regard to competitiveness and any adverse effects on the consumer price index and the less well off.</P>

I have outlined my concerns in my reply to the Deputy's question. Commissioner Monti paid me a courtesy call on his visit to Dublin last Friday and we discussed this matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not intend to be the dog in the manger and will assist in arriving at a compromise on this matter. We are a long way from agreement at present.

      <P>In anticipation of the Minister's reply, I read the paper published by the Tax Strategy Group last year. In its introduction, it sets out the Kyoto Protocol commitments which we have undertaken, namely an increase in emissions of just 13 per cent. The paper states that the limit is tight and that it will not be easy for Ireland to meet it. It also states that taxation could play a part in assisting us to meet the commitments made. Does the Minister agree that taxation will play a part in meeting those commitments?</P>

      <P>I accept that taxation can play a part in changing people's usage habits. If I were to double the price of cigarettes, I expect it would have a considerable impact on the level of consumption of cigarettes in the State. The EU submission, and those of other states is that taxation can play an important part in these patterns. I have a very open mind on whether taxation changes will have a considerable effect in a peripheral state such as Ireland or whether they will assist us in meeting our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. I have listened to the debate and am willing to assist in finding a solution at EU level.</P>
      <P>The Spanish position on this issue has been one of very trenchant opposition, more on the grounds of principle than anything else. While the Irish position has also been one of trenchant opposition, it has been somewhat more reasonable. I am willing to consider proposals, advanced by the Commission and member states, with a view to arriving at a compromise solution. However, the Irish position must be taken into account along the lines outlined in my reply.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index, CPI, for May showed an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent compared with 1.4 per cent for the previous month. Excluding mortgage interest effects, inflation rose to 2.6 per cent in May from 2.3 per cent in April. The year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices stood at 2.3 per cent in May compared with 2 per cent in April. The most notable price changes in the year to May were in services and related expenditure at +4.3 per cent, food at +3.1 per cent, tobacco at +3.3 per cent, housing at 10.7 per cent and clothing and footwear at 6.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the recent rise in international oil prices and changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate, transport at +0.9 per cent and light and fuel at +0.6 per cent showed large monthly increases in May. Alcoholic drinks showed a monthly increase of +1.5 per cent, reflecting a recent general rise in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prospects for the rest of the year are dependent on a number of factors. On the negative side, inflation in the services sector is running at over 4 per cent on a year-on-year basis. This is a cause for concern and indicates the existence of domestic inflationary pressures. International commodity prices, which have been very low until recently, are also increasing modestly with the prospect of further increases in the months ahead. In addition, as the large falls in mortgage rates at <Col N="74" /> the end of last year fall out of the year-on-year comparison, this will see the headline CPI increase towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>On the positive side food prices should put downward pressure on the CPI. Last autumn, food prices rose sharply reflecting supply problems. These price increases are unlikely to be repeated this year. Since the beginning of the year, the euro has fallen by about 7.6 per cent against sterling and by 11.3 per cent against the dollar. Although not strongly in evidence to date, imported inflation could become a factor if the present parities were sustained, in view of Ireland's substantial dependence on international trade. The degree to which this might occur is, of course, critically dependent on the pricing response of UK suppliers, in particular, to the evolution of the euro/sterling parity. Overall, it is forecast that the CPI will increase over the course of the year but the average for the year as a whole is likely to be lower than the budget day forecast of 2 per cent.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that an exchange rate of below 82p sterling over a sustained period will inevitably lead to inflationary pressures here? Will he express any concern in regard to the weakness of the euro from the point of view of international perception? Will he confirm whether discussions have taken place at meetings of European Finance Ministers on the weakness of the euro? Has its weakness given rise to any concern to date among our EU partners? </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this matter was discussed at length in advance of the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, particularly at the end of 1997 and early 1998 when some commentators forecast that Irish inflation would reach extraordinary levels. Suffice to say that the forecast outlined by the Department of Finance was correct, not that advanced in the outlandish headlines of some commentators.</P>
      <P>During that debate, I recognised that the critical determinant of Irish inflation has always been the relationship between the Irish pound and sterling. The Deputy is correct in saying that a high sterling value over a period would affect prices, given our trade with the UK. However, that would depend on the volume of imports from the UK, in addition to the pricing mechanisms used by UK suppliers and their Irish importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the value of the euro. I was somewhat criticised within this House, but praised outside of it in the longer term, for my failure to comment on the Irish pound exchange rate when the Irish pound floated freely. My approach was referred to as the &lsquo;button-lipped approach'. Some of my European counterparts might do well to adopt that approach in regard to comments on the euro exchange rate. It was not my practice in the past to comment on the Irish pound exchange <Col N="75" /> rate and I do not intend to comment on the euro exchange rate in the future. Discussions have taken place at ECOFIN on whether people in Europe should also adopt my button-lipped approach. We are aware of the effect comments by certain personages have had on the exchange rate on at least two occasions in recent months. I have indicated on many occasions that there is nothing the market makers love more than politicians and people in authority commenting on exchange rates. If one does not comment, one takes away the target for speculation. I encourage my European colleagues to adopt this approach.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to a similar question last month, the Revenue job assist scheme was introduced in April last year to complement the wide range of schemes available to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The scheme is a focused two part initiative that gives the long-term unemployed an incentive to take up employment and gives potential employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person as opposed to someone else in the labour market. The scheme has been extended to cater for certain persons with disabilities since the start of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to statistics produced by the Revenue Commissioners for the 1998-99 year of assessment, covering the 12 month period from 6 April 1998 to 5 April 1999, a total of 1,112 cases had been issued a tax free allowance which included the job assist allowance in that period. Of the 1,112 cases, a total of 132 cases were no <Col N="77" /> longer in employment at the end of that year of assessment. This represents a drop-out rate of nearly 12 per cent. While I would prefer if all the people who had benefited from the scheme had remained in full-time employment, the fact that more than 88 per cent were still employed at the end of the first year of operation of the scheme is most encouraging. In the first four weeks of the current tax year an additional 344 cases have availed of the scheme. Further details of these cases will be available shortly from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue job assist scheme is working satisfactorily in terms of dealing with the difficulties faced by the persons who are long-term unemployed from another angle and in terms of complementing the wide range of back-to-work incentives available to this category of persons. The scheme has met a clear need since its introduction last year and its operation will continue to be closely monitored.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI report contains many other interesting ideas which have been around for a long time, such as the abolition of mortgage interest relief. Successive Administrations decided not to go down that road. There is nothing new, therefore, about some of the policy options put forward in the study. The ESRI also made the case that we should row back on the assistance given via the IDA in attracting industry; that there is less need for this. All these matters will be considered by the Government in preparing the national development plan. As the labour market has tightened, there is an overwhelming case that one should not intervene at the same level as in the past. This is obvious in a wide range of areas.</P>

      <Quest>if favourable consideration will be given to the proposal by the Irish Hotels Federation for an additional tax free allowance of £2,000 per annum to those over 35 who have not worked or drawn benefit for five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals by the Irish Hotels Federation to introduce a new £2,000 tax allowance which it refers to as the homemakers Revenue job assist have been received by my Department. The proposals appears to be aimed at encouraging non-earning spouses, which in current labour market conditions are predominantly women, back into the workforce.The proposal also envisages the retention of existing social welfare and medical card benefits.</P>
      <P>These proposals, along with other proposals for new or increased tax allowances and reliefs, will be examined in the run-up to the budget. Deputies will appreciate that it would be difficult for reasons of equity to restrict any such new allowance to persons taking up employment in a particular sector. Similarly, I have concerns about the feasibility of restricting any new allowance to persons over a certain age. There is also the position of those persons already employed to consider who may regard it as unwelcome that new employees only should receive such allowances.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation to reward effort and improve the incentive to work. The reductions in tax rates in my first budget, together with the major reform introduced in the last budget, have considerably reduced the burden of taxation, particularly on the lower paid, and this will undoubtedly improve the incentive to work. The income tax changes in the last budget removed over 80,000 taxpayers from the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in the 1998 budget I announced a new tax-based employment incentive known as the Revenue job assist. This new scheme is a focused, two-part initiative which gives the long-term unemployed an incentive to take up employment and gives potential employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person as opposed to someone else <Col N="79" /> in the labour market. The scheme is a temporary allowance which is phased out over three years and is designed to help the long-term unemployed bid themselves back into work.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation's proposal, while lasting three years, is not reduced during that period, and could give extra tax-free income to households who already have a substantial family income. However, I will examine this proposal for the next budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the Irish Hotels Federation's recent newsletter, one would be led to believe that the Minister is considering its proposal seriously and that he has almost conceded to it. Does the Minister accept that there is a major labour shortage in the hotel industry and in the tourism industry in general? Does he accept that targeted incentives must be made available to attract workers to that sector? Does he further accept that the tourism industry has been forced to look abroad for workers? Many Dublin hotels now employ workers from France, Germany and other countries because they cannot get Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there has been a tightening of the labour market in the hotel sector in recent years. However, the same has occurred in other areas of the economy. There are still 193,000 people on the live register. The live register figure, or the more widely accepted labour force survey, indicate that our unemployment rate remains at over 6 per cent, so there is still a fair pool of workers available. The Irish Hotels Federation has come up with an interesting proposal which is somewhat analogous to the Revenue job assist scheme. However, other sectors of the economy are also protesting the need for a freeing-up of the labour market.</P>
      <P>The Irish Hotels Federation has given much thought to this issue. It sees a pool of workers, particularly married women, who might be available to join the labour market. The participation rate of that pool of workers is lower in Ireland than in other countries. I accept that the high rate of marital tax is a disincentive to women to return to the labour market.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any plans to make is easier for married women, particularly those whose children are reared and have left home, to participate in the labour market or to partake in training? There do not appear to be any incentives for them to do so at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The participation rate of married women in the Irish labour force is less than in other northern European countries. I accept that the tax disincentive is a factor. The measures introduced in recent budgets and taxation changes will improve matters but I recognise that <Col N="80" /> it is a consideration. A higher participation rate among this pool of workers would increase the numbers in the labour market. I will give this matter further consideration in the run up to the budget. Training schemes are a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but I will bring the Deputy's concerns to her attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>There are long-standing rules governing the conditions under which it is allowable for civil servants to engage in or be connected with outside occupations. In essence, the rules provide that no officer may at any time engage in or be connected with any outside business or activity which would in any way conflict with the interests of his Department, be inconsistent with his official position or tend to impair his usefulness as a public servant.</P>
      <P>As part of a series of initiatives to improve the human resource management function in the Civil Service under the strategic management initiative, it was decided to review the rules and guidelines which govern the conduct of civil servants. A draft code of conduct is being considered within the strategic management initiative deliberative process. It is intended that the code will draw together in a single document the principal precepts which should govern the behaviour of civil servants. The code is not intended to be an exhaustive list of guidelines for all possible eventualities, but rather will set out the principled framework within which all civil servants should work and the values they will be expected to uphold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code will address certain standards of probity required of civil servants in the modern Civil Service in relation to issues such as gifts, hospitality, conflicts of interest, such as those that may arise as a consequence of any business activity or employment of civil servants outside the Civil Service, and payments for work on behalf of outside bodies. Once the strategic management initiative consultative process has been completed the text will submitted to Government <Col N="81" /> for approval. If approved by Government the code will be circulated to all civil servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the code of conduct include penalties for non-compliance? Does the Minister accept that any proposed code of conduct should first be discussed by this House, or a committee of the House, before being circulated to Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is ongoing as part of the deliberative process in drawing up the code of conduct with Civil Service unions. It is intended that the code would not specify sanctions in respect of breaches of the standards set out. The code will operate within the existing legislative framework for the Civil Service. Disciplinary action against any civil servant is still governed by the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.</P>
      <P>I have not considered whether the code should be made available to the House but I see merit in that suggestion. Perhaps the code could be referred to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service within the next couple of months. I am sure that the advice of Members will be taken into account in bringing the code to fruition. I cannot see why anyone would object to it and I will make it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the code of conduct apply to advisers who are not public servants but who are working with a Minister on a temporary basis? I am sure the Minister shares my concern at the reduction in the number of applicants for some entry level posts in the Civil Service. Does he agree that we need a more flexible approach to employment in the Civil Service and that civil servants must be allowed to take leave of absence for a number of years, that they must be allowed to perform outside consultancy work &ndash; as long as it does not conflict with their public service obligations &ndash; and that we need a loosening of the rules while retaining some clarity as to the public service obligations of civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need more flexibility concerning the matters to which the Deputy referred. However, we have not been very good at loosening up the Civil Service. In the UK there is an ongoing flow of people moving from the public service into the private sector and gaining experience which benefits both parties. During the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, Deputy Quinn was very keen to promote such developments, as was the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. However, we have not been as successful as other countries in this regard. I can see how flexibility would encourage people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the fall-off in numbers of people applying to the Civil Service. However, this reflects the trend in the general jobs market. I have been around long enough <Col N="82" /> to have seen this operate in two directions. When I completed my third level studies, it was not that attractive to join the Civil Service because the market for jobs was very good. I have lived to see the opposite happen where everyone wanted to join the Civil Service and now I will see the first scenario come about again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a specific question as to whether it was intended that the code of conduct would apply to advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Advisers are usually appointed as temporary civil servants and there are rules and guidelines which apply to special advisers. There is a standard provision for special advisers who are subject to the Ethics in Public Office Act and who must also declare their interests. Therefore, a combination of Civil Service rules and the rules which apply to special advisers should cover all eventualities. In any event, people should know when there is a conflict of interest without having to be told.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no rules governing that activity but I can see merit in having it considered further. Long before current difficulties I initiated within the Department of Finance consideration of this matter with a view to drawing up some tentative rules governing people who may have been civil servants for many years and who left to act as lobbyists for private sector concerns. However, we must be careful not to restrict people's activities. It would not be fair to do that and I do not intend to do it. Nonetheless, some further thought and debate should take place in this area and perhaps the recent difficulties give us an opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, when such difficulties arise, some people make outlandish statements with the result that we do not deliberate as coolly as we should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister correctly that he has done some work in the Department and that he intends to bring forward proposals in the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

It is a delicate area and a difficult one in which to achieve the right balance.</P>

      <P>Section 231 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, exempts from income tax the profits or gains arising to the owner or part-owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares by the stallion, but only if the stallion is ordinarily kept on land in the State and if the servicing of the mares takes place in the State. Taxpayers are not required to include income arising from tax exempt stallion fees in their tax returns. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is, therefore, no basis on which to provide an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of the tax exemption or of the numbers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit bemused by this because my experience of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners is that one thing of which they usually can produce estimates is the likely loss or gain from abolishing an exemption. This has been part of tax law for some time and I do not know why. It is an enormously profitable business and I do not see why it needs a tax exemption to stimulate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no statistics available in this area because tax law provides that the profits arising to the owner of certain stallions shall not be taken into account for the purposes of the Tax Acts. The return taxpayers are required to make to Revenue is a return of income liable to tax. Therefore, if an activity is exempt from tax, it does not have to be included in the return. The same applies in the case of woodlands and forestry. Therefore, we cannot compose figures in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the commission on taxation, which proposed the abolition of a large number of reliefs specifically recommended that this exemption be maintained. Successive Governments have not taken up most of the recommendations of the <Col N="84" /> commission for the abolition of a large number of reliefs but this is one area where it said the exemption should be maintained. This initiative in the Finance Act, 1969, has resulted in Ireland acquiring an international reputation as the best place to stand a stallion and has brought enormous benefits to rural areas. Those facts are recognised by the Commission on Taxation. No administration, including the one of which the Deputy's party was a member, has considered the abolition of this relief and neither do I. It has worked tremendously well and made us a world leader. It would be very foolish to damage it and I have no intention of so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <P>This relief has been of benefit to the country. It has been of more benefit to rural areas than anything else in this area of activity. The horse breeding industry is estimated to employ about 4,500 people and has brought enormous benefits to the country. The tax exemption relates to fees on stallions. Many people think stud farms do not pay tax, but that is incorrect. Only stallion fees are exempt. Most studs do not employ a stallion in any event.</P>

Both reliefs have been worthwhile and the Deputy's colleague, the esteemed Deputy from Galway West, has been most vociferous in arguing that Ireland should be the place for artists to come and live. The tax relief for stallion fees introduced in 1969 has resulted in Ireland's recognititon internationally as the best place for horse breeding and, therefore, I do not contemplate making any change.</P>

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be wholly inappropriate for me to comment further on leaked material from a confidential draft document.</P>
      <P>As regards trends in pay in general, the Government has emphasised the need for continued restraint in both the public and private sectors. This is important if we are to maintain our competitiveness and sustain our strong economic growth of recent years into the future. As regards the public sector, the Government is fully aware of the difficulties and pressures on the pay front. This is why the Taoiseach identified the need for a new approach to public service pay in the period beyond Partnership 2000 and invited the public services committee of the ICTU to enter into discussions on this issue.

My comments are not based on statistical evidence &ndash; I am sure it will emerge in time &ndash; but I do not believe that higher level personnel in the Civil Service are moving outside at present. However, there has always been a tradition that people leave the public service on foot of better offers from the private sector. Difficulties exist in trying to attract people to enter the lower public service grades because they can obtain better remuneration in the private sector. For some reason, it is more attractive for people to enter the private sector at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 require that a disabled person must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer. Refusal of a primary medical certificate may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. The board is independent and its decision is final. I have no role in determining whether a person satisfies the medical criteria laid down in the above mentioned regulations, nor have I powers which would allow me to overturn a decision of the Medical Board of Appeal.</P>
      <P>There is increasing demand from applicants to gain admittance to this scheme. However, as with all schemes governed by qualifying conditions, there will always be applicants who do not meet the required conditions. Therefore, it may be that the difficulties referred to by persons in obtaining the primary medical certificate do not indicate administrative inefficiencies but rather the fact that the applicants concerned may not meet the specified medical criteria.</P>
      <P>We have considered how to resolve these sort of issues before. A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions of the scheme was carried out in 1993-4, involving wide-ranging consultations with the Departments of Health, the Environment and Justice, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, relevant organisations catering for the disabled and Opposition spokespersons on Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the review detailed consideration was given to the qualifying medical criteria for entry to the scheme, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to many additional categories of disabled individuals. It was decided that the scheme should continue to focus on persons with the most severe and permanent mobility restrictions. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations, drawn up following that review, and a qualifying person must satisfy on one or more of them. It is the nature and the extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability. The cur<Col N="89" /> rent regulations, namely, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations came into effect on 1 December 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>A current review of the scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determining what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. However, I do not want to raise expectations that any person who suffers from some form of disability will be able to benefit from the scheme following the completion of this examination.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out a wide-ranging technical review of the operation of the scheme and their report is also awaited. However, this review is much narrower in scope in that it addresses problems with the current scheme and makes recommendations on how to make it operate in a more effective and cost-efficient manner for its present target group.</P>
    <P>While I am very sympathetic to people with disabilities, the difficulty with this scheme relates to the need to focus its substantial benefits on those most affected by lack of mobility due to physical disability. The cost of the current scheme has been steadily increasing and opening it up to wider ranges of disabilities would significantly add to this cost. The total cost to the Exchequer for 1998 was £14.4 million and it is estimated that the cost will rise to £16.5 million in 1999. This does not include the costs of the exemption from the payment of road tax.</P>
    <P>As was indicated in the other House last night, a variety of requests have been made for the medical criteria to be relaxed so as to extend the range of qualifying disabilities to include many other categories suffering from other ailments. In addition, there are requests to allow persons not fully meeting the current criteria relating to the loss of limbs to be admitted. The number of potential beneficiaries is unclear but according to groups representing the disabled, there are up to 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree. Clearly a scheme which attempted to meet all these needs would involve a radical overhaul of the basis of the relief and result in a large increase in cost.</P>
    <P>The potential cost and the possible very wide uptake of any extension of the scheme can be gauged by the interest of Deputies and the 30 or so questions tabled on this issue so far this year. I accept the obvious concern and the sincere motivation of the House in seeking to extend this scheme. Needless to say, we want to be sensitive on this issue, but there are genuine problems in <Col N="90" /> accommodating extensions of relief as I hope I have demonstrated.</P>

      <P>The regulations were drawn up after the consultation process outlined in my reply. In reply to previous questions, and during the debate on last year's and this year's Finance Bills, I highlighted the cost of this scheme. Discussions on this costly scheme have been taking place among members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party for some time. It is a costly scheme because it is very attractive. Other countries address this problem in a different way.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to the Deputy on a previous occasion that to make changes to the existing scheme to make it less attractive would bring down a hornet's nest on the head of the Minister for Finance. I recall a former Minister for Health and a former Minister for Finance proposed changes to this scheme in the past and all hell broke loose. I am reluctant to revisit it, except to say that an ongoing interdepartmental review is taking place and the matter will be considered when that review group's report comes before me.</P>

In light of the fact that senior area medical officers have no alternative but to recommend applicants whom they deem appropriate to avail of the scheme, will he consider seeking the views of the senior area medical officers, or might I get their views and convey them to the Minister for consideration by the interdepartmental review committee?</P>

      <P>I do not have an objection to the Deputy sending the views of anybody to a relevant interdepartmental review group. I do not want to give the impression that I am heartless in this regard, but I must point out it is estimated that there are 350,000 persons in Ireland who have some form of disability. Relaxation of the medical criteria that apply to this scheme would impose a heavy charge on the Exchequer for the reasons I outlined. It is an attractive scheme and, perhaps, there is another way of addressing this problem. When we introduced this scheme perhaps we should not have set it up as we did, but we did that and I have no intention of abolishing it. Changing the scheme with a view to making it less attractive might bring more people into the scheme but it would then be less attractive to those who are already in it, and that is a problem.</P>

I am concerned, as I know the Minister is, that there are people who cannot avail of the scheme who should be able to do so. Given the strict criteria laid down in the first primary certificate, senior medical officers find they cannot comply in terms of ticking the required boxes, so to speak. For that reason and because of my interest in this matter and my involvement in the Eastern Health Board, I will contact some senior area medical officers to get their views on the scheme and forward them to the interdepartmental review committee.</P>

      <P>The rapid escalation in house prices over the past few years has presented difficulties, even for those prospective buyers who would normally be regarded as having good incomes. Last year the Government appointed a team of consultants to prepare a report on the housing market. The Government reacted speedily to the findings of this report into house prices by Peter Bacon and Associates and announced a number of measures aimed at addressing the sharp increase in house prices and restoring balance to the housing market. As part of these measures, I made a number of changes to the tax system and these were contained in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998. Earlier this year the Government commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to review the effectiveness of the measures taken last year and to consider other recent developments in the housing sector.</P>
      <P>In their second report, the consultants noted that there is widespread consensus that the Government actions taken last year have played a key role in achieving a slow-down in the rate of increase in house prices. They stated that the primary impact towards price stability has been achieved through reducing investor demand, promoting liquidity in the second-hand market, through the reforms of the stamp duty code, and implementing a strategy to address the problem which has been credible to the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Finance Bill, 1999, I acted promptly on a further recommendation contained in the consultants' second report. In response to difficulties identified by the consultants, I amended the conditions attaching to the special low rate of capital gains tax for development land where this is sold to form part of the supply of housing land. In order to avail of the low 20 per cent rate, the land <Col N="92" /> need only be zoned residential under a county development plan.</P>
    <P>I have said previously that the tax measures taken last year and the further amendment to the capital gains tax code contained in this year's Finance Act were only part of an overall balanced package of ongoing measures taken by the Government. There are a number of measures, which my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal have announced in this regard. These measures, which have been discussed at length inside and outside this House, are aimed at increasing the supply of housing as well as improving the affordability of house purchasing.</P>
    <P>In short, what could be done in the short term under the tax code has been done and done promptly. Furthermore, tax measures have been put in place to encourage the increased supply of land for housing development to redress the imbalance between supply and demand in the housing market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>His second question concerned increasing the new house grant. I will have to give the Deputy a blunt answer to that question. I am certain my view is not shared by all Members of the House, all members of my party or, perhaps, by all members of the Government. I do not believe that increasing the new house grant would do anything to alleviate the burden on first time house purchasers. Past experience reveals that such money ends up in increased profits for the builder-developer &ndash; that is certain. That has been the case with grants, particularly housing grants, and successive Administrations have made mistakes in that regard. I have been of that view for a long time. That is my honest opinion on the Deputy's proposal to increase the new house grant, attractive as that proposal might seem initially. The Deputy's party may have made suggestions in that regard during a recent <Col N="93" /> election campaign, but I did not agree with it then, nor did I agree with it in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any empirical evidence at present, except that the changes I made regarding capital gains tax on development land seem to have brought problems in other regards, to which I referred at the finance committee. I received representations from some people concerning a local authority that wanted to buy a plot of land for use as a cemetery. The individual concerned does not want to sell his land to that local authority because he would face a capital gains tax bill of 40 per cent, whereas if he sold it for housing development he would only have to pay a capital gains tax bill of 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not have any evidence at present to say whether this measure has had a major or minor impact, except to say that from my experience people are aware of it and when they want to dispose of their land they want to get the best possible price and to pay the least amount of tax. I do not have any empirical evidence on this matter on file.</P>

      <P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, was our response to the Bacon report and I introduced the various tax changes then. I said during the debate on that Bill that the measure was an attempt by the Government to distort the market. The Government was trying to balance supply and demand by dampening down demand and I said clearly at the time that it was a short-term measure. The market will only become rational when supply increases to meet demand, and we have discussed the reason supply and demand are out of kilter. As I have said previously, it is amazing that Deputies, not so much those from Deputy Stanton's party, who cry about housing shortages are stopping housing developments going ahead on zoned land in their own constituencies.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as the two former judges referred to in the Bill give a clear undertaking that they are prepared to make themselves available to answer questions before whatever course of enquiry is recommended by Dáil Éireann in order to establish the full truth of the involvement of both individuals in the Sheedy affair.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday, 15 June the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, replying to a question I put down, said that legal advice given to him stated it would be contrary to the Constitution for the Government to enshrine a condition of co-operation on the part of the judges in this legislation. That could well be the case, although the Minister has declined to make the legal advice available. There could, however, have been no constitutional difficulty <Col N="95" /> whatever in telling Mr. O'Flaherty that the Government had taken its own legal advice and-or the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights had received legal advice to the effect that Mr. O'Flaherty's involvement in the Sheedy case did not constitute a judicial function and in light of this the Government would appreciate a written undertaking from him to co-operate with whatever further inquiry would be undertaken in order to fully establish the circumstances surrounding the Sheedy affair.</P>
      <P>For the Government to expect the Oireachtas to agree to legislation guaranteeing the former judge, Mr. O'Flaherty, a £40,000 index-linked pension for life, in the light of his illogical, inconsistent, contradictory and unco-operative attitude is irresponsible on the Government's part. Granting him the pension in such circumstances is tantamount to an invitation to dig in further, and Fine Gael is not prepared to be a party to this strategy. Similarly, in the case of Mr. Kelly, one could scarcely hear a more damning denunciation from a fellow judge than the Chief Justice's commentary. He should not have heard the appeal case &ndash; the transcript runs to less than one and a half pages and the case took only a few minutes to hear. Contrary to the impression given by Mr. Kelly, there was no up-to-date psychologist's report. Neither party to the case was allowed to make submissions. Now, without any guarantee of co-operation, the Irish taxpayer is expected to reward the judge, who in the words of the Chief Justice compromised the administration of justice and did not conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge, with a handsome pension of £30,000, index-linked for the rest of his life. As in the case of Mr. O'Flaherty, this is wrong.</P>
      <P>What written commitments, if any, have been given by the Minister and his Department in relation to the judge's pension entitlements. What correspondence has been exchanged between his Department and the representatives of the two judges in the pension negotiations? Is there anything in writing or were all negotiations carried out orally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas has no desire to trespass on the domain of judicial function or to infringe on judicial independence in any way. There is, however, a clear absence of judicial accountability at present and this is not the fault of the Constitution. The legal advice available to the joint committee is to the effect that the Constitution permits judges and former judges to give evidence and offer explanations in relation to matters not concerned with the exercise of their judicial function. However, in the absence of a constitutional amendment it would not be open to make an inquiry into the exercise of their judicial function by a judge or former judge. Therefore, depending on the progress or lack of progress of any further inquiry into the Sheedy <Col N="96" /> affair, a constitutional amendment which provides some limited degree of accountability may have to be considered, while at the same time respecting the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>The ready co-operation of the former Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, is to be welcomed. It is clear, as the Minister said, that his handling of the listing of the case was flawed. His office is a quasi-judicial one but he should not have allowed himself to be influenced in relation to the listing of the case. He is, however, partially exonerated by a paragraph in the Chief Justice's report in which Mr. Justice Hamilton states: &ldquo;I am satisfied, therefore, that had Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty not spoken to the County Registrar, he, the County Registrar, would not have telephoned the accused's solicitor and opened the possibility of the case being relisted in the Circuit Court.&rdquo;  Mr. Quinlan's offer of co-operation is in stark contrast to the refusal in the case of Mr. O'Flaherty and the tardiness in the case of Mr. Kelly in coming forward and discharging their public civic responsibility.</P>
    <P>Both judges have done considerable damage to the credibility of a central instrument of our democracy. By falling on their swords they relieved the Oireachtas of the trauma of voting them out of office. There are, however, too many imponderables, unexplained irregularities, contradictions and inconsistencies to simply close the book and consign it to the shelves of history. It is important in the interest of democracy, the Judiciary and public confidence in the institutions of State that we establish the reasons the various actors in the Sheedy affair did what they did.</P>
    <P>The two former court judges were central to what took place. Unless they co-operate, the truth will never be established. We owe absolutely nobody an apology for ensuring that every legitimate means of persuading them to assist in establishing the truth is availed of. For this reason, therefore, Fine Gael is not willing to grant this Bill a Second Reading until such time as clear undertakings are given by both individuals that they are prepared to co-operate fully with whatever further inquiry is deemed necessary and we ask all Members of the House to endorse this course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will concede that this is an unusual Bill. Its introduction is the latest in a series of bizarre and still unexplained events resulting from the traffic accident in which a car driven by Mr. Philip Sheedy killed Mrs. Anne Ryan and injured members of her family. Resignations of some of the highest judicial figures in the land have ensued, fine reputations have been damaged and families have been put under enormous stress and strain. However, we should never lose sight of the fact that those who are most affected, who have suffered most and endured the greatest loss are the family of Anne Ryan. In the <Col N="97" /> midst of the judicial and political fall-out, the fact remains that a young woman was killed and taken from her family in the prime of her life, her husband was left seriously injured and her children left motherless because of the reckless driving of a man who had consumed more than the legally permitted level of alcohol.</P>
      <P>As I remarked when we discussed the matter in this House before, nothing could compensate the Ryan family for their loss. However, they have a right to expect that if, and when, the person who caused the action was charged, convicted and sentenced, then justice, as set out in the enactments of this House, would take its normal course. The events of the past few months have flowed from clear attempts to ensure justice did not take its normal course and that, in effect, the course of justice would be perverted. These attempts might have been successful had not a vigilant person spotted Mr. Sheedy, whom he believed was properly in prison, and had not Mr. John Ryan shown the courage and determination to ask questions, to persist and to demand explanations.</P>
      <P>The inquiry undertaken into this affair, at the instigation of the Government and at the request of the Attorney General, by the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, was, and is, unprecedented in Irish legal history. Its findings shocked the legal establishment to its core. The Chief Justice found that the actions of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, who shared the Supreme Court benches with him, were &ldquo;damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo;. The findings of the Chief Justice in relation to Mr. Justice Kelly were, in my view, even more damning when he found he had failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge and that his actions &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is against that background, and the background of the response of the two former judges to efforts by an Oireachtas committee charged with responsibility by these Houses to establish the full facts leading up to the early release of Mr. Philip Sheedy, that we must evaluate and pass judgment on this Bill.</P>
      <P>The indisputable fact is that the report produced by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hamilton, was, by any measure, severely critical of the actions of the two judges involved. The Government made it clear that, had the two judges not resigned, motions would have been placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas seeking their formal removal from office, in accordance with Article 35.4.2º of the Constitution. I am unaware of any precedent for formal letters of the type to be delivered to the two judges from the Government, consequent on formal decisions of the Government. That all underscores the uniqueness of the situation and the seriousness of the actions of the judges involved, as determined by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had the Government been required to place a motion before this House in accordance with the <Col N="98" /> Article 35 provisions, I have little doubt that such a motion would have received majority support. Had that happened, the judges would have been removed from office and would, as I understand it, have had no rights to pension or gratuity payments, whatsoever.</P>
    <P>One must acknowledge that the resignation of the two judges averted the need for the Oireachtas to embark on that particular difficult voyage into uncharted waters, where, quite obviously, serious constitutional and legal difficulties would have arisen. I know that prospect was relished by nobody in this House. The two judges are entitled to credit for that, but they are entitled to no subsequent credit for their response to requests to co-operate with efforts on an all-party basis by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights to find answers to the questions that not only Members of this House and the committee wish to have, but which members of the public are entitled to have.</P>
    <P>Given the findings of the Chief Justice and the early resignations of the two former judges, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Kelly, they should now only be entitled to the pensions for which they would have qualified had they simply quit their posts because they chose to retire at this point. It is extremely difficult to justify rewarding the actions of the two judges and the County Registrar, which is what most people would regard this Bill as effectively proposing to do.</P>
    <P>In a statement to the Dáil on 20 April, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined the pension arrangements the Government had agreed upon. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, had he continued to serve, would have been entitled at the age of 67 years to a pension of £26,000 per annum and a gratuity of £79,000; instead, subsequent to severe criticism and the threat by the Government of impeachment, at the age of 61 years he is to get an annual pension of £40,000 and no gratuity. Mr. Justice Kelly would have been entitled at the age of 65 years to a pension of £17,000 and a gratuity of £51,000; instead, at the age of 50 years he is to get&mdash;</P>

      <P>Are the figures wrong? They are the figures the Minister gave in his speech to the Dáil on 20 April. At the age of 50 years, he is to get an annual pension of £30,000.

      <P>Deputy Howlin is correct in outlining the figures which I outlined to the House on 20 April. However, they were based on the service to date at that time. If, on the other hand, they were to proceed to their proper retirement dates, the situation would be entirely different and the figures would be far higher. The fig<Col N="99" /> ures which Deputy Howlin is utilising are certainly those which I gave to the House, but they were based on the pensions they would be entitled to on the basis of their service up to that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The net point is that, had the gentlemen retired because they received another offer or were unwell, or for family or any other reasons &ndash; in other words, had retired in good standing &ndash; they would have been entitled to a pension a fraction of the one now being provided for them in this Bill with the same service. That is the reality. The service has not changed. Had they retired voluntarily in good standing, had done absolutely nothing wrong and had not received a shred of criticism, they would have received substantially less money in annual pension than we are proposing to grant them in this measure, subsequent on the unprecedented criticisms of the Chief Justice.</P>
      <P>These are very generous arrangements. It is not normal for people who are resigning under a significant degree of criticism, to put it at its mildest, to have their pension entitlements substantially enhanced. Comparing the actuarial value of their pension had they served a full judicial term in good standing with their position now is not a valid comparison. It is like calculating what a Dáil Deputy would be entitled to had he served a 30-year Dáil term, even though he might have lost his seat at the last election. It makes no sense to make such a comparison. The only valid comparison is with what he would be entitled to on the basis of service. On that basis, the provisions in the Bill greatly enhance the strictly legal entitlements of the two judges and the County Registrar. That is a point I want to make forcefully.</P>
      <P>I cannot think of any other walk of life in which two senior officials who resigned in the wake of such severe criticisms by a superior &ndash; we are talking about the author of the criticisms being the Chief Justice of the land &ndash; would receive such generous settlements. In virtually any other case, a person in these circumstances would have received no more than their basic pension entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no idea how the Government arrived at the figures contained in the measure before us. We are asked to believe &ndash; and I am particularly anxious that the Minister would respond to these points &ndash; that the figures were arrived at entirely on the basis of telephone calls and that there was no written documentation prepared in advance of the statement made to this House by the Minister on 20 April when he announced details of the pension arrangements for the persons concerned. <Col N="100" /> That was the response which I received to a formal application made under the Freedom of Information Act and by way of follow-up parliamentary question. I have been informed by the Minister and by the officials of his Department that there was, up to the day the Minister made his statement, no written documentation and no file in the Department in relation to these matters, despite the fact that the Minister was aware that they would require legislation.</P>
    <P>Surely there was a legislative file? The actuarial figures were worked out by somebody. There must have been formal requests going back and forth between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance. However, I was told definitively by the Minister and formally by way of response to my request under the Freedom of Information Act that no file existed. Quite simply, that defies belief. Anyone who has held Government office and is familiar with the decision-making process will find it difficult to believe that such an important and sensitive decision would be taken without any papers or documents.</P>
    <P>The statement given by the Minister to this House on 20 April was the announcement of a formal Government decision. We are told that it was worked out and agreed on the telephone and nobody wrote down anything. I would like the Minister to address that matter because I do not believe that is in accordance with normal practice. Is he seriously asking us to believe that decisions to grant these pensions were made without any actuarial written assessment of the likely cost to the taxpayer? Is he asking us to believe that there was no written legal advice sought or obtained on the pension entitlements of the two judges before the Minister made his speech in the Dáil in April? If this is the case, and that is my understanding from the formal response I got to my request under the Freedom of Information Act, then it is an extraordinary way to do important Government business.</P>
    <P>In deciding what pension arrangements we should make for the two retired judges and for the former County Registrar, the Oireachtas is entitled to have regard to the manner in which they responded to the requests of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights in its search for the truth. In this regard we have particular cause to be disappointed with the reaction of the former Supreme Court Justice, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, who, as Deputy Jim Higgins has rightly said, prior to his resignation while he was in office, volunteered to assist the committee. He wrote to the committee and indicated that he would be happy to explain his actions. We were anxious to have as informal an inquiry into the matter as possible so that we would get at the motivation. Unfortunately, subsequent to resigning office, he stated that he believes himself constitutionally barred from assisting the commit<Col N="101" /> tee. It is very difficult to reconcile those two positions.</P>
    <P>Former Justice O'Flaherty felt able, without constitutional impediment, to assist the committee as a serving member of the Supreme Court because his actions, he contended publicly, were not judicial in nature, so there was no constitutional impediment. Subsequent to resigning as a member of the Supreme Court, when one would imagine there would be less pressure on him and less constitutional impediment placed upon him, he found that he could not assist the committee. That is a cause of disappointment to the committee, because we would have been able to advance greatly in the matters to which we sought to have answers by his full co-operation.</P>
    <P>The position of Mr. Kelly is unclear. He wanted further information about the nature of any inquiries before he would definitively agree or not to come before the committee. Mr. Quinlan, to his credit, has indicated from the beginning his willingness to assist the committee, and that should be acknowledged publicly. Mr. Quinlan sought to come before the committee. He sought to have questions in advance and to have legal representation but offered to appear in any event, even without such public notice, and that is something the committee appreciated greatly.</P>
    <P>It is in the public interest that the committee should be able to fulfil its stated objective of determining the lessons to be learned from this affair and making appropriate recommendations as to how to avoid a repetition of what occurred. However, the task of the committee has been made immeasurably more difficult by the lack of co-operation from the key parties involved. The people who are the potential beneficiaries of this Bill are those whose testimony would be crucial to finding the motivation behind the actions carried out.</P>
    <P>I accept there are constitutional problems with regard to any attempt to require judges to attend at Dáil committees or tribunals of inquiry to testify in regard to judicial functions. That is clearly not constitutionally permissible. However, it is arguable whether the actions taken in this case, certainly by Mr. Flaherty and Mr. Kelly, amounted to an exercise of judicial functions. There is nothing to prevent a judge or a former judge giving evidence or offering explanations in relation to matters which are not connected to judicial functions. That sensitivity was perfectly understood by the committee and we would have accepted charting a course that did not trespass on the absolute right of the Judiciary to make decisions without oversight by the Oireachtas or anybody else. That is a precious separation of powers that the Oireachtas has no right to trespass upon and no intention of so doing. At the same time, no fundamental pillar of our democracy &ndash; the Judiciary is one such pillar &ndash; can be without oversight and accountable to no one. <Col N="102" /> There must be a measure of accountability for actions, particularly actions which warrant the criticisms clearly stated in the report of the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>At the committee I argued that a tribunal of inquiry with a limited remit should be established to investigate the facts of this matter, notwithstanding the legal difficulties involved. I did not support the notion lightly of a new judicial inquiry under the Tribunals of Evidence Act. I am aware of the difficulties which would be implicit in such an inquiry, but unless we are to abandon our attempt to get nearer the truth, it is the best vehicle available to us. When I say this I am aware of the constitutional limitations and the difficulty for any inquiry to establish motivation &ndash; it is very difficult to establish. Facts can be got at but it is extremely difficult to reveal motivation. I felt, however, that Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty was anxious to tell his story. That was the impression from the beginning. Maybe he is still anxious to do that, and we should seek a mechanism which could fully ventilate that story.</P>
    <P>At the outset of this crisis we as politicians, arising from the level of public concern expressed about this issue, resolved collectively to get to the bottom of the story, but we have failed to do this so far. We know the circumstances in which Mr. Sheedy was released, but the question why remains unanswered. There are legal difficulties, but they are difficulties which we will have to resolve at some stage. Were we to decide not to establish a tribunal of inquiry solely because we would fear legal action or a constitutional challenge, as the events of the last year have proven, we would never establish one. Many of the tribunals established by this House have been tested in the courts subsequently.</P>
    <P>The only issue involved is whether we think the matters under investigation are sufficiently serious to warrant a tribunal of inquiry and if the reputation of the institution tarnished by the affair warrants getting to the bottom of the matter. Reluctantly I feel the answer to both those questions is yes. There is an obligation upon us to pursue this matter as far as we can. On balance, a public tribunal of inquiry is the best avenue open to us. The committee does not possess the expertise, time or skill to pursue the matter sufficiently. I referred to the onerous workload facing the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. By extension, the workload of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is equally onerous. The exchanges between the Minister and me in the course of the past hour underscore that.</P>
    <P>Given the response of the Chief Justice to the supplementary request of the committee, a response which is absolutely at odds with the Chief Justice's actions thus far, it is clear that no further assistance will be available from the quar<Col N="103" /> ter. It strikes me as an unfortunate short-term approach by the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>That correspondence is published but it would aid every Member if the full report and all the correspondence was available before Members spoke. That is why this side of the House worked hard to ensure it was published before this debate. Unfortunately, although the report is now concluded, the committee has not formally adopted it. It is due to do that at 4.45 p.m. and then it will be placed in the Library. The Deputy is right, Members are at a disadvantage in contributing to the debate before the full report of the committee is available. I regret that is the situation.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the issues of this case, the more fundamental issue &ndash; I am genuine when I say this &ndash; is that every pillar of our democracy must be accountable. It is clear that if there is a suspect action or a misdemeanour by a member of the Judiciary, the only sanction available to anyone in this State is the action under the Constitution of impeachment by this House. If something untoward outside the scope of this matter happened and the judicial figure involved resigned and could not, therefore, be the subject of a formal motion of impeachment in this House, there is no mechanism to investigate that matter because there are no constitutional avenues for us to travel. That is untenable in a democracy and this House has a responsibility to address it.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I have outlined, I support the reasoned tenor of Deputy Jim Higgins's amendment and I hope Members will reflect upon it before we vote.</P>

      <P>I wish to declare an interest in this matter. I have been a member of the Bar since 1961 and a member of the inner Bar since 1973. I am currently a Bencher at the Kings Inns. The Benchers of the Kings Inns have not discussed this matter in any way, but it is important that I make those declarations. Another declaration applies to all of us as Members of the Oireachtas under the Constitution. We are bound <Col N="104" /> by the terms of that Constitution and are bound to do nothing which might in any way cut across the separation of powers under that Constitution or the clear provisions of it.</P>
      <P>Having made those declarations, I want to refer to the terms of the amendment and the suggestions made by the Opposition about this Bill. The position being taken by the Opposition is in contravention of both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution in a number of respects. The Opposition has requested that the Minister make available to the House the advice of the Attorney General. In so doing it does not seem to be aware of the provisions of the Constitution in respect of the Attorney General. I will quote those provisions lest there be any doubt about his fundamental role and responsibility. Article 30 states: &ldquo;There shall be an Attorney General who shall be the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion, and shall exercise and perform all such powers, functions and duties as are conferred or imposed on him by this Constitution or by law.&rdquo; It goes on to state: &ldquo;That the Attorney General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach.&rdquo;  Note the terms. There shall be an Attorney General &ndash; that is not a matter of discretion in that he must be there. However, when he is there, he shall be the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion. That is the fundamental role of the Attorney General. He is accountable to and obliged only to advise the Government of the day. Implicit in that is that the Government of the day is obliged to act on his advice as the constitutional law officer under the Constitution. There is no discretion or hazy position in this area.</P>
      <P>It is as well when we address such issues in the House that we are very clear about our obligations. When the Opposition asks that the Attorney General's advice be made available to this House so it would have the information it requires before coming to a conclusion in terms of discharging its role, it is acting contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The separation of powers and the functions of the Oireachtas, the Executive <Col N="105" /> and the Judiciary are clearly set out in the Constitution. Every first year student of constitutional law is made aware of that, and I was made aware of it by a very distinguished former Member of this House, the late Paddy McGilligan SC. That is the most fundamental bulwark on which this Constitution and the exercise of our role is based. From that follow those conclusions I have been drawing.</P>
      <P>The Opposition wants the Minister to make available to the House the advice of the Attorney General before it will agree to support this legislation. It is doing that as a condition and is insisting that we create a precedent here &ndash; an obligation on Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it has been done, it is wrong. It was a mistake if it was done, but it would be very wrong if it was introduced as a condition here. It would be an even greater mistake if the Minister of the day responded to that precondition which would breach the role and relationship of the Attorney General and the Government and the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. It is important that, wherever our human interest, curiosity and concern may be, we recognise where our role begins and ends.</P>
      <P>I am not a member of the committee as are both Members who have spoken. They want to have this matter referred to the committee as a second bite. The terms of reference state very clearly:</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee, which shall be called the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights . be appointed to consider such</P>
      <P>(i) Bills the statute law in respect of which is dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Defence, and</P>
      <P>(ii) Estimates for Public Services within the aegis of those Departments.</P>
      <P>So far so good, but the next line is the important one and states: &ldquo;as shall be referred to it by Dáil Éireann from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been in this House perhaps more regularly than me but I am not aware that this Bill has been referred to that committee. Nonetheless, in the confusion generated by elected representatives, who do not seem to be aware of the limits and parameters of our role and function, they are insisting that this committee would be seized of the responsibility to look into this matter at this time when it has not been referred to it by the Dáil. Has the committee looked at its terms of reference? It wants more. It wants a former member of the Judiciary <Col N="106" /> to come before it to get to the end of the matter or to establish the facts beyond all doubt.</P>
    <P>I remember a similar event in respect of the beef tribunal. I was Minister for Agriculture at the time and remember all the statements made then. We wanted the full facts, the information to get to the bottom of the matter and to know everything which was required to be known once and for all. I had decided we should not have a beef tribunal and drafted my statement on that basis explaining the checks and counter checks &ndash; inadequate or unsatisfactory though they may have been &ndash; which we had in the Department, the Court of Auditors and the Commission. A short time before coming into the House, I was informed the Government would fall if we did not have a tribunal, which the Labour Party, Democratic Left and Fine Gael were demanding.</P>
    <P>A tribunal was to be the answer to all our problems. I had a few minutes to address that position. I was faced with the fact that the Government would fall if we did not have a tribunal, and I am sure we have been criticised in a subsequent general election for not being agreeable to a tribunal. I invite Members to read the three sentences I wrote, the only changes I made to the statement I had prepared. I said that lest it be suggested that the Government was attempting to conceal irregularities in the beef industry or was complicit in any such irregularities, we have reluctantly decided to accept this motion. I said we were reluctant because tribunals have a habit of turning out very differently from what people expect of them. I also said they last a great deal longer and cost a great deal more than one would expect.</P>
    <P>The people who called for a tribunal can face the consequences of the tribunal industry established as a result. I am even stronger in my conviction now, both as a member of the Bar and knowing the views of members of the Judiciary about tribunals. Will those who are suggesting a tribunal as a possible option learn from what we and the taxpayers have suffered as a consequence of what they demanded previously? Please dismiss the idea. I also ask the committee to look at its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The committee does not seem to know where its role begins and ends. The Chief Justice furnished the report but the Acting Chairman wrote to the Chief Justice asking him to revisit this area and to furnish the committee with a report. I have heard some strange requests in my time but this was a request to the Chief Justice to furnish the committee with a report, a committee which was not even seized of this matter under its terms of reference. Not surprisingly, the Chief Justice, or any Chief Justice for that matter, should write back and say he had completed all the inquiries open to him in connection with this matter and that his position was as stated in his letter. He said it was not a matter for him to advise &ndash; it <Col N="107" /> surely was not &ndash; or make any suggestions to the committee as to how it should proceed in this matter. We are looking at the frustration of certain individual elected representatives who, to use the jargon so often heard in the House, could not get to the bottom of it all. They wanted to know the full facts for once and for all &ndash; how often I have heard that phrase used during my 34 years in the House. In insisting that we know the full facts for once and for all we are turning our Constitution, our role and the terms of reference of the committee on its head.</P>
    <P>We may wish to know a little more from the human point of view, but we must recognise that we operate within constitutional constraints. In particular, the attempt to compromise the Attorney General by asking that the advice he is required to give to the Government be made available to the House is very dangerous. I hope we will never see a day when the advice of an Attorney General to Government is made available to the House. If Members want legal advice they should get it for themselves. Even those of us who are lawyers should seek advice from someone else &ndash; while I have a legal and constitutional view, I would not rely on it. There should be no breach of the Constitution, particularly in the context of the functions of the Attorney General and the Minister. If the Minister acceded to the request he would be outrageously breaching the Constitution. Fortunately, the Minister has no such intention or purpose.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed the cut and thrust of debate in the House over the years, which is part of the business of politics. However, we may be now seeing the residue of the initial assumption that what was involved in this case was what was termed &ldquo;the Cahirciveen connection&rdquo;. I recall the heated debate in the House. There were two people involved who happened to be from that small town in Kerry, namely, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the former justice, Mr. O'Flaherty. It would be extraordinary if both gentlemen, coming from the same community and both with legal backgrounds, did not know each other personally. I assume they knew each other and that nobody would suggest there is anything wrong in that. However, it is a tribute to both men that the so-called &ldquo;Cahirciveen connection&rdquo; did not exist, except in the festered minds of some people in the House, and that, even though they knew each other personally and must have met socially on many occasions, including at many of the events in Kerry in respect of which Mr. O'Flaherty was a patron, at no stage did they have contact with each other. This must be said in recognition of the sense they had of their separate responsibilities. Mr. O'Flaherty did request to come before the committee&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication A Strategy for Equality: Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> People with disabilities are the neglected citizens of Ireland. On the eve of the 21st century, many of them suffer intolerable conditions because of outdated social and economic policies and unthinking public attitudes. Changes have begun to come about, influenced by international recognition that disability is a social rather than a medical issue, but many of those changes have been piecemeal. Public attitudes towards disability are still based on charity rather than on rights, and the odds are stacked against people with disabilities at almost every turn. Whether their status is looked at in terms of economics, information, education, mobility or housing, they are treated as second class citizens.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that is the background and culture against which we discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>As I have said before in the House, people with physical, sensory or learning disabilities, those with a mental handicap, their families, advocates and carers have for far too long heard words like &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;integrate&rdquo;, &ldquo;empower&rdquo; and &ldquo;enable&rdquo;. What they have experienced and continue to experience is marginalisation and exclusion. There are many examples of this in relation to transport.</P>
    <P>Mr. John Doyle recently held a vigil outside the headquarters of CIE to protest about the lack of wheelchair accessible public transport. When interviewed on radio one morning he described how, in order to use public transport, he must be carried on to a bus or must be willing to crawl on to a bus. An order was placed recently for 150 new non-accessible buses. The fact that the buses are not accessible to wheelchair users was seen as almost incidental. The needs and rights of persons with a disability have, yet again, been overlooked.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises with taxis. It is evident that while the recently issued taxi licences were contingent on the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, there is no similar onus on the individual taxi owner or on taxi companies to use their accessible taxis to transport wheelchair users. How can people be empowered if they cannot get a taxi? How mainstream are they if they cannot travel down the main street or access public buildings?</P>
    <P>Vantastic was started by the Centre for Independent Living in late 1994 as a way of addressing in the short to medium term the lack of accessible public transport for the disabled. Eight vans operate in the greater Dublin area. It was run as a FÁS community employment scheme and the service continued until 9 June this year when it had to be suspended due to lack of funding. Up to 300 people were using the service in a variety of ways, some to go to work and some for social activities. In the absence of proper transport facilities for the disabled, a service such as this should have financial support from Government. As I have outlined, mainstream transport facili<Col N="110" /> ties are not accessible to the disabled and the attempts of Vantastic to establish a locally based service must surely be supported. It should be helped to develop strategic partners to deliver and develop the service.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues at present is the lack of transport facilities for disabled people that respond directly to their needs. This service was never meant to replace proper public transport for the disabled. However, it is clear that a variety of initiatives are needed and will continue to be needed if we are serious about actively including disabled people in our society. Supporting schemes such as Vantastic should surely form part of this. Other cities manage to supply door-to-door services. Why are we different and why have the commitments entered into some years ago not been implemented?</P>
    <P>Representatives of Vantastic met with the Taoiseach on 17 May 1999 and the Minister of State with responsibility for equality was also briefed on the issue. What has happened since those meetings? What Department has responsibility for this issue? I understand people are being sent from Department to Department and it is not clear that one Department will take responsibility for the development of the service.</P>

I ask the Minister to take this issue seriously, respond to the questions I raised and give an assurance to the people involved in supplying this service, particularly in view of the overall lack of service for the disabled.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Fitzgerald on raising this urgent matter. The Vantastic scheme was established to provide a specialised transport service for people with disabilities. I understand that the scheme involves the use of eight vans to provide transport to work, training and education for about 300 people. It has recently been suspended due to financial difficulties. In 1995 the project received a national lottery grant through the then Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise recently met Transport for All to discuss a range of issues relating to access to transport for mobility impaired and disabled people. One of the matters raised briefly during that meeting was the current financial difficulties of the Vantastic project. The <Col N="111" /> Minister made it clear that she had no statutory responsibility for the project, but indicated that she was sympathetic to such a service and would raise the matter with her Government colleagues.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the meeting the Minister asked her Department to obtain further information on the Vantastic project and its current financial difficulties. She will shortly be discussing the matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, who has special responsibility for disability issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we have been talking about a light rail system for Dublin for more than ten years and we have yet to see a metre of rail laid or a single tram acquired, it is not surprising that public scepticism among the people of the city and county has increased significantly, with more and more people doubting that the project will ever go ahead. The bungling, delays, rejection of consultants' reports and U-turns which have been such a feature of the Government's handling of the issue have increased public scepticism against the background of a traffic problem of such magnitude that it is no exaggeration to say that the city and county are in danger of grinding to a halt.</P>
      <P>It is a year since the Government decided to reject the consultants' report favouring the overground option and we still do not know if it will be technically feasible to put in place an underground section. Even if all targets are met, it will still be the best part of five years before any light rail system will be operational in the city. It is clear that we cannot allow the traffic situation to continue to deteriorate until light rail is available. Urgent remedial action is now required.</P>
      <P>While the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has been dithering, week by week the situation has been getting worse. Traffic congestion that was once the norm for an hour at peak time in the morning and evening is now experienced throughout the day. Even on relatively short journeys at peak time there are now delays of epic proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to dealing with the traffic problems in the short term rests with the proper development of the bus service. Bus services will remain the only public transport option for the vast majority of Dublin people for the foreseeable future, but contrary to the public perception the level of subvention for Dublin Bus, at about 3.8p per passenger journey, remains one of the lowest for any similar sized city in Europe. Much of the Dublin Bus fleet of vehicles are clapped out, mechanically unreliable and unpleasant to travel in. A sum of £30 million, less than the cost of one underground station, would allow Dublin Bus to <Col N="112" /> acquire about 175 additional buses, which would make a huge difference to the quality of public transport in the city and county.</P>
    <P>The combination of poor service, relatively high fares and chronic traffic problems is forcing more and more people away from public transport and into their cars. This, in turn, worsens the traffic problem, further slows down the buses and particularly inconveniences people who have no alternative to public transport. The vicious circle must be broken.</P>
    <P>The pricing and ticketing policy of Dublin Bus must be looked at. This is an integral part of any solution to Dublin's traffic problems. It is not good enough for the Minister to wash her hands of this issue. Every time a parliamentary question is tabled on this issue, the Minister tells us that ticketing and pricing are matters for Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason buses are so slow is that boarding is very slow. This is because most people are still using cash rather than prepaid tickets. When prepaid tickets were first introduced there was a substantial incentive to buy them. A ten journey ticket of £1 fares could be bought for £8, which involved a substantial saving, but the economic incentive has been gradually whittled away and there is now no saving to be made from buying a prepaid ticket. This is crazy.</P>
    <P>The social and economic costs of crawling traffic and congested streets are well known. The solution requires an efficient public transport system with economical fares. This cannot be achieved on the level of subvention currently provided for Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>Last year new car registrations in Dublin reached a record level of 62,000. The city just cannot continue to absorb this number of new cars. We will have to consider introducing disincentives to discourage people from bringing cars into the city centre, but this can only reasonably be done when there is a reliable, efficient and economic public transport system. Unless we set about ensuring this now rather than wait for Luas, the situation will undoubtedly continue to get worse.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take responsibility for her job. She is charged with ensuring that Dublin has a proper public transport system that works. At the moment it does not work. The quality of life for people living and working in the city is being seriously undermined because of traffic congestion and the lack of public transport. The cost of doing business is increasing continually. I call on the Minister to take charge, to do her job and ensure that a proper level of subvention is provided for Dublin Bus to enable it to provide an adequate service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this important matter. The Government is committed to the integrated development of public transport in Dublin. We are determined to ensure <Col N="113" /> the ongoing improvement in bus and rail services and we are making real progress in the implementation of the enhanced light rail system. This is not a vague aspiration but one which has been clearly articulated and is being steadily implemented with the support of Exchequer and EU funding. For the first time Exchequer funding is being provided directly for specific projects such as bus purchases and railway development. Direct Exchequer support will continue.</P>
      <P>The bus service is the backbone of the public transport system. Quality bus corridors have been introduced and more will be completed over the coming years to enhance the priority, speed, reliability and overall quality of service which buses can provide on key routes in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>To ensure that adequate capacity is provided on these and other routes, approval has already been given for the acquisition by Bus Átha Cliath of 150 additional buses. Already almost 60 of these buses have been delivered, with the remainder being delivered in phases throughout the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Exchequer and EU funding is being provided to speed up the introduction of accessible buses. Trials on low floor double deck buses are scheduled to start next month. I expect that the company will be in a position to start ordering only low floor vehicles from next year.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that investment to date and the proposals for future development are being undertaken against a background of co-ordinated and detailed planning. The Dublin Transportation Office will shortly be making recommendations on its blueprint for the next few years. This will take particular account of the strategic planning guidelines and, in relation to bus services, is expected to include measures such as a substantial increase in the bus fleet, further development of quality bus corridors and improved bus priority, the introduction of a wider range of orbital routes which will cross the existing orbital routes and provide a better web of services matching customers' travel requirements and the provision of more local and feeder services.</P>
      <P>In addition to bus services, major investment has taken place in DART and suburban rail. Infrastructural works to extend the DART service to Greystones and Malahide are almost complete and the Maynooth line is being upgraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most significant actions taken by the Government was its decision to proceed with an extended and enhanced light rail network. Rapid progress has been made in getting the necessary authorisations to enable construction work to commence. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, signed the order for the Tallaght to Abbey Street section and CIE has placed an order for the 20 trams <Col N="114" /> needed for this route. The full cost of these trams is being met from Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>In addition to Exchequer funding for investment, Exchequer funding is also made available to CIE for the provision of socially necessary or desirable public transport services which cannot be provided on a commercial basis. The allocation of the subvention to the individual operating subsidiaries within the CIE group is currently a matter for the board of CIE. The allocation this year to Bus Átha Cliath is £9.244 million, an increase on the 1998 figure of £8.895 million. The subvention to Bus Átha Cliath enables the company to maintain, and in some cases expand, its services to cope with the increasing public transport demand and, thereby, give people an alternative to using private transport. My Department has been in negotiation for some time with CIE for the introduction of public service contracts as a replacement for the annual lump sum Exchequer subvention to CIE.</P>
    <P>The Bus Átha Cliath contract will detail the quantity and quality of public transport services to be provided in the greater Dublin area for which the State will make a specific payment. The contract approach will provide for a direct link between Exchequer payments and the services to be provided by the individual companies in return. They will also set out clear performance standards in respect of these services and allow for performance measurement. It is envisaged that the new system, with an emphasis on the delivery of quantifiable output, will facilitate and encourage better performance by the companies. It is expected that the negotiations on the contracts will soon be completed and the contracts brought into operation this year.</P>
    <P>While a great deal has been achieved in recent years, much more remains to be done. Identifying the capacity requirements and securing the funding needed to achieve them are only part of what must be undertaken. Substantial amounts of money need to be invested and we need to ensure that we achieve maximum benefit from these investments. It must be done in a planned and co-ordinated way. We are, therefore, continuing to plan for the future.</P>
    <P>Significant effort has gone into planning for the future. This Government can be relied on to provide a properly planned and co-ordinated response to the transport challenges in our major urban areas. We will set out a clear strategy to address these problems in the forthcoming national development plan. In doing so we will take into account proposals from agencies, such as the DTO, and the recommendations contained in the strategic planning guidelines. Our record to date shows that we are committed to investment in our transport system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent announcement that 504 people, comprising 421 males and 83 females, suffered death by suicide last year represents an increase of 16 per cent on the 1997 figure. In the past five years there has been an unprecedented increase of 43 per cent in the levels of suicide. A total of 257 of those who died through suicide last year were under the age of 35. An increase in the levels of suicide is not just a serious issue; it is a crisis and action must be taken. The Minister must, as a matter of urgency, introduce in full the recommendations of the National Task Force on Suicide, which were published in January of 1998.</P>
      <P>While health boards have commenced structures to examine the situation and research is continuing the overall thrust of the report is not being implemented. The Minister and the Government should not delay any further the introduction of the recommendations of the task force. There is a serious failure in the Government on this issue. It is not acceptable that this serious public health issue is not being addressed.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the task force was the provision of an extensive network of community-based psychiatric services, bringing specialised, multidisciplinary psychiatric services within the reach and accessibility of all citizens and referral agencies so that psychiatric services would be readily available and acceptable to all. It was the view of the task force that this would lead to more frequent and earlier referral of potential suicidal patients and enable them to receive earlier and more effective treatment.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science announced that programmes would be introduced in second level schools in relation to positive mental health issues, including coping strategies and basic information about positive mental health. The task force recommended that this be introduced at an early stage as a natural part of children's health care curriculum. Nothing has been done to facilitate this. The task force asked that guidance counsellors be available to all schools and this has not happened.</P>

    <P>The National Task Force on Suicide made 79 recommendations. Perhaps the Minister will outline to the House in his reply the number of recommendations which have been fully implemented in the 18 months since the report was published. Suicide is the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year old males. The increase in youth suicides is particularly serious when measured against the &ldquo;years of potential life lost&rdquo; factor. The ratio of 421 males or 83.5 per cent to 83 females or 16.5 per cent in 1998 gives a gender ratio of 5.1 males to one female. These figures demonstrate that suicide in recent decades has been primarily a male phenomenon. <Col N="116" /> There has also been a significant increase in the rate of suicides in older men aged 65 and over.</P>
    <P>Suicide is a major social problem and is a potentially preventable form of mortality. However, no specific intervention has been found to be universally effective due to the lack of knowledge or consensus regarding the natural history of causation of suicide, the contributing factors most amenable to preventative effort and the most appropriate target of the population.</P>
    <P>The task force acknowledged that preventative approaches must involve all sectors of society and a multiplicity of interrelated activities and responses, and suggested that it was on this basis that the possibility of solutions to the suicide problem would evolve. Preventing suicide means influencing in a corrective and constructive way the process of problem development and the individual's own resources at different phases of life. Suicide prevention includes a range of activities aimed at influencing the factors and events which may otherwise culminate in suicide.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in conjunction with the health boards, should immediately introduce action plans which would include teaching individuals to manage their own lives while offering alternatives and support when needed; preventing the circumstances, factors and interactions which lead to problems; and preventing problems from worsening and becoming insurmountable.</P>
    <P>The issue of creating awareness about suicide, suicide prevention and access to information and services should be available to all members of society and, particularly, to specific groups, especially those at risk. Each health board should create an awareness of issues relating to suicide and para-suicide by issuing a leaflet to every household in each health board region, which would include details of suicide and para-suicide, services, accountability and availability of a help line. The help line should be operated by the Samaritans. Public information points should be available, which should be easily accessible. The public information point should include a comprehensive range of information on health services availability.</P>
    <P>An immediate campaign should be undertaken, which would include input from key organisations and personnel. A public poster display should be introduced by the Minister with visual images, which would include a help line number. Each health board should make the Samaritans's number available on a wallet size card at universities, schools, regional technical colleges, social welfare offices, post offices, community welfare offices and youth clubs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter, which is also close to my own heart. The report of the National Task Force on Suicide, which was published in February 1998 put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities. Since the publication of the report my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has been in contact with his ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government with a view to implementing the task force's recommendations in so far as those Departments are concerned. The Department of Health and Children has also contacted all other statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requesting the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent suicide and attempted suicide. The group was established last year and has met on several occasions. Arising from its deliberations so far, it is intended to appoint a research co-ordinator with secretarial facilities and the necessary funds have been provided to allow this important work to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers and have established multisectoral and multidisciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the report. They are engaged in a range of activities, including the promotion of positive mental health and the destigmatisation of suicide; provision of information in relation to suicide and para-suicide; liaison with the media; and provision of training requirements for staff in relation to suicide and para-suicide. The process of consultation with statutory and voluntary groups on the issue <Col N="118" /> of suicide has also commenced in many health board areas.</P>
    <P>The task force identified groups at particular risk of suicide and recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public and, in particular, to our young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide among older people. The Minister for Health and Children has provided additional resources to further develop child and adolescent psychiatric services and mental health services for older people during 1999 which will assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment for individuals at risk. The Minister for Health and Children is fully committed to implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the National Task Force on Suicide.</P>

      <P>Scoil Eoin is an outstanding primary school in the parish of Foxfield-St. John in Kilbarrack which is deemed a vulnerable area in terms of economic deprivation and high levels of unemployment, a central feature of the Northside Partnership area. Although I have raised the matter with the Minister for Education and Science and his predecessor, the school has failed to gain disadvantaged status and, as a consequence, extra specialist teachers, unlike the adjacent Gaelscoil, Gaelscoil Míde, and multidenominational school, North Bay, both of which are excellent primary schools and where perhaps parents are more committed.</P>
      <P>Unbelievably, about half of the school yard, 1.018 acres, is to be sold off to Dublin Corporation for social housing development. In the recent local elections there was a major demonstration by several hundred people who are outraged at the proposed sale. In a press release, the demonstrators, who included the staff and parents, indicated that while they were not opposed to housing, this should not be at the expense of the pupils. They referred to the proposed sale as a form of asset stripping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by Dublin Corporation that the contract which it has signed has not been returned by the St. Laurence O'Toole Diocesan Trust. While I appreciate that it is the religious authorities which have initiated this process, the Minister for Education and Science should not allow the proposed sale to go through without comment. I call on him to act immediately in the interests of this deprived community. Foxfield-St. John is the parish of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, who has expressed concern at this development. Given that this brilliant school has not been given the disadvantaged status and specialist teachers it <Col N="119" /> deserves, the least we should do is ensure its playground remains untouched.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining the situation regarding the school property at Scoil Eoin, Kilbarrack, Dublin 5. Let me provide some background information on the case. The existing school site is not owned by the Department of Education and Science and no State funding of any kind went towards its purchase. The St. Laurence O'Toole Diocesan Trust has legal ownership of the site. The Department would have provided a substantial proportion of the funding for the construction of the school buildings at Scoil Eoin.</P>
      <P>To protect the State's investment in the buildings, there is a vesting arrangement in respect of the site which requires the consent of the Minister for Education and Science to a disposal of land. If the owners wish to dispose of any part of the vested site, the Department examines the situation from the point of view of the school's current and future requirements and if it is satisfied that these are not adversely affected, approval is given. The circumstances whereby the Department may refuse approval to devest part of a site relate solely to the protection of the State's investment in the buildings and the normal requirements of a primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1996 the solicitors for the St. Laurence O'Toole Diocesan Trust &ndash; parish of Foxfield applied to the Department to have a portion of the school site formally devested as it wished to sell it to Fingal County Council for social housing development. The Department wrote to the school inspector outlining the situation and asking him to report on the matter and ascertain if the piece of land in question was <Col N="120" /> necessary for the effective operation of the school and if there were any buildings located on the site in question.</P>
    <P>In December 1996 the inspector submitted a report to the Department on the matter in which he indicated that the enrolment at the school had dropped from 970 in the 1977-78 school year to 320 in 1996, despite having amalgamated with the girls' school in the interim. The inspector sought the opinion of the then principal and vice-principal who stated that the remaining play area, following the proposed devesting, would be adequate for the 320 pupils on the roll. It was also their opinion that the enrolment figures were likely to remain static and would not increase for the foreseeable future. Enrolments at the school in September 1998 had declined to 287 pupils.</P>
    <P>Based on the information to hand, the Department determined that there were no grounds for objecting to the devesting of the site in question which amounted to some 1.25 acres. A stipulation was, however, made as part of the agreement that a suitable perimeter fence in keeping with the existing fence should be erected along part of the boundary. The deeds of surrender were executed in the Department and returned to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in June 1997. The current status of the sale of the property is not a matter for the Department.</P>
    <P>It has since come to the Department's attention that the area agreed for sale was reduced to one acre leaving a site of some 3.22 acres remaining to the school. This is in excess of the area of 2.5 acres which the Department considers necessary for a school of approximately 290 pupils. In these circumstances there can be no question of the Department intervening to prevent the sale of land it does not own.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 June 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>As I announced yesterday, 23 June 1999, these reliefs will come into operation shortly following EU Commission clearance. The tax incentives in question are accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial or industrial buildings.</P>
      <P>The tax incentives for the rural renewal scheme were legislated for in the 1998 Finance Act. The residential incentives in the scheme were commenced on 1 June 1998 in the case of rented accommodation and on 6 April 1999 in the case of owner-occupied accommodation. The delay in bringing the business tax incentives of the scheme into operation until now was due to the need to clear these under the State aid rules with the European Commission. Because of the longer than expected negotiations and the resultant delay in commencement it is proposed to extend the termination date for the scheme to 31 December 2002 for both the residential and business tax incentives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the business tax incentives available under the scheme, the capital allowances will <Col N="122" /> apply for qualifying expenditure incurred in the period from 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2002. The year one capital allowances will be 50 per cent for both owner-occupiers and lessors of the buildings constructed or refurbished under the scheme, with the remaining 50 per cent being written off at 4 per cent per annum over the next 13 years. The necessary commencement order will be made as soon as possible and the other necessary legislative changes will be included in the next Finance Bill with retrospective effect to 1 July 1999.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission opposed the granting of double rent and rates reliefs for this and other schemes as originally intended. Consequently, the 1998 Urban Renewal Act has already provided for a doubling of the capital allowances for commercial buildings from 50 per cent to 100 per cent for both the rural renewal and the new urban renewal schemes. The position therefore is that neither double rent relief nor rates relief will apply under the scheme. However, it should be pointed out that the doubling of the capital allowances from 50 per cent to 100 per cent for commercial buildings will serve as a major replacement incentive and will be particularly important for owner-occupied businesses which is the main type of firm in the area concerned.</P>

I will not be extending this scheme beyond that date as it has fulfilled its purpose by encouraging a large volume of investment in the 15 designated seaside areas. While no firm estimates of the tax cost are available, it is provisionally estimated at present that the tax cost could eventually be of the order of £200 million or more. However, this figure may have to be revised significantly as more developments are completed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, provision was made in section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999 for the granting of relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students. The relief covers three categories of expenditure-construction, conversion and refurbishment. The relief gives a deduction of 100 per cent of qualifying expenditure which is offset against all rental income whether derived from the premises in question or from other lettings. The relief will be available for expenditure incurred in the four year period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2003.</P>
      <P>To qualify for this relief, each project must be certified by the relevant educational institution in accordance with guidelines recently issued by the Department of Education and Science, with my consent. These guidelines were compiled by the Department of Education and Science after consultation with my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, third level institutions and the Revenue Commissioners. They are intended to assist developers and designers in formulating proposals for student residential developments. They were designed to allow some flexibility in choice of location having regard to constraints in the availability of suitable development sites at or near campus. Under the guidelines a qualifying area is defined as being within the campus area of the educational institution or an area, within an eight kilometre radius of the main campus, which is approved by the certifying educational institution as being an area within which a qualifying development may take place.</P>
      <P>While the scheme has been introduced only recently, I can inform the Deputy that in the month that has elapsed since the guidelines were issued, both my Department and the Department of Education and Science report a significant level of interest in this scheme from developers and third level institutions. However the next steps of planning, developing and constructing suitable accommodation facilities for students are in the hands of private developers and educational institutions. Therefore, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is much too early in the process for the requested details to be available, since any developments availing of the scheme are likely to be only at planning or pre-planning stage. Taking up the Deputy's point, I will consult with the Minister for Education and Science to see that the existence of the scheme is drawn to the attention of those who might avail of it.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the reliefs in respect of income tax or corporation tax provided by section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and in respect of capital acquisitions tax provided by section 39 of the Finance Act, 1978. A determination for the purposes of relief under section 482 also secured exemption for individual taxpayers from all the requirements of the residential property tax, including the requirement to make a return, for all years when the tax was in force.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics in respect of the amount of income tax, corporation and residential property tax foregone under section 482 are not available in a manner which would enable a soundly based estimate of the costs of these reliefs. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the number of properties involved is small as only 118 determinations have been made by Revenue since the relief was introduced in 1982. I have been further advised that the volume of capital acquisitions tax foregone under section 39 of the Finance Act, 1978, in the period 1994-98 was £181,800. Prior to 1994, records in relation to section 39 were not maintained in a manner which would allow easy access to the specific information required.</P>
      <P>Taxpayers are entitled to claim relief under section 482 when they have received determinations from both the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Revenue Commissioners. The determination to be made by that Minister is that the building is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and the Revenue has to determine that the building either affords reasonable access to the public or is in use as a tourist accommodation facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has advised me that determinations are made by her under section 482 on the basis of an inspection of the building usually carried <Col N="125" /> out by an architect. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they subject such cases to detailed examination before making a determination in respect of reasonable access. The availability of reasonable access on an ongoing basis is subject to examination under Revenue's audit programme and within the past two years Revenue has initiated a specific programme of audit inspections of these buildings.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I have been advised that, before making a determination under section 39 of the Finance Act, 1978, in relation to capital acquisitions tax, the Revenue Commissioners seek written confirmation that the conditions for granting the relief are fully satisfied and also monitor public access by means of inspections under the specific capital acquisitions tax audit programme.</P>
    <P>In general, on the basis of the information available to me I am satisfied that the legislation has been operating in accordance with the intention of the Oireachtas and has provided important assistance to the preservation of stately homes and to allowing public access to them.</P>

      <P>According to the most recent national accounts data published by the Central Statistics Office, which relate to 1997, gross domestic product is estimated to be £48.241 billion compared with gross national product of £41.919 billion, a difference of £6.322 billion or 13 per cent of GDP. This compares to a gap of £2.796 billion in 1991 which amounted to 9.9 per cent of GDP. For 1997 most of this difference relates to the profits of multinational companies operating in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The foreign-owned sector has made a significant contribution to the economy's transformation over the last 30 years and to the exceptional performance of recent years. According to the IDA's annual report for 1998, there were 1,140 overseas companies in Ireland directly employing over 116,000 people. Adding to this total the indirect employment generated by these companies, it is clear that the foreign-owned sector is crucial to the economy. In addition, many of these companies are operating in high-growth sectors where the potential exists for continued strong growth in output and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the increase in the gap between GDP and GNP is an indication of the success of Ireland's industrial policy in attracting foreign direct investment. It also reflects the strength of the economy's international competitiveness which has been an important factor behind the strong growth of recent years. Maintaining this successful policy is a key challenge over the <Col N="126" /> medium term.

      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997 to apply parity with a floor of 3 per cent to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Initially, there were difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines should be applied to certain groups of pensioners, particularly in the local authority and health board areas. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department along with other Departments made every effort to ensure public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>The issues now being pursued by certain pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy. For example, some pensioners want personal long service increments paid to certain serving staff under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel. My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale. This was one of the key criteria set out in the guidelines issued to Departments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 29, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Work on preparing the national development plan has intensified in recent weeks. I expect to be in a position shortly to put a comprehensive set of proposals to the Government in relation to NDP priorities and investment.</P>
      <P>The EU Structural Fund regulations were adopted by the General Affairs Council on 21 June last. The Government will accordingly have until mid-October to submit the NDP to the European Commission. However, it is the aim of the Government to publish the plan and submit it to the Commission before this deadline.</P>
      <P>The consultation process involved in the drawing up of the national development plan has been extensive. Written submissions have been received from the regional authorities, the social partners and Government Departments. Meetings to discuss these submissions and the views of the various interests on the plan have been held at both official and ministerial level. A number of informal meetings have also been held at official level with the European Commission.</P>
      <P>My Department organised a seminar on 13 May last involving a wide array of interests to hear presentations on, and to discuss priorities for, the national development plan. In addition, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and I held further consultations on the plan with each of the four social partner pillars towards the end of May. Deputies and Senators were also given an opportunity to highlight the areas that the national development plan should address when I addressed and answered questions from the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, on 1 June, in connection with the NDP.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach recently attended a function organised by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland's west region in Dublin on 1 June, where he was presented with their west economic development plan for the years 2000-06. The plan has been forwarded to my Department and it will be fully considered in the context of the preparation of the NDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the continued existence and funding of many of the partnership organisations, these organisations and groups will generally continue to receive funding into 2000 for eligible expenditure which they have incurred under the current programmes. The Government has indicated its commitment to addressing urban and rural poverty black spots in the new NDP and those groups which are successful in the delivery <Col N="128" /> of programmes in these areas under the current plan should have a role in the next plan. No specific commitments can, however, be given to individual groups in respect of the next round of programmes at this stage in advance of a Government decision on the NDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cologne European Council took place on 3 and 4 June 1999. The Taoiseach, with whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I attended the Council, gave a detailed statement on the European Council to the House on 15 June 1999.</P>
      <P>Finance Ministers attended the working sessions of the Council on 3 June 1999. The items of most relevance to them were the European employment pact, the broad economic policy guidelines and taxation.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has informed the House, the promotion of economic growth and the creation of jobs at EU level remain a particular priorities for all member states. In this context the summit agreed an employment pact. The pact, which was jointly developed within the ECOFIN and Social Affairs Councils, is concerned with developing a new macro-economic policy dialogue between the social partners, fiscal and employment policy makers, and monetary policy makers. To achieve this goal, the pact provides for twice yearly meetings between Finance and Social Affairs Ministers, the social partners, and the European Central Bank. It will complement the enhanced implementation of the employment strategy agreed in Luxembourg and the process of improving the competitiveness and functioning of markets for goods, services and capital agreed in Cardiff. I have always been supportive of the development of the employment pact at the ECOFIN Council, and I believe it will make a worthwhile contribution, especially through the inclusion of European social partners, in the policy debate at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council also considered, and recommended the adoption of, the broad economic policy guidelines which had been discussed at some length at ECOFIN prior to their submission to the Heads of State or Government. The guidelines identify a co-ordinated mix of macro-economic policies in the context of the stability and growth pact, and wide ranging liberalisation of product, capital and labour markets as key elements to boost competitiveness so as to increase economic and employment growth. I welcome the economic policy recommendations laid down in the 1999 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. I regard the annual preparation of the guidelines, as required by the treaty, as a very useful framework within which to discuss, and focus attention on, the key policy measures <Col N="129" /> needed to boost sustainable economic and employment growth within the Community.</P>
    <P>The European Council also noted the second report from ECOFIN on tax policy co-operation, which sets out progress on tax issues such as the code of conduct on business tax and invited a third report bringing the discussions on these tax issues to a conclusion for Helsinki. One of the issues covered in the report is energy tax. Ireland has not supported Commission proposals for higher taxes on energy because of the possible effects on competitiveness and price stability. I do acknowledge, however, that we need to consider what measures are required in order to achieve the commitments on emissions which we undertook at Kyoto.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the Taoiseach has informed the House, the issue of the continuation of duty free was raised at Cologne. Ireland, along with a number of other member states, strongly supported the extension of the duty free regime.  However, in the face of strong opposition from other member states, especially Denmark, it was not possible to achieve the unanimity required for an extension.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the proposals for the introduction of a Tobin tax which have been made by the association referred to by the Deputy in his question. The Tobin tax seeks to impose a world wide tax on all foreign exchange transactions to reduce exchange rate volatility and to raise revenue to support international development.</P>
      <P>While one can acknowledge the motives of those seeking to impose such a tax, the majority of expert opinion appears to be that the proposed tax suffers from severe pragmatic flaws, primarily due to enforcement problems. Whatever the theoretical merits of the tax, and there is some debate on that, a Tobin tax would require global co-operation.  Otherwise, foreign exchange business would gravitate quickly to any country that did not enforce the tax. In this light, the probability of every country in the world applying such a tax, or of one country applying it unilaterally must be open to question.</P>

      <P>I am considering the subsequent use of the proceeds in the context of the Government's budgetary objectives as set out in the Stability Programme 1999 to 2001 which was published on budget day. These objectives are to reduce further the debt burden and to prepare the public finances for longer-term demographic and other challenges.</P>
      <P>Reducing the debt burden will lead to lower debt servicing costs in future years and will release resources for more productive purposes including much needed infrastructural development, continued tax reform and improvements in public services.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together. In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis of the treatment of married persons for tax purposes derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v. </i>the Attorney General, <Col N="131" /> 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances including those outlined in this question. An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. This group is due to report later this year.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a number of commitments in relation to income tax. In my budget speech last December, I restated the Government's commitment to deliver, over the five budgets of this Government, the tax proposals as agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &ndash; which are aimed at reducing the burden of personal taxation to reward effort and improve the incentives to work. I also stated my view that high tax rates in many areas of taxation &ndash; personal, corporation, capital, inheritance &ndash; lead to disincentives, evasion and finally less yield to the Exchequer, constraining, Government in implementing socially progressive policies.</P>
      <P>The precise shape of the income tax package to be included in next year's budget will be considered in the period leading up to the budget.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Price Index for May showed an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent compared to 1.4 per cent for the previous month. Excluding mortgage interest effects, inflation rose to 2.6 per cent in May from 2.3 per cent in April. The year-on-year increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices stood at 2.3 per cent in May compared with 2.0 per cent in April. The most notable price changes in the year to May, were in services and related expenditure (+4.3 per cent), food (+3.1 per cent), tobacco (+3.3 per cent), housing (-10.7 per cent) and clothing and footwear (-6.5 per cent).</P>
      <P>Reflecting the recent rise in international oil prices and changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate, transport (+0.9 per cent) and light and fuel (+0.6 per cent) showed large monthly increases in May. Alcoholic drinks showed a monthly increase of +1.5 per cent, reflecting a recent general rise in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prospects for the rest of the year are dependent on a number of factors. On the negative side inflation in the services sector is running at over 4 per cent on a year to year basis. This is a cause for concern and indicates the existence of dom<Col N="133" /> estic inflationary pressures. International commodity prices, which have been very low until recently, are also increasing modestly with the prospect of further increases in the months ahead. In addition, as the large falls in mortgage rates at the end of last year fall out of the year-on-year comparison, this will see the headline CPI increase towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, food prices should put downward pressure on the CPI. Last autumn, food prices rose sharply reflecting supply problems. These price increases are unlikely to be repeated this year.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year the euro has fallen by about 7.6 per cent against sterling and by 11.3 per cent against the dollar. Although not strongly in evidence to date, imported inflation could become a factor if the present parities were sustained, in view of Ireland's substantial dependence on international trade. The degree to which this might occur is, of course, critically dependent on the pricing response of UK suppliers, in particular, to the evolution of the euro-sterling parity. Overall it is forecast that the CPI will increase over the course of the year but the average for the year as a whole is likely to be lower than the budget day forecast of 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my officials have communicated with the Economic Policy Committee or the European Central Bank on the effects of the recent depreciation of the euro on Irish inflation.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, my Department forecast an Exchequer surplus of £925 million for 1999 on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of specific factors have since had an impact on this target. The actual 1998 outturn for tax was £36 million higher than expected. This additional buoyancy is expected to carry into the 1999 Exchequer surplus. A total of £160 million has been received by the Exchequer for the Telecom Éireann employee share ownership programme which had not been included in the budget day arithmetic. This figure will have an impact on the Exchequer surplus. The proceeds <Col N="134" /> of the Telecom Éireann flotation will increase the Exchequer surplus.</P>
    <P>As usual, I will review the trend in revenue and expenditure over the first half of the year and will issue a detailed statement on the Exchequer returns at the end of the second quarter.</P>
    <P>This year's Exchequer surplus will reduce further debt servicing costs by reducing the national debt. This will release resources for more productive purposes in future years, including improvement in public services, continued tax reform and infrastructural development. In this way it will help to offset the reduction in EU transfers which is in prospect &ndash; a reduction which will increase the net burden on the budget of a range of capital and current expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>Looking further ahead, there is need, also, to prepare for the less favourable budgetary position which will face us in the future when, demographic trends indicate, the proportion of older people in the population will increase and economic growth will slow.</P>
    <P>The Government will also consider shortly the National Development Plan for the period 2000-06.</P>
    <P>The stability and growth pact commits the Government to a budget which is close to balance or in surplus over the full economic cycle.

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the view that the disclosure regulations will result in fewer insurance and pension policies being sold with less advice in view of the fact brokers will lose out to direct product producers; and the plans, if any, she has for further discussions with financial consultants on new life assurance disclosure regulations. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft life assurance disclosure regulations are currently undergoing legal drafting in the parliamentary draftsman's office. They will be based on a specific enabling provision in the insurance Bill, 1999 which is due to be published later this year.</P>
      <P>The essential rationale behind the proposals is to rectify the failure within the market as a whole to provide adequate information to the consumer in the marketing and selling of life assurance products and, as a by-product, to generate more competition among suppliers of insurance. The introduction of similar disclosure provisions in the UK in 1995 resulted in a significant increase in market share for the independent insurance intermediary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The up to date situation with regard to the draft life assurance disclosure regulations remains fundamentally unchanged from my comprehensive responses to Dáil questions recently. The whole thrust of the regulations and the support<Col N="136" /> ing actuarial guidance notes is to ensure, as far as is practicable, a level playing field between different distribution channels, irrespective of whether institutional or individual.</P>
    <P>The achievement of equivalent disclosure across all suppliers is an extremely difficult concept. Nevertheless, the draft regulations provide that, the insurer shall, in determining illustrations of prospective benefits, expenses, costs, charges and intermediary and sales remuneration, through the appointed actuary, take all reasonable steps to ensure that the illustrations are not misleading and are presented in a fair and clear manner.</P>
    <P>Currently, there is no mechanism for uncovering the insurers in-house expenses and charges nor remuneration levels to salespeople, all of which impact on the cost of life assurance products and investment returns. On the other hand, it should be possible, on request, to discover the proportion of premium attributable to insurance intermediaries commission. The disclosure regulations will provide for mandatory disclosure, for the first time, of insurers expenses and charges including management fees and an element which represents the cost of emoluments and other payments, benefits and services in the case of salespersons which are equivalent to insurance intermediaries remuneration. The guidance notes produced by the Society of Actuaries in consultation with the Department, which will accompany the disclosure regulations, have identified such elements on a commission equivalent basis so as to avoid unfairly discriminating against <Col N="137" /> the disclosure requirements for brokers and other insurance intermediaries. All of the interested representative bodies and parties have been furnished with the draft actuarial guidance notes which will accompany the final regulations and have been given the opportunity to make submissions on their content. The Society of Actuaries in consultation with my Department, is considering all of the observations received which will be taken into account before enacting the regulations, particularly in regard to strengthening the principle of equivalence.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is designed specifically to target a particularly severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means tested payments. In addition, social welfare recipients with an adult dependant can swap their social welfare entitlement with their spouse or partner in order for that person to qualify for CE.</P>
      <P>These are the persons who are at most disadvantage in accessing jobs in the open labour market and this targeting maximises the availability of places on CE by part financing the programme from savings in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>With regard to specific provision for women who wish to return to work following an extended absence from the labour market, FÁS provides return to work courses. This programme helps participants to develop the confidence necessary to re-enter the labour force and is also an important bridging programme for progression into employment or to other FÁS programmes. The programme is delivered on a part-time basis within local communities and 1,065 women completed return to work courses in 1998.</P>
      <P>Many women do not undertake return to work training, instead they move directly into specific skills training programmes and into enterprise training programmes and from there into employment or self-employment. Anyone seeking a job or a suitable training programme can avail of the FÁS placement service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working group, representative of the social partners is currently considering the issue of <Col N="138" /> access by women to labour market opportunities and is likely later this year to make recommendations on enhanced access. The group is chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Any changes in eligibility criteria for admission to active labour market programmes will be made on foot of the recommendations of this group.</P>

      <P>A training bonus of £25 per week for long-term unemployed people on mainstream FÁS training courses was introduced on a pilot basis with effect from 19 <Col N="140" /> April 1999. The bonus is payable in addition to the trainees normal training allowance.</P>

      <P>Community employment is a transitional programme which is intended to re-introduce long-term unemployed people to the labour market.

      <P>Following inquiries made on my instructions by the embassy in London, the British authorities have confirmed that with effect from April this year steps have been taken to implement a provision of Schedule 5 of the British Prevention of Terrorism Act, 1989, which relates to port and border control. Under this provision the captain of a ship or aircraft carrying passengers from Ireland to Britain can be required to furnish to an examining officer, upon arrival in Britain, the names and dates and places of birth of passengers and crew. Passengers are also required to provide these details to the captain of the ship or aircraft on which they are travelling. This provision applies only to travel within the common travel area and, accordingly, affects principally persons travelling between Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>I understand that the ferry company to which the Deputy has referred has introduced this practice at the request of the British authorities in Liverpool, following the decision to implement this provision of the PTA. The British authorities have also approached the other major ferry companies operating on the Irish Sea. The intention is to implement the provision in relation to all ports in the common travel area, although the new practice may be in place in some ports ahead of others, depending on the action of the local port authorities. The British authorities have also advised that the practice is being applied to all truck drivers and not only to Irish citizens. Discussions on the implementation of the relevant provision of the PTA are, I understand, ongoing between the relevant British authorities and the ferry companies.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have stated that the reason for this new initiative is to cover a gap in the measures so far adopted to give effect to the PTA and to regularise practices at British ports under Schedule 5 of that Act.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have confirmed that the practice being adopted by the ferry company in question is not based on any provision in Irish legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly expressed its concern to the British authorities regarding the operation of the PTA and in particular its impact on passengers travelling to and from Ireland. I am concerned at the decision of the British authorities to take a new initiative to implement a provision of the PTA from April of this year, not least in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and of the review being undertaken of legislation against terrorism in the United Kingdom. I have instructed the embassy in London to express this concern and to monitor any further implementation of the relevant PTA provision closely.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1988, No. 29 of 1998, was enacted on 8 July 1998 and its provisions allow for the transfer of responsibility for all existing food control services to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. This authority was officially established on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to transfer the following functions from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to the new food safety promotion board: promotion of food safety; research into food safety; communication of food alerts; surveillance of food-borne diseases; promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages between laboratories, and developing cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing.</P>
      <P>I am assured by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, who has ministerial responsibility in this area, that there is no vacuum in the exercise of the above functions while we await the coming into force of the British-Irish Agreement. These functions remain within the remit of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland until such time as the food safety promotion board is formally established.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I express in the strongest possible terms my condemnation of the murder of Mrs. Elizabeth O'Neill in Portadown earlier this month. I express my deepest sympathy to Mrs. <Col N="143" /> O'Neill's family and I urge anyone with information on who may have planned or carried out this attack to pass it on to the authorities without delay.</P>
      <P>The Government has conveyed its deep concern to the British Government at the number of attacks on nationalist homes and businesses in recent months, both directly to the Secretary of State and on a continuous basis at official level through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. There have been more than 150 petrol and pipe bomb attacks since the Good Friday Agreement, not to mention the numerous incidents of intimidation and violence which have also taken place.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is the judgment of the British authorities that the ceasefires by the main paramilitary organizations are holding, and that the situation continues to be kept under active review.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have responsi<Col N="144" /> bility for the maintenance or upkeep of sluice gates. However, in the acquisition of certain lands the former Land Commission retained a portion of the purchase money for particular purposes, mainly maintenance of embankments and sluices. These funds were assigned to the public trustee who is now an officer of my Department. The public trustee invests these funds and the income is used for the purpose set out in individual trust deeds.</P>
      <P>In the Ballinful area of County Sligo a small trust fund was set up in 1910 on the Sir J. Gore Booth Estate, to assist the tenant occupiers in the townlands of Cloonagh and Ardtrasna to maintain an embankment and sluice gate on a culvert or drain which runs between the townlands. Local trustees were appointed who could apply to the public trustee to release funds to cover maintenance work.</P>
      <P>If the problem referred to by the Deputy involves the culvert to which the trust fund relates the trustees should contact the public trustee at my Department's Cavan office.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the special levy imposed on pension funds in the Finance Act, 1988; if it applied to pension funds of State and semi-State bodies only; the number of funds affected; the amounts levied on each; if amounts will be refunded in view of the fact Exchequer finances have improved; if some pension funds have suffered due to the levy; and the consideration, if any, he will give to the case of a fund (details supplied) where pensions to retired staff are below the norm and the reasons given to members is the effect of the 1988 levy.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16250/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special levy on pension funds provided for in the Finance Act 1988 consisted of a charge of 6 per cent on the net imputed income of pension funds in 1988. Net imputed income for the purposes of the levy was determined by reference to an assumed return of 9 per cent on pension fund assets valued at 1 January 1988 after allowing a deduction for pension payments made in 1988. Apart from an exemption for small pension schemes with chargeable amounts of not more than £5,000, the levy applied to all occupational pension schemes in the private and public sectors.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible in the time available to indicate the number of pension funds which were subject to the levy or to give a breakdown of the amounts paid by each fund, the total Exchequer yield from the levy was approximately £14 million.</P>
      <P>The levy was introduced as a once-off revenue raising measure at a difficult time for the Exchequer. While the Exchequer position has improved considerably since then, there is no provision in the legislation for a refund of the levy and, as is generally the case with any tax measure, I have no intention to amend the legislation to provide for such a refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that pension funds suffered unduly from the levy, which after all amounted to an effective charge of just 0.54 per cent, 6 per cent of 9 per cent, of the assets of pension funds net of pension payments in 1988. Since that time, pension funds have performed extremely well with annual investment returns averaging at over <Col N="150" /> 15 per cent in the ten year period 1988 to 1997 inclusive. Also, no further taxes have been imposed on pension funds and such funds remain exempt from taxation on their investment returns. It should be stressed that Irish occupational pension provision has extremely favourable taxation arrangements covering tax-relieved contributions, tax-relieved investment returns and tax-free lump sums in the hands of the pensioner.</P>
    <P>Regarding the particular case mentioned by the Deputy, I am advised that the actuarial reports completed by independent actuaries, based on valuations between 31 March 1997 and 1 April 1998, disclosed that the schemes of the company in question are not under-funded and that they have a surplus of assets over liabilities. While the level of pension increases is a matter for the pension scheme trustees, I understand that the scheme in question has increased pensions annually by the growth of the Consumer Price Index since 1987.</P>

      <P>The seeking of tenders for the provision of the service of collection, transport, treatment and dis<Col N="151" /> posal of clinical-healthcare risk waste throughout the island of Ireland was a central purchasing, value for money initiative. It is one of a number of such initiatives sponsored by my Department in the purchasing area in the interest of achieving economy in the expenditure of public funds.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the market for clinical waste disposal was not stifled in any way by the tender process carried out. It should be noted that all waste contractors had the opportunity to respond to the publication of the tender notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the national press. In recent weeks I have received correspondence from a firm of solicitors in relation to this tender. A detailed legal response is in course of preparation and, therefore, it would not be appropriate to comment further on the issues at this stage.</P>

      <P>The orthodontic service continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant led orthodontic service. This ensures a service of high quality and high service levels. The provision of an orthodontic service to eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the health board.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Eastern Health Board that since the introduction of its consultant led orthodontic service in 1996 significant progress has been made in reducing waiting lists and waiting times. All category I patients, the category of greatest need, are assessed and treated immediately. A treatment programme for category II patients is put in place immediately following assessment. The waiting list for assessment for category II patients has been reduced from 10,676 in 1996 to 6,649 in 1999. The average waiting time for assessment has reduced by two years and is now three years and ten months.</P>
      <P>The board is continuing in its efforts to further reduce the category II waiting list as quickly as possible. I understand from the board that staffing difficulties which have arisen in recent months are currently being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board is planning to develop further surgeries at the board's regional orthodontic department on campus of St. James Hospital this year. The board has also recently completed a planning brief for the proposed regional orthodontic unit at Beaumont Hospital and has submitted this brief to my Department for consideration and <Col N="152" /> approval. The brief will be the subject of discussions between the Eastern Health Board and officials of my Department in the near future.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan. The group recently made its report to the chief executive officers of the health boards and this report is currently the subject of discussions between the chief executive officers of the health boards and my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, the primary responsibility for litter management and control rests with the individual local authorities. The Act also provides for the adoption of litter management plans by the elected members of each authority. However, I remain concerned at the prevalence of litter pollution in our society. In support of local authority action I have taken a number of measures including co-funding, with private sector interests, the successful An Taisce led national spring clean campaign and the establishment of a national litter pollution monitoring mechanism. This latter initiative which is now getting under way will be of particular value to local authorities and the public in highlighting litter blackspots, identifying models of good practice in regard to litter management planing and promoting a more even performance by local authorities, including further strengthening the already increased emphasis by local authorities on enforcement.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, representatives of the local authorities, the business community, the educational and tourism sectors, environmental NGOs, community and tidy towns groups have been invited to participate to a new national anti-litter forum to review actions targeting litter pollution and to investigate ways which they can be enhanced and extended.</P>

      <P>I am currently seeking to progress, with the various interests concerned, a range of improvements to the regulatory framework for taxis and hackneys, following closely the advice of the Dublin Taxi Forum. These regulatory improvements include issues related to hackneys such as external identification, the use of two-way radios and telephonic equipment and the carrying of a log of agreed fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, have not been permitted to use bus lanes in view of their more limited service role, which does not involve publicly standing or plying for hire, and the practical difficulty of distinguishing them from private cars. The Dublin Taxi Forum, while recommending some form of external identification for hackneys to facilitate enforcement of regulations by the Garda Síochána, nonetheless, recommended against the merging of the separate service roles of taxis and hackneys, against roof signage for hackneys and against permitting access to bus lanes by hackneys. I have no proposals to <Col N="156" /> extend the use of bus lanes to hackneys at this time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballymun Regeneration Limited is a limited company established under the Companies Acts, and is under the aegis of Dublin Corporation. The board of the company consists of an indepen<Col N="157" /> dent chairman, two city councillors, five community representatives, three corporation officials, one Eastern Health Board official and one private sector representative, all of whom were appointed by Dublin Corporation. The company is responsible for the implementation of the strategic master plan for the regeneration of the Ballymun area, which addresses the economic and social regeneration needs of the area as a whole. This involves the demolition of all high rise flat structures and their replacement with low rise housing, the development of a new town centre and the provision of ancillary facilities.</P>
    <P>Functions that are reserved to the elected members will continue to be performed by the city council in the normal way. The company meets with and reports to a specially established sub-committee on Ballymun and proposals approved by the sub-committee are put before the city council where the exercise of a reserved function is required.</P>
    <P>The regeneration of Ballymun is governed by the master plan which was prepared by Ballymun Regeneration Limited in partnership with the local community and Dublin Corporation. The master plan sets out an overall cost estimate for the anticipated building programme which for the most part relates to housing construction. Annual funding allocations for this programme are determined in the normal way having regard to needs and commitments.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Acts, the board of directors of the company are required to prepare annual accounts and I understand that the first set of accounts are now being finalised and audited by the company's auditors. All of the financial transactions for the company are made through Dublin Corporation's finance department and are reflected in the corporation's capital account. In this way, the company's financial transactions and accounting procedures are subject to examination and scrutiny by the local government auditor. It is also a requirement under the Companies Acts that an audited copy of the annual accounts be submitted to the Companies Office where they are available for public inspection. I understand that copies of the accounts will be submitted to Dublin Corporation and will be circulated to the elected members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions No. 87, 88, 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The issues relating to occupational pensions raised in these questions were considered by the Pensions Board in the context of the widespread consultation process undertaken by the board in preparing its report on the national pensions policy initiative. This report &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo; was published in May 1998 and a copy was circulated to each Deputy at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it was acknowledged in the NPPI consultation document that pension, defined benefit, scheme assets can benefit through early leavers, the impact would vary between schemes as a result of different rules and provisions applying under the voluntary occupational pension system. The Pensions Board considered that if a statutory requirement to revalue all pre-1991 service was placed on pension schemes, the additional costs involved for schemes with many deferred pensioners and few current members, could, be considerable in percentage of payroll terms and <Col N="161" /> could, threaten the solvency of a scheme in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of revaluation of deferred benefits for members of occupational pension schemes who left such schemes prior to 1991, when the Pensions Act, 1990, came into effect, the usual position is that leaving service benefits are calculated by reference to the period of scheme membership and salary at the time of leaving and are not subject to revaluation. The Pensions Board examined the issue of early leavers but did not recommend a statutory requirement to revalue all pre-1991 rights. However, the board urged employers to consider the revaluation of such benefits, where people remain members of the scheme, on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>On the issue of choice, I would stress that occupational pension schemes are trust-based and the trustees of the individual schemes are responsible to the scheme members in relation to matters such as choice of provider, investment of funds etc. I would also point out that the Government has accepted the Pensions Board recommendation on the introduction of a new pensions savings vehicle, the personal retirement savings account. This will be a simplified pensions savings mechanism which it is hoped will encourage more providers to enter the market-place and allow greater choice for the consumer. The legislative framework for the introduction of PRSAs will form part of the new occupational Pensions Bill which I expect to publish later this year or early 2000.</P>
    <P>In relation to membership of occupational pensions schemes, I have to stress that the provision of an occupational pension scheme is a voluntary matter for individual employers. As I mentioned earlier, arising from the voluntary nature of the arrangement, differing rules apply regarding membership but in the NPPI report the Pensions Board recommended that it should remain permissible for an employer who is contributing to a pension scheme to have or make it a condition on taking up employment, that employees join the pension scheme. The board considered this condition to be essential to avoid the possibility of unscrupulous attempts to tempt people out of employer-sponsored schemes as happened in the United Kingdom for example, where employers were legally prohibited from having scheme membership as a condition of employment. I would have to say that I fully support the pensions board recommendation in this regard.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the consultative process leading to the NPPI report was both comprehensive and inclusive and that the issues raised by the Deputy received due attention in that context. I now look forward to moving the process forward and giving legislative effect to many of the Pensions Board proposals in the new pensions Bill which I referred to earlier.</P>

      <P>The method of nominating people to the board is set down in the Pensions Act, 1990, as amended by the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1996. The Pensions Board is a representative body, comprising a chairperson and fourteen ordinary members. This is the maximum number of members allowed under current legislation. While all members are appointed by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs under the provisions of the Pension Act, as amended, the board must comprise representatives nominated by trade unions, employers, the Government, the pensions industry, member trustees and professional groups involved with occupational schemes.</P>
      <P>Members can serve for a maximum period of five years from 21 December 1995. The term of office of all members will expire on 20 December 2000.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the Youghal family support group has applied for funding towards the cost of employing a full-time co-ordinator and for management support for its resource centre. My Department also has a similar application from the Youghal community development project for funding for staff and running costs of a resource centre. Both applications were examined by the CDP technical group, which was established to advise me on applications for community development funding and on areas to be prioritised for pro-active development of new projects. The technical group recommended the establishment of a project under the community development programme to serve the town of Youghal and its hinterland. The technical group further recommended that, rather than the funding being allocated to one or other of the existing applicant groups, the new CDP project should be established in such a way that it draws on and involves members of both these groups &ndash; and of any other relevant groupings in the town. I concur completely with this recommendation. It would not represent good value for money for the Department to fund two separate resource centres in Youghal, both whose objectives are to tackle social needs and promote community development.</P>
      <P>As I announced last month, Youghal is one of the 30 areas identified for the expansion of the community development programme as part of the commitment in that regard in Partnership 2000. I should stress that this is a decision in principle to establish a community development project in Youghal and its hinterland, rather than a decision to fund any specific applicant group. That is the clear brief that has been given to CCDI. The two applications received have been referred to Cork community development institute which is the regional support agency for CDPs in the southern region and which has responsibility for setting up the new project in Youghal.</P>
      <P>CCDI will shortly commence the necessary preparatory work in the Youghal area. This will involve working with all relevant local voluntary and community groups in order to bring a new project to the stage of signing a formal contract for funding with the Department.</P>

The project is being planned, financed and managed by the Office of Public Works, which is the authority responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of property used by all Government Departments. The design for the project has been approved by the Planning Authority.</P>
      <P>The project involves the erection of three self contained office blocks around a landscaped courtyard over the underground carpark. Also included in the project is the renovation, alteration and extension of the existing colonnade building and the expansion in area, by 30 per cent approximately, of the play space available to Scoil Chaoimhín.</P>
      <P>The new office blocks will replace very unsatisfactory and sub-standard office accommodation including 30 year old dilapidated single storey prefabs.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding from the Office of Public Works that tenders are currently being sought with a view to placing a contract at the end of July 1999. The contract period will be 18 months.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Office of Public Works will make every effort to minimise any impact this development will have on the school environment of Scoil Chaoimhín. I have indicated that a working group consisting of the parents of Scoil Chaoimhín, the board of management and the Office of Public Works should be set up to deal with any problems that arise during the construction phase. I accept that there will be inconvenience for everybody on site during the building operation, but on completion the complex will be a safer, cleaner and healthier environment for the children of Scoil Chaoimhín.</P>
