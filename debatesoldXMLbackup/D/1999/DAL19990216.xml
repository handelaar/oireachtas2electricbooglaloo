    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a successful visit to Armagh and Newry last Friday week. During my visit to Armagh I met Archbishop Brady and we visited the soon to be opened Cardinal Ó Fiaich Memorial Library. I then went to the Queen's University campus at Armagh, where I met Dr. Richard Jay, Acting Academic Director and staff and students of the university. I also participated in a video link with Professor George Bain, Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast and I visited the Robinson Library, which houses the national archive of the Church of Ireland and also has close associations with Jonathan Swift.</P>
      <P>Also while in Armagh, I attended a lunch hosted by the Mayor of Armagh, Councillor Robert Turner of the UUP. This event was attended by the local MP and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Seamus Mallon, Church leaders and representatives of the Partnership Board, including political representatives from the various parties and representatives of local businesses, trades unions, and the community sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the afternoon, accompanied by Deputy First Minister, Mr. Mallon, I visited Newry. My visit there included a site visit to see the progress being made on the new Roches Stores outlet <Col N="691" /> being built there and other examples of refurbishment &ndash; a further example of the opportunities for investment and employment that can be reaped in an island economy operating in conditions of peace. A &ldquo;walkabout&rdquo; in Newry gave me an opportunity to meet the people and see the impressive revitalisation taking place there, much of it with the assistance of the International Fund for Ireland. I also attended a special meeting of the Newry and Mourne District Council. At this meeting I commended the council for its proactive approach to cross-Border initiatives including its involvement in the East Border Region Committee, its links with Dundalk Urban District Council and its involvement with organisations such as the IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council.</P>
    <P>Following my meeting with the council I met the Newry and Mourne District Partnership Board which briefed me on its activities in the area. I also attended a civic reception hosted by the district council at which I met a wide range of individuals and representatives from across the spectrum including local community groups. During my visit to Armagh and Newry I also had very useful private meetings with Seamus Mallon and the UUP Assembly member, Danny Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss or report in detail on all my recent meetings relating to Northern Ireland other than to say that I met the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam on 3 February, the SDLP leader, Mr. John Hume on 2 February and on Friday last. Our discussions focused in the main on how best to ensure the successful implementation of the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement, in particular the issues surrounding the formation of the Executive. It is clear that we have to continue our efforts to achieve progress and that this is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>During the negotiation of the British-Irish Agreement I was asked by Sinn Féin representatives if those convicted in the Garda Jerry McCabe case would be included in the arrangements for the release of prisoners. At that time, and at all times since then, both I and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made it transparently clear that those convicted in this case would not come within the terms of the Agreement. There was not, at that time or at any time since, any ambiguity on my part or on the part of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the consultative forum envisaged under strand two of the British-Irish Agreement, our efforts to date have, in the main, been focused on the implementation of the North-South aspects of the Agreement. The consultative forum is a matter to be considered between the administrations North and South and in due course, when the Northern administration is in place, I could see a role for the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council in advising on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> I will visit the United States again this year where I will undertake a number of engagements in San José, San Francisco and Washington. The full itinerary for the visit is still in preparation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, wish the Taoiseach and all those involved in the finalisation of the arrangements for the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement well. We accept that for the Agreement to work we must have Executive participation by both the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin and that that is the objective toward which all must work.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that we accept that everything he said in the article in <i>The Sunday Times </i>as published in full on that newspaper's Internet website, is consistent with everything he has said in the House if stated a little more explicitly? Why, then, did the Taoiseach feel it necessary to issue a clarification of the article in <i>The Sunday Times, </i>given that the article had already been published in full and was not open to misinterpretation? The clarification said the Taoiseach did not believe Sinn Féin should not be allowed to participate in the Executive if the IRA had not started decommissioning. That statement could be interpreted as meaning the converse, namely that the Taoiseach believed they should be allowed to participate even if there had not been a start to decommissioning. The clarification came close to being potentially a contradiction of what the Taoiseach had said earlier in the article in <i>The Sunday Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for his remarks about the ongoing work to implement the British-Irish Agreement. I do not detract from what I said in the article in <i>The Sunday Times. </i>It is all available on the Internet. However, a difficulty arose on Sunday morning. Essentially, the heading was given on all the news bulletins throughout Northern Ireland from 6 a.m. on Sunday. The headline writer implied that Sinn Féin should be barred from the executive unless the IRA had first decommissioned. I never said that and I never used the word &ldquo;barred&rdquo;. The journalist admitted that on RTE yesterday. That distorted the position. It is clear now that nobody was talking about barring or otherwise preventing the Northern Ireland executive from being set up. The full text of the interview made available in <i>The Sunday Times</i> shows that clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that decommissioning is an indispensable part of the Agreement. Nobody argues that. Like all parts of the Agreement it must be implemented in full and nobody disagrees with that. All parties are committed to that objective, given that they signed section 24 of the Agreement which says there must be full decommissioning. The Agreement does not contain a precondition that there must be a start to decommissioning before Sinn Féin can take its place on the executive. I must have put that on the record of the House about 100 times during the past 12 months. Such a precondition does not exist. <Col N="693" /> Under the terms of the Agreement, Sinn Féin has a full entitlement to its place on the executive. Both the Irish and British Governments have accepted that. It is the only realistic way forward.</P>
    <P>The political reality which I have spelt out since October, certainly since November, is that the UUP interpret the Agreement in a different way. Its understanding is that for participation by Sinn Féin on the executive there must be a start on decommissioning. The Agreement provides a mechanism to resolve the decommissioning issue. For months we have been endeavouring to find a method within the mechanism set out in the British-Irish Agreement &ndash; the international body on decommissioning headed by General John de Chastelain &ndash; to resolve this matter.</P>
    <P>I accept what Deputy Bruton has said that I have been stepping up this matter and the article was a means of doing that. I have had at least five meetings in recent weeks with Sinn Féin. I wish to repeat the gist of those meetings. I note Martin McGuinness said yesterday that I never used the word &ldquo;barred&rdquo;. He made that clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reported in the <i>Irish News </i>this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He is correct in saying I never used the word &ldquo;barred&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always said decommissioning must happen and that there can be no place for weapons in a democratic and peaceful Ireland. That is the principle I was reflecting and I stand by that principle. The issue is one of timing and interpretation, how we get from the present to a point where all the guns have been removed. That has to happen as we proceed along the route. What I have consistently stated in interviews in stepping up the pressure in recent times is that all parties, including Sinn Féin, have to clear their minds on how they will proceed to implement their responsibility under the Agreement to bring about decommissioning. In this context it is neither reasonable nor politically realistic to argue that the executive on the North-South Council be established without an understanding of how the implementation of the decommissioning part of the Agreement will be moved forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To assist in the achievement of clarity on this matter, will the Taoiseach agree that if Sinn Féin is to go to the IRA to ask it to do anything it is important that it be clear what it is being asked to do and that there be no confusion in its mind? Will the Taoiseach agree, regardless of what the Agreement says, the practical politics are that there can be no executive without a start on decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The important reality is that there is no precondition in the Agreement. The political reality is that the UUP has stated it inter<Col N="694" /> prets the Agreement in such a way that it will not set up the executive until this matter is satisfactorily resolved. Mr. Trimble's position now is that that should be done within the de Chastelain route. I strongly welcome that helpful move on his part. The SDLP's position is that it will oppose any attempt by the UUP, led by Mr. Trimble, to set up the Executive without Sinn Féin. The political reality is that we cannot have an Executive until this matter is dealt with.</P>
      <P>The second political reality relates to inclusivity as Seamus Mallon has said many times and repeated this morning. We can only set up an Executive, which we desperately need &ndash; the situation gets more desperate every day &ndash; by agreement between the parties. We will not get anywhere if we do not find a compromise under the de Chastelain route. I have said a number of times recently, to Sinn Féin and others, that they must clear their minds on how we will proceed if we are to implement this aspect of the Agreement and make the decommissioning part of the Agreement happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered putting the Irish Government's position in writing to Sinn Féin, in recognition of the existing political realities? That would mean they would have an absolutely clear written statement of what the Irish Government is asking of them at this historic time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not put it in the terms of a memorandum but it has certainly been put at meetings, including two meetings last week. In terms of what we can set out, our position is fairly clear to Sinn Féin; there is no difficulty with giving it to them in writing but they know very well what our position is. The other parties who signed up to the British-Irish Agreement are also aware of our position.</P>
      <P>It is necessary now, as I made clear in the interview, that under the Agreement we give the key to General John de Chastelain and the international commission to how to resolve the issue. We need greater effort and greater momentum if we are to work closely to achieve this. People must focus on the issues. We have been saying the same thing for some months, but people are not focusing on making the decisions that need to be made. I accept that requires some hard decisions and pain, but the only way we can resolve this issue and move forward is if people accept the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the various recent meetings between the Taoiseach and the leadership of Sinn Féin, specifically the president of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, has it been conveyed to the Taoiseach, as it has been to other political parties in this House, that it is Mr. Adams' opinion that the IRA will never decommission? If so, as Taoiseach with responsibility for ensuring that the British-Irish Agreement is implemented, what was his response to Mr. Adams?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="695" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was put in such terms, although emphasis was put on the difficulties of making progress in this regard. However, one way or the other, regardless of how it is put, I have continually restated what the Agreement states on decommissioning. I say it again as it is as least six months since I did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful &ndash; as the Taoiseach knows, both Opposition parties are supportive of his work on this difficult task. However, we would like to know what he said in private to Mr. Adams when he conveyed his opinion, as he did to us, that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I continually quote the Agreement which Sinn Féin and everybody else signed. It states that all participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations, that they also confirm their intention to continue to work constructively and in good faith with the Independent Commission, and to use any influence that they may have, to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years, following endorsement in referendums North and South of the agreement and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement. I continually quote that and the fact that this is what everyone signed up to. That simply means that decommissioning must occur in the life of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn will be able to ascertain from previous comments I have made and those I made in the article published at the weekend that I believe all of these matters should move along together as all parts of the Agreement are implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. If I can refer to a phrase used in the quotation he read out, he stated the parties should use any influence they might have in respect of paramilitaries in order to encourage them to decommission. Is Mr. Adams saying to the Taoiseach in private that the parties in question do not have any influence with the IRA? Has he indicated to the Taoiseach that the IRA is prepared to decommission at some stage? If so, will that occur prior to 10 March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Mr. Adams and the other leaders are committed to a real process of partnership. I also believe that Sinn Féin, under the leadership of Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, has made a critical contribution to the search for peace and is committed to the full implementation of the terms of the Agreement, including the decommissioning aspects. We must endeavour to help both sides in this regard. Although Mr. Trimble has difficulties on the one hand, the leadership of Sinn Féin also has difficulties. I am sure that from the briefing Deputies received they will have gained some knowledge of what those difficulties are. I would rather not <Col N="696" /> go into all of the details of those. There are people within and outside of the republican family who do not believe too much in this process and we must be conscious of that. That is why &ndash; perhaps annoyingly and painfully to some people &ndash; I must at times seek to achieve a balance.</P>
      <P>I believe it is fair for me some months on to step up the pressure in an attempt to get more movement, particularly as we move towards 10 March. I am acutely conscious that when we missed the October deadline, huge pressure was experienced in the attempt to reach agreement by Christmas. That is not a healthy way to do business. If we miss the 10 March deadline and run into the Easter period and the beginning of the marches, that will be even less healthy. I am trying to encourage people to ask the difficult questions. Somebody has to do that and we have been trying to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that an Executive cannot be formed without Sinn Féin and that an Executive will not be formed in the absence of the commencement of decommissioning? If the Taoiseach accepts that as a reasonably accurate political summation of the current position, could he elaborate on what he meant by his reference to General de Chastelain finding some kind of formula with regard to making progress on a mechanism to signal that some form of decommissioning had commenced? Presumably, both Governments and their advisers are looking at ways around this impasse. Will the Taoiseach outline what role he envisages General de Chastelain having? How much can he put on the record of the House in that regard within the confines of diplomacy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of September and particularly since Martin McGuinness, Sinn Féin's chief negotiator, took up the position on the decommissioning body, considerable progress has been made. General de Chastelain stated that when I met him some months ago. He has also met some of my departmental officials quite recently. However, sufficient progress has not been made to allow General de Chastelain state in any credible way that we have reached a situation from which we could move on to the formation of an Executive, which is a very important aspect of the implementation of the Agreement.  Over that time, and particularly since Christmas, we have considered many ways in which the issue could be dealt with. I remind the House of what we did on 28 June when we set up the decommissioning process and the regulations governing how these things could be done. We explored most of them in one way or another and have gone through them extensively. The Government put forward proposals which we believe might be helpful, but we have not yet reached a stage where any of them are acceptable to the parties. We are trying to feed in our proposals as best we can to assist General John de Chastelain. Prime Minister Blair has also been <Col N="697" /> trying to do that, but at this stage I cannot put my hand on my heart and tell the House we have a mechanism through which this issue can be resolved. We are still endeavouring to work on this.</P>

      <P>Is it the Government's view that since 2 February some progress has been made by the IRA paramilitary group on the cessation of punishment beatings? Have Government sources an assessment as to whether this is an indication of some kind of progress? As much encouragement as possible should be given where progress has been made. While the punishment and mutilation beatings should never have occurred, will the Taoiseach agree that if they have stopped, and that continues to be the case, it is a positive indication of progress? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, but they have not stopped totally. There are still some incidents. January was an appalling month in terms of punishment beatings. Last year there were approximately 220 such beatings and there were some every night in January. Calls for a cessation of punishment beatings by the political leadership of parties, including Sinn Féin, Members of this House, Sinn Féin members of the assembly and some of the loyalist leaders were helpful. That has improved the position. Without going into detail, and I do not want to mislead the House, overall the security situation is still tense. We must be conscious of that and of those leaders who are endeavouring to maintain and win support and to avoid those, who would like to wreck the Agreement, getting involved in activities again.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree Sinn Féin is fulfilling its obligations in regard to all aspects of the British-Irish Agreement and that the party continues, in the words of the agreement, which the Taoiseach quoted, to work constructively and in good faith with the independent commission and to use any influence it may have to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years, following endorsement in referendums, North and South, of the Agreement and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement? Does the Taoiseach agree this is the position? If so, does it not follow that the plain truth, which must be <Col N="698" /> stated clearly at all times by the Irish Government, is that there is absolutely no obstacle in the Agreement to the immediate establishment of the executive with Sinn Féin participation? Will the Taoiseach note that I have been concerned at responses affirming that question in the past that seemed to have the additional baggage of the &ldquo;ah, but&rdquo; because the &ldquo;ah, but&rdquo; has created great difficulties within the equilibrium of the Agreement and its ongoing passage and the raising of such obstacles runs contrary to the Agreement endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the people on this island? I would appreciate the Taoiseach's response to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that I believe the Sinn Féin leadership, particularly Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness who were involved in all the negotiations, have made and are making a critical contribution and are endeavouring to do their utmost in this regard, including the implementation of the terms of the Agreement on decommissioning. Unfortunately, I cannot be as positive about the &ldquo;ah, but&rdquo; as I did not insert it. The political reality is that, as much as I would like to move on with the executive and all parts of the Agreement, we cannot get over this position. I think everybody else recognises this as a political reality and have accepted that it is not a pre-condition. The British and Irish Governments have stated it is not a pre-condition, as have all the key players. However, we must find a way forward under the Agreement. I do not have to remind the Deputy as he is familiar with it, but the Agreement states:</P>
      <P>Participants recall their agreement in the Procedural Motion adopted on 24 September 1997 &ldquo;that the resolution of the decommissioning issue is an indispensable part of the process of negotiation&rdquo;, and also recall the provisions of paragraph 25 of Strand 1.</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>They note the progress made by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and the Governments in developing schemes which can represent a workable basis for achieving the decommissioning of illegally-held arms in the possession of paramilitary groups.</P>
      <P>This is what the Agreement states, and all we are doing is trying to find a method, system or combination of words which will remove or allow us overcome the impasse. I would love to say the impasse will go away, but I have spent hours upon hours discussing it and have had 27 meetings on decommissioning since the start of the year, and talking does not change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that the impasse exists and I say to Deputy Ó Caoláin that we must be clear in our minds how we are going to get around it. This is the difficulty. By saying the impasse does not exist will not change the situation. Under the de Chastelain route we must find some method of <Col N="699" /> removing the impasse and that is what we are trying to do. I am prepared to try to do this with Sinn Féin and everybody else, but it will not go away until we find such a method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm what the Taoiseach has said as that is what must be done and what my party is doing. More and more there is a growing exasperation that the implementation or usage of the &ldquo;ah, but&rdquo;, which now has a currency in the Chamber, is giving comfort to the obstructionists whose very purpose is to thwart the Agreement. Does the Taoiseach recognise this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it does not give such comfort, but I am sure the Deputy appreciates that many times in the process there are obstacles which affect his party and that we must find ways of dealing with them. Sometimes there are issues which are part of the Agreement and which we must try to bring forward to assist his party. Other parties have similar difficulties. As an honest broker, which is what I am in this, we must be fair to everybody and this means trying to find resolutions. I genuinely agree with Seamus Mallon that inclusivity is the only way we will move forward, but that means we must carry everybody with us. We cannot carry everybody some days and other days carry everybody minus one as that approach will not work.</P>
      <P>We will not achieve the setting up of the executive until the reality is faced. We must clear our minds and face the reality. Otherwise we will not achieve the big prize which at this stage is setting up the executive and moving apace with a number of other things. The Irish or British Governments on their own or collectively cannot do that, they need the support of the participants.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate somewhat on his conversation on Sunday with Mr. Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin? What prompted this call and what passed between the Taoiseach and Sinn Féin? Was the only aspect of his full interview with <i>The Sunday Times</i>, to which Mr. McGuinness objected, the use of the term &ldquo;banned&rdquo; in the headline, or did he indicate that he disagreed with the Taoiseach when he said that practical politics are that there can be no executive without a start to decommissioning? Did Mr. McGuinness indicate to the Taoiseach that he did not accept this sentiment of his? What did Mr. McGuinness indicate that he believed was practical politics in this matter? Did Mr. McGuinness vouchsafe any resolution of his own to this dilemma or did he leave the matter entirely to the Taoiseach to solve without any help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three aspects to that. I am sure Mr. Martin McGuinness would not agree with many of the things I said in the interview, but he would be aware of them as being <Col N="700" /> my views. There was nothing new. If issues were controversial, I prefaced them by saying I was on record in recent weeks and months in relation to them. They were all things I have said for a long time.</P>

      <P>Mr. Martin McGuinness spoke to an official, he had not seen the paper, but the headlines had been running that I was effectively putting down a precondition to a new Northern Ireland Government that unless the IRA started to decommission Sinn Féin should be barred from the new Northern Ireland executive. That was the first paragraph of the article, the only headline and Mr. McGuinness's only information. He inquired whether I said that because it would have been a change from the position stated at a meeting on Friday and at one last week, and I clarified that. He was not arguing or debating other points of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In the many meetings and visits referred to in the questions, did the Taoiseach raise the frequency of punishment beatings of which, according to Families Against Intimidation and Terror, there were more in January 1999 than in any month in the past ten years? Will he give us his opinion on the reasons behind these beatings? Apart from condemning these barbaric acts, what is being done to stop the beatings, alongside all the other work?</P>
      <P>At what stage are we in setting up the civic forum to provide for that section of the Agreement which relates to other than the parties? Given that so many NGOs, groups and organisations are interested in being part of such a forum, has there been any agreement on a selection procedure to decide which of them will be represented or has that been dealt with? Will the Taoiseach give us an idea when it will be dealt with and if there is a set up date in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could conclude this part of the discussion, we would move very quickly to the civic forum. Work is being done by the Irish and British Governments, and the Women's Coalition, in particular, has been very active in this regard. Other parties have done papers on this matter but it will be somewhat on the back burner until this issue is resolved. There is broad support on what we could do and I genuinely believe we could make rapid progress. I do not believe there are huge or insurmountable difficulties. It is an enormously important part of the Agreement. For a long time to come, we will have <Col N="701" /> difficulty trying to get things moving and building trust and confidence. The civic forum would do much in this regard and could break away from the political parties and the political agenda towards civic society and inter-community life. While it will not be an easy task to set it up as long as mistrust continues, a civic forum will, for some years, be important but I hope not for too many years. There is also a need to decommission mistrust. That would help to move many other matters forward. The Civic Forum will help to do this.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the figures are but the January figure was high. As Deputy Quinn said, the figure to date in February is relatively low. It is important that this is maintained. The efforts being made by the policing commission and by others in the community, including Sinn Féin and the loyalist parties, to find legal alternatives to community policing will help but it will not happen in the short-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions. As regards Deputy Ó Caoláin's selective quoting from the Agreement, paragraph 4 of the section on decommissioning on page 24 states, &ldquo;The Independent Commission will monitor, review and verify progress on decommissioning of illegal arms, and will report to both Governments at regular intervals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify his understanding of that paragraph against the background of a belief by some that decommissioning can commence on the eve of the second anniversary of the Agree<Col N="703" /> ment? If so, that would seem to render paragraph 4 redundant.</P>
    <P>The confusion following the Taoiseach's article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> has arisen not so much from the article but from its consequences, particularly the Taoiseach's actions since the publication of the article, including a telephone conversation with Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin.

      <Quest> if she will give an update report on the 13 inquiries currently being conducted by her Department; the final reports, if any, she has received; when she received the interim reports; the actions, if any, she has taken on foot of reports received; the costs expended to date and budgeted for on all these reports; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>Five of the 13 investigations have been completed. Two of the five investigations concerned National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Irish Life plc and dealt with insurance-related matters. The interim report last June of the authorised officer appointed to NIBFSL led to the appointment by the High Court at my request of inspectors to the company. The Irish Life report was published last week at a cost of £3,200. The only other cost to my Department of these inquiries has been the normal salary costs of the staff involved.</P>
      <P>The report of the inquiry into Bula Resources (Holdings) plc was published in July 1998. Copies of this report were immediately forwarded to Bula, Ovoca Resources plc, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry and the Financial Services Department in Jersey. The cost of this inquiry was approximately £201,000.</P>
      <P>The investigations into Garuda Limited and Faxhill Homes Limited were concluded in December last and extracts from the reports have been sent to various parties for their comments. I will take decisions on these reports in the coming weeks. The cost of the Garuda investigation which was done by my Department has been about £3,000, excluding normal salary costs. The Faxhill investigation which has been undertaken by an external accountant has cost about £87,000.</P>
      <P>The remaining eight investigations are all ongoing and the cost to date has been about £12,000, excluding departmental salary costs. I received two interim reports on Celtic Helicopters Limited in September 1997 and January 1998. The latter report caused me to commence the investigations into Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited.</P>
      <P>In June last, I received two interim reports on Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited which led to my deciding to investigate Kentford Securities Limited, Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. The latter two investigations are subject to additional judicial review proceedings. Today I received a further interim report on Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited to which I will give attention shortly.</P>
      <P>The outturns for company investigations in my Department in 1997 and 1998 were £28,664 and £240,000, respectively, as against the estimates of £30,000 and £350,000, respectively. The 1999 estimate for company investigations is £245,000.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to follow the Minister's labyrinthine mixture of reports. Will we <Col N="706" /> ever see the results of these inquires? Will the reports be made public? The only report that has been made public relates to Irish Life and churning. Is the Minister surprised that more than 12 months after the inquiries started in January 1998, there is still no finality in any of the reports?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the investigation into National Irish Bank shows the amount of overcharging was approximately £140,000? Is this the correct figure? How many inspectors were involved in that part of the inquiry? What was the cost of that part of the inquiry? Was it more than the amount of overcharging identified? Will the Minister outline whether there is any truth in the rumour that the insurance scam operated by National Irish Bank may have involved 30 to 40 people selling those products? When does she hope to have finality regarding that report?</P>

      <P>The first investigation began after the publication of the McCracken report. As the Deputy is aware, that report drew attention to serious lapses in corporate governance. On foot of the report, I began an investigation into Celtic Helicopters and Garuda Limited. It was on foot of the investigation into Celtic Helicopters that several other inquires commenced. I wish these inquiries could have been brought to a conclusion earlier. However, I assure the Deputy that is not for the want of effort on the part of the officers involved. The delay is due to litigation and several difficulties. As the Deputy is probably aware, matters have been before the courts on many occasions.</P>
      <P>I am determined that action will be taken on foot of the reports. For example, the Bula report was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Finance. I mentioned the other parties which received a copy of it.</P>
      <P>I cannot confirm the Deputy's comments about National Irish Bank because that investigation is still under way. It is before the High Court and the legal proceedings which delayed that investigation for a considerable length of time concluded only recently. The inspectors are now free to continue their inquiries. I cannot confirm the Deputy's comments. I do not know from where she got her information. Perhaps it relates to the company's internal examination, but I am not aware of those details and the inspectors did not report that to the court. Although I sought their appointment, they are now officers of the court and will report to it.</P>
      <P>My concern about this area is the reason a company law enforcement group was established some time ago under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael McDowell, SC. That group has just reported and I hope to bring its recommendations to the Government shortly and to publish its findings and recommendations. I am concerned that we do not have in place appropriate mechanisms with regard to the enforcement of company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept an unprecedented number of inquiries have been initiated. However, the Deputy will appreciate that all the inquiries were launched <Col N="707" /> only after careful consideration. I did not lightly authorise any officer to carry out an inquiry without careful consideration. It was only after serious matters were brought to my attention that I initiated those investigations and I hope many of them will be brought to a conclusion shortly. As I said, I received a report this morning in relation to Guinness &amp; Mahon. I have not had an opportunity to read this long report. I hope to do so later today and to consider it fully as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the contents of the report on Celtic Helicopters which she received matches the information emerging at the Moriarty tribunal? When will the report on Celtic Helicopters prepared by her Department be published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>I cannot confirm any matter in that regard because I am precluded, under the Companies Act, 1990, from disclosing to any party, other than those affected, information which comes into my possession. I am also precluded from publishing a report prepared under section 19. This is one of the main difficulties in this area. The Minister's capacity to bring matters into the public arena when reports have been concluded is rather limited. However, I confirm that the Celtic Helicopters inquiry is proceeding and I understand it will be brought to a conclusion very soon.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that appropriate standards of corporate governance and behaviour have not been present in a number of the companies being investigated. Apparent breaches of company law and other legislation caused me to commence a number of these investigations in the first place. When I have received and fully considered all the reports concerned, I will take whatever steps I can to ensure appropriate enforcement action follows. I am determined to use all the powers available to me to expose wrongdoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these investigations involve the examination of company books and documents under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. I am precluded by section 21 of this Act from disclosing or publishing information relating to specific investigations, except in very restricted circumstances. However, I am permitted by the Act to bring matters to the attention of certain appropriate authorities. Such authorities include the <Col N="708" /> Director of Public Prosecutions, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and any court of competent jurisdiction. In appropriate circumstances, I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, can initiate proceedings.</P>

      <P>My question refers to the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 31 December 1998 which carried the headline, &ldquo;Exposed. a golden circle of swindlers&rdquo;. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has on a number of occasions, including in that story, been quoted as expressing the most grave concern about what she called a small coterie of business people in Irish life. The statement she made clearly indicates that whatever she knows is enough to cause the hair on the back of her neck to stand up. I can well understand that, but will she tell the House when she intends to share these dreadful secrets with the rest of us? She is tantalisingly drawing a veil across this, mentioning <i>en passant</i> to Deputy Owen that inquiries under sections 19 or 21 may not be published by the Minister. How does she intend to mediate into the public domain the terrible secrets that oppress her? </P>

      <P>If Deputy Rabbitte was in any doubt about what I said a number of weeks ago, events that have happened in the last few weeks should leave him in no doubt that there was a golden circle in this country that had considerable influence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The laws of the country did not seem to matter to them and they felt they could ignore corporate governance. Incorporation bestows huge privileges upon individuals, but attached to those privileges are enormous responsibilities to ensure the law is upheld. It is important so that all stakeholders in a company's interests are protected, including creditors and shareholders. Under the Act, the Minister is precluded from making public the results of such inquiries, as Deputy Rabbitte was in relation to inquiries he initiated. It is a defect because a Minister is acting in the public interest and when matters come to the Minister's attention it is right that they should be brought into the public arena. The only vehicle the Minister has to do that is by opting for a section 8 inspection, but such an inspection can be justified only if the circumstances are such as to suggest we should go down that route. It is extremely expensive, as we know in the case of National Irish Bank. That route may well be necessary in relation to some of these investigations because one of the other drawbacks of the section 19 procedure is that third parties cannot be interviewed or spoken to. On very many occasions it is necessary for the authorised officer, to be able to confirm or substan<Col N="709" /> tiate what is being told to him or her by the affected party, to have access to other parties. That is another drawback of the legislation.</P>
      <P>A number of inquiries have taken place because key principals in certain companies involved in certain activities seemed to feel they could ignore company law and that corporate governance was not for them. I strongly believe it is in the interests of the economic well being of the country, and in the interests of equity and justice, that the laws are vigorously enforced. That is one of the reasons we established the committee to examine company law enforcement. It has made some outstanding recommendations which, I hope, the Government will decide to implement shortly when the matter comes before it.</P>
      <P>I did not write the newspaper headlines but I can assure the Deputy that one investigation led to another. We started with two and have ended up with ten in relation to these matters. They were all commenced because of serious matters that were brought to our attention that required investigation. I hope the appropriate authorities will take action. In the case of Bula, it was passed on to the company, the Stock Exchange, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Revenue Commissioners. The interim report on National Irish Bank, which led to the application to appoint an inspector, has been brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. I presume those bodies are acting on foot of that report. Very useful work has already been done and I hope other useful work can be commenced shortly.</P>

      <P>I agree with everything the Minister has said, but can we focus for a moment on the Ansbacher cesspool? Will she say a word to the House about the expectation she has raised that the discoveries will be released into the public domain at some stage? I appreciate the difficulties she is having with the legislation. However, whether the headlines reflect it accurately, she has raised the expectation that these findings &ndash; which, I presume, include breaches of company law, tax evasion and God knows what else &ndash; will at some stage come into the public domain. The Minister has a responsibility to tell the House whether she has thought out that matter. Are there some matters that caused her to say she does not know what is coming down the tracks towards her, the Government, the Parliament or the country? Are matters in this area coming down the tracks at us or are there other, as yet unspecified, matters that are coming down the track?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister designated the Moriarty tribunal as a competent authority under the Act? Will she furnish these documents to the Moriarty tribunal so it may use them, not just in reaching conclusions but that they might be adduced in evidence before the tribunal? Has the Minister taken legal advice on that matter?</P>

      <P>In relation to the Deputy's last point, my Department has co-operated and is co-operating with both tribunals of inquiry which have had occasion to come and talk to officers of the Department on matters on which they sought clarification. That will continue to be the case. In relation to giving the reports to the Moriarty tribunal, one can give a section 19 report to only what is called a court of competent jurisdiction. As I understand it, a tribunal does not fall into that category. If, however, the tribunal were to seek information from an officer in my Department or from me, of course it would be forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries on that matter and I understand that I cannot. I can revert to the Deputy. It is some time since a query of that kind was put to me. One can give to any tribunal &ndash; as every Deputy has an obligation to do, particularly every Minister &ndash; knowledge that comes to one's attention in whatever capacity. However, one cannot pass over a report or designate the Moriarty tribunal, as I understand it, as a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I suppose public expectations have been raised because when one is asked if the matters being investigated are serious and if the investigations are warranted, the answer is &ldquo;yes, very much so&rdquo;. The extent to which company law was breached &ndash; or apparently breached, because until we get final reports one cannot be certain &ndash; is very surprising. As I said earlier, it seems a few key principals involved in the operation of companies went to extraordinary lengths to avoid their responsibilities to themselves, their shareholders, the tax authorities and others.</P>
      <P>It is important that professionals who have to deal with companies, particularly accountants, also understand their responsibilities when auditing accounts. As the Deputy knows, the Institute of Chartered Accountants is carrying out its own inquiry and, now that the legal obstacles have been removed, I look forward to that inquiry being concluded as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to whether I have thought out how it can get into the public arena, under the present Act, it cannot get into the public arena&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are other proceedings next week, when we will be in court again in relation to Dunne Stores (Ireland) Limited and Dunne Stores (Ilac Centre).

      <P>Following a series of discussions between the management of Enterprise Ireland, the SIPTU union and the MSF professional union, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, a framework for a proposal was outlined by management to SIPTU on 12 December 1998 regarding some of the grades it represents. On 14 December 1998 a general meeting of SIPTU members considered the framework and the outcome was to initiate a ballot for industrial action up to and including strike action. A formal proposal was subsequently sent to the union by management and rejected. On 20 January 1999 a further proposal was made by management to SIPTU and MSF in respect of senior management grades represented by these unions. These proposals are part of the ongoing negotiation process and it would not be helpful to these negotiations if the detail were discussed at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of informal contacts were made during the week following 1 February designed to recommence discussions between the parties involved in the dispute. A framework was agreed for direct discussions between management and <Col N="712" /> SIPTU and a general meeting of SIPTU members decided on 8 February 1999 to suspend the industrial action. Mr. Derek Hunter, formerly of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, and Mr. Billy Attley, former secretary general of SIPTU, are assisting the parties in the discussions.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the negative impact the industrial relations issue has on the morale of the staff of the agencies. Both management and SIPTU are committed to engaging actively in the direct discussions currently under way to secure a resolution of the issue.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that, in her haste to establish Enterprise Ireland last year by appointing the chair of the committee, the chief executive, and then introducing the legislation, all within a period of two to three months, she failed dismally to ensure the first year of operation of Enterprise Ireland would not be spent in sorting out staffing problems? Will she confirm that before the Authority was established, she was aware there was a difficulty with grading levels in the agency and that she had been warned the issue should be sorted out before the agency was established? Does she accept she failed to heed those warnings and established the agency, resulting in the current impasse? While the talks taking place in Malahide today are welcome, staff morale has been shattered by the fact that, for the first eight months of operation, it has not been possible to undertake decent, effective talks. Does the Minister accept that those of us in Opposition who warned her in July last year that the first six, eight or 12 months would be spent sorting out staffing problems, something which should have been done before the agency was established, have unfortunately been proved right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that. It is a matter for the Minister to lay down policy and put in place the legal framework. It is not a matter for the Minister to negotiate with staff about conditions and grades. As the Deputy knows, these problems date back to when the agencies were established in 1993-94. There are 45 different grades in the agency as a result of a lack of decision making at the time. The Minister lays down policy and puts in place the legal framework. That required in this case putting in place a board which in turn put in place the management and chief executive. None of that could have happened if the organisation and legal framework had not been in place. There would have been no one to negotiate and sort out problems. I hope they can be sorted out quickly. Matters should be conducted in the spirit of partnership. All the parties subscribe to Partnership 2000 and I hope, in the spirit of that partnership, matters can be resolved. It is good the parties have returned to direct discussions and that the industrial action has been withdrawn. In that context, a resolution will be found.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the industrial action is only withdrawn for a period of four weeks? Is she aware that some staff in the new agency earn as much as £10,000 more than others? What permission does the Minister have from her colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to allow her negotiate an upgrading of those currently working with people who earn £10,000 more than them?

      <P>The matter can be resolved within four weeks. The assistance of Mr. Hunter and Mr. Attley, together with the responsible attitude taken by the trade unions involved and management, will resolve the problem once and for all. It is important matters are settled in the calm atmosphere of direct discussions rather than on the floor of the House. As the Deputy knows, industrial action has only been suspended. That is normal in such matters, but the timeframe is sufficient to allow agreement to be reached.</P>

    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent months and IBI Corporate Finance has in the past week approached potential interested parties to ascertain the likely level of interest in acquiring IFI. Subject to agreement between the shareholders that this initial round of contacts demonstrates there is sufficient interest in the market <Col N="714" /> to justify proceeding at present, an information memorandum will be issued in the coming weeks to those parties who have expressed an interest and have signed a confidentiality agreement.</P>
    <P>Despite the current difficult conditions in the fertiliser industry, I am anxious to test the market at this stage with a view to securing a purchaser with a commitment to IFI as a fertiliser manufacturer and seeking safeguards regarding IFI operations and levels of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that the three plants will be kept open as a going concern? Will she include that as a proviso? What is she doing to ensure employment is kept to a maximum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that not too many preconditions are laid down. However, employment maximisation will be crucial to any decision made. We do not want someone to buy the plants and then close them down. I do not know if the three plants can be maintained. We have not yet had feedback from interested parties. I hope that will be forthcoming. Maximising employment will be the number one priority, and I have given that assurance to the union representatives I have met. I have undertaken to meet them again when we have more information.</P>
      <P>It may well be the case that the market conditions are not right at the moment to continue with the sale or to proceed along the lines of selling. It is a bad time in the fertiliser industry, and I do not know if there will be a good time in the foreseeable future. It may well be the case that, after IBI Corporate Finance reports it has spoken to interested parties, we may not proceed at this time with the sale. There must be a reasonable return to the Exchequer because all this has cost close to £400 million since the early 1980s. There must be a return which would warrant disposing of the company. Employment maximisation would certainly be the number one priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>What figure does the Minister have in mind for the sale? In asking that I do not want to put her in a position where she will tell us the price she is negotiating. What is the net debt at the moment and what does the Minister intend to do about it? How does she intend to handle it pending the sale of the company? What is ICI's position if the company is sold? Is the Minister aware of the position regarding the company's substantial pension fund? Will she give some guarantee that it will be safeguarded in the event of a sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures for the debt but, adding it to depreciation and other costs, we are talking of a sum well in excess of £300 million, which is the amount this matter has cost since the early 1980s. That is extraordinary. The debt will obviously have to be taken over by the State. The company is worth nothing in the region of £300 million. I do not want to say what <Col N="715" /> valuations we have been given because we want to get the best price. However, it falls far short of any such figure. I am aware of workers' concerns regarding the pension fund. That is a matter we would want to protect in any sale.</P>
      <P>While the agreement requires ICI to give the Government first option, it has no intention of buying the company's 49 per cent stake. We want to move together and there is an agreement to that effect. I have no reason to believe ICI will change its mind on the issue. We have had discussions with its chairman and officials are having ongoing discussions with its company executives. We have agreed to move towards its disposal together, which makes sense. Anyone who is interested in acquiring this company will want 100 per cent of it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the answer she gave today nearly mirrors the answer given on 1 October 1998, when it was stated that an information memorandum would be circulated to prospective purchasers? This sounds like the same answer the Minister gave today. Is she disappointed more progress has not been made? Will she confirm that the State-guaranteed NET debt is £167.95 million? Is that figure included in her Departmental budget? If the company is sold, as she is proposing to do, how will that money be found? Has she had any discussions with the Department of Finance about finding this money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debt relates to NET, not IFI and obviously they are separate companies. I envisage, as is normal in these circumstances, that the debt will be taken over by the State. The debt at the moment is about £172 million and this is rising quite rapidly. It is likely to rise to over £180 million very shortly.</P>

      <P>Yes. As regards the delay, these matters take a considerable length of time. There were protracted discussions between both sides on the share-out of the sale. The State wanted to do better than 51 per cent and we reached an agreement on the State return, which took some time. I am advised that from the time the information memorandum is prepared, if the interest is sufficient to warrant it, it will be about 20 weeks to full disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the report of the authorised officer relating to Garuda Limited, trading as Streamline Enterprises, on 14 December 1998. Relevant extracts from the report were subsequently forwarded to the company and Deputy <Col N="717" /> Lowry for comment by 1 February 1999. On 29 January last, a two week extension of this deadline was sought on the basis that the advice of counsel was still awaited. A one week extension to 5 p.m. on 8 February 1999 was given, but no comments have been received to date from either Garuda Limited or Deputy Lowry.</P>
      <P>Unless I receive the permission of the company to publish the report, I may disclose its contents only to certain parties under section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990. It will be appreciated that this precludes me from indicating to the House the significant issues that have arisen in this case. However, I plan to make a statement in due course indicating what decisions I have made on the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that under the legislation the Minister may not reveal to the House the findings of this report. Can she confirm information that is not in the report? Is it the case that the findings of the report relate to business and commercial transactions or is there a political dimension to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a company law investigation, not a political inquiry. None of the investigations I am conducting has political consequences because I am precluded from investigating matters which do not relate to companies. For example, I cannot investigate matters which relate to political parties, if that is what the Deputy is asking. I cannot confirm what is not contained in the report, because by confirming what is not in it, one is confirming what may or may not be in it. Serious issues have arisen; however, because this company consists of one person, I have to be fair to him. Therefore I am reluctant to say any more at this stage. If the company gives me permission to publish the report, I will be happy to do so. I have sought its permission and I do not know whether it will be forthcoming. However, I have some time to make decisions on this matter. If I have not received a response from the company by 8 February, and I do not know whether I will get one, I will make some quick decisions on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to politicise this issue because the company is a politician. The officer was not asked to look at any political decisions or those made as a Minister. The officer was asked to look at the accounts of the company, which is all that was done. Just as in the case of Celtic Helicopters or any other interim reports I have seen, no political matters or matters relating to <Col N="718" /> decisions made by politicians at any time are reflected or referred to in reports of that kind.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek clarification from the Minister. She said that she could publish the report if she got permission from the company; under which section of the Act is that the case and does it have the same implications for the companies to which I referred in my first question, Celtic Helicopters, Ansbacher etc? Has the Minister sought permission from any of those to publish reports? She appears to be making a slightly different case for the Garuda report than she did for any of the others. She did not mention in her replies relating to those companies that if she got permission from them she would publish the report; she implied her hands were completely tied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only report which has been completed. The same procedure will apply to all reports. Certainly I will not have one set of standards or rules for one person and a different set for others. The Act provides for publication with the consent of the affected parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Which section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. I think it is section 21, but I will confirm that. One can, with the permission of the parties, publish a report, and we sought permission in this case. This is the only final report which has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Celtic Helicopters reports I have received are interim reports. That report will not be com<Col N="719" /> pleted until we complete other investigations. I hope it can be completed soon because since then other investigations have been undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister referred the report on this company to the Moriarty tribunal? Has she referred it to any other competent authority? Has she had any response in that connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It has not been referred to anybody. The procedure is that when one receives a final draft report one has an option, and I have chosen to exercise the option, to send it to the affected party for comments. That is what has happened in this matter. I have not made a final decision on what to do with this report. I have not yet received the comments in reply from the company but if I do not get them shortly I will have to make decisions on this matter.</P>
      <P>The same applies with what I said earlier about tribunals. I cannot publish the report unless the company gives me permission. As I understand it, unless the Moriarty inquiry seeks it, I do not think I have permission to send it to that tribunal. I understand that it is not legally a court of competent jurisdiction in the sense that that is defined in the Act. I may seek further clarification on that matter. Clearly, there are other authorities to which one can send the report and I mentioned some of them earlier. I must consider shortly what to do.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 51, 103 and 139 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My visit to Japan, New Zealand and Australia <Col N="720" /> from 1 to 11 February, inclusive, had three main objectives: to develop export and investment opportunities in these markets, to strengthen bilateral political and economic relations with the countries concerned, and to raise Ireland's profile as a major exporting nation and as an excellent investment location in Europe. I was accompanied on the visit by six officials from my Department.</P>
    <P>During the course of my visit I met Prime Minister Obuchi in Tokyo, Prime Minister Shipley in Wellington, Deputy Premier MacNamara in Melbourne, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, Leader of the Japanese Liberal Party, and Mr. Kaoru Yosano, the Japanese Minister for International Trade and Industry. I also had a number of meetings with other Ministers in the New Zealand Government. I had 13 bilateral meetings, organised by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, aimed at encouraging increased trade and investment with potential clients. In addition, I gave some 14 interviews and public addresses aimed at raising awareness of Ireland as a trade and investment partner.</P>
    <P>In the course of the visit, I was pleased to announce the creation of 604 jobs and total investment of over £80 million by four Japanese companies. I am hopeful that further trade and investment opportunities will follow from my visit.</P>
    <P>In Melbourne, I led a delegation of six leading Irish technology companies which were seeking business opportunities in Australia's rapidly developing IT sector and who see Melbourne as an important platform for the development of their business. Enterprise Ireland signed a co-operation agreement with the Victorian State body responsible for the development of the IT sector.</P>
    <P>The visit also allowed me to make a first hand assessment of how best we can develop our foreign earnings interests in the Asia-Pacific region both now and in the longer term. I am determined to ensure that we develop trade and investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region and will keep the House informed of the Government's plans in this regard once its review of the Asia strategy report is completed.</P>

      <P>To refer back to Deputy Rabbitte's question, at the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce function I met executives of National Australia Bank who attended that function.

      <P>I met a number of the graduates who are doing well. Some of them are no longer graduates; they have key positions in many Japanese companies. I would be concerned that we should continue with that programme. It may not be the case that FÁS will continue with it. I hope to have some discussions with IBEC and other interested parties with a view to exploring how we can continue with what has been a useful programme. Clearly, from FÁS's point of view, at a time when there is a skills shortage in the Irish economy it seems strange that we would sponsor people to work in companies aboard. On the other hand valuable experience is gained and, indeed, some key investment decisions are made. In the case of one company I met where an investment decision is pending, it was a young Irish graduate who was the key to putting Ireland on the map. We must take all these matters into consideration. I hope to explore the matter with IDA Ireland and IBEC, which is interested in continuing this programme also, to see how we can ensure it continues.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister meet people working in incubator units, such as exist in Silicon Valley, in her journey to the Far East? If they do not exist there, has she plans to set them up because they seem a good idea?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We did not meet people involved with incubator units. Generally, they are associated with third level education facilities. I am conscious that many of the new venture capital funds which have been established recently are focused on commercialising what is happening in the third level sector. It is right that we should provide, both at third level where research is the key to some of the successful opportunities which can flow and by way of physical space, to make it easier for companies to grow. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who is involved in the science and technology area, has had a number of discussions about these matters with a large number of companies and educational interests.</P>

      <P>Donegal remains a priority for IDA Ireland and for the Government. There has been a great number of site visits by potential investors to the Donegal region in recent months, the highest number ever. I hope from those visits some successful projects will come. I have no plans to follow up on the meetings I had with companies. However, a group of Australian companies is coming to Ireland in June to seek twinning, joint venture or partnership arrangements with Irish counterparts in the software sector. I welcome this development because Irish companies can help their Australian counterparts to exploit opportunities in Europe and Australians can help Irish companies to exploit opportunities in Asia and the Pacific. It is right that we should maintain ongoing contacts, not only between companies in those regions but also between the two agencies responsible, Multi-Media Victoria, which is the state agency for indigenous industry in the state of Victoria and Enterprise Ireland.</P>

      <P>What was the Tánaiste's assessment and that of her advisers of the economic circumstances in Japan and its implications for <Col N="723" /> investment in this industry?

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My assessment of the Japanese economy is that it is the second wealthiest economy in the world and by far the wealthiest in that part of the world. Notwithstanding its difficulties, there are still major possibilities for Japanese investment in Ireland. That was one of the reasons for my visit. From the point of view of foreign investment from Asia, we have not done well for quite some time. There are now new opportunities from Japan and also from Taiwan which we hope to explore. The Japanese Government is to engage in fiscal expansionism over the next while with a view to stimulating the Japanese economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly did not work here. I do not know if the Japanese will have any more success than we did. Japan has much more wealth than we do. The financial problems there are very serious. My liberal friend had forthright views on how the problems should be solved. We had much in common but I do not know if he is in a position to progress the agenda at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deregulation, competition and tax reduction were very much on his mind and I agree with him. The lesson we can learn from Victoria and from New Zealand, where many of these measures have been embraced, is that they work in many different sorts of economies. We have approximately 70 Japanese companies in Ireland, 50 in manufacturing and about 20 in the financial services sector. There is potential for more projects in the financial services sector in the short-term and, I hope, for other companies in the longer term. Japanese companies are not functioning like American companies which are restructuring globally and in many cases consolidating their operations into one European country. In that context, Ireland will be an attractive and competitive location for investment from Japan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford is correct. The Border areas have not done as well as other parts of the country for very obvious reasons connected with violence in Northern Ireland. Their natural economic hinterland was cut off from them for 30 years. Yesterday, I had a meeting with the chief executive and chairman of the IDA to discuss, among other things, regional development. We spent much time discussing Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo and the rest of the Border region. There is much investment potential in what is called the pipeline and I hope some of it will go to places such as Cavan, Donegal and Sligo. That is the intention. Over the next few months we will see some decisions being taken.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1999: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to introduce my third Finance Bill to the House since taking office. The Bill is one of the largest Finance Bills ever published and contains a series of important initiatives which reform the tax system in favour of the lower paid, cut personal taxes for all taxpayers, introduce significant new tax reliefs, set a new agenda for tax relieved pension provision and strengthen considerably the powers of the Revenue to combat tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in making radical change when such change is desirable &ndash; not by short steps but by pushing out the frontier and challenging the accepted approach. I pursued this strategy in moving to tax credits &ndash; a move which was uni<Col N="732" /> versally welcomed. I am making the same structural changes in the pension area &ndash; changes which will be a challenge to the existing way of doing things and present new opportunities to providers of pension products. The changes, however, are in the interest of those who count, that is, the pensioner who has worked and saved to accumulate the pension fund.</P>
    <P>The proposals I set out in some detail last Thursday, when the details were published, and which I will introduce on Committee Stage, are fair, reasonable, balanced and well thought out. I was struck by the trepidation of the pensions sector which, before the Bill was published, rushed uncharacteristically to comment on proposals it had not even seen. I was also struck by the representations I have received from, and on behalf of, the pension clients who feel strongly that the current system offers too little choice and flexibility and, accordingly, does not seem to operate sufficiently in the customer's interest. I will return to this issue at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There are nearly 200 sections in the Bill. I do not intend to give a guided tour of each. Such a <i>tour de force</i> would take some considerable time. Much of the content of the Bill in volume terms is accounted for by a limited number of subjects &ndash; the dividend withholding tax, profit sharing schemes, stamp duty preconsolidation measures, rural renewal reliefs and Revenue powers, including measures in relation to offshore trusts, and I will concentrate on these. There are other provisions which occupy less space in the Bill but are, nonetheless, of significance and I will highlight them.</P>
    <P>The first part of the Bill deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. The first six sections set out the basic elements of the personal tax package announced in the budget. This package of nearly £600 million in a full year will cut the tax bill of every taxpayer, in particular the over 65s and those on lower pay. It removes 80,000 taxpayers from the tax net, 15,000 of whom are over 65.</P>
    <P>It delivers on the promises made to reduce the tax burden and to improve the position of the less advantaged in the community. It does so by a radical equalising of the benefits of personal tax allowances by converting these into tax credits at the standard rate of income tax. I signalled in my first budget that such a move was on the cards but this prognosis seems to have gone unnoticed in the commentaries by pundits on my 1998 budget.</P>
    <P>Other income tax changes include an extension of the tax allowance for the employment of a carer by wider family members. Employment of a carer will now also extend to the hire of a carer through an agency. Section 11 introduces a new tax relief in respect of funds raised by public subscription for persons who are totally and permanently incapacitated. This relief recognises both the needs of such persons and the desire of those who responded to the public appeal that the entire funds raised should be applied, without <Col N="733" /> deduction of tax, for the relief of the distress of the person concerned. The House will welcome this initiative.</P>
    <P>I also propose to increase substantially the amount of the basic tax exemption for non-statutory redundancy payments with effect from 1 December 1998. The basic exemption will increase from £6,000 plus £500 for each complete year of service, to £8,000 and £600 respectively. The increases reflect the change in the general level of wages and salaries since this relief was last amended in 1993.</P>
    <P>Other changes in this part include the removal of BIK on child care facilities and travel passes provided by employers and a reduction in the BIK charge on preferential loans.</P>
    <P>Part one of the Bill also makes a number of changes in tax administration by tightening up in section 16 the relevant contracts tax system, whereby tax is deducted at source in the case of certain subcontractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry industries. It is also proposed to level the playing field by requiring subcontractors from outside the State working here to produce tax clearance from their own tax authorities.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19, 20 and 21 make a number of changes to tax law to facilitate the introduction on a phased basis of new Revenue computer systems for dealing with taxpayers, the implementation over time of a consolidated tax billing procedure, and to tailor the penalties for late filing of the end of year return by employers &ndash; the P35 &ndash; to the length of the actual delay in meeting the due date for receipt of the return by Revenue.</P>
    <P>Section 17 increases substantially the annual amounts which may be claimed as a deduction for funding of retirement provision and the new pension arrangements which I announced last Thursday. The new limits range from 15 per cent of net relevant earnings to a maximum of 30 per cent, depending on the age of the contributor. The 30 per cent maximum also applies to persons in certain occupations and professions, irrespective of age, where there is a limited earnings span. The Bill lists a number of such occupations, relating to professional athletes in the main, but allows for this list to be extended by regulations to other specific occupations, if the Dáil approves. These limits will be subject to an earnings cap of £200,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>These increases in limits set the scene for the more basic changes in pension provisions which I intend to introduce on Committee Stage and which I set out in some detail in the summary of Finance Bill measures which I published on 11 February. These new pension measures give effect to the principles I set out in my budget day speech as my guiding aims in reforming the rules in this area. These principles were that the individual will not be restricted to only one pension option on retirement, will have the option of retaining ownership of' the capital sum invested on retirement, and will have a greater role in the <Col N="734" /> investment of accumulating funds during the contribution period.</P>
    <P>The new rules seek to give greater choice in how persons plan to fund their retirement, greater flexibility in how they use their accumulated funds and a greater say in how their pension scheme is run. At the same time, I will set down prudent requirements to preserve pension assets via the approved minimum retirement fund. I am also seeking to preserve the taxation principle whereby pension contributions and the investment fund, as it accumulates, are tax exempt while the draw-down or realisation of the fund is subject to tax. The system is usually referred to as exempt, exempt, taxed or EET for short.</P>
    <P>I will nonetheless take account of particularly sensitive areas in this tax treatment, namely, the position of the surviving spouse and minor children. I will also remove the rule which forces pensioners who wish to access their lump sums to take out an annuity at the same time. They will now be able to choose between the annuity and the new pension option for which I am making provision.</P>
    <P>Some will call these proposals radical. I call them sensible and pro-consumer. I have had a considerable input in forming my views from Members of this House, pension commentators, the pension industry, the experts in the Revenue Commissioners and the advisers in my own Department. In the final analysis, these proposals have my stamp on them and the approval of the Government. I look forward to the views of Members opposite on these proposals and to their constructive examination on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 22 inserts 13 new sections into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to implement the budget day announcement of the new withholding tax at the standard rate of 24 per cent in respect of dividends paid and other profit distributions made from 6 April 1999 by companies resident in the State. The Explanatory Memorandum sets out in some detail how the new tax will operate. The obligation to withhold tax is placed on the company paying the dividend or on an authorised withholding agent acting for the company.</P>
    <P>Certain exemptions are provided for in the case of dividends paid to Irish resident companies, charities, pension funds, certain persons resident in EU or tax treaty countries and to publicly quoted companies in such territories. Entitlement to these exemptions will have to be supported by particular documentary evidence from the recipients of the dividends.</P>
    <P>The rules for the application of the tax are thorough and detailed. They have been drawn up in consultation with company registrars and intermediaries who will have to apply the tax. The rules seek to ensure the relevant tax will be deducted and returned to Revenue while at the same time applying a system that takes account of the commercial realities and practical issues involved in the payment of dividends and distri<Col N="735" /> butions by, or on behalf of, companies in the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, in the case of Irish resident shareholders, dividend withholding tax deducted in a year of assessment can be set against the shareholder's tax liability for that year &ndash; the shareholder will be taxed on the gross dividend at his or her marginal rate and will get a credit for the tax withheld. Where the tax withheld exceeds that liability, the excess can be repaid to the taxpayer. A person who is not liable to tax and who has been charged withholding tax will thus be entitled to a full refund of the tax withheld.</P>
    <P>Sections 36 to 40 extend the termination dates for a number of tax relief schemes aimed at developing particular areas or locations in the State. These are the urban renewal scheme, the Temple Bar area scheme, the seaside resorts scheme and islands reliefs. In particular, following agreement with the EU Commission, section 36 will extend capital allowances in the Customs House Docks area from the scheduled termination date of 24 January 1999 up to 31 December 1999 and, in certain cases, where work on a project is well advanced at that latter date, the extension will run until 30 June 2000. This will allow the remaining development of the area, and the 12 acre extension to the area, to be completed.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment on our recent difficulties with the EU Commission in this matter. While the Commission has opened a procedure under the rules for State aids to investigate the applications of double rent relief and rates reliefs since 1993 in the area concerned, I believe we can defend this successfully and get a favourable outcome. These matters have to be negotiated, in the same way as the approval for the extension of the capital allowances was secured.</P>
    <P>My Department has been active in pursuing these issues as constructively as possible with the Commission. We have held detailed discussions with the interested developers here to keep them in the picture. Officials are in Brussels today to progress this case and to continue discussions on the commercial tax reliefs under the new urban and rural renewal schemes yet to be brought into force.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on one matter. Approval for State aids must be sought and secured from the Commission under Article 92 of the Treaty. These rules apply in the same manner to all member states. Ireland is not being singled out. The Commission has complete discretion in the granting or refusal of State aid approval. It is not an EU Council of Ministers matter.</P>
    <P>The Commission is becoming increasingly vigilant and pro-active where State aids take the form of tax relief. It produced new guidelines on State aids in this regard which it published last November setting out its approach and policy in regard to special tax reliefs and reductions. It has indicated that it will monitor, from a State aids <Col N="736" /> point of view, those tax relief measures notified by all the member states under the EU code of conduct on harmful tax competition. However, I should stress that in spite of our proposed single rate of corporation tax and the phasing out of our 10 per cent regime for manufacturing, the IFSC and Shannon have State aid clearance under the agreement between the Commission and the Irish Government last July.</P>
    <P>The Commission has not regarded tax reliefs for residential development as requiring State aid approval and, accordingly, I brought in these reliefs in the case of rural renewal last June and the introduction of the corresponding residential reliefs in the case of the new urban renewal scheme is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rural renewal scheme, I am proposing a number of changes to the scheme in section 41 to enhance the residential tax reliefs in particular. The main changes involve the granting of a relief in respect of expenditure, incurred by an individual in the period 6 April 1999 to 31 December 2001, on the construction or refurbishment of owner-occupied residential accommodation in a qualifying rural area.</P>
    <P>The relief consists of an annual deduction from total income for tax purposes of an amount equal to 5 per cent in the case of construction expenditure and, in the case of refurbishment expenditure, 10 per cent of the expenditure incurred. The individual incurring the expenditure must be the first owner and occupier of the dwelling after the expenditure has been incurred. The relief available under the section may be claimed in each of the first ten years of the life of the dwelling following construction or refurbishment provided the dwelling is the sole or main residence of the individual.</P>
    <P>In addition, I propose changes to the section 23 relief for rented residential accommodation in the area. At present, to qualify for the section 23 type allowances available under the rural renewal scheme, the lease of the property in question must be for a minimum period of one year. This minimum period is now being reduced to three months. Again, to qualify for these allowances, the premises were restricted to a maximum floor area of 125 square metres. This limit is now being increased to 140 square metres for newly constructed premises while, in the case of converted and refurbished property, the maximum increases to 150 square metres. I view these extensions as a major fillip to the scheme and a clear incentive to investors to invest in the development of the areas in Leitrim, Longford, Cavan, Sligo and Roscommon covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>Sections 42, 43 and 44 provide for the new capital allowances for expenditure on private convalescent facilities and on employer based child care facilities and the granting of section 23 relief for third level student accommodation. I accept these new tax reliefs may run counter to the general policy aim of reducing the range of reliefs and widening the tax base. Nonetheless, if there are clear and desirable social objectives to be <Col N="737" /> secured, as all will agree is the case with health, child care and housing, we should not rule out the use of tax reliefs in a targeted and prudent manner to achieve those aims.</P>
    <P>Section 45 is a similar type of relief under section 843 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to encourage private investment in the provision of third level buildings by providing capital allowances to investors who put up 50 per cent of the funds. This relief was introduced in 1997. I am proposing two changes in this section. First, the termination date for the scheme of relief is being extended from 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2002. Second, the scheme will apply to projects funded by the research and development fund announced by the Minister for Education and Science last November and, to fit into the way the fund will operate, the section enables the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education and Science to delegate the approval mechanism for such projects qualifying for section 843 relief to the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 52 deals with a number of tax issues arising under the special Government bond exchange programme being undertaken by the NTMA. This will involve the exchange of certain high coupon Government bonds currently trading at a substantial premium for new bonds which reflect the current lower levels of interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions analogous to rollover relief to allow any tax change arising on the bond exchange to be computed at the current rates of tax but defer payment until the new bonds are either redeemed or sold. The interest on the new bonds will be taxed in the normal way. The aim of this tax treatment is to ensure that the net present value of the tax flow arising to the Exchequer from the new bonds is essentially the same as from the existing ones, thus preserving tax neutrality in the exchange programme.</P>
    <P>Section 54 extends the tax relief on investment in films for a further year to 5 April 2000. The film sector is reading all sorts of unwarranted negative signals into this limited extension claiming that it puts the future continuation of the relief into question, but this is not the case. As I made clear in the summary of Finance Bill measures published on 11 February, there are a number of reports on the operation of the film relief which are to be published shortly and which the Government wishes to consider more fully. One such major report, the INDECON Report, which was received in November, supports the continuation of the relief subject to a number of modifications to help better focus and target Exchequer resources in this area. I hope this clarification calms things down in the film sector.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5, that is sections 61 and 62, provides for the introduction of a new savings-related employee share option scheme and for changes to existing tax reliefs on employee share ownership trusts. I remind the House that in my Budget Statement I made it clear that there had been a number of calls for new profit sharing initiatives <Col N="738" /> and that I was not opposed to reasonable proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>I made the point that, if profit-related pay makes economic sense to employers and employees from a profit and pay point of view, it should need no tax relief from the State to encourage it to be put into practice. It should also be recognised by all that there are tax planning opportunities in schemes of tax-relieved profit-related pay.</P>
    <P>My approach in this area is based on a number of criteria. First, any profit sharing schemes should be open to all employees on similar terms. Second, they should provide an opportunity for employees to acquire an equity stake in their firm. There should be a medium to longer-term aspect to profit sharing schemes in the form of the delivery of benefits in the future for efficiency improvements undertaken now.</P>
    <P>Section 61 provides for a new save as you earn, or SAYE, scheme, which is modelled on a similar scheme in the UK. The SAYE scheme will provide for employees to save for a certain period to acquire shares in their employer company. The shares are acquired under options which may be granted by the employer at a discount to the market price at the start of the savings period. Any gain on such shares when the option is exercised will be free of income tax but will be subject to capital gains tax if the shares are sold.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the SAYE scheme must be available to all employees on similar terms and that any minimum service requirement for qualification may not exceed three years. This is currently five years in other profit sharing schemes, but I plan to reduce this to three years for all schemes on Committee Stage. Employees may save for a period of three, five or seven years, the interest or bonus on such saving will be tax free, a wide range of financial institutions may qualify as savings media for SAYE and the discount on the price of shares at the time the option is granted may be up to 25 per cent. These terms and conditions were decided after consultation with IBEC and ICTU.</P>
    <P>Section 62 contains a number of amendments to the legislation in respect of both employee share ownership trusts, ESOTs and approved profit sharing schemes. Specifically the Bill will allow those employees who leave a company in the first five years of the ESOT to benefit from the allocation of shares in the company to the trust for a period of up to 15 years after the ESOT is established. The normal benefit period for ex-employees in ESOTs and approved profit sharing schemes is 18 months after leaving.</P>
    <P>An ESOT will operate usually by borrowing funds to acquire shares in a company and releasing these to employees after several years when the debt to the lenders is run off. To acknowledge this structure section 62 allows employees to take up to £30,000 in shares tax free in year ten, or a later year. This ties in with the current Telecom ESOT and its likely timetable for distribution of shares in the ESOT as security for borrowings. In <Col N="739" /> this situation the £30,000 limit will replace, on a once-off basis, the normal annual £10,000 limit.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also provide an exemption to CGT for the trustees of the ESOT on the proceeds of disposal of shares to the extent that such proceeds are used to repay borrowings of the trustees taken out to acquire shares in the company concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 63 provides 100 per cent capital allowances for the establishment of park and ride facilities in the larger urban areas to help alleviate traffic congestion. The principal change in this provision since it was proposed in the budget is the extension of the allowances to commercial and residential development associated with the park and ride facility subject to the residential element of any project not exceeding 25 per cent of total allowable expenditure and the residential and commercial elements combined not exceeding 50 per cent of that expenditure. It has been put to me that the park and ride facility on its own would not be attractive to investors without this associated physical development. The park and ride scheme will last for three years.</P>
    <P>Sections 64 to 67 give legislative effect to the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax on trading income from 32 per cent in 1998 to 12.5 per cent in 2003 and to the provisions of the agreement reached between the Government and the European Commission last July on the phasing out of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and for certified activities in the IFSC and in the Shannon Airport Zone.</P>
    <P>Section 66 identifies income to which a 25 per cent rate of corporation tax will apply from 1 January 2000. These legislative provisions will copperfasten the corporation tax regime in this State. This new regime conforms to EU state aid rules and with the EU code of conduct on harmful tax competition.</P>
    <P>Sections 75 and 76 deal with the problem of Irish registered non-resident companies. The use of such companies for questionable purposes by persons with no connection with this State was debated at great length and in some detail this time last year. The Government undertook to come up with a comprehensive package of company law and tax measures to get rid of the undesirable exploitation of such companies, while at the same time not ruling out the legitimate use of a non-resident structure for acceptable business purposes.</P>
    <P>The measures in this Bill will be complemented by action to be taken by the Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and commerce under company law in a companies Bill to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The company law measures will provide that as a precondition of incorporation, every new company must show that it intends to carry on an activity in the State before it will be registered; every company will be required on incorporation to have either an Irish resident director or to provide a bond to the value of £20,000 as surety in <Col N="740" /> the event of the company failing to comply with company law and tax requirements; the number of directorships that any one person can hold will be limited to 25, subject to certain exemptions, to curb the use of nominee directors as a means of disguising beneficial ownership or control; and more effective powers will be available to strike off companies where they fail to make the statutory annual return to the Companies Registration Office or to register with the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>On the tax side, section 75 will make registration in the State equate with tax residence for all companies. This will apply to new companies incorporated on or after the date of publication of the Bill and for existing companies from 1 October 1999.</P>
    <P>This will not be the case where the company, or a related company, is carrying on a trade in the State and either the company is ultimately controlled by residents of an EU member state or a tax treaty country, or the company or the related company is quoted on a recognised stock exchange. In such cases, tax residence will continue to be based on where the company is managed and controlled.</P>
    <P>Section 76 provides that a company which is incorporated but not tax resident in the State will be required to identify the territory in which it is tax resident, to say whether the company or a related company is trading in this State and to identify the ultimate beneficial owners of the company where the company is claiming non-residence because of treaty provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also enable the Revenue Commissioners to give the Registrar of Companies details of those companies which fail to comply with the new Revenue information requirements to enable such companies to be struck off the company register, if appropriate. I intend to introduce further provisions on Committee Stage which will complement the provisions to be introduced under the Companies Amendment Bill on the requirement to appoint an Irish resident director or provide a bond to the value of £20,000. The Committee Stage amendment will provide that, where a company fails to pay penalties for failure to meet certain tax and company law compliance obligations, these penalties may be recovered from an Irish resident director of the company. Where a company does not have an Irish resident company director, any such penalties will be recoverable from the £20,000 bond already referred to.</P>
    <P>This is an extensive, comprehensive and focused set of measures to deal with the malpractices in this area and to allow Revenue identify and deal effectively with cases of abuse. It is a far better solution than that attempted in the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Sections 80 to 83 introduce new provisions dealing with offshore trusts and companies. These provisions will tighten up the legislation in place since 1974 to ensure that gains made by such <Col N="741" /> trusts and companies are effectively taxed in the hands of taxpayers who are domiciled and resident or ordinarily resident in the State. The law in this area is in need of some up-dating.</P>
    <P>Irish tax law is similar to the corresponding UK legislation but has not kept up with the changes and adjustments that have been made in that jurisdiction. There is some evidence that the use of such trusts is growing as a means of avoiding Irish tax and the present deficiencies in the Irish legislation compared to the UK are being taken advantage of and advertised by tax advisers.</P>
    <P>The Bill tackles the main avoidance issue by imposing an exit charge under CGT on trusts moving offshore, applying more stringent provisions for attributing gains to resident beneficiaries, limiting exemptions from tax for beneficiaries disposing of an interest in a trust, and requiring more information to be returned to Revenue in relation to offshore trusts. I am happy these changes will close a potential avenue for tax avoidance which would have become increasingly attractive as personal wealth in Ireland continues to grow given our rapid economic expansion in recent years.</P>
    <P>Under the customs and excise provisions in Part II, sections 84 to 99 consolidate and modernise the excise legislation relating to mineral oils, namely, petrol, diesel and other heating and fuel oils. This oil legislation has been amended and supplemented on many occasions since the original 1930s legislation to the extent that it has become very fragmented and difficult to follow. The various sections deal with the rates of excise, the charging of excise, reliefs and abatements, excise licensing requirements, control procedures, prosecutions and offences.</P>
    <P>The excise duty and VRT changes are implemented in sections 100 to 106, as announced in the budget. In the case of the VRT changes contained in section 105, it is interesting to note that despite the increase in rates on cars over 1400 ccs from 1 January, the level of new car registrations in January 1999 was 21 per cent up on the same month in 1998. On the cut in betting tax, section 106 provides that the new rate of 5 per cent will come into effect by order made by the Minister. In the budget I linked the implementation of this cut to the agreement by the trade of satisfactory alternative arrangements to replace the on-course levy which funds the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon. Discussions are at an advanced stage on proposals to put in place these new arrangements and I will announce these shortly.</P>
    <P>The VAT changes in this year's Bill are limited in extent and mainly technical in nature, apart from the increase in the farmers' flat rate of VAT from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent from 1 March 1999, and the associated similar increase in the VAT livestock rate announced in the budget. The VAT changes deal in the main with the removal of a double VAT charge on certain HP transactions and sales of secondhand agricultural machinery, the tightening up of certain VAT <Col N="742" /> charging and control provisions and implementation of an EU directive on the VAT treatment of gold held for investment purposes.</P>
    <P>A considerable part of the Bill, namely, sections 126 to 180, deals with stamp duty changes. This is an area of taxation which normally attracts limited attention. The present stamp duty code goes back to 1891. Stamp duties were first introduced to the UK by William of Orange who brought the idea from Holland where they had proved to be a very effective source of revenue. The application of stamp duties in the 1891 Act was seen as a radical and progressive form of taxation requiring those who transferred property by deed to make a substantial contribution to the Exchequer. This was a source of irritation to the better off at that time. I recognise the contribution William of Orange has made to the Exchequer in recent years, something which is appropriate given that he is often referred to in a less than complimentary light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>His father was.</P>
      <P>Stamp duties still contribute a significant amount of tax revenue to the Exchequer. The yield has risen by 90 per cent in the past three years, from £286 million in 1995 to £541 million in 1998, reflecting economic growth and the increasing value of property. It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that stamp duty legislation, which was last consolidated in 1891, is kept up to date and that any potential loopholes are closed off.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, it is proposed to publish a Bill later this year to consolidate all stamp duty legislation since 1891. In advance of this it is necessary to make a number of changes to stamp duty law in the Finance Bill. These measures, which are in the main technical, include repealing a number of redundant sections as well as standardising all references to fines and penalties so that there is a clear distinction between civil penalties and criminal offences. In addition, penalties which are set at a nominal amount, for example, £10 or £20, will be increased to more realistic levels. Further, the rate of interest which will apply when stamp duty relief is being clawed back will be standardised at 1 per cent per month. These are substantive changes to the law which cannot be included in the consolidation Bill under the legislative rules applying to such Bills.</P>
      <P>Apart from this there are a number of other changes being made in the area of stamp duty. One of these relates to the application of surcharges for incorrectly estimating the value of the residential element of a mixed residential and commercial use property to avail of lower stamp duty rates. This change is a consequence of new rates which apply for residential property since the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will also put on a statutory basis a concession in place since 1996 relating to interest charged on any capital acquisitions tax clawed <Col N="743" /> back from a taxpayer under the provisions relating to agricultural relief. Under the concession, interest is charged only from the date of the event giving rise to the clawback and not from the date of the original acquisition. Similar treatment will be given to other CAT reliefs, for example, business relief, and to the stamp duty reliefs for company reconstructions and intra-group transfers and young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions governing Revenue powers which have been subject to much recent comment. Sections 189 and 190 provide additional powers to Revenue to facilitate greater access to material held by or in financial institutions, including in certain cases in non-resident accounts, where this information is necessary to pursue tax liabilities. There are also provisions to enable Revenue to obtain a greater range of information from third parties in relation to persons with whom they have dealings and to require a taxpayer to provide fuller information to Revenue on their own tax affairs, including answering specific questions put by a tax inspector.</P>
    <P>The Bill also augments the current provisions requiring a person to give a full statement of their financial affairs and of their assets and liabilities. These proposed new powers will add considerably to the statutory powers of the Revenue Commissioners in all tax areas. They are in response to recent tax investigations and are based on experience of the gaps in powers which have been identified in following up such investigations.</P>
    <P>I indicated on previous occasions that the wisest course might be to await the findings of the Moriarity tribunal. The tribunal was asked among other things to make recommendations in this area. Events have moved apace and the Government considered it necessary in the interest of reassuring the public, to propose new powers at this time. It is the intention to review the matter further when the report and recommendations of that tribunal are available. I have no doubt the tribunal will make a valuable contribution in this connection.</P>
    <P>In relation to access to persons' accounts in financial institutions, the Bill proposes to broaden existing powers of access to accounts of named individuals where Revenue has reasonable grounds to believe there is information in the possession of the financial institution relating to the taxpayer's liability to tax. These new powers of access will include resident and ordinarily resident individuals, companies, trusts and connected persons, not just individuals who are ordinarily resident in the State; cover all tax heads and not just income tax and corporation tax as at present; extend to accounts held by unidentified persons or classes of persons, not just named individuals as at present; allow access to non-resident accounts in cases where there is reason to believe the true owner is resident, and extend the definition of &ldquo;bankers' books&rdquo; to include relevant sup<Col N="744" /> plementary information in a financial institution's possession, such as background documentation.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will also be able to examine the procedures and systems of financial institutions in relation to non-resident DIRT free accounts and to examine a sample of non-resident accounts to ensure they are genuine. The Bill will also empower the Revenue in specific criminal investigations to gain access to accounts in the same manner as the Garda currently can in criminal investigations. Finally, the Bill will permit Revenue to conduct on-site audits of a banks affairs, not just a PAYE or VAT audit as at present.</P>
    <P>For clarification, the accounts referred to in the Bill include accounts in banks, building societies and other deposit taking institutions such as credit unions. This wide range of deposit taking institutions is already covered by the existing Revenue powers of access to individual accounts.</P>
    <P>Under current law, the Revenue Commissioners must seek the approval of the High Court or the Appeal Commissioners for access to the account of a named individual who is ordinarily resident in the State. The Bill will allow for such access to be secured by an order issued by one of the three Revenue Commissioners. In the case of accounts held by unidentified persons or classes of persons, and non-resident accounts, it will still be necessary to secure High Court or Appeals Commissioners approval. These arrangements are comparable to the situation found in many other countries. They bring us more into line with other countries rather than ahead of them as some media comments have suggested.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed in certain quarters that this new provision will be misused, and that the Revenue Commissioners will engage in trawling exercises of all and every account. This will not be the case. The powers will be used responsibly. The focus will be on tax evasion. There will have to be <i>prima facie </i>evidence of suspected evasion in the possession of Revenue before the Revenue Commissioners seek access.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have assured me they will exercise these powers and grant orders only in those cases where it is necessary and where there are firm reasons to believe there is material and particular information held in the deposit taking bodies in question. Revenue will give notice to the taxpayer concerned and, if necessary, the taxpayer can take court action for judicial review.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have also assured me there will be appropriate checks and balances to ensure that only properly authorised and trained Revenue personnel will have access to any new powers. The chairman of the Commissioners has already publicly indicated on RTE radio last week that the new proposed powers would not be focused on smaller cases; he saw these powers as providing the means to restore public confidence in the tax collection system which has been sever<Col N="745" /> ely dented by the revelations of the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Taxation has called for the appointment of a special tax ombudsman to ensure any new powers are not abused. There is no history in this country of the Revenue Commissioners abusing powers given to them by the Oireachtas. Second, the Ombudsman already has a remit in Revenue matters and dealt with some 130 complaints on tax matters last year. Third, there are existing procedures for a taxpayer to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and to the courts. Fourth, Revenue has standing procedures for internal review &ndash; by a senior officer unconnected with the case &ndash; where a taxpayer is unhappy with the actions of a tax inspector. While I do not see the need for a special tax ombudsman at this juncture, the matter will, nonetheless, be kept under review in the light of the experience in the operation of these new powers.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to preserve the balance between the legitimate expectation of taxpayers to go about their business without unwarranted intrusion and the need to empower Revenue to tackle the episodes of tax evasion which have caused such recent public concern and anxiety. This balance is essentially a matter of political judgment. That is, in the final analysis, an assessment which can only be made by this House and reflected in the legislation passed by the public representatives assembled here.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear. One cannot beat one's breast about tax evasion and, at the same time, be horrified when the powers to combat tax evasion are sought and given. This is a perennial issue. This ambivalence has arisen on each occasion when it is proposed that Revenue powers be widened significantly. The last such occasion was section 153 of the Finance Bill, 1995, in relation to the famous whistle blowers' charter requiring tax advisers of various sorts to report tax evasion by the their clients to Revenue. I am sure we will have a thorough and frank debate in this House on where we want to go in this area and I look forward to the constructive input of Deputies on all sides.</P>
    <P>There are many other important proposals in the Bill which I have not found time to mention in these opening remarks. All sections of the Bill can be gone into in detail on Committee Stage. I have suggested to the chairman of the committee that we might take three days this year compared to the two days allocated to the 1998 Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is voluminous work. It contains 196 sections and when it first hit the desk, I thought we would be debating it until the summer recess. Like all Finance Bills, it implements the decisions of the budget. It is not as intimidating as it first appears, however, as in excess of 40 sections are technical ones on stamp duty which are necessary to prepare the way for a stamp duty Bill later in the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a number of new announcements on Thursday last when the Finance Bill was published. Some of these are fully dealt with in the Finance Bill, some are partially dealt with and others are not dealt with at all. In debating the latter, we are relying on the Minister's press statement and his speech today.</P>
      <P>In general terms, it is very bad practice to introduce new material involving serious policy issues by way of amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. It is unfair to the House, particularly to the Deputies who contribute to the debate. It makes it very difficult for the House to discharge its responsibilities in full. The Government is responsible to the Oireachtas. The Government proposes and the Parliament disposes, is the principle on which we operate, and if the House does not have proposals in sufficient time to give them serious, detailed, informed consideration then it cannot discharge its constitutional responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In modern finance legislation, to be informed is to get the assistance of outside practitioners. If we do not get the proposals until the eve of Committee Stage, then a travesty of parliamentary responsibility is being visited on the House. I want a commitment from the Minister that he will circulate the new sections to the Finance Bill, which he announced by way of press statement last Thursday, as quickly as possible. I would like them this week, certainly not later than Friday.</P>
      <P>I discussed the Minister's budgetary decisions on budget day and will debate some of them again this afternoon, but initially I will give priority to the new proposals by the Minister. The Minister's proposes to give significant extra powers to the Revenue Commissioners. Against the background of the news from the tribunals, the findings of the McCracken tribunal and the various banking tax evasion scandals, particularly those in NIB and AIB, no Minister for Finance could have come before this House without taking measures to prevent tax evasion. The Minister would be politically naked if, in present circumstances, he were not prepared to give the Revenue Commissioners the additional powers they say they need to do their job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister's predecessors have come into the House looking for extra powers. On all occasions the Fine Gael Party treated the proposal reasonably, and were generally in support of granting additional powers to the Revenue. For some time, compliant taxpayers have not been prepared to continue <Col N="747" /> with a situation where they are always being required to divvy up on a full PAYE basis, while persons whose lifestyle would suggest they have significantly more resources seem to lead a charmed life and to possess some type of cloaking device which makes them invisible to the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, Fine Gael agrees with the new powers in principle, but we have serious concerns about the efficacy, legality and timing of the proposals.  The Minister for Finance will have to be more convincing on Committee Stage than on Second Stage when Fine Gael intends to scrutinise the relevant sections of the Finance Bill in detail.</P>
    <P>The major tax evasions which have been brought to our attention by the recent spate of scandals are directly centred in the banking system. NIB designed a type of broker bond which was sold to customers for the sole purpose of evading tax. NIB received a handling charge and commission well in excess of the economic cost of the transaction, and out of line with rates applying to legitimate transactions. The motive for the bank as an institution was to increase banking profits and, for the individual bank employees, the motive was to comply with the culture of the bank, to enhance their promotion prospects and to benefit from the commission which resulted from the sale of the product.</P>
    <P>The evasion of DIRT through the use of bogus non-resident accounts was an industry wide problem. This is the subject of an inquiry by a committee of the House in association with the Comptroller and Auditor General. At initial hearings of the committee a conflict of evidence emerged between the Revenue Commissioners and the AIB. Whatever the final outcome, a number of facts have been established. There was widespread evasion of DIRT by all the main banks through the use of bogus offshore accounts. The initiative came from the banks and was endemic in the system, led by management and promoted by all relevant employees. The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals have shown that if the activities of Mr. Des Traynor resulted in tax evasion, he was acting more in his role as banker than accountant when he was most devastatingly effective.</P>
    <P>All we have learned from the scandals would suggest that the essential element in large-scale tax evasion is that the banks collude with their customers to enhance their liquidity and profitability, the primary purpose of tax evasion, with their customers being the consequent beneficiaries. The banks are the designers and promoters of the financial products, mechanisms or accounts used for the purpose of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>When these facts are taken into account the Minister's response appears weak. He seeks to open up the bank accounts of individuals to scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners and to impose severe penalties on professionals, solicitors and accountants, who advise and assist tax<Col N="748" /> payers in ordering their affairs. He is removing from these professionals, under pain of criminal sanction, privileges of confidentiality which they have traditionally enjoyed. It is the banks, however, which have systematically promoted tax evasion, colluded with their customers and are now being found out. The Minister is missing the target. The new powers are stringent and while they may be effective against the small fry, the big sharks, swimming in the protection of the banking system, will continue to escape, not because the Revenue Commissioners are bad with a harpoon but because they and the Minister have identified the wrong target.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be in a better position to introduce measures if the reports and recommendations of the various tribunals and inquiries were available. The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal require it to report on these matters. To my knowledge, the NIB inquiry has not yet reported &ndash; there is no evidence that it has. Does the Tánaiste have a copy of its report, to which she refers obliquely in television interviews? Do some of the proposals arise from it? Are there recommendations on tax evasion and, if so, does the Minister have access to the report? The inquiries of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts into the non-payment of DIRT have not concluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proceeded for political reasons ahead of a series of reports whose recommendations would enable him to legislate more effectively. I understand the reasons he is making these proposals but he or his successor will have to return to the House before the end of the year when the various reports and their recommendations have been published and scrutinised.</P>
    <P>The powers being sought on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners may lead to legal difficulties. The right to privacy and to natural justice cannot be set aside lightly. In exercising these new powers the Revenue Commissioners should follow a fair and systematic process known and transparent to practitioners and taxpayers and endorsed by the House. The Minister, by way of statutory regulation, or the Revenue Commissioners, by way of statement of practice, should put in place a transparent procedural process under which these powers will be invoked. I would prefer the Minister to do this by way of statutory regulation and the Revenue Commissioners to subsequently issue a statement of practise based on the Minister's regulations. This would reduce the possibility of a successful legal challenge. The right to privacy and to natural justice and other personal rights in the Constitution may be transgressed for good and sufficient reason.</P>
    <P>Individuals can be protected from draconian powers by a well ordered and agreed process. If this is not done, there will be legal difficulties. In no circumstances would it be proper for the Revenue Commissioners to engage in a trawl of taxpayers' accounts. That would not stand up to <Col N="749" /> legal challenge. The Minister repeated the assurances of the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that the powers will not be used in this way. The Revenue Commissioners should be required to rely on evidence of evasion, no matter how slight. On Committee Stage I will press the Minister to indicate clearly the trigger mechanism which will allow the Revenue Commissioners to examine the bank accounts of individuals.</P>
    <P>For generations the conversations of solicitors and their clients have been privileged. Solicitors will now be required not alone to produce documents given to them by their clients, if the Revenue Commissioners are inquiring into possible tax evasion, but to produce minutes or notes of conversations with their clients. It is difficult to see how a solicitor can deal with a client when he or she knows that documents the client may produce as well as notes of confidential conversations may be the subject of a discovery order by the Revenue Commissioners. He or she will have to inform the client in advance that he or she may have to report the subject of conservations to the Revenue Commissioners. It requires no great imagination to foresee the consequences of such a warning.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will confirm that many tax evasion schemes and mechanisms are first brought to their notice by solicitors and other tax practitioners who advise clients to put their houses in order and start afresh. Were it not for honest professionals, the Revenue Commissioners may remain blind to the latest tax evasion fashion. In removing their privileges the Minister should ensure he hits the target and does not make the situation worse.</P>
    <P>As I understand the law, it is a criminal offence to assist taxpayers to evade tax in Ireland. It is not, however, a criminal offence for tax professionals in other jurisdictions to assist Irish taxpayers to evade tax through the use of mechanisms and products available in other jurisdictions. I have no doubt the new powers will be effective in chasing small offenders. However, those involved in large scale tax evasion may avail of the services of foreign practitioners. There is a gap in the law as these powers are given to the Revenue Commissioners. If the Minister strengthens the domestic powers he has no protection from those who go abroad. For these purposes, abroad is a 45 minute drive to Newry. We are not talking about people going to far flung fields. We are talking about a trot up the road. Those drafting this legislation should examine this issue before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Large scale systematic tax evasion, as distinct from small scale tax evasion in the black economy, which involves millions of pounds, is still prevalent in Ireland but is a Europe-wide rather than a nationwide problem. This is even more the case since we entered the euro in January. Consequently, successful attempts to counteract serious tax evasion must be promoted on a European basis. That basis should be a greater European basis rather than an EU basis. The Minister <Col N="750" /> should raise this issue at ECOFIN to see if procedures can be put in place in respect of the evasion we suspect is taking place and of which we have a certain amount of evidence thanks to the tribunals, particularly McCracken and Moriarty tribunals.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his attempts to counteract tax evasion and Fine Gael will not be found wanting in assisting him. However, these proposals will not be effective. I understand the political pressure on the Minister to produce measures but he would have aimed his gun with greater accuracy if he had the benefit of the recommendations of Moriarty, the NIB report, and the inquiry by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee into evasion of DIRT.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposals relating to the use of companies incorporated within the State by non-residents who have no personal or business connections with the State, for whatever purpose these accounts are held. There are varying estimates of the number of Irish-registered, non-resident companies. There are also various legitimate and illegitimate explanations of why there are so many such accounts. Legitimate explanations range from fraud to international crime, drug cartels, money laundering, the international arms business and tax evasion. Whatever explanation there may be for any individual accounts, their number and the shadowy nature of whatever activity they engage in are a blot on the Irish financial landscape which can no longer be tolerated by Ireland or our European partners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal in so far as I understand them. However, my initial point is also relevant in this instance. It is difficult to discuss his proposals in any detail as he has indicated he will introduce additional proposals on Committee Stage and that the main bulk of the proposals he outlined today will be a matter for the Companies (Amendment) Bill to be introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. This is bad parliamentary practice. This Parliament is not able to properly do its job if proposals put forward by Government are not provided in sufficient time to enable Members engage in detailed, informed debate.</P>
    <P>These proposals involve major issues of policy which add several sections of tax legislation but which are being introduced on Committee Stage. The Oireachtas cannot do its job properly when amendments are the subject of time motions on Committee and Report Stages, as they will be, and when all amendments, except those in the name of the Minister, fall when the allocated time has elapsed. In such circumstances the concept of parliamentary scrutiny of Government decisions is a sick joke. It is bad enough when we see proposals on Second Stage. However, in this case we have to wait until the eve of Committee Stage and then the debate is the subject of a time motion so that all amendments fall except those in the Minister's name.</P>
    <P>There are serious financial proposals involving <Col N="751" /> every area in this legislation which will not be the subject of any scrutiny. They go from their originators in the Department of Finance to the draftsman's office, are read into the record by the Minister on Second Stage, and circulated in documents without being scrutinised by any Member of this Parliament. We then have to take responsiblity for tax laws to which we have contributed nothing. That is not good enough. There are proposals on non-resident accounts, pensions and innumerable other suggestions made by the Minister which have been kicked to touch until Committee Stage. The pretence is that they will be scrutinised in detail on Committee Stage but that does not happen. They fall and any votes taken are often on an omnibus basis whereby amendments are not taken individually.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to bring these proposals forward at an early stage. I appreciate the pressures on officials in the Department of Finance and the parliamentary draftsman's office, particularly at this time of year. I understand there are occasions when it is not physically possible to have all proposals ready for the date of publication of the Finance Bill. The dates of that Bill are set by legislative procedure, deadlines must be met and additional material must sometimes be introduced at a later stage. However, if the Minister legislates in haste he will repent at leisure.</P>
    <P>On this occasion he is proposing sufficient additional material which is not yet ready, to justify a second Finance Bill before the summer recess. If he had proceeded on the basis of a second Finance Bill we would be more effective as parliamentarians in ensuring that the legislation is water tight and that the extra powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners will be effective.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are doing a good job. They operate within legal constraints and have a significant portfolio of powers which sometimes they do not adequately use. They do not carry out a sufficient number of random audits. We have moved to a self-assessment system for the self-employed since the late 1980s. The self-employed have more latitude to evade and avoid tax than PAYE taxpayers who have no such latitude. Human flesh is weak and many of those on self-assessment will give way to temptation if they do not fear discovery by the Revenue Commissioners for evading tax or making incorrect returns. The number of random audits being carried out is so small as to be derisory. It does not put fear into anyone on self-assessment. Someone on self-assessment has almost as good a chance of winning the lottery as of being the subject of a random audit by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>That is not how self-assessment operates in the US or how it was intended to operate when US advisers recommended we introduce a self-assessment system. Anyone familiar with the US system knows it is an efficient tax collection system because there is such fear of the internal revenue. <Col N="752" /> Self-assessment systems only operate if there is such fear. There is no fear of the revenue unless there are a sufficient number of random audits. The chances of escaping are so high that the sanction is very limited and the Minister should examine this situation.</P>
    <P>The last time I raised this issue I was told the Revenue Commissioners did not have sufficient staff. In their last report they implied they would like to carry out more random audits but did not have enough staff. We should not constantly talk about extra powers. The Revenue Commissioners need the powers to do the job but if they lack resources the Minister should provide them so we do not have a Statute Book full of powers which cannot be implemented. This would also address the Minister's point about keeping public opinion on side and the populist calm against the background of scandals. The Revenue Commissioners need resources to exercise their powers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals on pensions which he made on budget day and also the more detailed proposals announced last Thursday. However, the only details we have are the press statement and the Minister's speech. The proposals are not in the Finance Bill and we will not get the details for some time. Many people in the pensions industry are opposed to the proposals. However, change is desirable and in the interest of the consumer who is, in effect, the man or woman who contributes to the pension. It is also in the interest of the beneficiaries of his or her estate.</P>
    <P>Frequently, people who made major contributions to pension funds died and did not benefit much from the annuities. They may only have benefited for a short time and the pension fund died with them. Their children or beneficiaries under their wills did not enjoy the benefits. I welcome the move although I wish to examine certain aspects in depth. There is no great clarity regarding the detail of the proposals because they are not available and the Minister is only telling us about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an interesting speech, but much of the time he only gave heads of sections and discussed them. This is not good enough in a Finance Bill. Previously cases went to appeal commissioners and as far as the Supreme Court where millions of pounds weighed on a word. Yet, we are expected to adjudicate on provisions when only heads of sections, which are not well formed, are available. There are no sections in the Bill to support the arguments put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to make a commitment to bring before the House shortly some other recommendations of the Pensions Board. Now that the national finances are in surplus and are likely to remain so for many years, the Minister should give serious consideration to establishing a funded social insurance fund to underpin social welfare pensions. The Minister may be thinking along these lines. Apart from the prudence of funding public pensions for the future, it is a bet<Col N="753" /> ter way of using surpluses. The Government of the day might be able to use them if things were not always as good as they are at present instead of running surpluses which would immediately knock down or reduce the debt. There is great merit in having a properly funded social insurance fund and viewing this as a type of reserve fund outside the criteria under which we must operate our financial accounts to comply with the plus or minus 3 per cent surplus deficit agreement in respect of our entry to the euro.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provisions announced by the Minister on budget day, Fine Gael has been committed to tax credits for many years and we would welcome their introduction. However, the Minister has not introduced tax credits; he merely took the first step towards their introduction by applying the personal allowance at the standard rate. Will the Minister outline how he intends to proceed from now? Is he committed to the full implementation of tax credits? In respect of benefits such as the incapacitated person's allowance, the blind person's allowance and other allowances on which people depend, will the Minister raise them sufficiently so that when the relief is applied at 24 per cent rather than 46 per cent, the individual taxpayer will not lose in any way?</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister makes such a commitment, a transfer to tax credits in respect of allowances in the income tax code other than the strictly personal allowances will be penal. I ask the Minister to outline his views and to do as he has done in respect of corporation tax by indicating in his reply or on Committee Stage the schedule for implementing tax credits in the future. Does he intend moving completely to tax credits in the next budget? Will he state how he intends to deal with the allowances I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I welcome another provision in the Bill, which is colloquially known as the Shane Broderick provision, to which the Minister did not refer. This is a farseeing measure and I welcome it. However, it opens an interesting argument. Funds subscribed by the public to a trust will be exempt from taxation in the trust and when they are drawn down and paid by the trustees to the beneficiary. However, how can the Minister continue to justify in situations where a father gives money to an incapacitated son, a relative gives money for the benefit of another relative or a neighbour gives money for the benefit of a retarded child that a publicly subscribed fund and its beneficiary should be exempt from tax but the private individual doing exactly the same to a relative or a person they know should be taxed?</P>
    <P>The Minister must address this issue because he has created a precedent. I ask him to consider it between now and Committee Stage. In one sense, the provision has a far reaching effect but, in another sense, it is a focused area of relief. It is focused on individuals who need it most. I welcome the Minister's proposals, but he has created a precedent, the logic of which he must follow to assist those who are incapacitated in society. A certain logic will carry the Minister in that direc <Col N="754" /> tion and I ask him to have the matter examined between now and Committee Stage where I intend to raise it again.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister published a schedule in respect of corporation tax. However, other issues arise in the application of the new schedule of taxes to individual companies. There is an increasing case to be made for the Minister to publish a White Paper which would cover the issues of tax credits, corporation tax, the change in the tax year to a calendar year, withholding tax and dividends, the powers of the Revenue Commissioners, off-shore accounts and pensions. This would allow people to know where they are going in respect of a range of taxes. It would be of great benefit if, in the next three or four months, the Minister's officials put the information they have to hand together in a White Paper and indicated the route they intend following in respect of these items and others which Members may mention.</P>
    <P>The officials should try to deal with the possible consequences of the changes for individual taxpayers. While the proposals for change are clear, it is unclear how many of the changes will impact on individual taxpayers or companies. Those who wish to plan ahead, particularly with regard to corporation tax, need to know the position now. The Minister has always been strong in terms of business taxation. Given his professional background, he has a good understanding of these issues. He is aware that investment decisions are always made five or six years ahead. Frequently, they are now made eight to ten years ahead. The Minister is aware that any progressive multinational company which seeks to set up in Ireland will have put its plans to its tax advisers before it even reaches first base. A White Paper is needed now. This is one of the calls made by the Institute of Taxation of Ireland. The Minister mentioned its call for an ombudsman, but its call for a White Paper is a much more significant demand and the Minister should move to meet it.</P>
    <P>Another issue which is ancillary to corporation tax and in the same family of issues is the matter of State aids. I ask the Minister to deal with this area in his reply. What is our position now? Is there a danger that, as regards companies and persons who thought they were enjoying certain reliefs in our urban renewal areas, double rent allowances and relief from commercial rates will be cancelled and they will be required to pay back the tax advantage they enjoyed? If they have to pay it back, will the payback be through some mechanism to Brussels, since they seem to be the offended party, or will Brussels require those who got tax relief to repay the Exchequer for the relief they got which we do not want them to give back? It would be ironic if a decision from Brussels compelled Irish taxpayers to pay back tax which the Exchequer and the various parties in this House hoped they would continue to enjoy.</P>
    <P>Where does the situation stand? The Minister should state it bluntly for us because there are many inquiries now and we do not know what <Col N="755" /> the situation is. Will the Minister project into the future, as well? Is it a fact that only capital allowances and tax reliefs in respect of residential accommodation may be applied in any new round of either urban or rural renewal schemes? Will only capital allowances relating to the residential side pass the test? If so, will the Minister state that? As in the upper Shannon area where residential reliefs have already been applied, is it confined to section 23 type apartment buildings and small houses or will it also apply to hotels, guest houses, holiday homes and boats on the Shannon, where people reside for a time during the summer? What will be caught within the residential provision? There is much concern about this matter which is inhibiting growth in the tourism industry and is also inhibiting investment in Dublin and other areas. In addition, it is inhibiting investment in residential accommodation which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>Against a background of rising house prices, the Minister must do something about capital acquisitions tax in respect of the transfer of the family home because thresholds are now very low. Transfers from parents to children are becoming increasingly penal. When the transfer is not in the direct line of descent, including transfers to nephews, nieces and step-nephews, it is becoming very difficult. The transfer of quite modest homes, which the rise in inflation has made into very valuable properties, between aged sisters and brothers is becoming absolutely penal. The person who is left behind is in an impossible situation. I know of cases where the legal advice to people is not to set their affairs in order by taking out probate. If they do so they will end up in a nursing home because they will not be able to afford to pay the tax on the family home which they will then have to sell. The Minister will have to examine this situation because escalating house prices have left the tax regime totally out of line. I am disappoint that the Minister did not say anything about this, either in the budget or today. It is one of the areas about which I am receiving most representations. With house prices as they currently stand, there is a real social need to bring things into line.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the Minister did not say much about vehicle registration tax, except to reaffirm that it comes as he announced it. My colleague, Deputy Deenihan will deal with this matter in greater detail but we are disappointed in it.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the assurances the Minister gave to the film industry. He could have included such provisions in the Bill, but the pressure of work in his Department with so many new proposals being brought forward, meant that he simply did not have the resources to deal with the various reports on the film industry. The Minister has extended the matter for a year to allow himself extra time, but he should not wait until next year's Finance Bill. He should introduce a separate Bill, either before the summer recess or <Col N="756" /> immediately after it. We know Ireland was a very favoured location for the international film industry. It is not as favoured now because there is uncertainty about tax. The Minister should put that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals on profit sharing and particularly the &ldquo;pay as you save&rdquo; scheme he is introducing. If he is around at the commencement of the negotiations with the social partners, he should take pay into account. Of all the perceived threats to the booming economy, the one which resonates most is that at some future point we will find ourselves to be uncompetitive. The uncompetitiveness may arise from the price of houses but it is more likely to concern wage inflation. In 1986 and 1994 we found ourselves to be uncompetitive and we devalued. The competitiveness provided by those two devaluations has underpinned the economic boom because our growth is export led. There has been a kind of secret devaluation in fixing the 2.48 benchmark rate with the deutschmark. If one looks at it in trade related terms over a period of years, there has been a devaluation of about 30 per cent against the deutschmark, but the two previous devaluations did not add up to anything like that. That secret devaluation has given us further competitiveness benefits. In future, however, we will not be able to rely on devaluations. If there is a problem and the Central Bank wants to calm it down they will not be able to raise interest rates. Proportionately, we are very small players in Europe and if we get into trouble there will be no point in going to Brussels or Frankfurt because they will not take any macroeconomic initiative to help us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we become uncompetitive once more, the first line of defence will be pay. Once it becomes pay it will become jobs and multinationals will close down and leave for more competitive locations. Indigenous employers, meanwhile, will seek wage freezes or reductions. In the next wage negotiations, the negotiators must build in a buffer so that jobs are not the first line of defence. I do not want the situation to run from uncompetitiveness straight into redundancy. The Minister has included in the Finance Bill part of the <Col N="757" /> buffer that can be built in, including profit-sharing and the &ldquo;pay as you earn&rdquo; share schemes. The Minister should add to that by introducing a scheme whereby the Exchequer will allow a company to give 0.5 per cent of its total payroll by way of an incentive bonus to at least 40 per cent or 50 per cent of its employees. That gives flexibility to the employer. The State would have to back it up by making it tax free to make it worthwhile. If sterling goes wrong, the next wage agreement should have some percentage related to the fluctuations in that currency. There should be a range whereby at a particular level of sterling one could have an x per cent pay increase which would rise or fall in relation to sterling. Something is needed because if sterling does not track the euro, there is a grave danger that indigenous industry, which trades principally into the UK, will be in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also look at the possibility of incorporating once-off lump sums into the package of rewards in the next pay agreement. Once off lump sums do not run into the wage base, yet they are there in good times and can be taken out in bad times. The policy levers that were available to Governments up to now are no longer there. If we become uncompetitive again there will be widespread redundancies. To ensure that jobs are not the front line of defence, the next agreement between the social partners should build in a buffer containing the elements I have suggested. In that way there will be one set of rewards in one set of circumstances, which can be taken out without touching basic wages, or without affecting jobs in other circumstances. </P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially there are two elements to the Bill: those provisions which give effect to what was announced on budget day and some new items, most of which were flagged by the Minister a few weeks ago. I will deal with both in the time available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Noonan said earlier, and the Minister is on record as having said something similar during his period in Opposition. This is a long Bill with almost 200 sections. I welcome the Minister's advocacy of three days for Committee Stage. However, the notion of one vote on many amendments grouped together at the end of a two or three hour session must be examined carefully. Going on the experience of last year and the year before last, most of the amendments were not dealt with and most of the sections not discussed. We did not even get sight of the Minister's speaking notes on most of the sections. I hope the Whips take this into account when setting the time. Most of the time on Committee Stage is spent with about a half dozen Deputies. It is essential for the sake of the legitimacy of the House and our scrutiny of Bills that there is adequate time to at least give the Minister an opportunity to put his speaking notes on the record of the House and to have an opportunity <Col N="758" /> to question him on them. That is something with which we must deal for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will make some general comments on what appears to be the economic and budgetary strategy of the Government. When the Government came to power less than two years ago, it appeared to have two central tenets to its economic policy. It committed itself to restricting Government expenditure within certain specified targets and to reducing the rates of income tax. Less than two years after it came to power, both these central tenets of its economic policy are in tatters. That in itself would not be such a bad thing since the policy was wrong anyway. Unfortunately, the Government's previously clear, if wrongheaded, policy has given way to an unintelligible mixture of contradictory aspirations.</P>
    <P>Looking at the current side, the Government's stated target is to limit the gross increase in current spending to 4 per cent per annum over the life of the Government. I have said before, as have others, that the target makes little sense. It is a stand alone target plucked out of the air neither underpinned by logical reasoning nor related to ability to pay. That said, since the Minister persists with the target, we are entitled to judge him by the standards he has set for himself.</P>
    <P>In 1997-8 the Minister sought to stay within his target by bringing forward almost £500 million of future liabilities into 1997. This affected a once-off change in the base which would make future adherence to the target a good deal easier. It had precisely that effect in 1998. In effect, the Minister remained within his target by sleight of hand. Unfortunately for him, the sleight of hand could not be operated a second time. Bringing expenditure into 1997 altered the base for all future calculations. To repeat that exercise in this year's budget would have had the effect of increasing the 1998 outturn. Given that, it was reasonable to expect that the 1999 budget would give a more accurate reflection of the real growth in Government expenditure. Given that he had other things going for him, such as lower unemployment, increased PRSI receipts and lower debt repayments, many people thought the Minister might make a genuine effort to stay within his targets. As we now know, we underestimated his ingenuity and willingness, not to say his determination, to put one over on any commentator trying to make sense of his economic policy.</P>
    <P>One simple mechanism used was to increase the health levy from 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent and to abolish the employment and training levy. This was of no benefit to the health budget; Government spending on health was reduced by an amount equivalent to the levy proceeds. In his budget speech, the Minister attempted to suggest in a half-hearted way that this was a measure of the Government's commitment to the health services. It is nothing of the kind. It is nothing more than a mathematical exercise intended to deceive those trying to make sense of the Government's economic policy. The Minister admitted as much when he addressed the Joint Committee on Fin<Col N="759" /> ance and the Public Service before Christmas in the presence of the Secretary General of his Department.</P>
    <P>In one sense, none of this matters a great deal. The Minister's targets were wrong in the first place and it is no harm that they have been abandoned. On the other hand, there is something deeply unsettling about a Minister who insists on articulating an economic policy which is so manifestly bogus. How can any of us seek to debate with him if he is determined not to pursue a certain policy but to appear as if he were doing so? In all likelihood, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, believes in the targets he has set himself. He should now have the courage to either put up or shut up. Either he should seek to meet his targets or he should formally abandon them. This make-believe world of fancy statistics and number juggling is an inadequate substitute for a genuine economic policy.</P>
    <P>Still on the subject of current expenditure, I was struck by the financial envelopes set out by the Minister in the supplementary documentation he provided on budget day. He told us a number of times last year in reply to parliamentary questions and otherwise that he intended to publish on budget day the financial envelopes, disaggregated by individual Vote group, which would be available over the next three years. The figures he produced on budget day seemed to fall short of this but, nonetheless, they make interesting reading. For example, the health budget for 1999 is projected to be £2.974 billion, which is 10.5 per cent to 11 per cent higher than in the previous year, allowing for the trick acting with the levy. The figure for the year 2000 is given as £3.044 billion and the figure for the year 2001 is £3.165 billion. This represents an increase of only 2.5 per cent in each of those years. This contrasts dramatically with increases of more than 10 per cent in the past two years.</P>
    <P>This provokes the obvious question: from where do these figures come? How, or in what context, were they agreed? Is anyone seriously suggesting that health expenditure is to be restrained in this way? At a time when the largest hospital in the State is threatened with closure because of inadequate financing, surely this is not a time to cut back health spending? However, the health figure is typical. Most of the increases provided for in the years 2000 and 2001 are in the order of 2 per cent to 3 per cent per annum. We are entitled to know how these figures were reached and calculated. With the exception of the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, Deputy O'Donnell, I am not aware of any statement made by any Minister relating to the allocation made to his or her Department for future years. In anticipation of the Minister's response, I am aware an unallocated additional figure of £296 million has been provided for the year 2000 and a figure of slightly more than twice that for the following year. That said, even these figures are inadequate. Almost <Col N="760" /> all this money would have to be allocated to the health budget to meet the increase likely to be demanded in that Department alone.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in medium-term forecasting is not good. The convergence programme produced in 1997 now reads like a work of complete fiction. However, these financial envelopes, if that is what they are, are meant to be something more than estimates. They are meant to be a key part of the Government's multi-annual budget strategy. The Taoiseach told me on budget day that these allocations had been made by Government decision. He seemed to imply they were hard and fast decisions rather than mere aspirations. It is time the Government came clean. Is it committed to multi-annual budgeting or not? Do these future allocations mean anything? If they are to be taken seriously, the Minister owes us a full explanation of all the implications.</P>
    <P>Presumably, these expenditure projections for 2000 and 2001 have been taken into account in compiling the stability programme submitted to the European Commission before Christmas. The programme makes for interesting and in some ways, disturbing reading. It projects a cyclically adjusted tightening of fiscal policy over the period of the programme. This is at a time when fiscal tightening is the last thing we need or want. Even more disturbingly, the programme projects a reduction in general current expenditure as a percentage of GDP, from 31.4 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 28 per cent in 2001. This is nothing less than ideologically driven monetary conservatism at a time when the country still has enormous social needs, and more to the point, now has the capacity to go at least some distance in meeting them.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that our <i>per capita</i> spending on health is still among the lowest in Europe, that class sizes in our schools are still among the highest in the European Union, and that in this time of plenty, local authorities are still obliged to make real cuts in services to stay within the relatively meagre increases in budgets provided by the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in Dún Laoghaire two or three weeks ago at a time when local authorities were setting their annual budgets. I was amazed to hear they were being obliged to contemplate relatively minor but very stupid cuts in areas such as the provision of books in libraries because of the inadequacy of the budget being provided from the Custom House.</P>
    <P>There are two different things happening in this country &ndash; on the macro level, in the documentation we receive from the Department of Finance, we have wonderful current budget surpluses, likely to hit £3 billion or £4 billion in the next couple of years, while at the same time, in local authorities, minor but nonetheless painful cuts are being made. The two cannot comfortably sit side by side.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on capital investment is no less confusing than its policy on current <Col N="761" /> spending. Virtually everyone accepts we have an infrastructural deficit. Notwithstanding the high rates of economic growth in recent years there are still major deficiencies in our road network, our telecommunications sector and other services such as water and sewage treatment. There is an overwhelming case, accepted by virtually every party in this House and widely outside it, for investing in these services at a time when we can afford to do so.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Government's stated target of increasing capital expenditure by only 5 per cent per annum was clearly a nonsense and in fairness to the Minister he rapidly abandoned it. He made provisions substantially in excess of that in his first two budgets. However, he also stoutly refused to apply any of last year's unintended budget surplus towards necessary investment. In the communiqué issued jointly with the European Commission on 14 March, he committed the Government to applying any unintended surplus to the reduction of the national debt.</P>
    <P>He followed through on this policy by making provision in his 1999 budget for a budget surplus of close to £1 billion, all of which is to be applied to the national debt. There is a strong argument that this is not the best possible use of money in these circumstances. The national debt is reducing as a percentage of GDP in any event and is already below the 60 per cent target set in the Maastricht convergence criteria. The national debt is well and truly under control; so much so that the agency charged with managing the debt, the NTMA, has indicated its view that the surplus money would be better used on infrastructural investment rather than on reducing the debt.</P>
    <P>Perhaps even more interesting were the comments in a speech given in Limerick a few weeks ago:</P>
    <P>Paying off part of the national debt is hardly a grand political project. Surely, we as a nation are capable of more visionary thinking; surely we are capable of devising a forward strategy for future investment that will help to transform this country.</P>
    <P>That speech was not made by some loony leftie or some vested interest with a tendency towards profligate spending. This speech, which is, interestingly enough, on Progressive Democrats' headed notepaper as opposed to Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment headed notepaper, was made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. This clearly represents a significant shift in PD policy. More importantly, it is a direct contradiction of the Minister of Finance's stated policy and the Government's policy stated in the communiqué issued in March 1998.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that Deputy Harney is the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, the Minister's partner in Government, she is also Minister in a Department which has a direct influence and say in economic policy. We are entitled to ask who speaks on behalf of the Government on this <Col N="762" /> issue. This is far from being an academic or purely party political argument. If this Government was to run its full course, it would have in the region of £5 billion surplus moneys to spend. Allowing for privatisation receipts, the figure could be close to twice that. There is clearly a fundamental indecision, if not division in Government as to how best this money can be used. The Tánaiste promises a brave new world while the Minister of Finance wants to reduce the debt.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister will protest that he has provided for significant increases in capital expenditure over his two budgets. It is true that in percentage terms, the capital budget has been increased by a significant amount. However, there is clearly a need for this level of increase to be sustained and increased further; but stated Government policy suggests exactly the contrary.</P>
    <P>The stability programme projects that total Government investment as a percentage of GDP &ndash; I gather this figure includes receipts from Europe as well as moneys provided from our domestic resources &ndash; will remain almost exactly the same as it currently is over the next three years. This means that actual cash increases will be in accordance with the level of growth which is projected in the same programme as in the region of 6 per cent per annum over those three years, which is a reasonable balance to strike.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously telling us he believes that dedicating just 3 per cent of GDP to infrastructural spending is sufficient in the circumstances in which we are projecting a current budget surplus of about £4 billion? How can we possibly justify such a low level of capital expenditure at a time when we can clearly afford and clearly need a great deal more?</P>
    <P>We all know the lead-in period for planning is quite long. If we are to have the decade of investment which we need, the planning needs to start now. I see no sign, even in the context of the current national plan, that this Government is making the wherewithal available to ensure that planning and the investment we require happens.</P>
    <P>It is particularly ironic that this is happening at a time when the Minister is playing ducks and drakes with Brussels in an attempt to squeeze an extra few million pounds out of the European taxpayer. I have spoken at some length on this issue before and I do not intend to labour the point here. Suffice to say that the Government's pathetic effort at regionalisation must be put in the context of its abject failure to use resources generated at home.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the stability programme, I will ask some questions about taxation. Is it Government policy to reduce taxation as a percentage of GDP? Mr. Tutty of the Department of Finance told me a few months ago at a committee that it was not stated Government policy to reduce the relative value of the tax take in this way. On the other hand, the stability programme projects a reduction in central Government taxes from 29.3 per cent of GDP to 27.9 per cent over the next three years. The Minister is on record in previous <Col N="763" /> times and in a previous guise as stating that as a matter of ideological principle, he would also favour a reduction in the tax burden in this way. It would be helpful if he clarified the position today, or at the very least on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The stability programme also indicates that projections of Government expenditure for future years incorporate a continuation of current taxation policy. Unfortunately, he then goes on to characterise this policy in a way which does not stand up to scrutiny. Given the lack of continuity and coherence between the Minister's two budgets in tax policy particularly income tax policy, it is unlikely he will tell us how he intends to pursue these matters over the next few years. However, he should surely be able to tell us the measure of the reduction in tax which has been factored into the stability programme which has been presented to the European Commission. I hope he will be able to do at least that when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>The major change in the budget, to which the Finance Bill gives effect, is the partial switch to tax credits. I welcomed this in my budget speech. It is a manifestly fairer way to do things. However, the Minister has only started into the process and he has not gone a great distance down the road. In a sense what he has done provides him with the framework on which he can build in future years should he chose to do so. It clearly contradicts what he had done in previous years particularly in his first budget when he had sought to reduce the income tax rates. To give positive effect to what I acknowledge as an equitable move, he needs to indicate to us how he intends to build upon it or, given the Minister's tendency towards secrecy in these matters, at least confirm that he intends to continue to go down this road.</P>
    <P>The major initiative in the Finance Bill is the pension provisions. Unlike Deputy Noonan, who expressed unreserved support for them, I have some concerns about some of the provisions in the memorandum because we have not seen the provisions in the Bill itself. We must put all of this debate in the context of the pensions initiative published about six or eight months ago which made a number of recommendations. It was a particularly good initiative. The Minister's reaction to it and the reaction of his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, was quite positive. As I recall, some three working groups were set up to look at aspects of it. None of them has yet reported.</P>
    <P>I support the pre-funding of pensions. It is a useful, progressive and politically saleable way of using surplus moneys which are available now. I know the Minister's Department is considering these matters and that the interdepartmental working group will shortly come to a conclusion. I hope it will be a positive one and that we will establish a fund before the end of this year or at least in next year's provisions.</P>
    <P>However, it provokes a number of interesting <Col N="764" /> questions. If we accept the principle that rather than reducing the debt it is more economically viable and proper to set up a fund and that the Minister can invest to greater effect and with benefit to the Exchequer, then we are surely saying the State must maintain some exposure to the market because it is likely that any managed fund of that kind, whether it is done through the NTMA or private fund managers, would need to include at least some equity element. Recently it struck me that, at a time when many of the ideological objections to privatisation on this side of the House are not as strong as they once were, there is surely still an important argument to be made in this context for the retention of some valuable State assets. One which strikes me as most obvious is Telecom Éireann. The reality is that had we disposed of the shares in Telecom Éireann a couple of years ago they would have fetched a great deal less than they would fetch now. To a great extent, it has been an appreciating asset. It has been in the financial interests of the State, apart from all the strategic considerations in the telecommunications area, to retain those shares. If we are considering setting up a fund which will presumably have some equity element to it for the purpose of pre-funding pensions, we must consider whether it is appropriate at the same time for us to dispose of valuable State assets.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions in the Bill relates to the tax-free element of contributions. There is a balance to be struck here. We should encourage people to make provision for pension and a tax-free element is a necessary part of that, but we should not deliberately look to create what could prove to be valuable tax shelters for better off people. There is a risk that at the higher end &ndash; the 30 per cent level &ndash; it would be possible for people, even given the earnings cap, to secrete away a considerable tax-free sum of money for purposes other than purely providing pensions. Given that it will no longer be necessary for all of that money to be applied towards pensions when the time comes and that it will be possible for individuals to draw down a considerable amount of money by way of lump sums, one must wonder whether we should create a tax shelter of that kind. I presume the Minister will argue that tax will be payable when the lump sum is drawn down, but it will still be possible for somebody to invest over a period of 20 years and the benefit which he derives from that investment in terms of its increased value would not be taxable. I wonder whether we are going a little too far in that and I want to tease out that matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the central provision in what the Minister is looking to do is more important. He is effectively looking to deregulate what happens to pension funds when somebody comes to retirement age. He has put it in terms which, on the face of it, sound extremely attractive. He said the provisions are pro-consumer, he is giving back people's accumulated savings to them and he is <Col N="765" /> allowing people to inherit moneys which are not used by the person who made the savings in the first place. All of that sounds attractive and to some degree it is. I agree with him that the current provision, whereby one is obliged to invest in annuities and cannot change once one has done so, is not satisfactory and is far too rigid. It is right that we should seek to change it.</P>
    <P>However, there is a middle ground which the Minister has chosen not to take. There is still a need for regulation of some kind. Certainly, by all means let us expand the number of ways in which the money can be invested or drawn down. There is no reason to oblige somebody to invest in annuities. I do not see why properly regulated and approved managed funds should not also be available to individual investors and pensioners for the use and management of their moneys, but there should be some control over it. There should be some obligation on the Minister or the Pensions Board to approve funds which would be suitable for the investment of pension funds in that way. We should not allow pensioners to have virtually unfettered control over the moneys they have provided for themselves.</P>
    <P>The reason is simple: that whether we like it or not, not everybody will make a sound investment decision and not everybody, whether he or she is advised or not, is in a position to make a sound investment decision. Unfortunately, some older people will be brought under pressure, perhaps from offspring who might require a loan to sustain a business or buy a house. It is not difficult to imagine circumstances where older people in their declining years are brought under pressure or, indeed, put themselves under pressure to dispose of their pension or savings in a way which is not directly for their benefit. The reality is that all of our thinking in pension provision heretofore has been based on security. The current system may not offer good returns and may be too inflexible, but it offers security. We must look to maintain that level of security in anything that we do.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister making contributions on this issue during Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill. He made it clear that he intended to do something of this kind so I am not surprised at the provisions of the Bill, but I am concerned about how they sit with the pensions initiative published last year which was so wholeheartedly welcomed by the Government at the time. It seems to me that much of what the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is seeking to do flies in the face of what the pensions initiative suggested. It is possible that private retirement funds can be made to sit side by side with what the Minister has done. However, the element of security is missing and I am concerned about that. Having given some thought to this matter, I am inclined towards obligatory personal contributions which would oblige those who can afford to do so to make some provision for their own pensions. I am not quite sure how this could be done but I am convinced the voluntary way of doing things <Col N="766" /> which now applies is not sufficient and does not provide the level of security which our society should try to encourage.</P>
    <P>The question of giving powers to the Revenue Commission has attracted much attention in recent days. The Labour Party has always supported granting the necessary powers and resources to the Revenue Commissioners to enable them to ensure that there is proper compliance with revenue legislation. There is no point in this House passing legislation if the powers do not exist to ensure proper compliance with the law. We must also acknowledge people's entitlement to privacy and to protection from unfair intrusion into their affairs. We must strike a balance. Any tax practitioner and anyone who has ever had an audit done will know that theory and practice can diverge considerably. When a tax inspector arrives at an office the first thing he or she will do is ask to see bank statements. In most cases those bank statements are voluntarily presented.</P>
    <P>If they are not, a measure of justifiable suspicion is aroused. However, concern has been expressed that the Revenue Commission may do trawls without any particular reason. It is important that we focus on the need for the establishment of reasonable suspicion before the Revenue Commissioners use this power. I was encouraged by what the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners had to say the other day on this matter and I was glad to hear the Minister repeat some of what he said today. I agree with Deputy Noonan that there is a need to set out the procedures to be followed, whether by way of statement of practice or statutory regulation. My preference would be for a statement of practice. For example, it should be required to state the nature of the suspicion before the Revenue Commission would exercise these powers. The process will be largely internal and will not be visible to individual taxpayers and it is important that the process be clearly set out in principle, in writing and in advance.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister said about advance notification of individual taxpayers. That is the least that would have been required by the Haughey case of a few weeks ago but he needs to go further in setting in motion a review process. I noted that the Minister said that there would be a facility to apply for judicial review. I am not sure if he intends that as an appeal to the courts. If that is what is intended it should be spelled out in the Bill. As a general principle, provided these measures are employed in a fair and equitable fashion, the Labour Party supports the new provisions for powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the business of ESOTs. Like Deputy Noonan I think this will become increasingly important. Because devaluation is not available to us because of our membership of the EMU, we need to have different forms of remuneration available to us which are more flexible and which can be reduced. There is no reality in suggesting that actual wages can be <Col N="767" /> reduced in times of economic difficulty for firms. We need a more flexible instrument which can go up an down according to whether a company or an economy is profitable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the start the Minister has made in dealing with ESOTs. I am concerned about one aspect of this question. Some of the provisions of the Bill were agreed with the Communications Workers' Union and the unions involved in setting up the Telecom Trust. I suspect we will see a great deal more of this. The motivation in setting up ESOTs should be clear. It is to set up a partnership arrangement within particular companies and to allow for more flexibility with regard to remuneration. They are not intended to provide a capital asset for individuals which, if they cease to be workers, they may retain for five or ten more years and then sell on the open market. This defeats the purpose of the exercise.</P>
    <P>While I understand why people who are currently working for Telecom Éireann, for example, will want to retain that asset, this aspect of ESOTs does not lie comfortably with the stated aims of these trusts which are to foster partnership and provide more flexible forms of remuneration. This is something on which we need to keep a close eye. I suspect that trusts of this kind in the semi-State sector are being provided as something close to a bribe to workers to facilitate the privatisation of companies in this sector. We must maintain a focus on the primary purpose of these trusts.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not contain provision for the regulation of credit unions. The Minister is not here to allow me to tease him about the events of last year. As a result of his failure to deal with the question of credit unions last year, the Minister set up a working group comprising representatives of the League of Credit Unions, his own Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and one or two others. The group produced a report towards the end of last year which suggested various changes all of which are in the public arena. It is quite clear from the Minister's demeanour and from what he has said in the past week or so that he has no intention of giving effect to the proposals of the working group. In the first page of the report I read, &ldquo;The Department of Finance sees no case for any further changes to tax law to favour credit unions&rdquo;. This is the core of the issue.</P>
    <P>The Department, and presumably the Minister, does not accept that credit unions are particular types of organisations which require or deserve our support. I strongly disagree. Credit unions were not established to make a profit. They are not the same as other financial institutions. They are largely managed by volunteers and they have a structure which is not analogous or comparable to other financial institutions. They also have a client base which is distinctly different from those of other financial institutions and that must be recognised. This is recognised by everyone in the <Col N="768" /> House except for the Minister and his Department. Does the Minister stand by the statement by the Department of Finance and does it represent his policy and the policy of the Government?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the working group divided on the question of its recommendations. All parties on the working group favoured granting favourable taxation treatment to credit unions except the Department of Finance. I assume the Minister agrees with his Department. If he does not intend taking action on this matter, let him say so. We can then judge him accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to film relief. This is widely acknowledged as an enormously successful relief which has brought considerable investment to the country. It has targeted attention on the country which has been largely positive. The INDECON report, which will soon be available to us, recommends the continuation of this tax relief. I know a number of other reports are being prepared on this subject and I gather they will be available soon. The Minister needs to go further than he did today in saying that he favours in principle the continuation of the relief.</P>
    <P>Obviously we can tweak it in a particular direction by setting a greater requirement for employment initiatives. He should go further in acknowledging that the relief has had the desired effect in bringing investment into the country and providing employment and he should seek to have it continued in future years. It is not sufficient that it would continue on a year to year basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention today that the Bill provides for an increase in the limits for tax free take of redundancies. Given that the limits have not been increased for a number of years, it is right that they be increased in accordance with inflation in the intervening time. I take this opportunity to comment on the level of redundancy provided largely as part of the restructuring of semi-State bodies because there is cause for concern. The statutory redundancy is far too low. Few people made redundant would be happy with anything remotely close to the statutory redundancy provided for in the 1970s legislation. I am concerned in the current employment market at the levels of redundancy offered in the semi-State sector as part of restructuring arrangements. They strike me as extraordinarily generous. We are all aware of people in their 40s in Telecom Éireann, the ESB and other companies who have left with very large sums of money only to get another job a few weeks later. In an employment market where people are setting up in employment, in circumstances where they may even be facing unemployment, they need help. Where there is a likelihood that a person who has acquired skills in the semi-State sector over a period will get a job in the private sector, probably competing with previous employers, one wonders whether such generous settlements are appropriate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement about Irish non-registered companies. On reading the pro<Col N="769" /> posals in the explanatory memorandum it strikes me he has got the balance right. Unfortunately, the proposals are not contained in the Bill but I hope they will be available soon. He has got the balance between taxation measures and company registration measures right. I argued last year that actual residents should be acquainted with residence for taxation purposes and I am pleased he has taken that on board.</P>
    <P>The issues of compliance and enforcement are extremely important. There has been an improvement in recent years in the staffing levels of the Companies Registration Office, but if there is any increase in the number of Irish non-registered companies there will be a major task of enforcement and I ask whether the office has the capacity to carry out that task. Likewise since the measures specifically proposed are taxation measures, I wonder if the Revenue has the capacity to ensure compliance with the measures set out in the Bill? </P>
    <P>I wish to refer to provisions which I thought might be contained in the Bill. The Minister indicated last year he intended to change the income tax year to coincide with the calendar year. How far has he got with that proposal and does he intend to bring it in next year? He indicated also last year that he intended to look at the taxation arrangements for cohabiting individuals rather than married couples? Has he made any progress on that matter?</P>
    <P>There are good and bad measures in the Bill. Given the need for sufficient time to deal with this Bill in detail on Committee Stage, I hope the Minister will lend his weight to making time available.</P>

      <P>The number and diversity of sections in the Bill demonstrate the work and effort being put into his portfolio by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I commend him for the flexibility he has shown in adapting to the prevailing circumstances. I congratulate the Department of Finance on publication of the Bill. The full text of the Bill and explanatory memorandum were immediately available on the Internet. The Bill contains an index of all the items in layman's language. It was interesting to note that of the 82 items, only 33 were mentioned in the budget, a further 26 or 27 were mentioned on 21 January and there are 22 new items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What marks this Finance Bill are the powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners. They are far-reaching and appear to encompass all the controversies in banking, taxation and associated activities. As happens on many great occasions, the best wine is kept until the end. Some of the most interesting parts are at the end of the Bill. Therefore, I wish to approach the Bill from the <Col N="770" /> end and proceed to the beginning rather than the other way around.</P>
    <P>Section 195 places the taxes Acts under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners. Effectively they are the bosses when it comes to application of the taxes Acts. The Revenue Commissioners consists of three persons. They are not the Holy Trinity but to some people in difficulty in their taxes they often appear to be. There is a perception that the Revenue Commissioners are unapproachable. Since I became a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Revenue Commissioners have been accountable to the House through that committee. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners is asked to fully explain his actions on how he has carried out his duty over the previous year.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper for Members to make representations to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of their constituents. The Revenue Commissioners have discretion under the care and management section to mitigate taxes and penalties in the interests of effective and efficient management of the whole tax system. If a public representative considers there are circumstances which the Revenue Commissioners should take into account in making a decision on the tax affairs of his constituent, that public representative has a right and duty to his constituent to make those circumstances known to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have a duty to consider those representations in arriving at their decision.</P>
    <P>There is an attitude among tax inspectors that no public representative should interfere in the assessment and collection of taxes, but this is wrong. If there are circumstances which a public representative believes may not have been taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners in arriving at a decision, it is incumbent on the public representative to make representation on behalf of his constituent. Public representatives can bring a human element into the equation while often taxpayers' agents, be they accountants or lawyers, look only at the legalistic and statutory implications. Invariably, when questioned about a taxation matter, the Minister for Finance replies that he has no function in the matter and that the Revenue Commissioners are charged with the care and management of the taxes Acts. I can understand the reason a Member should not make representations to the Minister for Finance on the tax affairs of a constituent, but there is no reason he cannot make representations to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners should ensure the various inspectors of taxes treat representations from Members as genuine and take on board and consider the representations made. I acknowledge in the vast majority of cases the same decision may result. However, it should be possible for a public representative to, on occasion, expand the criteria upon which a <Col N="771" /> decision is made and, thereby, produce a different result.</P>
    <P>Under section 193 the limit on the amount of grants that county enterprise boards can make is being increased from £100 million to £200 million. Over recent months, both enterprise boards and their clients who are trying to start businesses have found that payments which were agreed and promised could not be paid. I hope such a monumental omission by the bureaucracy will not recur.</P>
    <P>Under section 192 the management of borrowing for FEOGA purposes is being transferred to the National Treasury Management Agency. There has been a great deal of criticism over a number of years of the management of borrowing by the Department of Agriculture and Food, particularly by two Members of this House. However, I question whether that criticism was deserved. The Department of Agriculture and Food performed the task of managing that borrowing in a very professional manner.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency has been set up as the sacred cow of financial matters in Ireland. However, it should guard against becoming a self important ivory tower type organisation. Everyone accepts its competence, but it is unelected and its contributions to policies, while much esteemed, should be given to the Minister for Finance rather than the national media.</P>
    <P>Section 189 deals with the additional powers of the Revenue Commissioners. I was delivering leaflets over the weekend&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;making people aware of the improvements in the medical card guidelines and the very generous increases in the social welfare payments in the budget which will come into effect very shortly. However, there is a fear among social welfare recipients, old age pensioners and owners of small businesses whom I met over the weekend that this section will be used as a witch-hunt against them for the purposes of reducing means tested payments, and that senior citizens will be frightened to put their money in banks. Last Monday we heard how almost £30,000 in cash was robbed from a couple, money which should have been in a bank.</P>
      <P>These fears are not well founded. Dermot Quigley, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, recently made a statement, to which the Minister for Finance alluded in his speech, in which he said the additional powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners in the Finance Bill are targeted at cases of tax evasion, and not at means tested social welfare recipients or owners of small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill will be debated in the House next week. There is a case for disregarding the first £20,000 of savings of social welfare recipients for means testing purposes. People who <Col N="772" /> save money for hard times should not be subjected to that type of means test. Savings of £20,000 effectively mean that the social welfare recipient is down £40 per week. A person on social welfare should be allowed to have savings of up to £20,000 for their security and old age. I will develop that point further during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill next week.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, from reading the section, that the additional powers are aimed, as the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners stated, at the serious tax offender and not at social welfare recipients and owners of small businesses.</P>
    <P>One of the little heralded powers given to the Revenue Commissioners is that the details of insurance policies related to taxpayers' assets will have to be made known. It is not often that taxpayers are asked for a statement of affairs and a list of their assets and liabilities. However, it appears from this section that it may be a more frequent occurrence in the future. I do not know if those who leave their Mercedes at home and drive their battered old Fiat on the day the inspector calls will continue to get away with that.</P>
    <P>One of the sections that aroused fear among a number of bank account holders was the amendment to section 905 of the Taxes Consolidation Act. Under this section an authorised officer can carry out an on site audit of a financial institution. Concern was expressed to me by a number of people that under this section the tax authorities could trawl through bank accounts on a wide basis, on the pretext of examining the tax affairs of the bank.</P>
    <P>The section in the Taxes Consolidation Act specifically states that only items of the bank's clients such as fee income or charges will be examined by the Revenue Commissioners, and not the accounts of the clients of the bank. Will the Minister confirm there will not be a trawl and examination of bank accounts when an on site audit of a financial institution is being carried out?</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 906 of the Taxes Consolidation Act states that the consent of the Revenue Commissioners is required for an authorised officer to seek information relevant to a person's tax liability. That additional power demonstrates that the Revenue Commissioners do not have the power to examine bank accounts on a general basis.</P>
    <P>The new power under the amended section 907 of the Taxes Consolidation Act allows the Revenue to apply to the Appeal Commissioners to examine a group of accounts. Accounts such as the Ansbacher accounts will come under the remit of this provision, which everyone believes is absolutely necessary. The Revenue Commissioners, on the order of a Circuit Court, can investigate transactions relating to offshore insurance bonds and so on.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 908 gives power to the Revenue Commissioners, on the orders of a High Court judge, to freeze the assets held in the bank of a person. This will allow the Revenue <Col N="773" /> Commissioners greater access to freeze the assets of criminals.</P>
    <P>On sections 11 and 188, to which the Minister alluded, I am delighted that funds donated to trusts for permanently incapacitated individuals &ndash; who are often injured sportspersons &ndash; and the income from such funds will be exempted from tax. That is a very welcome development which, as the Minister said, reflects the desires of the donors of such funds.</P>
    <P>Section 105 refers to vehicle registration tax. A concerted effort to change the minds of Deputies and the Minister in regard to increases has been waged by SIMI. As the Minister stated, in January there was a 21 per cent increase in sales of cars over 1400cc, compared to the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to Irish registered non-resident companies is very welcome. For too long, we have been reading in the Sunday newspapers about Irish companies for sale for £240, obviously with the intention of evading tax. These advertisements are placed in newspapers in the UK and across Europe. This provision will ensure that such companies will not be as popular in the future as they have been. All companies registered in Ireland will be deemed to be resident for tax purposes in Ireland. In addition, those companies which are already registered will, from October 1999, be deemed resident here for tax purposes. I foresee a large exodus of phantom companies from our shores, companies which were never here in the first place.</P>

      <P>I propose a vote of &lsquo;no confidence' in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. I do not do so lightly but because we, in the Labour Party, are seeking the approval of the House for a fresh start in the area of health. It is clear this Minister has failed abysmally to live up to the rigours of his office and that those who depend on health care and those who provide it have increasingly lost faith in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our motion is grounded not on some abstract political expediency but on the reality that too many sick and vulnerable people have suffered needlessly &ndash; some have even died needlessly &ndash; and will continue to do so into the future unless the Taoiseach seizes the initiative and establishes a new <Col N="774" /> basis for our health care system under different leadership.</P>
    <P>Everyone understands that Ministers are constrained by the general economic climate within which they operate and the competing and conflicting demands for resources. Nowhere is this more true than in the area of health care. Each Minister must be able to make choices in order to resolve immediate problems while, at the same time, creating a vision for the future. Ministerial leadership has been described as the place where the dream starts and the buck stops. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has proved himself gravely lacking on both counts. His focus is more on accountancy than on accountability, more on financial management than on medical care. His role is part of the problem rather than part of the solution at a time, when, for the first time ever in the history of the State, the country's prosperity offers us a real opportunity to address the inequities and failings of our health care system. With this Minister, leadership has become the place where the buck starts and the dream dies.</P>
    <P>In June 1997, the people were given a commitment by the Fianna Fáil Party. We were told that if Fianna Fáil was returned to power, the party would tackle hospital waiting lists as a priority. People before politics and tackling hospital waiting lists as a priority &ndash; that was the message. The Fianna Fáil election manifesto stated it clearly and even went further. It is worth recalling the basis on which this Government was elected.</P>
    <P>Our aim will be to eliminate waiting lists of over 12 months in orthopaedic surgery &ndash; especially hip replacements, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery. We will set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment. We will ensure that quiet hospital periods such as the summer months are used to make inroads into the lists.</P>
    <P>Tonight, as we debate this motion, there are literally thousands of sick and vulnerable people who, almost two years later, have been waiting more than 12 months on waiting lists and thousands of children who have been waiting more than six months. When the public went out to vote, it was on the basis that a vote for Fianna Fáil was a vote to change their lives. Even after the general election, the commitment was repeated in the Government programme drawn up jointly with the Progressive Democrats which said: &ldquo;The hospital waiting lists will be tackled as a priority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question the sick and vulnerable can legitimately ask is &ldquo;what has happened in our acute hospital services since this Government took office?&rdquo;. I will let the record speak for itself. Far from tackling the hospital waiting lists, this Government has presided over a steeply escalating rise in the number of patients waiting for hospital procedures. In some cases, patients have literally died for want of a hospital bed. Those who can, have gone into debt to raise a loan to <Col N="775" /> access treatment. The remainder are still waiting in ever increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>In May 1997, when hospital waiting lists were well below the 30,000 figure, Deputy Brian Cowen, then in Opposition, described them as being &ldquo; out of control&rdquo;. In June of that year, he was made Minister for Health and Children and has made strenuous efforts ever since to massage the figures and rejig the numbers. Yet, in spite of his best efforts, the number of patients has grown consistently. The latest figures, which are already out of date, show an inexorable rise to the most recent official figure, which dates back to September 1998, to 35,405 people. That latest total is almost 20 per cent higher that the total estimated on the date when this Government of such promise came to power.</P>
    <P>I can say with some certainty that when the Minister for Health stands up to speak, he will reel off his set piece for yet another time about what the Rainbow Government did or did not do. I acknowledge he has put more money into the system so the real question is &ldquo;why is he not more successful when he has all this money to spend; why is he not doing the business?&rdquo;. He is unlikely to mention that the last time there was a Labour Minister for Health, waiting lists were slashed by 37 per cent in one year alone.</P>
    <P>This Minister will stick to his mantra, as he does every time he is called to account. We know the script because we have heard it so often from him but the facts are incontrovertible and speak louder than any Government bluster. The facts are that 1 per cent of the Irish population is awaiting essential hospital treatment, and more people are on a shadow waiting list which is not recorded but is made up of those waiting to see a consultant. We have always had hospital waiting lists but there is a new development under this Government's tenure, namely that some of those who need to attend a consultant have even been refused the opportunity to have their names put on a waiting list because of the pressure on consultants' time. In effect, these sick people are waiting to go on to a waiting list which would enable them to access a hospital waiting list. For the first time ever in my experience, patients needing emergency procedures are being left for months before gaining access to hospital. Their tragedy is that if they had enough money to pay for private care, they would have no waiting time at all. It is because they are poor that they suffer. This affront to decency will continue on an ever greater scale unless real and fundamental change is brought about by a Minister genuinely committed to equality of care.</P>
    <P>In June 1997, 30,453 patients were on public hospital waiting lists. That figure has increased exponentially ever since. In 18 months of Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have succeeded in expanding the waiting lists by more than 5,000 people, although we do not have the exact figure. While the figure is still climbing, we can only guess at the extent of the increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> Far from using quiet times of the year to make inroads into the waiting lists, the record shows that hospital beds were closed in many cases as a budgetary safety valve in flat contradiction of the promises in the programme for Government. We all remember the brave fight put up by staff in the University College Hospital Galway last summer. What the public may not be aware of is that the total extent of bed closures in 1998 resulted in the loss of 7,704 bed days on average per month. Remarkably, at the time of year when there is greatest demand on our acute health services, bed closures were a major feature in our hospitals. In December 1998, 9 per cent of all beds were closed which led to 16,399 bed days lost. It is remarkable the Government that claims to deal with the issue of hospital waiting lists should have this record.</P>
    <P>When things got busy in 1998, it was clear that neither the Minister nor the Department had prepared for the pressures that built up in accident and emergency units and which led to extreme overcrowding. Patients were left on stretchers and slept on trolleys, some of them for literally days on end. In one case an elderly man died just five days after he had been left on a trolley for 56 hours.</P>
    <P>Plans were not made by the Department in time to enable hospitals to cope in terms of keeping beds open and providing step down beds in nursing homes which, according to hospital consultants, had spare capacity of approximately 500 beds at that time. Instead, when the going got tough, the tough got going. The Minister for Health and Children went into purdah down in Offaly and took an uncharacteristic vow of silence leaving the Eastern Health Board, in particular, struggling to cope with the deluge.</P>
    <P>Yet again, as that crisis receded the Minister has not given any indication that any lessons have been learned from the experience nor that, given increasing hospital waiting lists, we are not facing another year of excessive bed closures at the quiet time of the year and excessive overload in our accident and emergency departments in the winter. I want to be fair to the Minister. I know that pressures exist within the health system that can swallow up infinite resources without a return, but I also know that unless the Minister commits himself to significant structural reforms the position will not change.</P>
    <P>I want to put the Government's record in context. A previous Minister for Health has not ever been in the position in which the current one finds himself. No previous Minister operated in a climate of such extraordinary economic growth and prosperity. There are unprecedented opportunities now to bring about the necessary structural changes that can deliver a new health service based on the principles of quality and equality, yet we continue to have a health service in which there are incentives to deepen the gulf between the care of the private patient over the public one.</P>
    <P>The Minister will no doubt argue that structural changes are needed which take time to be <Col N="777" /> achieved and I agree with him as far as he goes, but he does not go far enough. It appears he has no intention of even attempting to tackle the core inequity between private and public health care which distorts our acute hospital services and leads to inefficiency and to injustice. Instead, the opportunity is being squandered and the chasm between those who are sick and can afford to jump the queue and those who are sick and cannot is deepening all the time.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in 1996 the percentage spend on health care in Ireland was 7 per cent, well below the EU and OECD average levels of 8 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively and well down the European league table. More recent figures indicate that our spend is slipping with public capital expenditure in 1999 at 0.26 per cent of GDP compared to 0.28 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>For the first time in Ireland we have the conditions within which an acute hospital service can be constructed that is based on provision for those who need the service most rather than those who can afford to pay for it, but sadly we have a Minister who is unable to provide the vision necessary to the task. This is not simply a matter of money. It is about steering our acute hospital services into a new relationship with the health needs of patients made central to treatment rather than, as now, made dependent on an ability to pay.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that generally our health services are not good. They are good and are staffed in the main by people of great dedication and professionalism, but the structural deficiencies in terms of manpower and resources militate against fairness and excellence. For the first time we are living in an economic climate that offers a chance of realizing that new relationship.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is that more true than in the situation now pertaining at Tallaght Hospital. The crunch issue, the catalyst that has forced this debate now, is the role the Minister for Health and Children has played in creating the impending crisis there.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear what has happened at Tallaght Hospital in case any spin or twist is put into this debate at a later stage. The opening of the hospital last June was a result of the great dedication, skill, determination and professionalism of the staff and management of the three base hospitals. It was an unprecedented achievement for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Those same members of staff who put such trust and energy into the project are, this week, voting in overwhelming numbers for strike action. It is not that their commitment has diminished. Paradoxically, it is the same spirit that is driving them to take a step which, generally speaking, is at variance with the ethos of the staff of any hospital. Their determination is to protect Tallaght Hospital from being down graded and starved into submission. They refuse to stand by and allow the cutbacks in services and job losses in a hospital that is already understaffed and operating at only 60 per cent capacity.</P>
    <P>Services have not been established, notably in <Col N="778" /> relation to the elderly day care centre. I am pleased the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly is present. He is a member of a Government that openly declared it would look after the elderly. Neither have services been established in cardiac catherization facilities. Morale among the staff has plummeted. High tech equipment is lying idle while patients are unnecessarily shipped over to St James's Hospital for tests, which involves a potential danger, because of a failure by the Minister to appreciate the requirements at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Just keeping the hospital operating as it currently stands will be impossible for the board unless the Minister acts to avert the pending crisis. This crisis is of the Minister's making; the faultline leads straight back to original miscalculations made in the Department of Health and Children. This is not only my view. It is the considered conclusion of the consultants who were sent in at the Minister's bidding.</P>
    <P>On page 26 of the Deloitte &amp; Touche Report the consultants state &ldquo;In our view the decision to base the 1998 Determination on the cost structure of the three base hospitals plus certain additional monies was inappropriate.&rdquo;  The report goes on to state &ldquo;The Determination process does not lend itself well to a situation of major change; such as the opening of a new hospital.&rdquo;  Earlier it is described as a &ldquo;relatively blunt instrument.&rdquo;  Today I received further confirmation of this and this point needs to be stated. The Deloitte &amp; Touche Report shows that from the Department's notes it knew in March 1998 the amount set was not enough. The notes record that it thought it had put enough funds aside. While it does not look like that now, the amount is set and it is a case of &ldquo;tough luck, Tallaght&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Tallaght Hospital is a state of the art, modern, technologically superb hospital. It is a Rolls Royce of a hospital, yet it is being forced to manage on a Morris Minor budget. The report pinpoints many other failures which the board has accepted without hesitation and is working conscientiously to address with the troika established on foot of the report. Its response is in stark contrast to that of the Minister who has not once accepted his responsibility or his culpability for a Department that could neither get its sums right nor use a mechanism appropriate to the task. Not only has the Minister refused to make this admission although he makes heavy demands on everyone else to be accountable, he has compounded his error yet again by leaving a shortfall in funding in the 1999 determination. Now he is reaping the whirlwind in the anger and frustration of staff members whose only desire is to continue to serve their patients and the community at large.</P>
    <P>The Minister is reported in today's newspapers as saying he will not make up that shortfall. Even at this eleventh hour he persists in his obduracy, yet he has the statutory authority to make it up without any difficulty. The Health Amendment Act provides for a Minister of health to make a variation in the determination. We all know the <Col N="779" /> Exchequer is awash with money. At the end of last year an extra £80 million was magically found to pay for the Garda pay deal, yet the Minister is saying he cannot find a paltry £5 million for a unique hospital project that has no parallel in the country and, therefore, cannot provide a precedent for any other hospital.</P>
    <P>It is almost as if there is a war of attrition against Tallaght Hospital. Many people believe there is a hidden agenda within the Department to bring Tallaght under its control, to clip its wings in a way that undermines the ethos and traditions of the three base hospitals. I hope that is not the case, but I am placing on record the fact that it is a widespread view. I hope when the Minister for Health and Children speaks, he will address the real funding deficit for this year and last year, something he has singularly failed to do until now.</P>
    <P>He might also explain why the expert advice he is hiding behind in making his decision to downgrade the paediatric haematology unit is not sufficiently well thought out to answer the points articulated so clearly by the parents of children with leukaemia who are appalled at the prospect of further unnecessary disruption to the service being provided at Tallaght for their children. Why, for example, should he make this decision which impacts severely on the only accredited paediatric haematology unit in Ireland, a brand new, purpose built unit which is the only externally audited diagnostic unit in Ireland and which has three fully qualified diagnosticians while the hospital being allocated the task of diagnosis has only one, and where there is uniquely a seamless transition for the patient from childhood through adolescence to adult care? </P>
    <P>In November an all-party motion was debated in the House on the needs of the mentally handicapped. I want to briefly refer to that issue again because these are the people who always lose out in the battle for resources. Despite that debate the situation has not improved. The most recent figures from the Mid-Western Health Board, for example, clearly show that the case made not just by Opposition Members but also by Fianna Fáil Members, has not been listened to. In the Mid-Western Health Board alone there is an urgent need for 76 new residential places and 81 day care units. The allocation received by the board will only provide for 19 residential and 17 day places, and at a reduced level. This is a pitiful response at a time when there are funds going a begging to meet the urgent needs in our communities.</P>
    <P>This motion is not about seeking a ministerial head on a platter.</P>

      <P>The Minister should listen as he might be interested in what I have to say. The impression one gets is that the Minister for Health and Children would shed no tears if he <Col N="780" /> was moved elsewhere. He is a man of undoubted ability and intelligence with an unprecedented amount of money at his disposal, which raises an obvious question, namely, why is he unsuccessful in meeting the requirements of his brief when all the circumstances are such that his position should be absolutely secure. No Minister in recent times has received so much criticism, in a whole area of concerns, as the Minister, Deputy Cowen. Yet the circumstances in which he is operating, economically and in other ways, have never been so good.</P>
      <P>The Minister's track record reveals the lack of serious commitment required for the task. His lethargy, combined with the clear breakdown of relations between senior officials in his Department, a case which has ended up in court, has resulted in a failure of governance of our health service. What is required now is a fresh Government initiative under new leadership that will confront the growing inequities in our health services, the escalating waiting lists, the shattering of hospital staff morale and, most significantly, the increasing despair felt by thousands of sick and vulnerable people. The release of the Hawkins House One is the first step towards resolving the vital issues that are impacting so severely on our acute hospital services. I commend this motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House this evening is timely. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has been in office for over a year and a half and in that time he has presided over a period of unprecedented turmoil in the public health system. The 18 months of the Minister's tenure have been marked by ward closures, industrial strife and lengthening waiting lists. It is time the Taoiseach recognised the Minister's failure to deliver quality health care to the citizens and brought this appalling state of affairs to an end.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House this evening is not a personal attack on the Minister for Health and Children. He is a capable, intelligent and resourceful politician. In a lacklustre Cabinet I am sure he adds much needed weight to Cabinet discussions. However, in his role as Minister of Health and Children he has failed abysmally. In such a vital Department, that failure results in untold hardship and anguish for thousands of families. It is time for the Minister, Deputy Cowen to admit that, as Minister for Health and Children, he has not created a record of achievement but a legacy of failure. As a result, the public has lost confidence in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rarely speaks to the media about his management of the health services. In contrast he has had no hesitancy of late in gracing the national airwaves to try to shore up support for the increasingly embattled Taoiseach. However, on the rare occasions when the Minister, Deputy Cowen, does speak on policy issues he is quick to remind us of his disdain for ideology. In his world ideology and ideas are a hindrance. This attitude provides an insight into the Minister's perform<Col N="781" /> ance in the Department of Health and Children, in particular the total lack of progress on the issue of child welfare and child protection that is, supposedly, a key part of his brief.</P>
    <P>When the Government was formed it took the decision to expand the remit of the Department of Health to include children. However, since then I have never heard the Minister say one significant thing about the Government's policy on children. He seems content to abandon all responsibility for this key area to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. As a result children have no voice at the Cabinet table. Their needs, and the commitments contained in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium have slipped way down the Government's priority list. An isolated Minister of State is expected to carry the can for the Government's failings on child welfare and child protection. Instead of actually driving forward a policy on children, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, is more concerned with insulating himself from responsibility to account for the disastrous record on children's issues. After 18 months it is becoming increasingly clear that the Department's change of name to include children was a cynical exercise, designed simply to portray the impression that this issue is high on the Government's agenda when nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>As regards child care policy, the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium increasingly resembles a work of fiction. The first priority the Government committed itself to was &ldquo;to enact comprehensive juvenile justice legislation&rdquo;. Legislation of this nature was first promised in 1971. Eventually, after years of delay, the rainbow Government published the Juvenile Justice Bill, 1996. The Bill was debated in the House and passed Second Stage. The Bill was on Committee Stage when the current Government came to power. The Bill was restored to the Order Paper but since then absolutely nothing has been done. The Bill has been parked in Committee Stage and, seemingly, abandoned by the Government. Each month I raise this matter on the Order of Business with the Taoiseach. Each month I receive the same reply &ndash; the Government is compiling its own amendments and this process has not been finalised. There is no sense of urgency within Government in this long awaited important Bill. We are now informed it is likely that, after 18 months of prevarication, the Government will scrap the 1996 Bill and introduce its own legislation. The enactment of comprehensive juvenile justice legislation has been put back for many years due to this shameful inaction on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that vehement criticism of this Government's failure to implement a coherent child care strategy will not just be found on the Opposition benches. The most valuable and strident criticisms of this State's policy on children was delivered more than 12 months ago by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. The UN report addressed a <Col N="782" /> situation which has pertained in Ireland for many years. I am not attempting to claim that all the faults and failings highlighted in that report can be laid at the door of this Government. However, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out to this House in a different context last week, the way the politicians of the late 1990s respond to the failings of previous incumbents is of crucial importance. By this yardstick, the Minister and the Government have failed miserably to meet the moral and political challenges set out by the UN report.</P>
    <P>In summary, the UN report criticised the absence of a comprehensive national policy on child care, the dearth of co-operation and co-ordination between agencies whose role is to protect the welfare of children and the failure to appoint an ombudsman for children. The Government's response to this trenchant and legitimate criticism has been quite pathetic and responsibility for that lies squarely at the door of the present Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>One of the first acts of the new Department of Health and Children was to abolish the previous Government's proposal to establish an ombudsman for children. At the time, we were promised that in place of the ombudsman, a new social services inspectorate, which in the first instance would concentrate on monitoring State child care services and developing child welfare policy, would be established.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the UN report, the Government rushed to roll back its decision to scrap the proposal for an ombudsman for children. Since last January, we have been informed that the Government is reconsidering the matter. We are also reassured that proposals regarding the social services inspectorate are proceeding but in reality, nothing has happened. Confusions reigns in the Department of Health and Children. There is still no ombudsman for children and the long awaited social services inspectorate is not up and running.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are no proposals to put either of those vital services on an independent footing as statutory services. Legislation has not been promised. Although it was in the programme for Government in the last term, it has vanished off the current programme.</P>
    <P>The proposed social services inspectorate was meant to concentrate on monitoring services for children. However, 18 months after the Government took office, this inspectorate has not been established because a chief executive for the agency has not been recruited. It seems the monitoring and development of child care services in this State is not a priority for the Minister. The inertia over the establishment of an inspectorate is matched by Government dithering over the appointment of an ombudsman. The Government is at sixes and sevens on this important policy initiative.</P>
    <P>It is obvious there is little co-ordination in the Government's approach. In addition to the failure to establish an inspectorate or the Ombudsman, the Government seems utterly unclear about to how to develop policy in this area. There <Col N="783" /> is no indication as to what the relationship should be between these two bodies. The lack of progress to date can be based on the fact that the Minister for Health and Children has no clear goals on child policy. He has no clear objectives, his only concern is to make sure he cannot be blamed for the dearth of direction in child policy. If this means hanging his Minister of State out to dry, then the Minister it would seem, has no hesitation in taking this course of action.</P>
    <P>Another key priority for the Government, according to An Action Programme for the Millennium was the introduction of mandatory reporting of child abuse. To date we have seen spats between the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Tánaiste on this matter. It appears the Minister of State has grave reservations about the introduction of these measures, concerns which are not shared by the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats. Has the Minister raised his voice in this debate? Has he come to the defence of his junior Minister or has he indicated support for the Tánaiste's view on the contents of the programme for Government? Not a chance. On one of the most contentious issues relating to child protection, the Minister has buried his head in the sand and hoped the whole messy business will blow over. Some leadership, some Minister.</P>
    <P>Child welfare and child protection are urgent issues that must be addressed. To date, the Government has been big on talk and short on action in this area. The failure to establish a well resourced body to monitor child care services is just one example of the lethargy that dominates Government policy in this area. Ultimately, it is the most vulnerable children who have to pay the price for this lacklustre approach to child policy.</P>
    <P>The child protection services operated by health boards are in a state of crisis. In the Eastern Health Board, for instance, child protection services are concentrated on emergency cases. The amount of time and resources that can be dedicated to the vital preventive work that needs to be done are abysmal.</P>
    <P>Information systems are appalling. Figures relating to the number of children in care, the reasons for them being in care and the number of families awaiting assessment by a child care worker cannot be provided.</P>

      <P>The lack of planning and co-ordination of child care policy means huge amounts of staff time is held up in attending court cases where the needs of individual children are discussed against a backdrop of scarce facilities and inappropriate care centres. Last year it took strong condemnation from a High Court judge to shake the Government out of its complacency in the provision of adequate places for children in need of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under-resourcing child care services leads to a <Col N="784" /> serious morale problem within child care services. Many talented and dedicated people have had to leave the profession, and that is as a result of lack of planning on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a palpable anger among the public at the condition of our public health system and the chronic state of our child care services. Nothing the Minister or his supporting chorus on the Fianna Fáil backbenches say tonight can change that fact. Despite his aversion to public comment on health and children, the Minister has managed to spend a king ransom's on public relations advice since coming into office. He should have held on to this money as it now appears that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy has no problem in dishing out media advice for free to his colleagues in Cabinet.

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann has full confidence in the Minister for Health and Children and, in noting with particular approval the Minister's achievement in securing an increase of 28 per cent in revenue funding and 43 per cent in capital funding in 1999 over the 1997 provision in place on coming to office, also welcomes the major service improvements under way across a whole range of areas as a result of the provision of this greatly enhanced level funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate and outline once again what the Government is achieving in developing the health service. I am also happy to respond to the criticism from the Opposition and, in the process, give some facts which it may not welcome. I will point, in particular, to the <Col N="785" /> huge gap between its rhetoric and its achievements when it held the purse strings in government.</P>
    <P>I face a dilemma. Do I react and deal with the petty political agenda being followed by those who want to use the issues within the health service as a political football or do I ignore the nonsense and concentrate on what concerns the public? I have taken the view that it is best to ignore the politics and get on with the job. I intend, therefore, to ignore the political jousting that is of no interest to the majority whom we aim to serve.</P>
    <P>Those working in the health service have become cynical of the extent to which the services are increasingly used as a political football. They know that issues now being exploited were also issues during the Opposition's time in government. There was a persistent failure by the previous Government to address them over a number of years. The major difference between the Government's approach to the health service and that of its immediate predecessor is that it is committing resources, instead of uttering platitudes. I lay down the challenge that no matter how the Opposition pours over the respective figures it cannot fail to be embarrassed when a comparison is made between the Government's investment in the health service and what happened under its stewardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional resources provided by the Government are double the increase provided by the parties opposite.</P>
      <P>I do not deny there are problems in the health service that have to be addressed. The Government is determined to address them in a structured and planned fashion in partnership with all those interested in improving the health service. There are those who seek to portray a systematic and reasoned approach to reform of the health service as indicative of inertia and lethargy, to use a favourite phrase of Deputy Shatter. On the contrary, I make no apology for diagnosing problems, identifying solutions and implementing reforms in a structured way so that the progress achieved endures. Our strategy for the health service is based on three key elements: a substantial increase in the resources provided; proper planning of the use of these resources; and a partnership approach to the resolution of problems with interests of the patients the overriding consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has given unprecedented recognition to the need for increased investment in the health service. Reform, however, is not just about increased resources. It is about tackling underlying structural weaknesses in the system. The Government has devised a clear and coherent programme for the health service in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in many other policy documents, including the Department's strategy statement. I am open to <Col N="786" /> constructive dialogue on the implementation of these improvements. I am conscious that, for certain parties, improving services in the medium and long-term is less important than exploiting short-term opportunities. The main result of such mischief is to create unnecessary doubt and fear among patients.</P>
    <P>I care deeply about preventing illness and providing good services for those who need them. I have a special responsibility to those for whom there are few advocates and who do not have major interest groups to plead their cause. I take the concept of equity seriously. The major initiative I have taken for public patients &ndash; an all out assault on waiting lists &ndash; is the one which was subjected to a significant reduction in expenditure by the previous Government. I have done much and I hope to do much more for the mentally handicapped, the physically disabled and older people. Public patients should enjoy the best standards of physical accommodation and be treated by fully trained doctors. On these issues, I ask Deputies opposite to reflect on what they failed to do when they had the opportunity and were fully aware of the need.</P>
    <P>The health service is a soft target from within and without. It is subject to easy black propaganda and much hyperbole. It will never be perfect but it can always be improved, provided the improvement is designed with the needs of patients at the core of the initiative. That is my mission. I will now outline, not for the first time, what I and the Department are achieving, with the ready co-operation of all the health agencies and their staff.</P>
    <P>Critics of the health service like to present it as unplanned, unfocused and unco-ordinated. This is not supported by the facts. The development of services is based on basic principles which are applied quietly and consistently to a health service which does not readily lend itself to the classic concepts of corporate management and control. The framework can be described simply.</P>
    <P>There is an overall strategy which focuses on real and measurable improvement in health status and is based on the principles of equity, quality and accountability. For most sectors, there is a specific strategy supported by an assessment of need and a plan to meet that need. Each sector is reviewed regularly through special working groups and, more recently, service reviews. The priorities for development are agreed across the service and form the basis for the acquisition and allocation of development funds. Each agency is required to produce and implement a service plan within its annual determination. The Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, referred to as the accountability legislation, ensures the system lives within its means and supports planning accountability and orderly development.</P>
    <P>All politics is local and we tend to focus on what is nearest to us. In doing so, we forget to make objective comparisons. The organisation, cohesion, impact and value for money of the health service is properly regarded, by those who <Col N="787" /> have examined it objectively, as providing good quality at relatively low cost to the taxpayer. Critics tend to highlight what it may lack. They rarely acknowledge the considerable strengths which come from a centrally funded, well planned service, staffed by a well trained and highly committed workforce. For example, significantly more people were treated in our hospitals in 1998 than in previous years. It is right that the gaps in the service should be addressed. That is what I am doing far more quickly than those who are criticising me. We should not talk ourselves and health service staff into artificial depression about imagined crises.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus stated that Tallaght Hospital is the catalyst that sparked her move. Given the extent to which the Opposition has deliberately misrepresented the difficulties at Tallaght Hospital, let me briefly give the salient facts before informing Deputies of the latest welcome developments.</P>
    <P>The board of the hospital failed to produce a service plan within the determination for 1998. It initially indicated a shortfall of £900,000. It then claimed to be short £5.9 million and after less than three months in operation it informed the Department that it would require an additional £21 million in 1998, of which £16.4 million was attributed to non-capital. It was in these unprecedented and alarming circumstances that I commissioned the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. The hospital, the board and senior management created the conditions which made this review essential. Any other presentation of the root cause of the current difficulties is not a reflection of what happened.</P>
    <P>The report which was received in early December was critical of issues relating to governance and top general management at the hospital and pointed to serious deficiencies in these areas. It did not deal with clinical issues at the hospital. The determination process used by the Department in relation to the hospital for 1998 has been the focus of critical comment. I invite reflection on the following points. The report states, on pages 25 to 27, that the determination was a relatively blunt instrument in relation to the development and commissioning costs. This represents about 10 per cent of the total determination.</P>
    <P>The alternative method regarded as preferred by the consultants &ndash; in effect a zero-based budgeting approach &ndash; was not feasible. The hospital had not geared itself to make such a submission to the Department. It was its responsibility to do so, if it wished to provide an alternative model. It did not recruit a director of finance until September 1997.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to automatically assume such a method would have been more favourable to the hospital. In such a process every post would have to be fully justified, allowances would have to be incorporated, based in the main on appropriate case mix costings in hospitals operating to best <Col N="788" /> practice. It is the Department's view that the product of such an exercise was unlikely to have been more favourable to the hospital than the determination made.</P>
    <P>The Department used, in the way most favourable to the hospital, the only available methodology. Three scenarios were computed and the most favourable chosen. The hospital opened with 76 fewer beds than in the base hospitals. It was provided with 35 beds to treat longer stay sub-acute patients in the Meath Hospital, funded by the Eastern Health Board. The net position of the hospital in 1998 was improved by about £4 million as a result of these factors.</P>
    <P>The report states that the incremental method of determination was inappropriate. However, the method preferred by Deloitte &amp; Touche, effectively zero based budgeting, would have been particularly difficult, especially in relation to staffing levels. Given that one would expect savings in a merger, it is highly likely that the outcome would be that even less funding would have been given in that scenario. It is also worth noting that the hospital is currently working on 76 beds less than the base hospitals. Even taking account of a more complex case mix in Tallaght, the incremental approach was the most favourable to the hospital. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report shows that since the move to Tallaght, the hospital has been operating below its service plan levels and, consequently, below the 1997 outturn level.</P>
    <P>The hospital was notified of its non-capital determination for 1999 on 23 December 1998 in the sum of £64.69 million. A further £3.916 million was approved in respect of the spending in the federated Dublin voluntary hospitals. Almost all this latter amount refers to staffing at the Tallaght Hospital. The total amount available to the hospital for 1999 is, therefore, £69 million. The House will be aware that I agreed to a two-week extension on the time limit for submission of the hospital's service plan until 12 February 1999. This extension was agreed to initially following contact with the Department by the chairman of the Tallaght Hospital group of unions. This extension allowed the three-person group I established to oversee the implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, have an input into the service plan. I subsequently agreed to a further extension which means that the service plan is due today.</P>
    <P>Given the hospital's case mix and state of the art facilities, I am satisfied the amount provided for this year, £69 million, is sufficient to meet pay and non-pay costs for approved services, including the full year costs of 1998 developments. The determination does not include any provision for the further development of services. It has been agreed that the detail of such development will be the subject of further discussions with my Department when it is clear that the recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report are implemented.</P>
    <P>Very considerable energy and expertise has been expended in helping the hospital resolve its difficulties. That commitment will remain in place <Col N="789" /> for as long as is necessary. On a number of occasions I met with the chairman and officers of the board since the Deloitte &amp; Touche report was published. On every such occasion I have reaffirmed my commitment to putting the hospital on a firm footing. I have made available to the hospital the expertise of three eminent people to help implement the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and they are being supported by management consultants. A team dedicated to helping the hospital remains in place in the Department. The staff at the hospital have continued to give dedicated services in a period of turbulence and uncertainty. It is, therefore, very gratifying to report the first major fruits of all this effort.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform Deputies that at a meeting held earlier today, the board agreed to a service plan for 1999 which, on the basis of the information now available to me, will comply with the requirements set out in the letter of determination. The plan provides for the full delivery of the approved level of services during 1999. There will be no enforced redundancies and the shedding of excess staff will be linked primarily to the completion of their short-term contracts. There will be no bed closures, other than those which occur seasonally. The plan will provide a very good basis for resolving potential industrial relations problems and I take the opportunity to urge all staff to support its implementation. In reaching this very satisfactory outcome I have been pleased to assist the board in its difficulties by agreeing to provide £1 million in 1999 to develop top priority services at the hospital, once the three person group assisting the board is satisfied, in line with the recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, that sufficient progress has been made on the implementation of the consultants' report to resume the phased further development of services at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The orderly, planned and focused approach to planning and budgeting to which I am committed and which is now in place for all agencies has stood the test in very difficult circumstances at Tallaght. We must now focus on helping the hospital to implement the plan and overcome the challenges it faces. The full and rapid implementation of the recommendations in the consultants' report is now a prerequisite for the planned further development of this magnificent facility. The governance, management and cost control problems must be addressed. The hospital needs a long period away from the distracting glare of public conflict and a very early appointment of a chief executive. I understand the board is determined to bring this about very quickly and I hope it will have every success in its efforts.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the board for the very positive way it has availed of the assistance provided by Mr. Kevin Bonner, Professor John Murray and Mr. Donal O'Shea since their appointment at the end of January. I am confident that a very good basis has now been laid to fully resolve the current difficulties at the hospital. I have had very cordial meetings with <Col N="790" /> representatives of the board in the past two months and we are all agreed that establishing the hospital on a firm footing is our fully shared objective.</P>
    <P>However, this debate must be about more than one hospital or, indeed, all hospitals. There are many other vital services which must be maintained and developed. We must take a strategic approach, integrating all services in pursuit of better health outcomes. We are actively applying this approach in tackling the two main diseases &ndash; cancer and cardiovascular disease.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have provided substantial funding to implement the provisions of the national cancer strategy. I acknowledge the initiative which my predecessor, Deputy Michael Noonan, took in launching this strategy and I am very happy to build on his very good work in this area. I am happy to acknowledge the obvious benefits of the approach he adopted, developing a strategy based on inclusive consultation and implementing a realistic plan on a multi-annual basis.</P>
    <P>I have made £19.5 million available to implement the provisions of the national cancer strategy since coming into office. This substantial funding is, <i>inter alia</i>, addressing regional imbalances in the availability of cancer treatment services outside Dublin. I am pleased with the progress made so far. Since implementation of the strategy commenced we have provided for 22 additional major consultant posts in the treatment and care of people with cancer, alongside a range of important support staff, who have either taken up duty or are currently being recruited.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy was accompanied by an action plan. The funding I have provided effectively delivers on that plan. There is more to be done in the area of cancer and I will be looking at this in the context of the Estimates for 2000. The Government can be justifiably proud of its record in delivering on a major programme of improvements to cancer services on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I am also committed to making the necessary resources available to implement a national breast screening programme. I hope the programme will get under way in the autumn. Another important initiative to receive funding is the national cervical screening programme. In 1995, 72 women died due to cancer of the cervix. If diagnosed late the disease has a high fatality rate, hence the importance of an effective screening programme.</P>
    <P>It was decided to pilot a screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board as a forerunner to the introduction of a national programme. A project office has been set up and work is currently under way on setting up a computerised population register of the target group of 67,000 women in the mid-west region. Further funding has been secured in 1999 in respect of this project. Until such time as a screening programme is available nationally I will continue to provide resources to hospitals and health boards to <Col N="791" /> improve access to screening services and to reduce waiting times for results of smear tests.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the major problem of cardiovascular disease, an issue on which we can effect very considerable improvement for the whole population. Important initiatives have already been taken. Even more far-reaching developments will be launched during 1999.</P>
    <P>I will first address the improvements planned and under way in existing services. I am confident the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and University College Hospital, Galway, announced last year will help reduce existing waiting lists. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. I am pleased to announce I have today approved the acceptance of tenders for the new cardiac unit in St James's at a total cost of £6.1 million. This development is scheduled for completion by the end of this year. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by more than 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit in the Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1999, an additional £16 million will have been invested since 1997 in the improvement of cardiac services. At the end of 1998, there had been a significant reduction in the number of adults and children waiting for treatment. Between September 1997 and March 1998, the number of patients awaiting surgery reduced from 1619 to 1300, a reduction of 23 per cent. The 1998 initiative built on the success of my 1997 initiative as evidenced by the latest waiting list data which shows an overall reduction of 22 per cent in adult and children waiting.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done and it will be done. In particular, we are formulating a strategy on how the incidence and management of the disease can be improved. I expect shortly the report of the group which I established in January 1998 to make recommendations on an overall cardiovascular strategy. This will address the preventative, medical and rehabilitation services needed to reduce the incidence of the disease and improve the services available to those who develop cardiovascular problems. I am committed to delivering and supporting whatever programmes are necessary to reduce the burden which affects so many in our community as a result of this modern killer disease, which is due in part to lifestyle and environmental factors.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland. <Col N="792" /> The existing arrangement is clearly not ideal for patients and their families. I am taking a number of steps to follow through on the Government's commitment and ensure the introduction as soon as practicable of this new and highly complex service.</P>
    <P>The Mater Hospital has been designated as the surgical site in Ireland for heart and lung transplants. The hospital will provide this service in association with other key service providers, in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, which is the major centre in Ireland for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The Mater Hospital, as a matter of urgency, is co-ordinating and finalising a detailed assessment of the infrastructural and service issues involved in developing the programme. I am committed to providing the necessary finance and support for the development of a quality transplant programme in this country.</P>
    <P>On taking up office, I immediately recognised the serious needs that required to be addressed in the capital area. The health capital programme had been significantly under-resourced in the years prior to my appointment. The previous Government appeared to be content with accepting hospitals and other units which belonged more to the last century than to the last decade of the 20th century. My objective is to secure the necessary capital funding so that the people have the best possible standards in hospital care and other areas of the health services.</P>
    <P>I negotiated a three year programme in relation to planned capital expenditure. This is the first time that any Minister for Health has been in a position to provide such assurance on the capital development front over the medium term. I set about securing significant annual increases in funding for the capital area. Exchequer capital spending for this year is £155 million and the corresponding allocations for 2000 and 2001 will be £165 million and £205 million respectively. Over the three year period 1999-2001, the total amount of investment will be £525 million compared to the 1995-97 period when the Opposition was in office and only £309 million was spent.</P>
    <P>Major hospital developments which are in construction or planning and require capital funding in 1999 include the Mater, St. James's, Naas, St. Vincent's, Elm Park, Limerick Regional, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Clonmel, Cashel, Mayo, Portiuncula in Ballinasloe and University College Hospital, Galway. In addition, I introduced specific funding last year of £10 million for priority equipment replacement and also continued the provision of £6 million capital funding in respect of maintenance backlogs and fire precaution works. These will now go ahead because of political decisions taken by this Government in contrast to the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>I am not only concerned with radically improving the acute hospital infrastructure, I am also determined to increase capital spending on groups like the elderly where I have committed <Col N="793" /> £14 million this year compared to £4 million when the Opposition was in office. I recently visited Thurles where I went to see privately the conditions of the Hospital of the Assumption. I wanted to see for myself the conditions which had been allowed to develop for some of the most vulnerable elderly persons in our society. I did not bring along the media on this visit.</P>
    <P>In respect of St. Ita's, Portrane, again I visited privately to see at first hand the very outdated conditions. I was very pleased to announce a major project costing £13 million to be funded by my Department and the Eastern Health Board. This is my strategy, to go and see the facts of the situation and not to allow bad conditions to get worse. There is also, for the first time ever, the £30 million national capital programme for those with mental handicap. There was no capital programme for mental handicap services before I took office. This will include St. Ita's and it is the first time such a programme has been put in place.</P>

      <P>In her radio interview this morning, Deputy McManus sought to make much of our relative position in the EU league table of health spending. I remind the Deputy that the expenditure figures are based on the situation which prevailed in 1995 when the last Government was in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to be careful of simple comparisons. The figures on which the Deputy is relying need to be interpreted, having regard to the different demographic profiles of the countries and the relative cost effectiveness of their systems. It is acknowledged by the OECD that our system results &ldquo;in good provision of health care at relatively low cost to the taxpayer&rdquo;. We also need to remind ourselves that we are not yet carrying the burden which falls on many other EU countries in providing services for the very high proportion of their populations which are old or very old. We need hardly look beyond the state of health agencies in the USA to see that high <i>per capita</i> spending does not automatically equate to a high quality, equitable and comprehensive system.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting if we could look at the situation at the end of 1998 or 1999. If the level of increased investment by this Government is sustained, I would expect that our relative position as we move into the next millennium will be more favourable. The acid test is the adequacy of the services provided, not our relative position in interesting but not conclusive league tables.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to turn to the services on <Col N="794" /> which the Deputies have chosen to be critical of my performance, usually without a backward glance on their parts to when they were in office. Since my appointment I have consistently identified as one of my top priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in the document, &ldquo;Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since June 1997 I have allocated an additional £53 million, with a full year cost of £59 million in 2000, towards the cost of meeting the needs identified in the assessment of need report. In the three year period, 1995-97, the previous Government allocated a total of £36.22 million in capital and revenue funding, or on average just over £12 million per year to these services. This compares to an average of £25 million per year allocated by me to these services to date. As I stated, I have also put in place a £30 million national capital programme to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need. The level of additional funding provided to date has given clear and concrete evidence of my commitment to meeting the service needs of persons with a mental handicap, their families and carers.</P>
      <P>In relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the report of the review group on health and personal social services, which was published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of the services. Prior to the publication of that report, the previous Government provided a total of £3.688 million in 1997. Before the end of that year, my Government invested another £10 million in this sector. Last year a further £12.4 million was provided and this year £13.4 million is being made available. This gives a total of £35.8 million since this Government took office. This is substantial funding by any standard and compares very favourably to what the previous Government did for this deserving group of people. There is no contest.</P>
      <P>The issue of waiting lists has received much attention. No country has solved the problem and all the most comprehensive studies, both here and abroad, emphasise that there are no simple, quick fix solutions. Despite these hard facts, I have been subject to some extremely simplistic and poorly thought out criticisms from the other side of the House on this matter. I wish we could have reasoned debate on this issue, rather than the extraordinarily ill-informed approach taken by the Opposition. Despite its complaints, it loses sight entirely of the fact that I have provided two and a half times more funding this year than it did before it left office in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group has pointed out what needs to be done in the short, medium and long-term. The Government is providing the funds to ensure that happens. The measures I have taken were not in place in 1998. Nevertheless, the information available to me on the position at the end of last year indicates that the overall numbers have stabilised and that numbers in many special<Col N="795" /> ities and, importantly, waiting times are being stabilised. We will now attack that problem on the basis of the review group's recommendations and the funding which the Minister for Finance has made available to me.</P>
    <P>There has been understandable criticism of the difficulties which arise during peak demand periods in providing beds promptly for emergency admissions. The entire question of the adequacy of emergency beds is being considered in the context of the Estimates for next year.</P>
    <P>The Opposition skirts over the issue of resources and accountability. I do not intend to revert to the position in the 1980s when that side was in Government and there was an <i>ad hoc</i> system which created critical service pressures.</P>

      <P>During the course of this debate, my colleagues will take great pleasure in pointing out the real improvements that have happened during our tenure in office. We do not claim the system is perfect but we are providing far greater resources. An extra £800 million in revenue is going into the health services, compared to the previous Government's term when the increase was £400 million. During the tenure of this Administration we will bring about real improvements in the health service which deserves better than the Opposition's catch cries this evening.</P>

      <P>We need a new, dynamic and radical approach to the provision of health care as we enter a new millennium. It is quite clear that dynamic approach, despite all the Minister's bluster, is not forthcoming form the present Government. The increasing prosperity of this Ireland of the Celtic tiger requires a new patriotism committed to ensuring equality of access for all to essential health services and an end to the type of chaos experienced by many who had to seek hospital care over the past two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy is that we have, under this Government an incompetent Minister for Health and Children presiding over a dysfunctional Department with, what the Spanish would call, a manana mentality. Nothing is seen as sufficiently urgent in its impact on the lives of people to merit <Col N="796" /> immediate action. Most of the plans we have heard from the Minister this evening may come on stream at the end of 1999 or maybe in the year 2000. A number of them were announced more than a year ago. In the context of new hospital facilities, the foundation stones have not yet been laid for many of the projects the Minister referred to.</P>
    <P>Breast and cervical screening programmes that should have commenced last September will not now get under way until next autumn. Prostrate screening programmes will not be seen until well into the new millennium. Cervical screening programmes may, if we are lucky, be seen by the year 2000. While internecine warfare publicly and embarrassingly breaks out between top officials in his Department, the Minister stands aside and observes the scene like a spectator at a football match. It is not acceptable that any Minister, who is accountable for the workings of his Department, so behaves.</P>
    <P>Financial, not human, considerations have been the Government's central concern in all aspects of health policy. On past occasions the Minister for Health and Children has talked in this House of the &ldquo;levels of productivity&rdquo; in our hospitals, as if treating people is the equivalent of manufacturing cars or computer parts. Patients' needs do not feature in his vocabulary. The Fine Gael vision of ensuring equal and speedy access for all to essential medical care is alien to the thinking of the present Government. At a time when this State is experiencing unprecedented economic prosperity we have a Minister for Health and Children who, to date, has been locked in a 1980s time warp of economic recession and who sees his main political mission as limiting health expenditure rather than expanding our health services in a planned and coherent way to meet the real needs of our people. The rhetoric of tonight has not been matched by ministerial action since this Minister took office.</P>
    <P>Limiting expenditure does not apply to his expenditure on promoting his own image. Sadly, this Minister still does not realise his policy of self-promotion entirely lacks credibility with the general public. To many he now has the image of the &ldquo;tyrant from Tullamore&rdquo;. While prepared to publicly criticise the board of Tallaght hospital for overspending on patient needs &ndash; and he did so, yet again, this evening &ndash; he has been strangely silent when it comes to the greed of his former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, and to allegations that some of his former ministerial colleagues were pocketing other people's money, including Fianna Fáil's, for their own excessive requirements.</P>
    <P>In Tallaght, the taxpayers have provided funding for a new state-of-the-art hospital, of which we should all be proud. The hospital opened successfully on 21 June 1998. New and excellent relationships were forged between the board members of the different hospitals and between all of those employed within the hospitals at all different levels. By initially grossly under funding <Col N="797" /> the hospital and failing to acknowledge and speedily act upon the findings in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report that the mechanisms applied to determine the funding of the hospital were &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;, the Minister destroyed the good relationships between many board members, destroyed labour relations within the hospital, grossly undermined the morale of the hospital's nursing, medical and servicing staff, and damaged public confidence in a new hospital which is providing excellent medical care.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister announced a resolution of some of the conflict in Tallaght and has indicated to the House that he is now making an additional £1 million available over and above the allocation originally announced for 1999. It remains to be seen whether the announcements made by the Minister in this House tonight are a true resolution of the difficulties that have arisen and whether they truly reflect the real position in Tallaght. In the past, the Minister has not fully informed the House of the reality of his discussions with those involved in negotiating on behalf of Tallaght hospital. The Minister and his Department have been loathe to release documentation concerning the contacts between departmental officials and Deloitte &amp; Touche during the course of carrying out their consultancy. We now know there were three different draft versions of this report before it was finally published. To date, the Minister's Department has been unwilling to release documentation which would detail the nature of the contacts between his officials and Deloitte &amp; Touche prior to the report being published.</P>
    <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act, they are demanding hundreds of pounds in return for the release of information to me as Fine Gael's spokesperson on health. I challenge the Minister to release all the documentation in his Department relating to the contacts that took place between Deloitte &amp; Touche and ministerial officials in the run up to the publication of that report in December, so that we will know finally whether this was truly an independent report or whether, to some degree, it was influenced by secret discussions that took place with departmental officials.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister says, our health service is in crisis. The growth in our population arising from economic prosperity, increases in births, the return of thousands of former emigrants, and greater longevity resulting in a substantial increase in the elderly within our community, has placed our hospitals, doctors and nurses under unprecedented pressure. Neither the Minister for Health and Children nor his Department have yet come to terms with the needs of our growing population, nor have they put in place the radical changes required to ensure those needs are properly met, as outlined in the Fine Gael document &ldquo;Patients First&rdquo;, which was published last October.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the report of the working group on the waiting list initiative, which <Col N="798" /> he received in July 1998. However, he refused to publish it until December 1998 and, to date, little if anything in the report has been implemented.</P>
    <P>As I said at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis, the present Minister in his dealings with the health service has shown the insight and sensitivity of a rhinoceros in heat. He has no understanding of the havoc he leaves in his wake on each occasion he briefly dips into an important area of health policy.</P>
    <P>As Minister for escalating waiting lists, he is not only presiding over the growth of waiting lists that existed when he came into office but can be credited with inventing entirely new ones. There are today more than 3,000 anxious women awaiting mammograms. In December 1998 there was an estimated 38,000 patients on in-patient waiting lists. In January there was a waiting list of more than 400 elderly patients in acute hospitals in need of long-term nursing home or convalescent care, or seeking a place in rehabilitation facilities, who could not be released from hospital as no places were available to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>In the fight against drugs, we know it is essential that addicted young people have treatment programmes immediately available to them when they seek help to become drug free. Yet, at the end of December, there were 617 people on waiting lists for treatment in various drug treatment centres in the Dublin area alone. Scandalously, they are abandoned to continue their habit until a place becomes available.</P>
    <P>We even have waiting lists for wheelchairs. At the beginning of January 581 people, spread across health boards throughout the country, were on the wheelchair waiting list. If the present Minister for Health and Children could extend the nine month period of pregnancy, we would also have an escalating maternity waiting list.</P>
    <P>There is no logic or coherence in the policies of the current Government. As hospital waiting lists escalated, 16,000 bed days were lost during the past six weeks of 1998 due to bed closures forced by financial stringencies. Many of the hospitals who closed down surgical beds did so because they had during the first 11 months of the year completed the number of procedures for which they were funded. The Minister for Health and Children negligently failed to review the hospital financial needs to facilitate additional targeted procedures being undertaken to tackle the waiting list scandal. As the Minister in his budget statement announced a waiting list initiative for 1999, hospitals throughout the country were notifying patients of the cancellation or postponement of long awaited operations. People in pain awaiting hip or knee replacement surgery learnt it was the policy of this Government that they remain in pain. Patients awaiting critical cardiac surgery learned that, as far as this Government was concerned, their lives had no value.</P>
    <P>In a six week period, more than 1,500 patients were informed that their long awaited surgery <Col N="799" /> was being cancelled or postponed. The policy of closing hospital beds and wards must end. It is clear from comments made by the Minister, even this evening, that he intends to continue with this foolish policy.</P>
    <P>The closure of hospital beds and wards to balance budgets is false economy. It results in paltry savings, prolongs pain and suffering, places at greater risk patients with life-threatening conditions, demoralises hospital staff, contributes to the acceleration of waiting lists and ultimately puts additional pressures on many accident and emergency departments. The cancellation of operations originally scheduled for the end of last year and early this year was partially responsible for the accident and emergency crisis with which our hospitals were confronted in January. During the crisis, the Minister was noticeable for his invisibility. Presumably he was advised to lie low by the public relations consultancy firm recruited by him to promote his image. To date, £120,000 of taxpayers' money has been wasted on this futile promotional exercise.</P>
    <P>We need a different Minister in the Department: one who is committed to developing our health services, who has a genuine interest in health care and who has insight into the needs of those who are consumers of health services. In short, we need a different Minister. The current Minister's confrontational style and gratuitous attitude are detrimentally impacting on the morale of doctors and nurses and undermining public confidence in the health service. It is time for him to go.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister had to leave but I am sure it was on pressing business. At least we had the opportunity to see him, because over the past months when we have debated the crisis in the health service, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has been the invisible man of the Government. He has been 20 months in office and has had that time to deal with the problems which existed when he took office. However, his record during that time has not been good. The Fianna Fáil backbenchers who came to the House to applaud him would have to concede that, every weekend at their clinics, they deal with people who are suffering because of the health crisis. The imprint of the Minister on the Department over the past 20 months has been one of lengthening waiting lists. We were told by the Minister that we should not use the words &ldquo;waiting lists&rdquo; but speak instead of &ldquo;waiting times&rdquo;. Whether we speak of waiting lists or waiting times, a bad picture is being painted by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Moffatt, is present. I point out to <Col N="800" /> him that there are elderly people throughout the country waiting in many cases for 18 to 24 months for hospital services. I could show him letters some of my elderly constituents received in the autumn of 1998 detailing appointments for May 2000. That is the health service we have. That is the reality, not what the Minister said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is going down cul-de-sacs. We are all aware from our clinic work of the severe health crisis. Regardless of whether we speak of &ldquo;waiting lists&rdquo; or &ldquo;waiting times&rdquo;, it is a problem in need of urgent attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, was seen in other Departments as a tough man who talked tough and took tough decisions. He has now become an almost invisible Minister and we are not receiving the response we should at a time of a Celtic tiger economy. No Minister for Health and Children in the history of the State has had the resources the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has to deal with problems. Yet nothing is working, and neither is he.</P>
      <P>As I do not have time to go into detail, I will finish by stating that I support the motion that it is time for the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to examine his position because 40,000 people on waiting lists are suffering as a result of his inaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion. Irrespective of the vote on it tomorrow, when the minority Government party and some Independent Members will probably support the Government, it is clear the Minister has already lost the confidence of the people and he should realise that. One only has to ask anyone on the waiting lists or their families if they have any confidence in him to realise that. There is nothing personal in the motion. The Minister is regarded as a fine person, but he is obviously not fit to continue as Minister for Health and Children. He is good for a sound bite and one of his most celebrated was when he said of the minority party in Government, &ldquo;If in doubt, leave them out&rdquo;. Perhaps those remarks could now be attributed to the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's greatest failure is the manner in which he has stood idly by and watched waiting lists spiral out of control, yet there was no reference to waiting lists in his half hour speech. As regards University College Hospital, Galway, the hospital with which I am familiar, figures I have received from replies to parliamentary questions show that the waiting list is now at crisis level. In June 1997, when the Minister came into office, there were 2,000 people on the waiting list for procedures at the hospital. In September 1998, 15 months later and the latest date for which figures are available, there were 3,500 people on the waiting list, an increase of 1,500 people in 15 <Col N="801" /> months, an average increase of 100 a month. One must assume, although no figures are available, that, five months later, that figure is now 4,000, exactly twice what it was when the Minister and the Government came to power. That alone is an indictment of the Minister. There were 2,000 people on the waiting list in June 1997 and, 15 months later, 1,300 of those have still not received a call-up for treatment. The Minister should deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that today he approved the tender for the cardiac unit at St. James's Hospital. That was sanctioned by the previous Minister more than two years ago, yet the tender documents are only being approved today. This has delayed the progress of the cardiac unit at University College Hospital, Galway, by another three years.</P>
    <P>What investigation has the Minister carried out into the serious accusations made by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, late last year during the crisis in University College Hospital, Galway? He said the hospital was not being run as it should be, that there was bad bed and patient management, that there were fundamental management problems at the hospital and that the new management structures implemented were not working. Perhaps the Minister could reply to that.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. As I only have a few minutes left, perhaps the Galway people would settle their differences at home. The situation in Tallaght Hospital is one about which I am very anxious. The Minister said it had experienced a period of turbulence and uncertainty. Why? Could the Minister not have adopted a more conciliatory stance? The amalgamation of the Adelaide Hospital and two other hospitals was a unique move and was regarded as a step forward. What would some of the nurses &ndash; my mother being one of them &ndash; thank of the manner in which this new body was treated by the Minister? I am not proud of his treatment of it and it does not help in the movement towards peace in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists are an extraordinary problem, and previous speakers said they are worse now than ever, I have been in Dáil Éireann for only six years but, in that time, my clinics have never been as busy with people anxious either about relatives on waiting lists or the treatment they receive in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope some of the funds of which the Minister <Col N="802" /> spoke make their way to the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan; I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle supports me in this. A strong programme has been submitted by the North-Eastern Health Board, with Monaghan General Hospital a main feature because it needs a minimum of £5 million spent on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make an announcement in the next few weeks and give an indication, if this motion does not put him out of office, to the people of Monaghan that the long awaited programme of rejuvenation, including car parking and other necessary structures which will avoid crises in that area, will be provided. I beg the Minister to make that announcement at the earliest possible date so that uncertainty and the unnecessary pain and suffering caused by a lack of commitment and funds will be alleviated. At the time of the Celtic tiger, this Minister has a rare opportunity to curtail waiting lists and do what is necessary for hospitals such as Monaghan General Hospital.</P>

      <P>The important matter I am raising tonight is one which every Member of this House considers to be of huge concern but too often it does not receive the attention it deserves. Today, anyone with an ounce of humanity would have been horrified at the picture which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of a heroin addict whose arms are covered in abscesses because of continuous injecting. It was reported that this man cannot get treatment to help ease his drug habit. We can assume his addiction will accelerate and that his health will suffer more as he waits on the increasing waiting list for drug treatment.</P>
      <P>More horrific was the story of a young mother who sat in her livingroom on a winter evening waiting for the onset of cold turkey. In the morning she would go to the post office and collect her social welfare payment, giving her the means to feed her habit for another day. I am not suggesting we should go back to the methadone protocol which was implemented in an attempt to manage our drug rehabilitation services better. However, in implementing this protocol there have been some problems in the effort to comply with the starting dates. Since doctors stopped prescribing methadone to addicts last October, many have been referred to treatment centres and due to the insufficient number of centres, they have had to join waiting lists. This in turn has pushed many people back into the dark and despairing world of heroin abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about what is happening to people who are making some inroads in tackling their addiction but are now without any treat<Col N="803" /> ment since the implementation of this protocol. What is happening to those who, rightly or wrongly, were obtaining methadone from a secondary source, perhaps from another addict attending a GP?</P>
    <P>Last week in this House the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation gave me assurances that the money allocated to the resourcing of the local drugs task forces would be spent. In spending this money, I would be the first to assert the need to consult with local communities on the establishment of treatment centres. Residents have a right to know the impact a centre would have on their area and it is their right to have an input into how it should be developed. The experience of many communities of treatment centres has been bad. However, some communities have had good experiences and these have come about through direct community input.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government, once community endorsement is given for the establishment of a centre, to undertake that work as a matter of urgency. The drug treatment centre in Cork Street is proving to be a success and is operating in a way which respects the wishes of the local community. However, it has yet to secure the full complement of the services planned for it, including counselling and a crèche facility. The money is there and should be released to complete this work.</P>
    <P>There are communities throughout this country which continue to be devastated by drugs; death through addiction, children left without parents because of addiction and children born already addicted or infected with the HIV virus are realities which must be faced up to. The people in the most deprived areas carry the burden of our drugs problem and we have the resources to deal with this head on. People who want treatment should not have to wait and I hope action will be taken to ensure waiting is unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising this important matter. As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of treatment for drug misusers is a matter for health boards in the first instance. The report of the review group on methadone treatment services, which became available in January 1998, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that strict controls should be introduced on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone.</P>
      <P>The review group comprised representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health and Children. In arriving at its conclusions the group took into account policy statements issued by the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in relation to the prescribing and dispensing of methadone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the review group, only general practitioners with <Col N="804" /> appropriate training would be allowed to prescribe methadone for opiate misusers and, in addition, the numbers attending any individual general practitioner or pharmacist would be strictly controlled. This would ensure that the prospect of large numbers of patients congregating around individual general practitioners' and pharmacists' premises would be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, in whose area the vast majority of opiate misusers reside, has also appointed liaison general practitioners and pharmacists in order to recruit general practitioners and pharmacists into the new scheme to ensure an even spread in each local area where a service is required.</P>
    <P>The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, were introduced to give effect to the recommendations of the review group. The regulations came into effect in two phases. The first phase, from 16 July 1998, introduced a standardised prescription form for methadone, which allowed for monitoring of these prescriptions to ensure that patients were not obtaining physeptone or methadone from more than one source.</P>
    <P>During the period between July and October 1998 when phase 2 of the regulations came into effect, it became clear to the Eastern Health Board that there was a small number of general practitioners who were prescribing methadone to a large number of drug misusers and that, in some instances, patients' details had not been notified to the central methadone treatment list. The challenge faced by the board was, therefore, to find treatment places for a large number of drug misusers in their own locality in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>To its credit, the board managed to find places for a significant number of people through a combination of opening new centres or through the recruitment of additional general practitioners and pharmacists into the protocol. Unfortunately, it was not possible to accommodate all those presenting for treatment and the board is continually attempting to expand its treatment facilities with the aim of being in a position to offer treatment to anybody who needs it.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is aware of the need to offer treatment on a priority basis to particular groups and individuals and has not had any problems with this policy to date. I would suggest, therefore, that if the Deputy is aware of any such priority cases she should contact the health board on their behalf or me and we will do all in our power to assist her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to this matter. Kildare has some of the best designed and constructed roads and road networks in the country. However, I am not seeking extra funding for these roads; I am concerned about the county rural roads which in many cases are in a deplorable state. I recently visited many of these areas following strong rep<Col N="805" /> resentations from local parents, farmers and business owners. The areas in question are Ballyteague, Allenwood, Carbury and Rathangan, and other areas in west County Kildare are affected. Many of the roads in question are adjacent to or travel through the County Kildare boglands.</P>
      <P>In many instances the people involved are being deprived of basic services, such as milk supplies and refuse collections. However, most importantly, many are being deprived of a school bus service. Due to the appalling state of the roads young children are being forced to walk distances to meet the school bus.</P>
      <P>The condition of these roads has been aggravated by the poor weather conditions of recent months and increased traffic. While I understand and recognise that the Minister has increased funding to Kildare County Council for repairs to county roads, it is not compatible with the urgent need to have the roads in these areas brought up to an acceptable standard. In an effort to address this problem there is a need for major reconstruction work to be done, which involves extra funding from the Department, in hand with that of Kildare County Council.</P>
      <P>In Kildare County Council's five-year plan for county roads from 1998-2002, approximately £150,000 was allocated to this particular area for 1999 out of a total of £1.899 million and £92,000 was allocated to the county road schemes. In fairness, this would not make any significant difference to the areas to which I refer. What is needed is for the Department, in agreement with the council, to put in place a financial package to alleviate the major problems currently being endured by the residents and users of these roads.</P>
      <P>On one particular road there are at least 20 requests for planning applications with Kildare County Council. If we are to give these people and their children a chance to reside in a rural environment, it is imperative that an appropriate approach be made to remedy the problems of rural county roads. Rural development depends on such roads and in most of the areas mentioned small farmers, plant holders in the local bogs and residents find it hard to proceed with the simplest tasks.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion in recent times about the housing difficulties and the need for people to settle outside Dublin and the main satellite towns. However, it will be impossible to achieve a more even population density until we put in place proper infrastructures in the most under-populated areas of rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before turning to the specific case of Kildare, I want to say a few words about non-national roads in general. As the Deputy may be aware, <Col N="806" /> the non-national road allocations were recently issued to local authorities. These involved an all-time record provision for non-national roads in 1999 of over £237, which is an increase of over £37 million or nearly 19 per cent on the original 1998 allocation of almost £200 million. In making this provision one of the Government's key commitments was being fulfilled, namely, to ensure additional funding for non-national roads. The other key Government commitment for non-national roads was to finance county road improvements from motor tax receipts and in this regard the local government fund, which is being introduced this year, will provide £235 million for non-national roads with the Exchequer contributing just £7 million. From now on, therefore, motor tax will finance and sustain our regional and county road network, meaning that significant buoyant funds will be available for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The restoration programme, which began in 1995 and aims to restore the entire network of regional and local roads in county areas by 2005, continues to be the cutting edge of the non-national roads effort and the funds available for this programme were increased in 1999 by over £20 million, that is, from £118 million to over £138 million. This will greatly increase the rate of progress being made in the restoration of regional and county roads to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>The 1999 allocations mean that, on average, county councils will receive over £2,400 for every kilometre of non-national road. Furthermore, county councils will receive significantly increased grants for maintenance works in 1999. Maintenance grants under the restoration programme will increase by 36 per cent to £31.7 million while discretionary maintenance grants will increase by almost 32 per cent to £12.8 million. This is further evidence of the Government's determination to deal with the problems of regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, he will be aware that the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their area is, of course, a matter for Kildare County Council, to be funded from its resources supplemented by grants made available by my Department. Kildare County Council has been allocated a total of £8.055 million for 1999, which represents an increase of 16 per cent on the corresponding 1998 payment to the council of £6.94 million.</P>
    <P>The initial selection and prioritisation of projects, to which the various grant categories should be applied, is a matter for Kildare County Council subject to general guidelines issued by my Department. Apart from the 1999 allocation to Kildare County Council for non-national roads, which is intended to provide for the special and ongoing needs of the council, there are no funds from which further non-national road grants could be made available by my Department to county councils. The House will appreciate, however, that the large increase in grants being <Col N="807" /> made available to the council this year should enable further significant improvements to be made in the condition of the non-national road network in the Kildare area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably be aware that approximately 90,000 people are waiting to take their driving tests; the average waiting time is about 40 weeks. This is not just the case in the cities of Dublin, Cork or Galway; it applies all around the country.</P>
      <P>On 17 December I tabled a question to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and was informed that the maximum waiting time was 49 weeks in north Leinster, 45 weeks in south Leinster, 36 weeks in the west, 41 weeks in the north-west, 40 weeks in the south-east and 44 weeks in the south-west. At that time the number on the list was 86,000 but it has since risen to over 90,000.</P>
      <P>On 5 March last the Minister indicated in the Dáil that he had the necessary arrangements in train to deal with the backlog and appoint more testers. At that time he was talking about appointing testers on 12 month contracts. With an increase in car ownership of 16 per cent in June 1998 over the previous year, it is clear that the number of testers, currently standing at between 70 and 75 depending on whether one takes supervisors into account, needs to be increased. Providing temporary testers just to get rid of this backlog will not work. Ironically, the last time we had a backlog like this was when former Deputy Pádraig Flynn was Minister in another Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition. I am not sure whether it is that the backlog builds up when the two parties are together in Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister ought not to reply that he inherited this backlog.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Last March he knew that the backlog was building up. He stated in the Dáil that it was his intention that 95 per cent of driving tests would take place within 15 weeks of application by the end of 1998, and within ten weeks of application by the end of 1999. We are no nearer achieving that, according to the figures to which I referred, unless the Minister immediately hires more full-time testers so that productivity can be increased. Putting the testers to work on a Saturday when each may do two extra tests is like trying to fill a bucket with a hole with water. It will not tackle a backlog of 90,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the Minister's inaction is that people can drive for four years on a provisional licence because all a person need do to get a second provisional licence is make an application for a test and get a date, even it if is 12 months ahead. He or she need not take the test and may <Col N="808" /> drive for another two years without a test. It is not their fault because the system does not allow them to take the test quickly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to appoint additional testers to tackle the backlog and to ensure that these kinds of delays do not build up. Part-time or temporary testers are not the answer because the Minister or his successor will come to the House in a year's time apologising yet again to those who are waiting for their driving test. The Minister need not apologise. He should let the applicants do their tests and drive with full, valid driving licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Owen will listen to all of my reply and not merely to selected parts of it. I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to explain again the reasons for the current delay in the issuing of driving test appointments and the measures we are taking to deal with what is clearly an unsatisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>This problem started in 1996 when greatly increased numbers of driving test applications were being made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In that year applications rose 20 per cent over 1995. This trend has continued and in 1998 there was in increase of 23 per cent over 1997 resulting in an all time record number of applications. Between 1995 and 1998 the level of applications rose by 36 per cent. This cumulative increase in the demand for tests has been exceeding the capacity of the Department's service to provide them and waiting times have consequently lengthened.</P>
      <P>I fully accept this is unsatisfactory. The Department is responding by increasing the number and productivity of its driver testers. Saturday testing has been in place for some time and this has allowed an increase of 12,500 tests per annum. After difficult and protracted negotiations a package of productivity measures was agreed under the PCW with IMPACT, the driver testers' union, last autumn and has now been implemented. An additional 9,000 tests per year will result from this agreement.</P>
      <P>The service is also being augmented by the appointment of new driver testers both on a permanent and contract basis. A competition has been run by the Civil Service Commission to recruit additional testers. Eight new testers joined last November and have been operating a full testing schedule since the beginning of January. Six more testers are currently undergoing training and are to be joined by three more next Monday. This brings the total number of additional testers recruited to 17. These additional testers will mean an increase of 25 per cent in our testing capacity, or 46,800 additional tests per annum. In addition, the Department is currently negotiating with IMPACT on the recruitment of an additional ten contract testers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will lead to an early reduction in the waiting period for tests. In this context I must emphasise that where an <Col N="809" /> individual requires a test for urgent reasons they will be facilitated as far as possible. At present, 30 per cent of applicants are tested within 15 weeks. The national average waiting period for a driving test is now 27 weeks and I am determined to reduce that waiting period to ten weeks.</P>

I trust that this explains the position to the Deputy's satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The delay in appointing extra testers, as I have explained in the House on a number of occasions, was the result of an industrial relations problem which was not of the Government's making and was outside my control.</P>

      <P>Since becoming a Member of this House in 1981, I have annually raised the need to construct Knocklyon post-primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs Owen Mrs Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know as much about Knocklyon school as Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In every general election in which I have been a candidate, Fianna Fáil promised it would build the school. The last occasion on which the promise was made was the general election of June 1997 when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats jointly gave a commitment that the Knocklyon post-primary school would be open by September 1998. The local community schools group, from being an apolitical group which rightly voiced criticisms of different political parties when appropriate, turned into a Fianna Fáil pressure group and dur<Col N="810" /> ing the 1997 election campaign advised voters that if they returned Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to government Knocklyon post-primary school would be open in September 1998. It is now February 1999 and not a sod has been turned nor a foundation stone laid. The Minister who, in 1998, indicated that he hoped the school would be open by September 1999, said in reply to a Dáil question I tabled on 10 February 1999, that he hopes the school will be open for operation by September 2000. The current position, we are told, is that the buildings unit technical staff in the Department of Education and Science is currently examining the stage 2 submission which is the outline sketch for the school. The Minister told us that at this stage of architectural planning it is too early to say when tenders for the project will be invited. It seems that it is also too early to give any commitment to the community in Knocklyon, who so badly need this school, that it will open in the year 2000. I must sadly predict that, yet again, the people of Knocklyon will be shown to have been conned by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in a slick election promise made in June 1997 and that they are now intent on betraying. The promise to build the school and to have it open by September 1998 has not been met. A suggestion that it might open by September 1999 will not be complied with and we are now being told that it is a ministerial aspiration &ndash; not a commitment &ndash; that the school might open in September 2000.</P>
      <P>It is time the Government came clean. I am putting the Minister on notice that, in the local and European Parliament elections to be held in June and in the inevitable general election that will take place this year, the people of Knocklyon will not believe any promise made by any Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrat candidate concerning Knocklyon school. It is vital that the Knocklyon community council and the Knocklyon schools committee reconsider the strategy they have adopted so far, recommence their campaigning for the school, put pressure on this Government and not allow it to be let off the hook by yet again promising a school to which, it appears, it is not committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best that can be said about the Fianna Fáil commitment to the construction of Knocklyon post-primary school is that it can be classified as the single transferable promise. Each time an election is called the promise is transferred into a new election manifesto, a new commitment is given and whoever happens to be leader of Fianna Fáil pledges that he or she will construct the school. Of course, last time around the Progressive Democrats were reeled in to give the same promise. Neither Deputy Harney nor Deputy Ahern has lived up to the promise they made to the people of Knocklyon. I call on the Government to state categorically when this school will be built, when the foundation stone will be laid, when teachers will be recruited, if the school will open for pupils in the year 2000 or if <Col N="811" /> we must look forward to an opening many years hence in the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the Department's proposals for the provision of a new school at Scholarstown Road, Knocklyon.</P>
      <P>The site at Scholarstown Road was purchased in 1982 to provide a post-primary school for Knocklyon. Following a report commissioned by the Department, it was decided by the previous Government not to proceed with the school. Given that the party of which Deputy Shatter was a member was in Government at that time for two and a half years, I cannot understand how that decision was arrived at.</P>
      <P>In March 1988 that decision was reviewed and the Government decided to proceed with the provision of the new school for Knocklyon. The election was long over. Architectural planning of the project has commenced and every effort will be made to ensure the new building is ready for operation by September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school is being planned to accommodate 650 pupils with a total floor area of 4,550 square <Col N="812" /> metres. The accommodation will include 12 general classrooms, lecture rooms, mathematics room, together with a number of specialist rooms, for example, social studies, language laboratory, science laboratories, building construction room, senior metalwork room, technology room, mechanical drawing rooms, art and craft room, home economics room, etc.</P>
    <P>In December, the Department received the stage 2 submission, i.e., the outline sketch scheme from the design team. The documentation was approved by the Department on 5 February 1999 authorising the design team to proceed to stage 3 &ndash; development sketch scheme &ndash; subject to a number of amendments. Given that the project is at an early stage of architectural planning, it is not possible to indicate the exact date of construction. However, the programme of work indicates the date of practical completion as August 2000 and every effort will be made to ensure this is met. This project is receiving a high priority and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government's record as one of investment in education has been positive. Deputy Shatter will not be put under any pressure or duress between now and the next election because the school will be open before then.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 February 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 32 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>I received a copy of the Irish Life report from the department officer assigned to carry out the examination into allegations of churning on 4 February. I immediately published the report on 5 February. The report has also been furnished to the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Enterprise and Small Business and Finance and the Public service for their consideration.</P>
      <P>In brief, the major conclusion of the report was that, although a problem of churning existed within the company, in the period identified, no evidence was found of encouragement at either senior management or board level of the practice.</P>
      <P>On 1 July last, I wrote to insurance representative bodies and all life insurers operating in the State on the question of churning. I have sought assurances that where evidence of sharp practice or abuse of consumer vulnerability existed in individual companies, it will be dealt with immediately and effectively by company management. I have called on the life assurance industry to read the report in detail. I have charged all life assurance companies to review again their procedures for dealing with customer complaints and to examine any possible evidence of misselling or churning including any compensatory measures. The responses from individual companies indicate that the level of sophistication in uncovering and dealing with sales malpractice and misselling varies from company to company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the parliamentary draftsman's office is currently examining our <Col N="814" /> proposals to introduce transparency regulations governing the sale of life assurance products. It is our intention, in the regulations, to ensure that prospective policyholders are not misled or provided with distorted projections particularly on policy investment performance. The creation of all-inclusive and comprehensive disclosure requirements will enable insurance policyholders and those proposing to buy life assurance products to determine all charges incurred, including commission payments and comparable salespersons remuneration. The draft regulations also include such standardised provisions which will make it more difficult for persons to engage in the practice of churning in the future. Insurance undertakings and intermediaries should plan and operate on the basis that the regulations will be operative from 1 September, 1999.</P>
    <P>The costs in terms of departmental staff time amounted to approximately £25,000. Costs of printing and publication amounted to £3,150.</P>

      <P>Funding for training people in employment, whether such training is delivered in the workplace or externally, is available under a number of subheads of my Department's Vote. Exchequer provision under these subheads is supplemented by European Social Fund Support.</P>
      <P>In 1999, £68.2 million will be available for training people in employment, including £29.3 million for apprenticeship training. These figures include the European Social Fund component.</P>

    <P>The total amount available through my Department and its agencies in 1999 for training both those in employment and those who are unemployed is £193.2 million. This figure includes European Social Fund support.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding available for training people who are already in employment, employers also benefit significantly from the resources allocated to training unemployed people.

      <P>I am replying to this question in so far as it relates to the regulation of mortgage intermediaries. I have no statutory responsibility for the regulation of investment intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which came into effect on 13 May 1996, obliges persons engaging in the business of being a mortgage intermediary to hold an authorization for that purpose from the Director of Consumer Affairs, and also to hold a letter of appointment in writing from each undertaking from which they act as intermediary.</P>
      <P>The firm in question did not hold an authorization from the director to engage in the business of being a mortgage intermediary. I understand that it did act as an intermediary for one mortgage provider until June 1996, i.e. shortly after the Consumer Credit Act took effect.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has an agreement with the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association and the Irish Bankers Federation that their members who provide mortgages only deal with intermediaries who hold authorizations from the Director of Consumer Affairs. The office has checked with the individual members of the aforementioned associations, who advise that they have had no dealings with the firm referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumers who request intermediaries, brokers, etc. to arrange mortages or any other financial product on their behalf should satisfy themselves that the particular intermediary they are <Col N="816" /> dealing with holds a current authorization from the relevant authority, i.e. in the case of a mortgage intermediary, an authorization from the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, requires that such authorization is on display in a prominent position in any premises where the holder engages in the business of being a mortgage intermediary and consumers should request to see authorization if they have any doubts whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos 35, 38, 46, 55, 65, 68, 107, and 113 together.</P>
      <P>Following publication in September 1998 of the Deloitte &amp; Touche review of community employment officials of my Department have discussed the recommendations on a number of occasions with the social partners, primarily in the context of Partnership 2000. I will shortly put my proposals for reform of the programme before the social partner pillars, prior to bringing these to Government.</P>
      <P>Since Partnership 2000 was agreed there has been an overall increase in labour market reintegration places for unemployed persons of at least 18,000, including DET and E programmes, back to work allowance and back to education allowance, with over 10,000 of these explicitly reserved for the long-term unemployed and socially excluded.</P>
      <P>There is no contradiction between reducing the number of places on community employment and fulfilling the terms of Paragraph 4.24 of P2000 to provide an additional 10,000 labour market interaction places over the lifetime of the programme. The Government's aim in enhancing the range of active labour market places has been to focus on programmes with the best employability outcomes and to target places at specific disadvantaged cohorts in the labour market, such as very long-term unemployed and lone parents.</P>
      <P>The revised estimate for my Department this year provides for 10,275 new places on active labour market initiatives, including 875 new job initiative places, 1,500 bridging programme places to enable long-term unemployed to enter mainstream training and 5,200 job club places. In 1999 my Department will also provide for an average of 37,700 places on CE.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme is a labour market integration programme. In today's dynamic labour market, it does not make sense generally speaking that a participant should be on community employment for longer than three years. Instead the focus is on helping participants progress to an open labour market job if they are job ready or to mainstream training which will help them become job ready. FÁS is providing increased levels of support and advice on progression to all participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche review of community employment recommends that the minimum age <Col N="818" /> for participants should be raised from 21 years to 25 years of age because employment prospects are much better for participants in mainstream training than for participants in CE and the full-time nature of training more closely mirrors the workplace than the part-time nature of CE. We have made substantial provision for such a shift in emphasis for young persons through ring-fencing 7,500 training places and developing a bridging programme with 1,000 places from which young persons can progress to mainstream training.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group was established, under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Collins, SC, by my predecessor with the following terms of reference; to review and made recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of legislative consolidation; the effectiveness fo competition policy and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the Competition Act, 1991, and, in particular, section 4 of that Act, and appropriate structures for implementation of the above legislation.</P>
      <P>I informed the House on 6 November 1997 that I had asked the group, in the context of their review of mergers and competition legislation, to take account of and advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the commission on the newspaper industry, relating specifically to the regulation of ownership, merger control and concentration of media ownership.</P>
      <P>The group has already published its discussion document on mergers in July 1998. I understand that its newspaper discussion document is currently being finalised and the chairman expects to publish it shortly for comment from the public and interested parties. When these comments have been received, the chairman intends to incorporate the group's recommendations in the overall report and recommendations which will be presented to me.</P>
      <P>The work of the group is complex and wide-ranging but it is making steady progress. I understand from the chairman that he now intends submitting the group's overall report to me later this year.</P>

      <P>The Commission proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community was published in November of last year and as yet it has not been placed on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council. It is at the discretion of the Presidency to set the agenda for discussions by the Council.</P>
      <P>In Ireland a wide range of statutory provisions for information and consultation is already in place, which addresses areas of vital interest to employees. These provisions include: the Protection of Employment Act, 1997, as amended by the Protection of Employment Order, 1996; covering collective redundancies; European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980; certain provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989; Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act, 1996; which applies to large-scale multinationals; and particular terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 includes commitments by the social partners and the Government to the development of partnership at the enterprise level. These include the advancement of information and consultation in the workplace. Indeed I would say that many Irish based enterprises are developing employee information and consultation as part of a competitive strategy, which recognises the role and value of employees in business development.</P>
      <P>One has to question the need for such a directive at this time. However, the social partners will be consulted and the text of the directive is currently being examined in preparation for the beginning of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>County Cavan and the Border region generally is a priority location for IDA Ireland and the agency has introduced a number of significant measures to encourage new investment to this area, including the following: making available, as appropriate, increased grant levels for potential investors in Border locations; stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations, with the involvement of the private sector; working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment; and working closely with FÁS and local institutes of technology to identify specific skills which are available in the region.</P>
      <P>Specifically, a 23,000 sq. ft advance factory was constructed in Cavan town by private developers. This facility is being actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential overseas investors. Eight site visits by potential investors took place in 1998 as well as three visits by IDA Ireland overseas and head office staff to the area; three site visits by potential clients have already taken place this year.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is encouraged by the positive responses it has received from the companies who have visited the area and IDA Ireland will continue to vigorously promote the area until an overseas investor is secured for the advance factory.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the day to day enforcement of workplace health and safety legislation. A total of 26 fatalities and 39 non-fatal accidents in the agricultural sector were reported to the Authority for 1998.</P>
      <P>I express  my personal disappointment, and that of the Authority, at the increased level of farm fatalities and accidents in 1998. It is a source of particular concern to see that six of the fatalities in 1998 were children under the age of 12.</P>
      <P>Agriculture has always been treated as a priority area of activity by the Authority which carries out a high number of inspections every year in the sector, gives talks to farm groups countrywide and makes its staff available to farmers through attendance at farm shows and exhibitions including the National Ploughing Championship. In addition, the Authority provides an extensive range of guidance literature and information on the control of farm hazards. The Authority, through its Farm Safety Task Force, the members of which are drawn from the farming community, works closely with the farming representative bodies and organisations such as Teagasc, the Co-Op movement, the farm relief service and also the insurance industry in order to highlight the hazards associated with farming, the risks to family and workers and the measures required to control such hazards.</P>
      <P>It is my firm belief that, as with all sectors of employment, prevention is the key to addressing the problem of accidents and fatalities. Farmers themselves can play a primary role in reducing the number of farm accidents. The 1998 farm fatality figures are a harsh reminder of the constant need for vigilance. Farmers must acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation, that accidents can happen on their own farm and that an investment in safety measures will reap its own rewards. In this context, I would strongly urge all farmers who have not done so to draw up a safety statement and where such statements exist to  keep them under regular review. I would also appeal to all farmers and farm workers to treat their work as the high-risk activity that it actually is, and to exercise constant care in their work practices, especially where there are children on the farm.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the Authority will continue its general inspection programme with 1,000 inspections planned in farming and forestry operations. In addition, the promotion of child safety in farming will be a priority for the Authority who will work closely with farming organisations, education authorities and the Garda Community Liaison Service on the issue. Particular emphasis will also be placed by the Authority on encouraging famers to carry out appropriate risk assessments and to draw up safety statements.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I have given to a priority question on this topic. The State, through NET, has a 51 per cent shareholding in Irish Fertilizer Industries, with the remaining 49 per cent owned by ICI. During 1998, both shareholders agred to seek a joint sale of 100 per cent of IFI. Since then, discussions have been ongoing between my Department, the Department of Finance, IBI Corporate Finance, who are advising and assisting the State in relation to the proposed sale, and ICI executives.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent months and IBI Corporate Finance has, in the past week, approached potential interested parties to ascertain the likely level of interest in acquiring IFI. Subject to agreement between the shareholders that this initial round of contacts demonstrates that there is sufficient interest in the market to justify proceeding at present, an information memorandum will be issued in the coming weeks to those parties who have expressed an interest and have signed a confidentiality agreement.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficult conditions currently existing in the fertilizer industry, I am anxious to test the market at this stage, with a view to securing a purchaser with a commitment to IFI as a fertilizer manufacturer, and seeking safeguards regarding IFI operations and levels of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 42, 100, 126 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>The question of securing reduced rates of employers and public liability insurance cover for small business has been dealt with in a number of recent replies to Dáil questions, the most recent being the reply which I gave to the House on 19 November 1998. The broader economic issue of the effect of liability insurance premium costs on industrial investment in Ireland cannot be assessed in isolation from the totality of costs born by manufacturing enterprises located in Ireland and the trends in these costs relative to costs in competing economies.</P>
      <P>In its 1996 report on An Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland, Deloitte &amp; Touche set out comparative quotations for employers and public liability insurance obtained from insurers in a number of EU countries. The quotations showed that premium rates in the other EU countries surveyed were considerably lower than in Ireland, with the Netherlands rate at 14 per cent, Denmark at 46 per cent and France at 90 per cent of the Irish quotation. However, the consultants pointed out that higher levels of State expenditure on social protection in the Netherlands and Denmark compared with Ireland meant that private insurance in these other EU countries was required to bear less of the cost of personal injury compensation and their liability insurance premiums would be correspondingly lower than in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche also undertook a survey of small and medium enterprises in manufacturing and services in Ireland to establish the cost impact of employers and public liability insurance. The survey found that, while in the larger employing firms insurance premiums amounted to 1.4 per cent of payroll costs, in very small firms with less than ten persons employed, insurance liability costs amounted to over 8 per cent of payroll. This indicated that the cost competitiveness impact of liability insurance in Ireland was essentially a problem affecting small business and did not constitute a significant cost competitiveness burden on larger firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants investigated the reasons for <Col N="824" /> the wide discrepancy between the premium costs borne by larger and smaller firms in Ireland and found that insurance companies perceived small firms, in general, as representing a high insurance risk category lacking in sophisticated risk management systems. This assessment was reflected in the high liability insurance rates quoted to individual small companies.</P>
    <P>To address this insurance cost problem for small companies and its contributory causes, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended that small businesses should join affinity groups to strengthen their collective bargaining power with insurers and that they should seek to improve their risk management procedures through greater awareness of and compliance with health and safety standards. A number of special affinity schemes have already been successfully established by, among others, the Small Firms Association of IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation and by publican, restaurateur and farmer groups. A new affinity scheme for the services and self-employed sector of ISME was launched in 1997. I understand these schemes have been successful in securing lower rates of liability insurance for the participating small companies.</P>
    <P>In addition to affinity schemes for purchasing insurance cover, I recently launched a voluntary code of practice aimed at reducing the cost burden, including insurance costs, of injuries in the workplace which has been developed by a Workplace Safety Group representative of, amongst others, IBEC, ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority and the insurance devision of our Department. The object of the Safe Working and Accident Prevention Code is to seek to ensure that injuries, where they occur in the workplace, are dealt with in the best way possible by management and that the employee is given every assistance and encouragement to return to work.</P>
    <P>Voluntary participation in the code of practice commits the employers to make safety an integral part of their business operations and make accident prevention a top priority; develop a safety culture through a partnership approach and with employee involvement; consult with employees and safety representatives on health and safety arrangements; provide, either through internal or external advice, requisite competence and appropriate health and safety training for all levels of employees, both on the job training and general health and safety training. Where appropriate, have information on hazardous substances, including material safety data sheet; and provide a safety statement and ensure implementation through communication with all staff.</P>
    <P>For their part the participating employees undertake to exercise care for their safety and that of others through their actions and safe work practices; participate in safety measures, including safety training; use their  initiative and take a responsible approach to accident prevention in their workplace; support the safety policy and familiarise themselves with the company safety statement and the arrangements, information and <Col N="825" /> procedures therein; and co-operate with safety arrangements. The common objective for employer and employee is to address health and safety matters in a non-adversarial climate of consultation and partnership.</P>
    <P>As the representative association for employers liability insurers in Ireland, the Irish Insurance Federation has indicated its full support for the voluntary code of practice. It particularly supports the co-operative approach proposed which recognises the shared responsibilities of employers and employees. The adoption of the code of practice is seen by the Irish Insurance Federation as a very positive step in building a safety culture in the workplace and it envisages that compliance with the provisions of the code on accident prevention, accident investigation and treatment of occupational injuries will help to reduce the frequency of accidents in the workplace. This, in turn, will help to control the costs, including insurance costs, associated with accidents at work with resulting benefits to employers in the calculation of liability premium rates.</P>
    <P>I regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses and the development of a voluntary code of practice in safe working and accident prevention as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, through a social partnership approach, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in the workplace and the related cost of liability insurance cover.</P>
    <P>With regard to the trend in liability insurance claims, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that, over the ten year period, 1985-1994, the annual number of claims remained fairly constant &ndash; employers' liability claims averaged 8,451 per annum with a high of 9,506 in 1990 and a low of 7,695 in 1993; public liability claims averaged 15,500 over that ten year period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the trend in the cost of claims, the consultants report found that the average cost of employers' liability claims rose by about 50 per cent in real terms over the ten year period to 1994 while the average cost of public liability claims almost doubled.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants undertook a detailed examination of the factors contributing to the high and rising cost of liability claims in Ireland. The  report found that the two major factors driving up the cost of claims were high legal costs relative to personal injury compensation awards, particularly in smaller claims, and medical inflation. The high legal costs, including the cost of expert witnesses, associated with establishing claims for personal injury compensation in Ireland is attributable to the adversarial and highly legalistic nature of the tort-based claims process which requires the litigant to establish that his injury resulted from the defendant's negligence. The submission to Government of the Deloitte &amp; Touche findings on the major factors contributing to high liability insurance costs in Ireland led to the establishment of a Special Working Group under the aegis of our <Col N="826" /> Department. The working group is currently engaged on a research-based examination of cost and other issues surrounding alternative systems of delivering personal injury compensation in operation in other countires. The group hopes to complete its report by the end of June, next.</P>

      <P>As part of the ongoing monitoring of European Social (ESF) assistance during the current Structural Funding period 1994-1999, the Community Support Framework (CSF) provided for the establishment of a Human Resources Co-ordinating Committee. The committee is chaired by my Department which is the national authority for the ESF in Ireland and its members are drawn from the various Government Departments and Agencies which implement ESF funded programmes or measures, the European Commission and the social partners.</P>
      <P>The committee meets twice a year, in spring and autumn. Its role is to consider horizontal human resources topics across the various operational programmes in the CSF with a view to developing a coherent approach to key issues. In March 1998, the central theme of the meeting was ESF and the long-term unemployed. The committee last met on the 25 September, 1998. The theme of that meeting was human resources needs post 1999 &ndash; that is, into the next round of Structural Funding.</P>
      <P>The co-ordinating committee, while having no formal decision-taking role, reports directly to the CSF monitoring committee which oversees the Community Support Framework as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 3 November 1998, Official Report, Vol. 495, Col. 1524, I indicated that the report of the authorised officer into the sale by National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited of certain insurance products had been passed to the DPP and Revenue Commissioners. While I have no information as to the DPP's intentions in the matter, the Commissioners have sought further documentation and information from the authorised officer who is continuing to deal with their queries as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request, the High Court appointed Messrs. John Blayney and Tom Grace as Inspec<Col N="828" /> tors on 30 March 1998 to investigate the affairs of National Irish Bank Limited and that inspectors' remit was extended on 15 June 1998 to cover its subsidiary, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited. I expect that the cost and value of the alleged overcharging by National Irish Bank Limited of its customers will be dealt with in the inspector's final report. The work of both inspectors is being supported by an average of about seven full-time staff from PricewaterhouseCoopers, excluding outside expertise such as legal advisers.</P>
    <P>A legal challenge to the inspector's work by certain National Irish Bank managers was only resolved in the Supreme Court on 21 January last. The inspectors are answerable to the court for the performance of their duties, and while they have filed a number of interim reports with the High Court since their appointment, I understand it will be some time yet before the inspectors will be ready to submit their final report. The High Court will decide in due course whether and to what extent this report should be published.</P>
    <P>I have recently been advised that National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Finanical Services Limited plan to commence High Court proceedings for the purpose, <i>inter alia</i>, of excluding from the remit of the inspectors any matters which are being investigated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, pursuant to the Comptroller and Auditor General and Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Special Provisions) Act, 1998, and the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 17 December 1998. It is my view that any decision by the High Court to accede to this request will seriously damage the prospects of the inspectors completing their work in an expeditious and comprehensive manner. Accordingly, I have indicated to the bank that I will be opposing in court its attempt to discharge the inspectors from any element of their court-ordered mandate. A hearing of the bank's application will take place shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has approved a package of measures under both company law and taxation law which it considers has the necessary elements to tackle the problems created by certain Irish registered non-resident companies in a comprehensive and focused manner. These measures were announced by the Minister for Finance on <Col N="829" /> Thursday, 11 February last, on the occasion of the publication of the Finance Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>The company law measures, which will be included in a companies amendment Bill to be published shortly, will provide that as a precondition of incorporation, every application for registration will be required to demonstrate that the proposed company intends to carry on an activity in the State. This provision is designed to prevent the use of Irish registered companies for exclusively foreign activities without any connection with the State; every company will be required to either have an Irish resident director or provide a bond to the value of £20,000 as surety in the event of the company failing to comply with certain company law and tax requirements. This will apply to new companies, as a pre-requisite to incorporation, and to existing companies after a transitional period. However, it will be provided that companies can be subsequently exempted from these requirements by the Registrar of Companies following consultation with the Revenue Commissioners; the number of directorships that any one person can hold will be limited to 25 subject to certain exemptions. The aim of this provision is to curb the issue of nominee directors as a means of disguising beneficial ownership or control; and enhanced strike-off provisions will be introduced where companies fail to make the statutory annual return to the Companies Registration Office (CRO) or fail to register with the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes. There will be enhanced notification to the CRO where directors have resigned, including strike-off provisions where a company appears to have no director. This provision will ensure more up to date information in the CRO in relation to directors.</P>
      <P>On the tax side, the Finance Bill will make registration in the State equate with tax residence for all companies except where the company, or a related company, is carrying on a trade in the State and either the company is ultimately controlled by residents of an EU member state or a tax treaty country, or the company or the related company is quoted on a recognised stock exchange. This will apply to new companies incorporated on or after the date of publication of the Bill and for existing companies from 1 October 1999. For those companies referred to in the exception above, tax residence will continue to be based on where the company is managed and controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill also provides for consequential changes in the requirements for companies to furnish information on their affairs to the Revenue Commissioners. For example, a company which is incorporated but not tax resident in the State will be required to identify the territory in which it is resident and to state whether the company or a related company is trading in the State or, if not, to identify the ultimate beneficial owners of the company. The Bill also enables the Revenue Commissioners to give the Registrar of Companies details of those companies which fail <Col N="830" /> to comply with the new revenue information requirements so as to enable such companies to be struck-off the company registrar, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>Further provisions will be introduced at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill which will complement the provisions to be introduced under the Companies Amendment Bill in relation to the requirement to appoint an Irish resident director or provide a bond to the value of £20,000. The Committee State  amendment will provide that, where a company fails to pay any penalties for failure to supply information or to file the company's tax return, these penalties may be recovered from the secretary of the company. If the secretary is not resident in the State, the penalties may be recovered from an Irish resident director of the company. Where a company does  not have an Irish resident company secretary or director, any such penalties will be recoverable from the £20,000 bond referred to above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of implementation of the employment action plan, aimed at unemployed young persons, under 25, reaching the six months unemployment threshold, commenced with effect from 1 September 1998. To date, I have published two detailed monthly reports on the initial outcomes of the measures put in place to assist young persons in their return to work or in the provision of employability supports. Copies of these reports are available in the Dáil Library. I <Col N="831" /> have asked officials in my Department to forward a copy of the first two reports to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The results from these reports show very clear evidence that the employment action plan approach is working. A total of 3,969 persons were referred during the months of September of December 1998 by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for a FÁS vocational and guidance interview, of whom, by end-January 1999, 56 per cent had been interviewed, 39 per cent did not attend for interview with the remainder being active in the local employment service or pending interview. Overall, taking interviewees and non-attendees together, 47 per cent of those referred were known to have left the live register by end-January, and almost 70 per cent of these had left for positive reasons, to enter employment, 43 per cent, a FÁS programme, 18 per cent, or back to education, 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Given the very positive outcomes, the Government has decided to extend the plan on a phased basis. From next month we will be extending it further to young persons who are 18 months unemployed. From May, we will be extending it to adult unemployed  in the age category 25 to 34 as they cross 12 months on the live register. I am satisfied that the staff resources and the programme capacity to respond to the demands arising from the action plan process are adequate but I will be keeping the matter under review as the process is rolled out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 September 1998, I set up the Donegal employment initiative to assess and recommend the most appropriate responses to offset and compensate for the expected job losses in particular areas of Donegal, and draw up a set of priority actions for establishing Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creation <Col N="832" /> investment. The task force is chaired by the Donegal County Manager and includes representatives from the business community, relevant State agencies and Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In line with its terms of reference, the task force is currently working with IDA Ireland in identifying international companies which would be best suited to a Donegal location, and the incentives and services which would be required to attract them to Donegal. In the past six months, IDA Ireland has brought 11 companies on first time site visits to County Donegal and a number of these companies have returned for a second visit. Currently, out of these 11 site visits, there are a number of companies involved in ongoing detailed discussions with IDA Ireland in relation to potential new investments. I am is hopeful that there will be a successful outcome to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition, the development of a new 27 acre business park in Letterkenny is progressing well, with the completed new advance factory attracting significant interest. Planning application has been lodged for a second 25,000 sq.ft. advance factory. Arrangements have also been finalised for the construction of a new quality office building at Windyhill in Letterkenny. These developments, together with the quality buildings available from Fruit of the Loom at Milford, Raphoe and Malin, all provide a good promotional base from which to actively market the Donegal region.</P>
    <P>The Donegal employment initiative is also working with Enterprise Ireland in attacting indigenous enterprises to the region, particularly in the fishing, food and tourism sectors. Enterprise Ireland has approved financial support of almost £2 million which will result in the creation of a total of 74 new jobs in 1999 by three companies located in Letterkenny and Killygordan.</P>
    <P>In relation to training, FÁS and CERT, in co-operation with the Donegal employment initiative, have drawn up a joint programme for retraining workers who are to be made redundant at Fruit of the Loom and the Austin Reed subsidiary, Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
    <P>On 11 January, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recration announced details of a £0.5 million CERT initiative involving a range of training programmes to help the workers who will be made redundant at Fruit of the Loom and Donegal Shirt Company to find new jobs in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>As a first step in the retraining programme, FÁS is running a series of interview sessions in the various Fruit of the Loom plants to provide personal employment guidance counselling for each workers and to register them with FÁS with a view to future job opportunities. These interview sessions commenced on 8 February and will be completed by the end of the month. Following on from this, FÁS will produce a workforce analysis which will provide a profile of the workers and the type of training they require. A <Col N="833" /> workforce analysis has already been completed in respect of the workers in the Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
    <P>The Donegal employment initiative, through FÁS and CERT, will then co-ordinate a wide range of education and training programmes, including the provision of training courses in each community area subject to the level of demand. In order to ensure that the combined FÁS and CERT training programme is utilised to the maximum, FÁS also plans to invite the workers who left the Buncrana Fruit of the Loom plant over the past 12 months to attend specially arranged interview sessions.</P>
    <P>The timing of the various training programmes will have to take into account that, due to receipt of a large order, Fruit of the Loom has announced that the planned redundancies have been postponed for three months and will not now take place before the end of April.</P>
    <P>In addition to the training programmes being provided by FÁS and CERT, the Irish Trade Union Trust is also planning to deliver their services to the workers at the various plants, which would include essentials such as the preparation of CVs,</P>
    <P>I would thank the management at Fruit of the Loom and Donegal Shirt Company for their co-operation with the Donegal employment initiative in the delivery of briefing and interview sessions to their workers.</P>

      <Col N="834" /> The control of military items is governed by the Control of Exports Act, 1983, and the list of military items covered is set out in the Control of Exports Order, 1996. Apart from applications to export shotguns, all military licences applications submitted to the Department must be accompanied by an end-use certificate. When examining these export licence applications, the Department takes account of several factors such as the description of the goods, end-use and the end-user of the goods, the reputation of the exporter, information made available arising from Ireland's participation in EU and other international export control regimes and obligations arising under sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council or agreed in other international fora. The advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs is also sought.</P>
    <P>In regard to the export of shotguns, my Department has drafted an Order, the objective of which is to have them removed from the Control of Exports Order, 1996, in respect of intra-community transfers and to reduce the level of control for exports to third countries. This has been agreed with the Deaprtment of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as it is considered that adequate control on the export of shotguns is already provided for by that Department and the Garda Síochána. When this is introduced, it should dramatically reduce the number of military licences granted by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy and procedures in relation to the export of military goods are publicly available via, <i>inter alia,</i>&ldquo;Export Controls Made Easy&rdquo; booklet, published by my Department; my Department's Freedom of Information Guide; the Export Licensing Unit's website (http://www.irlgov.ie/entemp/export). The website includes statistics on licences issued and answers to frequently asked questions on policy issues; and the Adjournment debate concerning the granting of military licences of 3 December 1996.</P>

      <P>The level of unemployment and of long-term unemployment continues to fall. The Quarterly National Household Survey for March-May 1998 shows an unemployment rate of 7.8 per cent and a long-term unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent. This trend is also reflected in the live register, where the January 1999 figures stand at 209,500, seasonally adjusted, the lowest level for 16 years. People who have been long-term unemployed have been accessing a reasonable share of jobs despite competition from first-time entrants to the labour <Col N="835" /> market, those returning to work, and returning emigrants.</P>
      <P>This increasingly positive scenario does not imply any complacency on the part of the Government. We recognise that unemployment continues to have a particularly high concentration in some communities and must be tackled. The strategy for full employment has three elements: the maintenance of favourable conditions such as moderate wage growth, low inflation, low interest rates; refocusing active labour market measures on programmes with the best employability outcomes; and a tax regime which encourages participation by the long-term unemployed and socially excluded to take or make a job.</P>
      <P>With effect from this year I have extended the Local Employment Service to an additional seven areas, mostly urban, bringing the total number of areas with an LES to 25. The particular focus of the LES is on persons furthest removed from the labour market. In the course of this year I also want to see better synergy developed between the national employment service operated by FÁS and the LES network, in the intersets of the users of the services. Finally, it is also of interest that in the context of the European Employment Guidelines we are moving towards a preventative strategy on long-term unemployment to complement our existing reintegration strategy. With effect from May 1999 the systematic activation strategy is being implemented for persons aged 25-34 who are 12 months unemployed with a view to offering them job guidance or a quality training or education place. This process of systematic engagement will be extended to older persons on a phased basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, came into operation on 2 January 1997. The Act is designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school years does not put a young person's education at risk. The Act sets limits for the employment of &ldquo;children&rdquo; i.e. persons under the age of 16 and &ldquo;young persons&rdquo; i.e. 16 and 17 year olds. It also sets rest intervals and maximum working hours, and prohibits the employment of under 18s on late night work. Employers who employ young people under 18 years of age must  keep specified records of such workers, must display a summary of the Act and must also give a summary of the Act to the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breaches of the Act come to the attention of my Department either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate. In 1998, a total of 872 inspections were carried out under the young persons legislation. These inspections revealed non-compliance in 44 instances. The Employment Rights Section of my Department <Col N="837" /> follow up the employers concerned regarding the breaches found and further inspections are arrranged on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the Act.</P>
    <P>No inspections under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act have been conducted at times later than 10 p.m. In the normal course, inspectors conduct their enforcement work during regular office  hours. In the course of these inspections, the inspectors check the records of employers to establish their compliance with the requirements of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act. Proceedings for breach of the provisions of the Act may be taken by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or by the employee's parent, guardian or trade union, within 12 months of the alleged breach. The parent or guardian of a child or young person may also refer certain breaches of the Act to the Rights Commissioner.</P>
    <P>At my initiative, a Monitoring Group &ndash; comprised of representatives of IBEC, ICTU, the National Youth Council, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Department was &ndash; established in 1997 to appraise the effectiveness of the legislation and to monitor its enforcement. The terms of reference of the group which meets from time to time are to review the operation of the Act and to advise on how the Act might be better implemented. Following a suggestion by the group that the provisions of the legislation be better publicised, my officials, as a specific initiative, recently contacted publicans in the Dublin area to remind them of their responsibilities as regards the employment of young people.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the recent reports in the media regarding school going students working beyond the permitted hours and I would urge parents and teachers who are aware of any breaches of the legislation to contact the employment rights section of my Department. I should point out, however, that while there is a legal obligation on employers to see that the legislation in this area is upheld, there is also a responsibility on the parents of young people to ensure that the law is respected.</P>

      <P>I have always believed that privatisation had a role to play in improving the efficiency of the Irish economy. That does not mean that every State-owned entity should be privatised. A pragmatic approach is required and that is the approach which is being taken by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> Work is progressing elsewhere on the sale of Telecom Éireann, ICC Bank, ACC Bank and TSB Bank. The situation of other State companies is being examined on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>All privatisations will be managed in a spirit of partnerhsip, with the possibility, in appropriate circumstances, of significant shareholdings being made available to the employees on attractive terms.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the primary role of the State should, as far as possible, be that of regulator, not operator. It makes no sense for the State to try to regulate a highly competitive telecoms market, for instance, while itself owning the biggest player in that market.</P>
    <P>When my own party first advocated privatisation in this country back in the mid-1980s we were heavily criticised. Since then, privatisation has become the norm right around the world. It is a pity that Ireland has fallen so far behind our competitors in the process of privatisation and deregulation but I am confident that most of the ground lost will be made up under the current administration.</P>
    <P>As for the only State enterprise within the remit of my Department, namely Irish Fertilizer Industries, I would refer the Deputy  to the reply I have provided to a priority question on this matter. </P>

      <P>Data on the apprenticeship system is collected by FÁS, which has operational responsibility for the system. The most comprehensive data available refers to year end 1998. As at 31 December 1998 the apprentice population, including both the new standards based apprenticeship and the outgoing time served apprenticeship was 16,923. Of these, 16,811 were male and 112 were female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 25 designated trades in the new standards based apprenticeship system and 27 designated trades in the old time served system. I am supplying the Deputy with a detailed <Col N="839" /> list of the numbers in each trade, broken down by gender, as at 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>As part of the development of the standards based apprenticeship system, structures have been put in place to allow for the designation of new trades. Decisions on individual trades are taken by FÁS, on the advice of the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, which comprises representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and the social partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is the Government agency responsible for the promotion and attraction of foreign investment into Ireland and it monitors the level of overseas investment and reports to my Department and to the Government on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>A total of nearly 16,000 new jobs were created by IDA backed companies during 1998. This is the highest ever job creation outcome in one year and means that overseas companies have more than doubled their annual rate of job creation in the past ten years. The 1998 experience continues the positive trend of recent years.</P>
      <P>A total of 128 investment projects from overseas companies were negotiated during 1998, 66 of these were new, greenfield projects while the remaining 62 projects came as expansions of overseas companies already established here. In addition, 115 projects were secured for Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). This is well in line with the ambitious and expansionary targets set for the year and will contribute strongly to new job creation over the next three years or so.</P>
      <P>Overall, net growth in total employment in IDA backed companies, at 8,785 jobs, shows an 8.2 per cent increase, with 115,846 people now employed in 1,137 companies.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of industrial investment from overseas companies shows the best performing sectors continue to be the electronics/engineering companies, which created over 7,000 of the new jobs and the rapidly growing international services  sector where companies in software, telemarketing, financial and shared services created over 6,500 of the new jobs, a 50 per cent increase in job creation levels in one year.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is optimistic that it will continue to secure a good level of job creation from overseas companies by targeting inward investment opportunities across a range of key segments of industry. As foreign direct investment markets change, IDA Ireland will, of course, adjust its strategies and focus accordingly.</P>

      <P>The board of the Health and Safety Authority consists of a chairman and ten ordinary members. Three of these members are nominated by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation to represent employer interests and three are nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to represent employee interests. The chairman and the remaining four ordinary members are nominated by the Minister with responsibility for occupational health and safety. Members of the board are appointed for a three year period and the term of office of the last board of the Authority expired on the 10 December.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that in the context of appointing a new board of the Authority, a number of changes were made. As Minister I must take full account of the large remit of areas for which the Health and Safety Authority now has responsibility and I must also give due consideration that all the board appointees should represent as broad a range of interests as possible.</P>
      <P>Prior to the expiration of the term of office of the previous board I received a number of letters and representations from various people and groups requesting that they themselves be appointed to the new board or requesting that consideration be given to the appointment of named individuals. I wish to state categorically that I was not lobbied by any organisation, nor did I receive any representations, to the effect that any individual should not be reappointed to the board.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that both I and the Authority will continue to afford priority attention to safety in the construction sector.</P>

      <P>In December 1998, following detailed negotiations, IDA Ireland and Fruit of the Loom reached agreement as follows: Fruit of the Loom will maintain a minimum of 1,300 jobs through 1999 and 600 jobs through until the end of 2005, and Fruit of the Loom will repay to IDA Ireland £7 million by way of £5 million in the first quarter of 1999 and £2 million from the sale of the factories at Milford, Malin and Raphoe.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs I have been delegated responsibility for matters arising in the context of the EU Labour and Social Affairs Council and related issues. During the past 12 months I have represented Ireland at five meetings of EU Ministers responsible for this policy area. The dates in question were 13-14 March 1998, 3-4 June 1998, 8-10 July 1998, 20 November 1998 and 4-6 February 1999.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner for Social Affairs would have been present at these meetings in his official capacity. However, while I met with the Commissioner in the environs of the meetings in question, I did not have any direct bi-lateral meetings with him on any of these occasions or on any other occasion in the past 12 months. I have no immediate plans at this stage for future meetings with the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I should add that the Tánaiste, to whom the question was addressed in the first instance, does not attend meetings of the Labour and Social Affairs Council. However, I can tell the Deputy that the Tánaiste, accompanied by officials, did in fact have one formal meeting with the Social Affairs Commissioner in the past 12 months. The meeting in question took place in Brussels on 23 April 1998.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 6,978 guarantee companies on the companies register at present. Many companies, including guarantee companies, do not operate to the highest standards of statutory compliance. The number of guarantee companies who have filed an up to date annual return in the last 12 months or who are not yet due to file a return, is about 1,630. This represents a compliance rate of 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>A determined effort is being made to improve statutory compliance rates. Following the installation of a new computer system in the Companies Registration Office, the Registrar of Companies has commenced a process of striking thousands of  non-compliant companies off the register. This exercise, which commenced in September 1998, will see a dramatic improvement in compliance by all forms of company by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Apple Computers Limited, as a company which had failed to make annual returns for two years, was randomly selected in September 1998 and formally notified by the Companies Registration Office that a failure to remedy its default would result in its being struck off the Register of Companies. It was removed from the strike-off list following the submission of the company's 1996 annual returns.</P>

      <P>There are separate community initiative monitoring committees for each of the ten EU Community Initiatives currently being implemented in Ireland. Lead responsibility for these lies with various Government Departments. My Department leads on four such initiatives &ndash; Employment, Adapt, SME's and RETEX and supports three monitoring committees. By agreement with the European Commission, a single committee monitors both Employment and Adapt.</P>
      <P>These committees were established in 1994 and are responsible for all major decisions to do with the implementation of the relevant initiatives.</P>
      <P>Those for which my Department is responsible in its area of responsibility have worked and are continuing to work quite well. Just as the mainstream or CSF operational programmes were subjected to independent critical mid-term reviews of their stewardship in 1996-97, the various Community initiatives were individually vetted at that time. In the case of those run by my Department, the broad picture reflected was on of solid progress in implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 83, 84, 86 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The progress made in relation to the Government's commitment in our programme for Government to introduce a national minimum hourly wage has been considerable. One of my first tasks as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was to establish the National Minimum Wage Commission to advise on the best way to implement our commitment to a national minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The commission produced, in a very short time, a comprehensive report which published in April 1998. It recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that a target date of 1 April 2000 be set to implement the commitment to a national minimum hourly wage. The commission's report has been the foundation upon which further progress on the introductionof a national minimum wage has been achieved.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on the 31 March 1998 the Government considered the report of the commission and approved the establishment of an interdepartmental group of officials to assist in formulating proposals and a plan of action on implementation.</P>
      <P>The group has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake a comprehensive study of the likely impact on those sectors of the economy most affected by a national minimum wage and on the economy as a whole. The information obtained will allow the group to assess the recommendation of the commission, that the initial rate set should take into account employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness. The ESRI is expected to complete its final report in March.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group submitted an interim report and this was published in November 1998. The interim report outlines a range of complex issues addressed by the group which require further analysis and consideration including the scope of the national minimum wage, variations, options for enforcement and the need to ensure that claims for the restoration of relative pay differentials, following its introduction, are not entertained. The work of this group is building on the very valuable work of the National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>
      <P>The interim report identified a number of issues that should be the subject of consultations with the social partners. The interdepartmental group also invited written submissions on its interim report from interested parties and these submissions are being considered by the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department are currently engaged in consultations with the social partners and have commenced drafting the heads of the Bill. It is expected to publish the National Minimum Wage Bill as soon as possible after receipt of the final report of the interdepartmental group in May. Consultations with the Social partners will continue to be an integral part of the process <Col N="846" /> of bringing forward the legislation to implement a national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>As to the impact of a national minimum wage on employment, this ultimately depends on the minimum wage structure adopted and the rates applied within that structure. Both the National Minimum Wage Commission and the interdepartmental group have addressed this important issue. The results of the study undertaken by the ESRI for the interdepartmental group will provide significant information as to the possible impact on work incentives, labour demand and labour supply responses. In relation to apprenticeships and training, the commission recommended that reduced rates should apply to workers who are apprentices or trainees subject to certain conditions and safegurds. The interim report of the interdepartmental group discussed certain principles on the treatment of apprentices and trainees under a national minimum wage regime. The group will give further consideration to the treatment of apprentices and trainees in its final report.</P>
    <P>These developments clearly illustrate and underpin the Government's commitment to the introduction of a national minimum wage in order to protect workers who are vulnerable and prone to be exploited while ensuring that its introduction does not impair the competitiveness of the economy. I intend to have a statutory national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour in place by the target timescale recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission on the expiry of Partnership 2000, beginning in April 2000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Placements under the overseas graduate programme are being temporarily suspended in light of the skills shortages which are present in the economy, particularly in the high technology area.

      <P>Measure 3 of the small business operational programme supports studies into new and emerging services areas. The focus of these studies is to determine the potential of the sectors to create sustainable employment and to identify the parameters necessary to realise this potential.</P>
      <P>To date, studies have been published on telefutures, audio visual facilities, multimedia and franchising. Each of the studies proposed a series of initiatives to realise the potential growth in the subsector and these are being implemented. A series of seminars on the studies have been held throughout the country and this promotional programme will be extended in 1999. An investigation of the feasibility of a digital park has also been completed.</P>
      <P>Additional studies on direct mail marketing, the design sector and entertainment support services will be published in early 1999. A strategic study into emerging service areas with a regional emphasis will also be commissioned in the near future.</P>
      <P>Seed support has been made available to assist a number of innovative projects in these new services areas. Support has been provided to a number of film-multimedia companies to strengthen their strategic bases. Telework Ireland is preparing a series of practical manuals for the subsector.

    <P>The Asia Strategy Group was established in October 1998 under the chair of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider how best to increase trade and investment between Ireland and Asia.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, only 35 per cent of some 165,000 companies on the Companies Register filed an annual return  during the year for which it was required. However, following additional staffing and IT investment over the past two years, I am glad to report that the Companies Registration Office is now beginning to make serious inroads into the compliance problem.</P>
      <P>The CRO commenced an extensive strike-off programme in September 1998 resulting in companies in default of their obligations to file their annual returns for two or more years being selected at random and formally notified of their default.</P>
      <P>Some 500 companies are now being advised by the CRO each working day that a failure on their part to comply with their statutory obligations within a short period will result in their being struck off the Companies Register and dissolved. This process will continue until mid-1999 when it is estimated that all such companies will have been processed. As at 5 February last, 34,000 companies have been issued with strike-off notices, and more significantly, this has resulted in 8,900 companies being struck-off the register.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging that since the strike-off regime commenced, a substantial improvement in the lodgment of annual returns has been experienced. In the October to January period, the number of companies which have filed returns is 52 per cent higher than the same period last year. While the figures will have to continue to improve if we are to attain a satisfactory level, I am satisfied that these trends give grounds for optimism that compliance rates by companies with their statutory obligations will show a significant improvement by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registrar also plans an increase in the number of prosecutions of both companies and their officers, and I am informed that a sizeable <Col N="850" /> number of cases will be prosecuted in late April-May 1999.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on Company Law Compliance and Enforcement which has reported recently includes a number of helpful recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the compliance and enforcement tasks of the Registrar. This report will be submitted to Government shortly, and I expect that it will be published in a matter of weeks. A number of its recommendations will require legislative change in due course.</P>
    <P>In short, I am satisfied that the benefits of additional investment in the Companies Registration Office are now becoming evident and that the Registrar and his staff are well on the way to reporting by the end of this year a substantial improvement in the rate of compliance by companies with their annual return obligations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 78, 106, 109, 128, 129 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual employment survey undertaken by Forfás indicates that in firms helped by agencies for which I am responsible, full-time jobs losses amounted to 16,654 in approximately 5,260 plants during 1998. It is normal practice that announcements relating to rationalisations and employment reductions be issued directly by the companies concerned, although I have made a number of statements concerning the closure of specific plants where I have been concerned at the impact both on the employees and the local economy. I do not have data on the total number of companies which failed in the economy gener<Col N="852" /> ally during 1998 as many of these would be in the broader services sector which do not come into contact with the support agencies.</P>
    <P>However, employment losses must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, declining unemployment and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy. Employment is dependent on the success or failure of individual firms in the market economy and it is inevitable that some firms will fail, as indeed, many will thrive and generate additional employment.</P>
    <P>Last year was the fifth successive year of strong economic growth and this is reflected in the number of new jobs created with the assistance of the development agencies. In firms assisted by the agencies associated with my Department, employment expanded vigorously by 30,624 full-time jobs during 1998, leaving net employment higher by almost 14,000. As the Forfás survey is undertaken annually, it is not possible to provide precise information on job creation or job losses other than on an annual basis. However, I am providing a list of projects (at Appendix A) which I have announced over the past four months.</P>
    <P>The city and county enterprise boards also undertake an annual survey of jobs created in the year. This survey does not provide  a month by month breakdown of jobs created. It is expected that the results for the full year 1998 will be received by my Department shortly and I will be happy to make this information available to the Deputy in the normal course.</P>
    <P>The sectors which have shown the greatest flux both in employment expansion and contraction in 1998 have been metals and engineering, food, services, clothing, footwear and leather. However, it must be noted that in our modern economy many skills are transferable across sectors. Where job losses have placed a significant strain on a local economy arrangements have been implemented to facilitate re-training and job placement through FÁS in conjunction with other State agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>As the Minister with responsibility for the year 2000 problem I launched a National Business Awareness Campaign in May of last year. The success of this campaign is evidenced by a survey, conducted by the Irish Computer Society, which showed that almost nine out of ten businesses are aware of the year 2000 problem. It also showed, however, that only 52 per cent of companies had already begun year 2000 projects. I understand that a follow-on survey to be released shortly indicates an increase of 5 per cent of companies which have started their year 2000 projects.</P>
      <P>To heighten awareness of the need to take early and definitive action, I recently launched the Enterprise Ireland National Y2K Information Service specifically geared to the needs of both small and medium sized companies. The new information service includes a helpline number. Callers will be provided with an information pack including a directory of Y2K consultants and service providers. In addition, the service will provide a series of training workshops both to companies and to intermediaries such as the county and city enterprise boards and many others.</P>
      <P>The new information service will also operate a dedicated website providing updated versions of its information pack and various other relevant material. The Y2K website will provide links to other suitable sites of direct benefit to small and medium enterprises.</P>
      <P>Last week I was delighted to launch the Small Firms Association Year 2000 Support Programme which I believe will have significant impact. The campaign includes a hotline which will provide expert advice and information to callers commencing on 10 February and running for the duration of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A newsletter, <i>Bugwatch 2,000</i>, will be published at regular intervals during the campaign providing information on checklists, case studies, articles from insurance, legal, health and safety and technical specialists. In order to gain the widest impact, part of the awareness campaign will comprise of a number of seminars held in different regional locations at which information packs and other material will be made available. A survey of those attending the seminars will be con<Col N="858" /> ducted to assess their level of awareness and preparedness for year 2000. Finally, as part of the campaign, SFA and IBEC are launching a national pledge calling on all companies to sign up to a voluntary code of compliance.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am still concerned about the levels of preparedness of Irish companies to deal with the millennium bug problem. To try to gauge their preparedness Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with the other development agencies and industry bodies, will launch before the end of this month a comprehensive national survey on the levels of compliance and activities of Irish companies. This survey will be repeated every quarter for the remainder of the year to assess the changing levels of compliance and to direct actions to stimulate compliance. I am also encouraging the industry representative bodies, in particular in the banking and insurance sectors, to use their influence with their members, business customers and clients to generate accelerated compliance activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 97 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wise Finance Company Limited was incorporated in the UK and registered as a branch in this State on 10 November 1995 under the European Communities (Branch Disclosures) <Col N="859" /> Regulations, 1993. Its directors are Ronald Weisz and Fiona Weisz.</P>
    <P>An allegation that Ronald Weisz was declared bankrupt in New York State in 1994 was recently made to our Department. Section 183 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended, prohibits an undischarged bankrupt from acting as a director of a company. As the bankruptcy was allegedly declared in a foreign state, legal advice was sought on the issue of jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have since been advised that a person declared a bankrupt in the US and remaining undischarged would not be in breach of section 183 by acting as a director in this jurisdiction. Such circumstances will obviously have to be addressed in the preparation of future companies legislation, and our Department will give the matter its attention in the interim period.</P>
    <P>The Registrar of Companies has advised me that The Wise Finance Company Limited is up to date with its filing requirements.</P>
    <P>I also understand that The Wise Finance Company Limited, which is primarily engaged in mortgage lending, does not require a licence/authorisation for its activities. Again this is a further matter which will be taken into account in the preparation of future legislation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the Estimates for my Department for 1999, published last November, and the additional funding provided in the budget, the combined details of which I understand are to be published very shortly, will be sufficient to underpin the programmes and activities carried out by my Department and its agencies in accordance with my objectives. One of my objectives is to get people, particularly young people and the long-term unemployed, into the many jobs becoming available in the economy. In that regard I would instance in particular, the £430 million package &ndash; £369 million in the Estimates and a further £14 million in the budget, supplemented by £47 million from the European Social Fund &ndash; which will fund the implementation of my employment action plan in its first full year of existance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policies are clearly stated in An Action Programme for the Millennium, which we are continuing to implement, with results in terms of record high levels of growth and low levels of inflation and unemployment that are becoming the envy of many of our competitors. <Col N="860" /> We are committed to controlling inflation and public expenditure in the new environment of EMU. We must also ensure that the necessary capital investment is put in place to meet the infrastructural requirements of our growing economy. The Government will continue to reduce the burden of taxation, and the national debt burden. We will pursue these targets so as to maximise the long-term potential for economic growth, employment, social inclusion and improved living standards for all.</P>

      <P>The local employment service is just one component of our national employment service function, with the other, and indeed larger, component being provided by FÁS. They have a critical role to play in helping unemployed people back into work, particularly in the context of our national action plan for employment. FÁS itself has undertaken a major reform and strengthening of its employment service and additional funding has been provided both to increase its personnel resource as well as its operating systems. Likewise the local employment service is being expanded to a further seven areas this year which will bring to 25 the number of areas throughout the country in which it is operational.</P>
      <P>I have, however, been concerned that we are not getting the best value from the considerable resources &ndash; amounting to around £25 million in this current year &ndash; which we are investing in our employment services. We need to achieve better co-ordination and complementarity between the two strands of the service, which I believe can best be achieved through an improved organisational structure. I am developing proposals in that regard which I will be bringing to Government shortly. The aim here, among other things, is to ensure that the further development of our employment services and infrastructure will take place in a co-ordinated and coherently planned way and, in particular, ensure that of duplication of effort and resource is avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has already been the subject of a written reply to this House on 9 February 1999.</P>
      <P>The US reaction to changes in the European Union's banana import regime to bring it into line with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules has been to threaten trade sanctions against certain exports from the EU, including Ireland. An agreement reached on 29 January in the WTO in Geneva means that for the moment the US threat has been averted.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, a WTO dispute panel is examining the recently revised EU banana import regime and will pronounce on its compatability with WTO rules. At the same time, the panel will also examine the US request for authority to impose trade sanctions and will assess the appropriateness of these under the WTO rules.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the results of the WTO panel's work will begin to become available at the beginning of next month and it is hoped that it will then be possible to resolve the matter within the mechanisms of the WTO. If these efforts prove unsuccessful, the US sanctions could apply from early March.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that for some exporters, particularly small exporters, in particular sectors, a loss of potential US markets could represent a serious strain on their resources. It is for this reason that every effort needs to be made to avoid any trade sanctions although the threat of such sanctions remains very real. If the US action goes ahead, I estimate that Irish exports affected could be of the order of £3 million per annum spread across a range of products. By comparison, the total amount of EU trade affected could be in excess of £400 million.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been very active both within the internal EU discussions and the broader Geneva discussions in working towards a resolution of the dispute within the dispute settlement system of the WTO. I consider it very important that this system, the cornerstone of the WTO, is not undermined by unilateral sanctions action. Enormous effort has been invested in building the WTO which provides a stable global trading environment. Unilateral action to resolve trade disputes endangers this environment and the economic benefits which derive from it.</P>

      <Quest> the reason the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 33 of 19 November 1998 on reducing the cost of public liability and employer's liability insurance made no reference to reducing the size of awards or the lump sum tax-free character of awards as matters that might be addressed to reduce insurance costs. </Quest>
      <QRef>[1048/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Question No. 33 of 19 November 1998 specifically referred to the cost of public and employers liability insurance for small and micro business and was responded to by me in that context. A similar question has been asked by Deputy Hogan on today's Order of Business and I have provided a separate detailed reply to the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of reducing the size of awards for damages in public liability and employers liability claims, I would point out that this issue was examined in the Deloitte &amp; Touche consultancy report on An Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland. In their study, the consultants undertook an analysis of general damages awards by the High Court over a three year period in relation to the most numerous categories of personal injury claims and found that the High Court awards were consistently significantly below the maximum awards in each category and clustered around twice the average male industrial earnings. Deloitte &amp; Touche also found that 85 per cent of High Court awards fell within the UK &ldquo;Guidelines for the Assessment of Damages in Personal Injury Cases&rdquo; prepared and published by the Judicial Studies Board.</P>
      <P>In the light of its comparative analysis, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that there was no valid case for introducing a capping regime in Ireland to limit the size of personal injury awards and pointed out that there would be no guarantee that the introduction of such a capping regime would lead to reductions in insurance premiums. To ensure greater consistency in awards, the consultants recommended that the Judiciary should establish a specialist panel, with its participation and under its direction and control, to draw up guidelines for general damages awards in personal injury cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report did not deal with the issue of lump sum awards and related taxation issues. The Law Reform Commission, in its 1997 report on &ldquo;Personal Injuries: Periodic Payments and Structured Settlements&rdquo;, recommended that provision should be made for the use of structured settlements in relation to the element of court awards made in respect of future loss and pain and suffering in serious injury cases where awards are large. Such settlements, as an alternative to lump sum awards, would be at the option of the plaintiff and, as an incentive in this regard, the commission recommended that section 5 of the 1990 Finance Act, which provides that the income from the investment of a lump sum in total incapacity cases is tax free, should be extended to structured awards. The recommendation for introducing the option of structured settlement awards was viewed by the commission, <Col N="863" /> not as a means of reducing the size of awards but as offering more secure arrangements for guaranteeing the seriously injured plaintiff an inflation-proofed, tax-free income for the rest of his/her life or for a minimum period of years.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that the two major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements in Ireland were medical inflation and the high transactions cost of claims, particularly legal costs, including the cost of expert witnesses. A Special Working Group, established under the aegis of our Department, is currently undertaking a research-based study of personal injury compensation systems in operation in other countries with a view to establishing if these provide a more cost-effective basis for delivering personal injury compensation.</P>

      <P>Government support to enterprise must conform to the limits set by the EU regional aid guidelines, the latest version of which will come into effect, generally, in January 2000.</P>
      <P>At present the development agencies can offer assistance to enterprises of up to 57 per cent of investment costs in the non-designated areas, up to 71 per cent in the designated areas and up to 75 per cent in Gaeltacht areas. In practice the assistance offered is well below these limits.</P>
      <P>Under the latest EU regulations, Ireland will be treated as comprising eight Article 92(3)(c) sub-regions &ndash; our regional authority areas&ndash; and each will have a ceiling on the aid which can be offered to enterprise. The limit for each area will depend on its GDP/unemployment rate, but may not exceed 20 per cent of investment costs, with a top-up of up to 10 per cent for SMEs. Not only is the Commission limiting aid payable across the Union to curb harmful competitive bidding between member states, but the new rules reflect Ireland's much improved economic status, that is, we are no longer one of the poorest areas of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the EU regulations on Structural Funds are amended and there is to be a new Objective One region in the area comprising the three sub-regions of the west, midlands and Border, plus Clare and Kerry, that area will qualify for the highest regional aid status, known as Article 92(3)(a), at present enjoyed by the whole State. <Col N="864" /> The aid limits in this case would probably be in the region of up to 40 per cent of investment costs, with a top-up to 15 per cent for small and medium enterprises.</P>
    <P>The new limits are, of course, ceilings. In practice, the agencies will continue to operate on a value for money basis and to offer assistance at the appropriate level in each case.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment blackspots, my Department's policy in relation to industrial location is to encourage investors, via the industrial development agencies, to locate their investments in areas which need them taking account of the investors' own requirements. The locational aspects of industrial development require a strong co-operative approach between the industrial development agencies, the local authorities and infrastructure-service providers. For their part, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development offer various incentives to accomplish this task including: enhanced grant packages, particularly in designated areas; stimulating construction programmes of modern advance factories and business parks at key locations with private sector involvement; working closely with local authorities to make available quality serviced sites; and working with local communities and development agencies to improve their areas so that these areas are more competitive and attractive to potential investors and capable of competing strongly against similar European locations for possible investment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies participate, as appropriate, in various local initiatives such as special task forces, details of which are furnished in reply to a separate question by Deputy Creed on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that the Apple Computer Company has decided to cease production of its iMAC computer at its Cork facility with the loss of 450 jobs. I was initially informed on 23 December 1998 that IDA Ireland feared that the iMAC manufacture would be outsourced to LG Electronics with subsequent job losses. Apple Corporation confirmed that it would be laying off 450 staff on the afternoon of Monday, 1 February 1999 prior to informing its employees in Cork. The official notification from Apple was received on 3 February 1999.</P>

      <P>In November 1997, the Government established an Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. The group was established as part of the business, education and training partnership to develop national strategies to tackle the issues of skills needs, manpower forecasting and education and training, for business.</P>
      <P>The first report of the group examined key technological skills in the software and electronics sectors. As part of the response to the recommendations of the group, FÁS has received an additional £3.2 million in its 1999 allocation to train up to 800 people in these sectors. Enterprise Ireland has established a programme aimed at Irish people working abroad, to attract graduates back to work in Ireland. The national skills awareness campaign, run by Forfás, is currently updating its main brochure which will be distributed to all second level schools. As part of this campaign, an information web site is also being launched by Forfás. My Department and FÁS will continue to monitor the situation and remain in active consultation with other Departments on implementation of the recommendations of the first report of the expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group has also recognised that issues of skills and labour availability are also a matter for many occupations which do not require third level qualifications. It is now considering this broader area and reviewing sectors <Col N="868" /> across a broad range of the economy, including construction, catering, office cleaning and clothing. I will await the outcome of its report with keen interest.</P>
    <P>The issue of potential labour shortages in a growing economy is a complex matter which demands a multi-faceted approach. For my part, I will continue with the thrust of current Government policy aimed at creating, a business environment that is conducive to the supply of adequately skilled persons to meet the demands of the economy. On a macro level, I will continue to promote appropriate fiscal and structural policies aimed at facilitating and encouraging a return to work and improving the reward from work. The significant tax reform announced in the last budget which will see the introduction of a tax credits system represents a mojor step in this direction. This radical approach combined with tax changes, in particular those focused on the lower paid, represents a key element of a stragegy  to improve the incentive to work. In the context of our current dynamic labour market we are refocusing the range and quality of active labour market programmes to match these to demand issues. The Estimates and budget of 1999 saw a significant re-orientation towards shorter, more focused programmes with a more direct labour market linkage. The employment action plan with its systematic focus on education and training for persons who are not job ready is also an important element in the strategy of matching labour supply and demand. Tackling outstanding unemployment and poverty traps also represents a further element of policy as part of an overarching strategy to ensure that we overcome potential labour supply bottlenecks.</P>

      <P>A substantial body of legislation has been enacted over the years to protect consumers. Two of the more important measures are the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and the Consumer Information Act, 1978. The former gives various rights to consumers who buy or hire goods. Goods, for example, must be of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose for which they are intended. The Act includes provisions relating to manufacturers' or suppliers' guarantees. For example, a guarantee may not exclude or limit the rights of a consumer. Under the Act, the consumer has the right of redress through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> The Consumer Information Act, 1978, protects consumers against false or misleading claims about goods, services and prices. Under the Act, it is an offence to make such claims to a material degree in the course of a business, trade or profession and the Director of Consumer Affairs has the power of prosecution in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Matters relating to fraud are the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <Quest> the early indications of the effect that the euro has had on enterprise and trade; if she has satisfied herself that Irish business is prepared for the euro and adhering to regulations; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>As yet it is somewhat early to make an assessment on the impact that the euro has had on enterprise and trade in this country, since the euro has only been introduced in a limited fashion, for non-cash transactions, since 1 January 1999. Notes and coins will not come into circulation until the year 2002. Notwithstanding this fact, Forfás which manages a business awareness campaign in regard to the introduction of the euro on behalf of myself and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertook at the end of December 1998 a survey of 624 businesses conducted by Irish Marketing Surveys with the objective of assessing the awareness of Irish business, and the extent of its preparations for EMU on the eve of the commencement of European Monetary Union. From that survey there is strong evidence that a significant number of Irish companies will operate in euros during 1999. The December survey undertaken by Irish Marketing Surveys indicates that 49 per cent of companies plan to price in euros, and 38 per cent to invoice in euros during 1999. Other major developments planned for 1999, according to this survey, are that 49 per cent of companies, including those who have already done so, will adapt their accounting systems to cater for the euro and 46 per cent will open a euro bank account. Over one in four of the businesses surveyed have spoken to their customers and suppliers in regard to their plans for changeover, and over half the businesses claim that their customers and suppliers have informed them of their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides the above findings in the survey other developments include the following: some supermarkets are currently pricing in both euros and in Irish pounds, and also advertising their product prices through the media in euros in addition to Irish pounds; a number of the financial institutions are now issuing bank statements in euros in addition to Irish pounds and showing individual transactions in both currencies; wages and salaries in net terms are now being printed by some <Col N="870" /> organisations onto payroll slips in euros in addition to the Irish pound amount. Such developments as those outlined above are bound to increase as the year progresses and will have a major impact in both educating the public generally and in assisting small businesses in coming to terms with the EMU environment especially when euros are brought into circulation in notes and coin in the year 2002.</P>
    <P>In conducting their business awareness campaign on behalf of both myself and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás has made extensive contact with businesses, particularly small businesses and its representative associations on a regular basis since the inception of the campaign in December 1996.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Forfás campaign it has distributed over 54,000 information packs on how businesses should prepare for EMU. It has distributed 104,000 summary brochures to businesses, outlining in brief terms the preparations which should be made. It has issued over 86,000 retail brochures specifically aimed at the medium to smaller retail businesses. Over 40,000 booklets setting out the guidelines to be observed in preparing IT systems have been issued, and 14,000 copies of a guide to conversion and rounding have also been distributed. Finally Forfás has also recently distributed 70,000 copies of a leaflet outlining various publications available to businesses from the overall campaign. This leaflet was distributed during the December-January period and concentrated on publications which were particularly relevant to companies in the SME sector.</P>
    <P>In addition to all the above material which was distributed to small businesses and the various consultations with the business representative organisations. Forfás has conducted many seminars throughout the country instructing local business people as to how they should prepare for the EMU environment.</P>
    <P>My Department in conjunction with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is currently at an advanced stage of preparation of a national code of practice on dual pricing in the context of the euro. This code of practice is currently in draft form and is expected to be ready for publication shortly. This code will form part of this Department's strategy to protect consumers in the changeover process and will assist businesses to prepare for dual display during the changeover period.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all of the above there may still be some businesses who feel they have had insufficient information on the preparations necessary for the euro regime. Forfás, during the coming year, will be continuing its efforts to ensure that all business operations in this country, particularly small businesses, and all business people are given every opportunity to avail of their comprehensive bank of information on the business implications of EMU.</P>

      <P>It is now accepted internationally that science and technology is playing an increasingly central role in national economic development. Recent industrial development experiences clearly show, that Ireland simply cannot compete internationally on the basis of low costs and low wages. Our international competitiveness in a global market therefore must be based on our ability, to provide high technology enterprises with a skilled workforce and an environment conducive to world class technological innovation.</P>
      <P>This means that as a nation we must stimulate public and private sector investment in research and development. As a small country, the public sector obviously cannot invest without limit in our research capacity. I therefore intend to target for special treatment those areas likely to have the most beneficial impact on our economy and I want to ensure Ireland can compete in these areas at a world class level. It was against this background that last March, I asked the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, ICSTI, to undertake Ireland's first ever Technology Foresight study. ICSTI's initiative, which involved a high degree of consultation with experts and other interested parties, is seeking to identify the research and technology areas regarded as the key to Ireland's long-term development. The Council's report is also expected to put forward recommendations to assist Government devise a long-term strategy to ensure Ireland is well placed to respond to the opportunities and challenges of our technological future. I expect to receive this Technology Foresight report from ICSTI during the month of March.</P>

      <P>The global communications revolution is changing the shape of the world economy. Dramatic advances in technology and the development of the Internet <Col N="872" /> as a platform for electronic commerce are at the heart of this revolution. Within two to three  years the Internet will have created a single market of over 300 million computer-based consumers world-wide. The scale of growth forecast for electronic commerce is phenomenal. Today, such transactions are worth $22 billion per annum. However, by 2002, the value of these transactions is expected to have risen to $350 billion per annum.</P>
      <P>Irish business, whether indigenous or foreign owned, must be at the heart of this revolution and access to competitively priced broad-band telecommunications infrastructure, not only within Ireland but also connected to the global broad-band telecommunications networks, is a prerequisite for Ireland's future economic well-being.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Government decided last year to accelerate liberalisation and competition in the telecommunications sector. The Government also decided to establish a public-private consortium to negotiate with submarine cable providers to extend to Ireland significant additional band-width capacity which would be connected to the global telecommunications infrastructure. I understand that negotiations are proceeding apace.</P>
      <P>The magnitude of the economic opportunities afforded by the advances in telecommunications technologies, including broad-band, has pushed information society and electronic commerce issues to the forefront of the Government's agenda and I am determined that Irish business will be well positioned to reap the rewards from these developments. Electronic commerce businesses will tend to be attracted to those countries with low cost, high quality telecommunications and Internet services, good business and legal environments for electronic commerce and highly skilled workforces.</P>
      <P>Specifically, we must create a facilitatory regime for electronic commerce so as to retain existing businesses which have or which could develop a high telecommunications or Internet dependence; promote Ireland's reputation as an attractive location for investment particularly in leading edge electronic commerce projects; foster organic growth of strong indigenous electronic commerce companies and the creation of higher added-value, knowledge-intensive, better-paid jobs; and enhance and underpin the competitiveness of Irish business generally in the face of its competitors elsewhere who are also exploiting the potential of electronic commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent past, a number of policy papers and reports have been published by high level groups comprising representatives of the public and private sectors. My Department and the development agencies under its aegis are implementing some 50 recommendations made in the National Competitiveness Council Statement on Telecommunications, A Key Factor in Electronic Commerce and Competitiveness; the first report of the Inter-Departmental Implementation Group on The Information Society &ndash; A Frame<Col N="873" /> work for Action; Information Society Commission &ndash; Is the Business Community Ready? and the report of the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Parallel to this implementation programme, my Department, in consultation with Forfás and the other industrial development agencies, is planning a policy statement on electronic commerce which will serve as a medium-term compass for further action in the area. In addition, my Department is fully participating in developments in information society issues and electronic commerce matters in particular at EU and international levels.</P>
    <P>Based  on an advanced telecommunication network with global connectivity, our goal is to position Ireland as a significant hub for electronic activity early in the new millennium.</P>

      <P>A survey comparing the price of insurance premiums among various categories of driver in the UK, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Ireland was undertaken by Deloitte &amp; Touche in its report on and economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland published in <Col N="874" /> 1996. This survey was based on premium quotations obtained from a number of insurance companies in each of these countries in respect of the years 1990, 1992, and 1994, (1995 in the case of Denmark).</P>
      <P>The survey found that premium rates for adult drivers in the UK were 48 per cent lower, France 21 per cent lower, Denmark 10 per cent lower, and Holland 6 per cent lower than corresponding rates in Ireland. Premiums in Holland and Denmark were not significantly lower than Ireland and the survey found that the gap between Irish and other EU rates had been narrowing since 1990. Danish rates were expected to overtake or exceed Irish rates in the short-term.</P>
      <P>The detailed results of the comparative survey are published in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</P>
      <P>With regard to comparisons with the UK market, the difference in premiums was found to be broadly proportional to the difference in motor claims costs in each State. Although UK drivers lodge more claims &ndash; car theft is more common in Britain &ndash; the average Irish motor claims estimate was over four times the UK average.</P>
      <P>The consultants found that the UK's lower average claims cost was attributable to the fact that the UK insurance market experienced relatively more claims involving low cost damage to vehicles partly because they have more urban driving characterised by low-speed &ldquo;fender bender&rdquo; collisions in traffic. Ireland, on the other hand, has a large rural road network and a lower traffic density, nine private cars per kilometre of road as against 56 in the UK, which increases the proportion of high-speed accidents involving personal injury in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The cost of claims caused by uninsured drivers is the same in both jurisdictions. Garda Síochána statistics showed that, at the time of publication of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report 6 per cent of Irish motorists were uninsured. According to latest Department of Environment and Local Government statistics this figure has now fallen to 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that, for most categories of driver there is a competitive market for motor insurance in Ireland. Drivers belonging to groups characterised by maturity and good claims experience have seen their premiums reduced in real terms since 1990. Young drivers throughout the EU are assessed, on the basis of insurers' claims experience, as a high risk category. Consequently, they will have limited choice of insurer and face high premium costs in Ireland, as elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to reducing the cost of motor insurance in Ireland lies in safer driving, leading to a reduction in the number and cost of claims. in order to monitor and evaluate the costs of motor insurance on a continuing basis, I have re-established and re-constituted the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The new expanded board will advise me in regard to the level of premiums, the system of differentiating premiums in respect of different categories and classes of drivers and owners, the relationship between claims <Col N="875" /> and premiums charged in each category and any other matters which the board may consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives are being taken to inculcate safe driving standards. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is examining the Ontario graduated licensing system for young drivers. The National Safety Council has developed road safety and driving instructional material for inclusion in school curricula. The Irish Insurance Federation has established and is actively promoting an insurance incentive scheme wherein certain driving instructors with the Driving Instructors' Register, DIR offer a special 25-hour driving course to learner drivers  who are then entitled to an introductory discount from an Irish Insurance Federation member company.</P>

      <Quest> the procedures in place whereby a consumer can have access to redress procedures throughout the EU; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>Each member state operates its own code of consumer protection legislation. It is also a matter for each member state to establish procedures for redress, which vary from member state to member state. However, a substantial body of consumer law in all member states derives from EU directives such as the directives on consumer credit, misleading advertising, unfair terms in consumer contracts and timeshare contracts. A number of recently adopted directives, including amendments to the consumer credit and misleading advertising directives, will be implemented over the next two years. Work is continuing at EU level on a number of other draft directives, including the draft directive on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, which is designed to improve consumer protection, <i>inter alia, </i>in transboundary transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer protection legislation, with cross-Border enforcement potential, is beginning to emerge at EU level. Directive 98/27/EC on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests will ensure access to the courts of other member states by approved Irish bodies, for <Col N="877" /> example, the Director of Consumer Affairs) to protect the collective interests of Irish consumers listed in a number of specified directives, that is, misleading advertising; contracts negotiated away from business premises, doorstep selling; consumer credit, the co-ordination of provisions on television broadcasting activities; package travel, package holidays and package tours, advertising of medicinal products for human use; unfair terms in consumer contracts; timeshare contracts and the distant selling of goods and services. The draft directive on the distant selling of financial services will be added to the list as will the consumer provisions of the draft directive on certain legal aspects of electronic commerce, assuming these directives are adopted. Discussions are continuing at EU level on the possibility of including the draft directive on guarantees, which we are required to implement by the end of the year, in the list of directives encompassed by Directive 98/27/EC.</P>
    <P>The European Consumer Centre, Dublin, is part of a network of ten such centres operating in seven EU member states, as follows: France, Germany, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg. The centre provides information and assistance to nationals of EU member states about their rights under Irish and EU consumer law. The centres are required to supply consumers with (a) information allowing them to carry out, with full knowledge of the facts, purchases of goods and services of any nature in their own member state or in any member state of the EU other than the one of their residence; (b) appropriate assistance in the event of problems arising as a consquence of these purchases and (c) as a last resort, information about court and legal recourses which are available to settle legal disputes. The centres are expected to collaborate closely with one another in order to encourage information flows, develop synergies and avoid duplication. The centre is co-financed by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The authorities responsible for consumer protection in EU member states, including the Director of Consumer Affairs in the case of Ireland, refer complaints for investigation and/or follow up, as appropriate, to their counterparts in other member states where the alleged infringement took place.</P>

      <P>Informational leaflets on the principal consumer protection measures are available from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, ODCA. The requirements regarding information are under constant review and new material is made available to the public as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The ODCA operates throughout the working week a telephone call-in advice line for consumers. There is also a regional office in Cork. ODCA inspectors hold monthly information clinics at selected locations throughout the country where advice is given to personal callers. The Director of Consumer Affairs frequently participates in media discussions on consumers' rights. Staff of the ODCA from time to time take part in consumer phone-in question and answer sessions on local radio. The Director of Consumer Affairs is presented on the Consumer Education Development Committee, CEDC, established by the Minister for Labour in 1992. Other members of the CEDC include representatives of the Consumer's Association of Ireland, the Department of Education and Science, the Vocational Educational Committee of Offaly and Tipperary North Riding and the Curriculum Development Unit of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. In 1997, a representative of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, was appointed to the Committee.</P>
      <P>The CEDC has been active since its establishment. A study pack, entitled Consumer Action, containing materials on consumer education was prepared in 1993. The pack was piloted in five centres for the unemployed in 1993. It was updated in 1994 within financial assistance from the Consumer Policy Service of the EU. The updated pack was piloted in adult education centres, Youthreach centres and in schools offering, the transition year programme. A series of in-career professional days were arranged for teachers and tutors of the pack. In 1995, the results of these pilot programmes were reported at a national conference on consumer education. The conference was attended by delegates from Ireland, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, the CEDC commissioned a discussion paper on Consumer Education in Ireland. The paper, Towards a Critical Awareness of the Marketplace, which looked at aspects of consumer education in Ireland within the context of consumer protection generally, was published in 1997. It made a number of proposals for the development of consumer awareness through the educational system. A conference is planned for March of this year to co-ordinate responses to the <Col N="879" /> discussion paper. It is intended that a wide variety of interests from various sectors in Irish education will be represented at the conference. The CEDC is currently engaged in a project entitled Teaching the Consumer. The project is grant-aided by the European Commission. The Consumer Council of Northern Irealnd and the Consumentenbond of The Netherlands are partners in the project. The project is designed to increase awareness of students and teachers at primary and secondary school levels on a wide range of consumer issues. Through the students and the providers of the materials it is expected that the information will extend outwards to a larger group of consumers, especially those in the disadvantaged and marginalised groups. The materials will be used in the national network of adult and youth education centres. The project is scheduled to run from 1 September 1998 to 31 August 1999.</P>

      <P>Information about individual firms in difficulty or likely to be in difficulty is generally both sensitive and confidential and is the responsibility of companies themselves.</P>
      <P>The State development agencies under the aegis of my Department are working closely with companies in difficulty with a view to ensuring as far as possible that corrective action is taken to improve competitiveness and minimise potential job losses. Task forces, representative of agency and other interests, are also operating to address the problems arising from company closures this year in a number of areas, including Donegal, Dublin, Limerick, Longford and Mullingar. In the case of company closures or significant down-sizing, the agencies work closely with local interests to attract replacement industry, assist in the expansion of existing industry, and provide retraining, where appropriate, for workers affected.</P>
      <P>Under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, 27 companies have notified my Department of proposed redundancies of about 1,500 people in 1999, including, nine company closures with 1,200 proposed redundancies. In addition to notified redundancies, Fruit of the Loom has announced job losses of 770 in 1999 at its Donegal plants.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the Corrib Field is that in 1998 Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum and Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited drilled and tested an appraisal well, flaring gas on test at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage; this will only be possible when the accumulation has been fully evaluated. The current estimates based on the limited data available gives a range of values and Enterprise Oil have indicated that it could contain one trillion cubic feet of gas in-place.</P>
      <P>The evaluation process will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years and is expected to include the drilling of additional appraisal wells. Enterprise Oil have indicated that they are planning to drill a further appraisal well this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the results of their appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for Enterprise Oil <Col N="882" /> to apply to my Department for a petroleum lease &ndash; the authorisation required to bring the gas into production.</P>
    <P>It is too early at this stage to address issues involved in a possible development of Corrib, but should a lease be granted to Enterprise Oil it will be necessary for them to submit a detailed Plan of Development for the field for my approval. This plan would cover the design, siting, construction, operation, abandonment and removal of any facilities. It would also include such technical, economic and financial information as would enable me to have the proposed development fully evaluated and to have its economic, social, safety and environmental implications assessed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply of 15 December last, the Government wishes to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners. In the UN General Assembly on 13 October 1998, Ireland voted with our EU partners in favour of Resolution 53/4 which called for an end to the embargo. The resolution was adopted with a significantly increased majority over its predecessor &ndash; 157 votes in favour, two against, with 12 abstentions. This compares to 143 in favour, three against and 17 abstentions in 1997.</P>
      <P>The US Administration and its diplomatic representatives have been made fully aware of our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Some progress has been made towards reviewing the embargo. I have already welcomed President Clinton's announcement of March 1998 on the opening of a number of contacts with Cuba. Last month, the US announced proposals for further measures, including fewer restrictions on flights to Cuba and on remittances to Cubans, a direct mail service with the island and a system that allows private Cuban entities to buy US food and agricultural inputs.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that, under Ireland's EU Presidency of 1996, the EU adopted a common position on Cuba. The common position defines the EU's objective in its relations with Cuba as the facilitation of a peaceful transition to democracy and a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people. The common position also makes clear that the EU's aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict, bloodshed and mass emigration. However, the common position also makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights.</P>
    <P>We look forward to an improvement in the human rights situation in Cuba. In the meantime, the EU position remains as set out in the common position, as reiterated by the General Affairs Council on 7 December last. Havana must also play its part if Cuba wishes its international relations to be more significantly improved.</P>
    <P>For its part, the EU &ndash; in line with its policy of encouragement rather than isolation &ndash; has acceded to Cuba's request for observer status, as of 30 September last, at the negotiations for a new Lomé Convention. Full membership of the convention &ndash; and other full co-operation &ndash; must depend on real, substantial progress in respecting human rights and democracy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opporturnity to state once more my complete abhorrence of punishment <Col N="884" /> attacks of all types. All of the parties to the British-Irish Agreement are united in their call for such attacks to end.</P>
    <P>Punishment beatings have been a part of the violence which has scarred Northern Ireland over the past thirty years. It is right, in the aftermath of the achievement of the British-Irish Agreement, that society expects such beatings to end immediately, just as we expect an end to the appalling sectarian attacks on vulnerable nationalist famillies which we have seen in recent weeks. There is a particular responsibility on those parties associated with paramilitary organisations to help to bring punishment beatings to an end. In this regard, I welcome the recent comments by Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin, who said that punishment beatings are brutal. They are dehumanising and should stop, no matter who is involved in them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by Amnesty International to fulfil its long-standing commitment to travel to Northern Ireland to assess the current human rights and justice situation. The organisation has, however, made clear that its decision was not made in the light of any political pressure, and that its investigation will have a far broader remit than punishment attacks alone. It will also consider issues such as policing and the administration of justice and will make a full and comprehensive report available in due course.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of paramilitary groups are regularly assessed by the relevant security authorities. They are also discussed on an ongoing basis through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental conference. When media reports concerning claims of a re-arming of one group came to light on 3 February 1999 they were immediately raised by the Department of Foreign Affairs through the framework of the conference. The British side indicated that the RUC was investigating the authenticity of the claims.</P>
      <P>There is at this stage no indication that the report claims have had any effect on the loyalist ceasefires, and I welcome in this regard the reassuring remarks of a senior member of the political party associated with the group in question. I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to monitor the situation closely. I would also like to add that I have repeatedly and strongly condemned the activities of loyalist paramilitaries who are not on ceasefire and who have conducted a series of recent attacks on vulnerable nationalist families and locations.</P>

      <P>The Government remains in close contact with the British Government on the implementation of all aspects of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Agreement's provisions on prisoners were negotiated and agreed by both the Irish and British Governments and by all the parties involved in the talks as an integral part of a comprehensive, balanced and interlocking package. The Agreement was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the electorate in the island of Ireland, and both Governments are determined that it will be implemented in its entirety.</P>
      <P>Legislation has been enacted in the State and in Northern Ireland to give effect to the commitment to an accelerated programme for the release of qualifying prisoners, and all releases are made in accordance with this legislation. Neither Government proposes to introduce in the legislation criteria for which there is no provision in the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Government unequivocally condemns so-called punishment beatings, irrespective of who the perpetrators are. However, we are convinced that to slow down or halt the release programme would not resolve this problem; rather, it would place a further obstacle in the way of full implementation of the Agreement and the development of functioning political structures in Northern Ireland.</P>

It is expected that, as part of the report, Irish haulage costs will be compared with similar costs in the United Kingdom, Holland and Germany and published in due course.

      <P>Ireland requires a national spread of high capacity, competitive telecommunications infrastructure if it is to exploit the opportunities offered by the information age. In this regard I have recently taken a series of steps which I believe will create an environment leading to the roll out of such infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
      <P>First, the implementation of telecommunications liberalisation from 1 December 1998 will, I believe, foster competition in the marketplace and thus the spread of telecommunications infrastructure. Second, recognising that in certain regions of the country competition alone will not provide the required investment, I have recently made available European Union Structural Funds to projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services in these regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the range of initiatives outlined in the recently published &ldquo;Implementing the Information Society in Ireland: an Action Plan&rdquo;, when actioned, will create demand for additional telecommunications services which will prompt yet <Col N="888" /> further investment by the private sector in cost competitive, high capacity telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are evidence of the Government's intent in ensuring that Ireland becomes an active player in the global digital economy.</P>

    <P>*The recommendations contained in the Defence Forces review implementation plan in relation to the reorganisation of the Army took effect from 1 November, 1998. This means that the army is now organised as follows: Three brigades, Defence Forces training centre and two logistics bases.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Broadly speaking the areas of the three brigades correspond to the areas of the former Eastern, Southern and Western Commands with the exception that the area of the former Curragh command now forms part of the areas of the Eastern, Southern and Western Brigades. The area of the Defence Forces training centre corresponds to the area of the Curragh Camp and the Glen of Imaal.</P>
    <P>However, the Defence Forces review implementation plan also provides for a special study of the reserve forces to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November, 1997, I announced the setting up of a joint civilian/military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the Chief of Staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. The joint civilian/military steering group, as part of its work, oversees and guides the military board in its task. Pending the findings and recommendaions of the study the FCA and An Slua Muirí are still organised in old command structure.</P>

      <P>Under a proposed draft variation of the Cork county development plan 1996 published recently, the relevant planning authority &ndash; Cork County Council &ndash; proposes that an integrated area action plan, including provision for commercial, residential and employment uses, should be drawn up in relation to future development of the barracks property. That integrated plan will be subject to formal adoption by the council in advance of the authority considering relevant individual planning applications. My Department has recently advertised a tender competition to appoint independent planning consultants to draw up the requisite integrated area action plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 February 1999 between 06.50 hours and 07.23 hours armed elements attacked Haddathah compound from locations within the IRISHBATT area of operations. Between 06.50 hours and 07.35 hours on 7 February the Israeli Defence Force/<i>de facto </i>forces responded by firing <Col N="892" /> into the IRISHBATT area of operations, resulting in injuries to two members of the Defence Forces serving with 84 IRISHBATT.</P>
    <P>The technical ordnance report on the incident confirms that one mortar round impacted on the roof of the Company HQ &ndash; UN position 6-38. Eight other rounds impacted in a pattern from five to 50 metres on and around the perimeter of the H.Q. The military authorities have reported that this clearly indicates that the UN position was the identified target. A crater analysis revealed that the rounds were fired from varying Israeli Defence Force/<i>de facto </i>forces positions and Israeli markings were also found on the remains of four mortars.</P>
    <P>The two members of the Defence Forces &ndash; Cpl. Noel Roche and Pte. John Flaherty &ndash; serving with 84 IRISHBATT who were wounded by the mortar round which impacted on the roof of the UN post were admitted to the UNIFIL hospital in Naquora. Pte. Flaherty was released yesterday and the latest information available on Cpl. Roche is that he is due to be released shortly. It was extremely fortunate that their injuries were not much more serious or that there was no loss of life in this case. There was also considerable damage to the building and its equipment.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of the incident were reported immediately by IRISHBATT to UNIFIL headquarters which in turn protested to the Israeli Defence Force through the usual liaison channels. At my request the Department of Foreign Affairs has protested this incident in the strongest possible manner to the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The number of personnel serving in each barracks is not made publicly available for reasons of security. The approximate percentage number of hearing loss claims as received from personnel attached to each barracks is contained in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>I should say that because of personnel movements, the percentage of claimants in any given installation will vary over time. It is not possible to give an exact number of claimants in a particular location at a particular time. The attached figures are, however, a good general guide to the distribution of claimants. About 15 per cent of claims received to date have been processed through the courts or by settlements.</P>

      <P>The current development strategy for the food industry covers the period from 1994 to 1999 and is contained in the food sub-programme of the operational programme for industrial development. The overall aim of the sub-programme is to build a competitive food industry which will generate national wealth and employment while helping to sustain rural economies. It provides for total public funding of £250 million through a range of support measures covering capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and human resources. The performance to date under the food sub-proramme has been satisfactory. Since 1993, the gross output of the industry has increased by £2.2 billion, exports have increased by £1 billion and some 10,200 gross jobs have been created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food industry development group, which was established under the aegis of my Department in 1998, was charged with the formulation of a future action plan for the industry. The group's report recommends the continuation of the integrated developmental approach contained in the sub-programme. In addition to emphasising the importance of continuing attention to food safety and quality matters, the report identifies other issues which need to be addressed in the context of competitiveness and market orientation. These concern the maximisation of efficieny and capabilities in the areas of innovation, production-processing, marketing and human resources. The report emphasises the need to maximise the added value elements of the various food sectors and refers to some sectoral specific <Col N="895" /> issues that require attention. These range from rationalisation-restructuring of the beef sector to improved grading and storage facilities in the horticultural sector. The group's report will be taken into consideration in the context of the new national development plan and the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the statement by the Secretary in his Department to the Committee of Public Accounts in 1997 querying the wisdom of devoting further resources to badger eradication while there is no anti-tuberculosis vaccine for badgers; if the badger cull costs £2 million a year; if he will outline the expenditure on a tuberculosis vaccine for badgers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such statement. In any event, my Department does not operate a badger eradication policy although significant resources are committed to our efforts to eradicate tuberculosis in both cattle and badgers. The objective in both instances is to protect the host species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 approximately 2,500 badgers were removed as part of a scientific programme under licences issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This figure represents <Col N="896" /> less than 1.5 per cent of the estimated total badger population. The objective of the programme is to understand more fully the mechanisms involved in the spread of this disease among badgers and cattle and to develop suitable means for its control and eradication.</P>
    <P>The cost of this part of the programme is relatively small and although final figures are not available it is anticipated that the total expenditure for 1998 will not exceed £200,000. The proposed budget for 1999 on this work will be in the order of £400,000.</P>

      <P>The service provided at Kilfinane was data processing of cattle movement notification forms completed by farmers and dealers in respect of bovine animals sold privately after 28 September 1998. It represented one element only of the national programme for the computerised traceability of cattle movements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the issue is that in mid January 1999, my Department was given notice by <Col N="900" /> the company involved of cessation of data entry operations at Kilfinane. This situation arose due to difficulties about a crucial element of the contract between the company and the Department. Prior to receipt of the notice of closure, discussions between the company and the Department had taken place over a period of several months. While all-out efforts were made to settle the matter, the reality is that the differences between the two sides were such that this was not feasible. After lengthy discussions and negotiations between the two parties the company ceased operations at Kilfinane on 12 February last.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that there was no interruption in the data processing service, the Department entered into negotiations with the service provider placed second in order of merit in the tendering procedure. Agreement was reached with the second placed tenderer to take over the service with immediate effect.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the correct amount of income tax is being deducted from the taxpayer's pension. The tax band being <Col N="912" /> applied to the taxpayer is appropriate to her level of income.</P>
      <P>As regards the social welfare insurance charge on the taxpayer's pension, this refers to the health contribution and the employment and training levy levies. Since her retirement the taxpayer has not been in insurable employment and she has not made social insurance contributions in that time. However, the taxpayer is liable to pay health levy at the rate of 1.25 per cent and employment and training levy at the rate of 1 per cent in any year where her income is greater than the threshold under which levies are not payable. In the years 1994-95 to 1996-97 the taxpayer's income was below the threshold. In 1997-98 her income exceeded the threshold and this gave rise to a liability to pay the levies. However the amount of levies deducted exceeded the amount payable and the taxpayer can claim a refund of the amount overpaid by applying to the Collector General, PRSI Refunds Section, Sarsfield House, Limerick. The taxpayer's P60 should accompany the application.</P>
      <P>The low income exemption threshold for the levies was introduced in the 1994 budget at £173 per week or £9,000 per annum, and was increased in subsequent budgets. At present the threshold is £207 per week or £10,750 per annum. The levies threshold was introduced in order to focus assistance towards those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 budget last December, I announced substantial changes in the area of levies. From the new tax year, the employment and training levy will be abolished and the health levy increased, resulting in a net levy of 2 per cent being applied from the 1999-2000 tax year, an overall decrease of 0.25 per cent in the levies. In addition, the threshold was raised to £11,250 per annum, or £216 per week. These two improvements will apply from 6 April next and will cost the Exchequer £63 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to tax relief for education and training courses.</P>
      <P>There are a number of tax reliefs available for training and educational courses. Section 476 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act provides tax relief, at the standard tax rate, for the fees of students studying certain training courses. Training courses must be in information technology and foreign languages of the EU but excluding official languages of the State.</P>
      <P>There are also tax reliefs, at the standard tax rate, available for the fees of full-time undergraduate students in private colleges and part-time undergraduate students in private colleges and publicly funded colleges. However, the courses must be of a least two years duration.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government commits a large amount of resources to training each year. CERT, the State Tourism Training Agency, provides professional cookery training from elementary level through to advanced and supervisory level. I understand from CERT that elementary programmes are provided for unemployed persons and are run over a 16 week period. During training participants receive a weekly allowance equivalent to the unemployment payment the person was receiving, books, uniforms, and a travel allowance where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a career path approach to training, a top-up training programme is available to persons successfully completing elementary training. This <Col N="914" /> facilitates access to full-time craft level training leading to national certification. Alternatively, they may go on a day-release training programme, if they have found employment on completion of training. In 1998 the placement rates for elementary programmes was 91 per cent.</P>
    <P>Also, An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, FÁS, provides a range of training and retraining for both the employed and the unemployed. Details of courses operated by FÁS are available from FÁS offices throughout the State.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce legislation to recognise the development of the new concept of micro breweries; and if he will consider a staggered excise system in the context of any new legislation relating to micro breweries' potential job creation outside the major centres of employment relative to the craft brewing industry and a small percentage of production to be allocated duty free status in order to develop the tourism potential of the business.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday 9 February 1999, Irish excise duties do not discriminate between large and small breweries and the tax system is not a source of competitive distortion.</P>
      <P>Under Article 4.1 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC, member states may apply reduced rates of duty, which may be differentiated in accordance with the annual production of the breweries concerned, to beer brewed by independent small breweries within the following limits: the reduced rates shall not be applied to undertakings producing more than 200,000 hectolitres of beer per year; the reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, shall not be set more than 50 per cent below the standard national rate of excise duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> A few member states with traditional small artisan brewing sectors avail of this provision.</P>
    <P>Any proposed low or staggered regime would also have to apply to imports of beer produced in small breweries in other member states in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.3 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC.</P>
    <P>Beer excise duty is a specific tax which does not increase in relation to the value of the product. Thus a higher priced premium craft beer bears the same amount of duty as a mass produced product of the same strength and, accordingly, a lower tax share of price than that of a mass produced product. The share of price represented by total tax, including VAT, has declined from 37.6 per cent in 1994 to 35.6 per cent in 1998.</P>
    <P>At present there are 13 micro breweries approved by the Revenue Commissioners. With regard to the potential for job creation within this industry, I believe that the overall package of measures announced in my recent budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the brewing industry.</P>
    <P>While I have no plans to introduce a zero, a low or a staggered system of excise duty on beer, I will keep the matter under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>Tables setting out the numbers serving in the relevant grades, by Department, are attached at appendices 1-3. The criteria for the appointment to these higher level grades is as follows:&ndash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Principal (higher) and Assistant Principal (higher)</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The principal (higher) and assistant principal (higher) grades are separate grades from the standard grades of the same name. Posts are graded at the higher levels where management deems that the scope and quality of the duties and responsibilities involved are greater than applies in the case of the standard grades.</P>
      <P>Appointment to the higher grades is by way of promotion either within the Departments which have these grades or from an inter-departmental competition. Promotion is on the basis of the best qualified candidate from among those eligible.</P>
      <P>Assistant principals (standard), administrative officers (standard and higher scale) and higher executive officers (standard and higher scale) are eligible for promotion to assistant principal (higher). Administrative officers and higher executive officers are required to have four years service to be eligible for such promotion. Principals (standard) and assistant principals (standard and higher) and, in the case of inter-departmental competitions, certain other comparable grades, may be eligible for promotion to principal (higher).</P>
      <P>
        <i>Higher Executive Officer</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Under the PCW restructuring agreement for grades represented by the Public Service Executive Union, a new higher scale applies to 30 per cent of the higher executive officers in each Department. The criteria for assignment to the higher scale is determined by the Head of each Department following consultation with local staff interests. The officers concerned must be satisfactory from the point of view of the performance of the duties of the grade, general conduct and sick leave. The requirements of a scheme of appraisal-performance review must be met where such a scheme is in operation. Of the initial assignments to the higher scale following the restructuring agreement in 1995, 50 per cent were on the basis of seniority subject to satisfactory performance and the remainder on the basis already outlined.</P>

      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database, which was launched in 1997, includes information on the needs of all persons with a mental handicap including persons with autism although the specific disability is not included. As part of the implementation of the recommendations of a policy document on services to persons with autism which was published by my Department in 1994, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the needs of persons with autism in their regions and, in particular, on those who require or will require specialist services. This information is not, however, readily available to my Department and I have asked the health boards to forward information on the number of persons with autism in their regions which I will, in turn, forward to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Due to problems with definition, the exact prevalence of autism in Ireland is still open to debate. Depending on the diagnostic criteria being applied, up to five per 10,000 children manifest autism to a marked degree. The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one i.e. it is based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation. Hence the concept of an &ldquo;autistic spectrum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability. The officially recognised classification systems are those of DSM IV and ICD 10.</P>
      <P>There is increasing recognition of the condition of autism in this country. Whether this is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertainment or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism has not yet been determined.</P>

      <P>In July, 1993 the Department of Health wrote to Wellcome (Ireland) Ltd., requesting information regarding batch 3741 of Trivax vaccine. The company's response indicated that the batch was produced around March, 1968 and that it did not have distribution records available which would show where the vaccine was distributed. Also in July, 1993 the Department wrote to the health boards in an effort to ascertain the extent to which vaccine from batch 3741 had been used in Ireland. The boards did not succeed in tracing any information in this regard. In November 1997, following further consideration of the matter, my Department wrote to Glaxo Wellcome, seeking information on the lots produced from batch 3741. An initial response was received from the company in December 1997 and additional information was received in March 1998. It was on the basis of this information that my Department wrote to the health boards asking them to undertake a further examination of their records.</P>
      <P>My Department is still in contact with the company about some issues concerning batch 3741 and has recently also requested information regarding the vaccine batches referred to by the Deputy, as it had no previous information in this regard.</P>

It is understood that the examination cannot be finalised until the results of blood-tests have been furnished by the State Laboratory. When the report of the post-mortem becomes available, it will have to be decided if the death should be referred to the coroner or alternatively, if the death should be registered on the signature of a qualified informant and on the production of a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a medical practitioner. If the death is referred to the coroner and he determines that an inquest is necessary, the registrar must await the issue of a coroner's certificate before registering the death. If the coroner decides that an inquest is not required he will so advise the registrar and in these circumstances the death may be registered on foot of a medical certificate of cause of death.</P>

      <P>Dental treatment services for children are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The plan provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to children after they leave national school up to 16 years of age on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>In the initial phase of the plan eligibility for dental services has already been extended to children up to their fourteenth birthday. I propose to extend entitlement up to 16 years of age later this year.</P>
      <P>The provision of dental services to eligible persons in the Belmullet area is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I have had inquires made of the Western Health Board. I am advised by the board that there are three posts vacant on the dental staff in the Mayo community care area i.e. Castlebar, Swinford and Belmullet. Competitions for these posts were advertised in both Ireland and the UK in late 1998 but unfortunately the board received no applications.</P>
      <P>The board is preparing to place further advertisements which it hopes will prove successful in attracting applicants.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, some health boards can have difficulty in filling dental posts in geographically remote areas. I have asked my Department to explore with the Western Health Board ways in which it might be possible for the board to provide an adequate dental service to children in areas which experience persistant recruitment difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has indicated that there has been a reduction in funding to the agency in question. In fact the agency's allocation in 1999 has been increased by an additional £536,000 in respect of both new and existing services.</P>
      <P>In relation to waiting lists for services to persons with a mental handicap in the County Wicklow area, I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that there are currently 12 persons waitlisted for residential services. Of the 12 persons waitlisted, all avail of regular respite from a new five place respite house developed this year from the additional funding provided to the agency in question and from two respite places which were put in place last year, giving a total of seven full time respite places. There are currently 31 persons waitlisted for day services in the County Wicklow area. Nine of these will receive day services from the agency in question from within the increased allocation and four other clients are in day services with another agency. This leaves 18 persons who are awaiting placement in day services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 271 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Unlike the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parent's means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>
      <P>As medical cards are granted based, in general, on means rather than medical condition health boards do not hold information on the number of medical card holders with particular illnesses.</P>

      <P>A programme of investment in the ambulance service has been under way since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambul<Col N="928" /> ance service in 1993 with in excess of £18 million having been invested in the ambulance service nationally since 1993. In this context, the Eastern Health Board has been pursuing a range of improvements to the ambulance service, including  improved training, upgrading of the ambulance fleet and the development of a new command and control centre in partnership with Dublin Fire Brigade. A national standard of training as laid out by the National Ambulance Advisory Council is being implemented in respect of all providers of pre-hospital care, including those employed by Dublin Fire Brigade.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has a formal arrangement with Dublin Corporation for the provision of an ambulance service by Dublin Fire Brigade within the Dublin metropolitan area. The number of ambulance normally rostered for duty by the Eastern Health Board is 38 and by the Dublin Fire Brigade is 11. The funding provided to the Eastern Health Board by my Department for the development of the ambulance service from 1996 to 1999 is:</P>

    <P>This funding has been provided to the health board for the implementation of the review group's recommendations with regard to ambulance services in the board's area, including that provided on its behalf by Dublin Fire Brigade.

    <P>In 1999 my Department will be placing very strong emphasis on the need for agencies to reach <Col N="930" /> their targets of treating adults within twelve months and children with six months of being placed on the waiting list.

    <P>Since coming into office I have increased the funding available to the waiting list initiative from the £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997 to £12 million in 1998 which represents an increase of 50 per cent over the  1997 funding and to £20 million in 1999 which represents an overall increase of 150 per cent.</P>

The information requested by the Deputy is not currently collected at consultant level.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently awaiting waiting list returns in respect of quarter ended 31 December from a number of agencies. I expect that the up to date national return will be validated and available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999 my Department will be placing very strong emphasis on the need for agencies to reach <Col N="932" /> their targets of treating adults within twelve months and children within six months of being placed on the waiting list and has regularly pointed out that the length of time that patients must await surgery is significantly more important than the absolute numbers on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have increased the funding available for the waiting list initiative from the £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997 to £12 million in 1998 &ndash; which represents an increase of 50 per cent over the 1997 funding &ndash; and to £20 million in 1999, which represents an overall increase of 150 per cent since 1997.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 77 of 18 November 1998, a design team has been appointed for the provision of additional cardiac theatres and associate facilities; if not, when it will be appointed; when it will complete its work; and when the theatres will be available to carry out cardiac surgery.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>As at 31 December 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, the number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, was 73. This compares with a figure of 97 who were awaiting cardiac surgery at the 31 December 1997 and represents a reduction of almost 25 per cent on that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> The ages of children awaiting cardiac surgery ranges from under one year to 16 years of age. One of the patients who was on the cardiac surgery waiting list in 1998 died before surgery was performed while 22 patients who had surgery performed up to and including 1998 died in 1998.</P>
    <P>As part of the cardiac waiting list initiative there were 18 patients transferred for surgery in 1997 to the United Kingdom while a further 30 patients were transferred in 1998. The purchase of additional cardiac procedures from the United Kingdom will continue in 1999 with an expected further 30 patients to be transferred.</P>
    <P>With regard to theatre development and the hospital, which will cost in the region of £20 million, I am pleased to report that the procedures for the appointment of the design team for the development is at a very advanced stage. I confidently expect to be in a position to give approval for the appointment of the design team within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The timing of the commencement and completion of planning and construction for the development will depend on several variable factors which are difficult to assess accurately in advance and it is not possible for me, therefore to give a precise timetable for the project at this time.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. A number of income sources are specifically excluded when assessing an applicant's income. These include <Col N="934" /> the carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance, mobility allowance, foster care allowance, back to work allowance and weekly payments under the community employment programme.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to children with autism in the midland area is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Midland Health Board. Special psychological services for children are provided by the Sisters of Chairty of Jesus and Mary, on behalf of the board.</P>
      <P>Psychological services to children up to four years of age, including children in Westmeath, are provided by the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, in conjunction with the Midland Health Board's early childhood services team, comprising a psychologist, area medical officer, speech and language therapist and counselling nurse.</P>
      <P>Children with autism who also have a mental handicap and who attend special schools, including St. Hilda's Athlone; St. Mary's, Delvin and St. Brigid's, Mullingar are seen by the Sisters of Charity Psychological Services. Children with autism only are seen by the board's child psychiatric team.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine educational psychological assessments for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science. The Minister for Education and Science is establishing a national educational psychological service to provide services for all primary and secondary schools. Fifteen additional psychologists were appointed last year. The development of this service will also assist the health funded psychological services to focus more closely the resources available to them on the areas of assessment and therapeutic treatment.</P>
      <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with the needs identified in the &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; 1997-2001&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of this additional funding, £730,000 has been allocated to the Midland Health Board, with a full year cost of £1,075,000 in 2000. The current year's figure includes £50,000 which has been specifically allocated for the provision of health related services, including psychological services, to children with autism, with a full year cost of £150,000 in 2000. Details of the precise services <Col N="935" /> to be put in place in the midland region from this additional funding and the individuals who will benefit from these services are being agreed by the board's regional co-ordinating committee.</P>

      <Quest>the initiatives, if any, his Department has taken since 1995 to promote a reduction in smoking habits; the cost of these initiatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department works closely with a wide variety of statutory and voluntary groups to ensure that people have the information and support to make healthy lifestyle choices. The unit has been involved in a number of initiatives since 1995 to increase the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with smoking. Included among these were a number of national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
      <P>During the period 1993-1995 the &ldquo;I'm One Less&rdquo; anti-smoking campaign was in operation. This was a multi-media campaign involving television, radio and outdoor advertising aimed largely at young people. It was directed at encouraging the friends, relatives and peers of smokers to adopt a positive and supportive role in helping them to stop smoking. The total spend over the course of this campaign was over £600,000.</P>
      <P>During the period 1995-1997 the &ldquo;Say what you like &ndash; smoking kills&rdquo; campaign was in operation and the overall spend on the campaign was in excess of £700,000 during that period. The campaign used television, radio, outdoor and print advertising.</P>
      <P>The most recent anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; was launched in December 1998. This campaign takes a slightly different approach than previous campaigns by emphasising the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. The campaign continues, by means of a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for people wishing to quit smoking. This is operated in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and offers support in the form of an advice kit. The budget involved will be of the order of £500,000 for the first &ldquo;burst&rdquo; of this campaign.</P>
      <P>A further £100,000 was made available in 1998 to fund a GP training initiative. This involves day release training for GPs in smoking cessation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A voluntary code on smoking in the workplace was developed by the Health Promotion Unit with the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Health and Safety Authority. The code is included in a booklet <Col N="936" /> entitled, &ldquo;Working Together for Cleaner Air&rdquo; and was distributed to over 5,000 companies, state, and semi-state institutions in late 1994. This code encourages a consensual approach to smoking control policies through a consultation process between staff and management interests.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department also co-ordinates two schools programmes which seek to prevent young people taking up smoking in the first instance. The Smoking Reduction Action Programme (SCRAP) is a peer-led anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science. The cost involved in the development of this programme was in the region of £45,000. The second schools programme, the &ldquo;Smoke-busters&rdquo; project, is aimed at primary school children (seven-11 years) in an urban environment and was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Eastern Health Board. The cost involved in the development of this programme was in the region of £70,000.</P>
    <P>Action against smoking also continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector. The Health Promotion Unit, in association with voluntary agencies active in this area, produces a range of materials including leaflets and posters containing information on smoking and encouraging smokers to quit.</P>
    <P>In addition to the health promotion measures outlined above new regulations, operative from February 1996, were put in place to help protect people from the harmful effects of passive smoking. The Tobacco Health Promotion and Protection Regulations 1995 prohibit and restrict smoking in a wide range of public areas and facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition I established a smoke free policy group in 1997 to review all aspects of health and tobacco policy. The group is chaired by a senior civil servant in my Department and the areas being looked at by the group include smoking in the workplace, protection from passive smoking and prevention of children taking up smoking. The group will be reporting to me shortly.</P>
    <P>I am allocating a sum of £180,000 to the health boards in 1999 as part of my commitment to promoting a smoke free society. This money will be used to foster integration of smoke free policies into health board service plans and to improve compliance with tobacco laws.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the establishment of a tobacco information resource and research centre and have allocated a sum of £50,000 to ASH Ireland to initiate the project in 1999.</P>
    <P>Also as part of the smoke free initiative a diploma course in tobacco and health studies is being developed. A grant of £20,000 is being made to the Department of Community Health and Medicine at Trinity College, Dublin to initiate the diploma course in the academic year 1999-2000.</P>

      <P>A preliminary report for the scheme has recently been received in my Department but has not been approved. As the scheme is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme it comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. The circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority list will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next national development plan 2000-2006. In the meanwhile the scheme will be considered, along with all other competing proposals, under the rural towns and villages initiative, details of which will be announced  shortly.</P>

      <P>Group water scheme grants of up to £1,600 per house and £1,200 per farm are available from the local authority towards the cost of constructing or upgrading group water schemes. All necessary works, including the provisions of tanks and reservoir, are eligible for grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities may, under the small schemes programme, provide headworks including reservoirs, on public water supply networks to facilitate group scheme development. Local authorities may also undertake certain works, including the upgrading or provision of new reservoirs, in order to facilitate the taking in charge of a group scheme by the local authority. Under the operational programme for environmental services 1994-99, European Regional Development Fund cofinancing of around £10 million is being provided to assist in the development of <Col N="941" /> certain high cost, large scale group water schemes where upsized headworks or trunk mains are needed to cater for downstream demand.</P>

      <P>Save in the case of a refusal on a planning application, planning application files held by a planning authority must be made readily available for inspection to the general public for five years after the decision has been made. The planning application and any submissions made in respect of the application must also be available for inspection while the application is being considered by the planning authority. Internal planning authority reports are not required to be made available for inspection until after the application has been determined. This restriction on internal reports is to protect the deliberative process within the planning authority.</P>
      <P>Where an application has been refused the file must be made available for inspection for one month after the decision. However, planning authorities would generally facilitate access after that period. My Department has also requested by circular letter that planning authorities should make available to the public copies of documents held on a planning application file (other than plans, drawings or photographs).</P>
      <P>The above provisions are of general application and there are no special provisions in the planning code regarding rights of inspection in respect of Oireachtas Members or other public representatives.</P>

      <P>The information requested is set out in the following table. Of the 1965 people awaiting test, 620 have been given appointments and a further 257 are not currently available to be tested. The national average waiting period for a driving test is now some 27 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons, are being given earlier appointments. At present some 30 per cent of applicants are being tested within 15 weeks. As indicated in my reply to Question No. 672 of the 27 January 1999 my Department is responding to this unsatisfactory situation by increasing the numbers and productivity of its testers. Saturday testing has been in place for some time and a further package of productivity measures has also been implemented. The service is also being aug<Col N="945" /> mented by the appointment of new testers on both a permanent and contract basis.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to those former community employment workers who revert to the Live Register after completing a period on a CE scheme, and who, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance. As a consequence, they lose entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>This issue arises as a direct consequence of the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996. The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers in so far as social insurance entitlements are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit. Persons entitled to a reduced, or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is <Col N="946" /> not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I have explained to the House on many occasions that I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients. Any such concessions could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support in the event of certain contingencies. As such, there is no general provision for a person to receive, concurrently, payment under two separate schemes.</P>
      <P>However, an exception to this rule is made in relation to recipients of the widow(er)s pension and one parent family payment, who are under 66 years of age and in employment, as they may receive half-rate disability benefit where they are certified as being medically unfit for work, and the relevant contribution conditions are satisfied.</P>
      <P>Under this arrangement, which is designed to take account of the special circumstances of widow(er)s and single parents, payment of disability benefit at half-rate can be paid for a maximum of 15 months.</P>
      <P>There are, at present, some 1,100 recipients of widow(er)s' and one parent family payments in receipt of half-rate disability benefit. It is estimated that extending the full rate of payment to this group, would cost £2 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the current arrangements for payment of disability benefit in addition to widow(er)s pension and one-parent family payment, are reasonable. I am also satisfied that both widow(er)s and other single parents are treated equally under those arrangements, and consequently, I do not propose to make any changes in this area.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase the amount of free fuel allowance payable to recipients who are aged 70 years or older in view of the greater need which older citizens have for heat; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks yearly.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week is payable during the heating season to fuel recipients in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Arklow, Dundalk and Drogheda to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in those centres.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the National Fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last 5 years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £45 million in 1998. This year a sum of £47 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme. It is estimated that increasing the basic allowance by £1 per week for those aged 70 years and over would cost an additional £2.5 million per year. Any increase in the rate of payment could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. With regard to the payment rate, the group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week effective from June 1999 were announced in the budget last December. All fuel allowance recipients who are aged 70 years or more will receive an increase of £6 per week if single, £9 per week in the case of couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group also recommended that the amount <Col N="948" /> of income which a contributory pensioner can have over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance should be increased from £15 per week to £30 per week. This recommendation is being implemented from the commencement of the next heating season in October 1999.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the Community Welfare Officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>These facilities under the SWA scheme are already in place and provide an appropriate mechanism to meet the needs of those who are experiencing financial difficulties due to exceptional heating needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Invalidity pension is a contributory social insurance payment for people who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The current weekly rates of invalidity pension are in excess of the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, ranging between 103 per cent in the case of claimants aged under 65 years and 118 per cent in the case of claimants aged 65 and over. The recent budget provides for a £3 per week increase, 4.2 per cent for some 43,100 invalidity pensioners aged under 65 and £6 per week increase 7.2 per cent for a further 2,000 invalidity pensioners aged 65 and over, from the beginning of June, 1999. On the basis of expected inflation of 2 per cent in 1999, these increases represent real increases of 2.2 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively. The qualified adult allowance is also being increased by £3 a week for all invalidity pensioners. Following the implementation of these budget increases, the weekly rates of invalidity pension will range between 105 per cent and 124 per cent of the CSW target rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the weekly pension, the needs of invalidity pensioners are also met through the provision of a range of additional benefits, including the medical card, rent and mortgage sup<Col N="949" /> plements, the free travel pass, free electricity allowance, free television licence, free telephone rental allowance, fuel allowance etc.</P>
    <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including increases for invalidity pensioners, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in Ireland, aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes, such as free electricity allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. In addition, widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement. The free telephone rental allowance will be extended to all recipients of carer's allowance from August 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and <Col N="952" /> required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 5 December 1995 as a result of an injury to his elbow. His claim was disallowed from 8 January 1998 following an examination by a medical assessor of the Department who considered that he was capable of work. He appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and he was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>Following an oral hearing of his appeal an appeals officer determined that the person concerned was not incapable of work. The appeals officer noted that although the person's condition might prevent him from resuming his former occupation, he is not incapable of work within the meaning of social welfare legislation and had, in fact, worked for some months following the injury on light duties with his former employer.</P>
      <P>Arising from representations from the Deputy, a further examination by a medical assessor was held on 25 January 1999. The person was again found capable and the appeals officer confirmed that there are no new facts or evidence as to warrant a revision of his decision.</P>

Projects in the programme are funded on a three year basis, which is renewable subject to satisfactory performance of the agreed workplan and the continued existence of an effective and appropriate management structure for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of 1998, it became apparent that there are serious internal difficulties in the <Col N="953" /> project, which have had a detrimental effect on its work. Officials of my Department met the management committee on 13 November 1998 and made it clear that these difficulties had to be addressed and resolved by the management committee before a further three year funding commitment could be given to the project. The Department indicated that favourable consideration could be given to making interim funding available for a limited period to allow an independent review of the project to be completed. Draft terms of reference for the review were received from the project on 4 February 1999 and are being examined at present in consultation with the Community Development Programme Support Agency for the North-Western Region. The Department will be in touch with the project in that regard as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures available for child poverty in Europe &ndash; a child being defined as less than 16 years of age &ndash; were published by EUROSTAT in May 1997. It was a paper based on data drawn from the European Community Household Panel which found that, in 1993, 28 per cent of children in Ireland lived in households with income less that 50 per cent of average household income. This equated to 322,000 children. The survey used country-specific poverty lines and these are not comparable across member states. It is not possible to give a current figure for the number of Irish children living in poverty until awaited ESRI data on poverty trends in the period 1994-97 become available later this year.</P>
      <P>The incidence of child poverty is a major concern of this Government and recent budget measures, along with targeted policy initiatives, have sought to ensure that our children are protected and are given the opportunities to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty.</P>
      <P>Child income support plays a major role in reducing and preventing child poverty and there is widespread agreement that child benefit is an effective mechanism in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent budget, child benefit was increased by £3 per month to £34.50 for each of the first two children and by £4 per month to £46 for the third and all subsequent children. Some 513,000 families with a total of 1.2 million chil<Col N="954" /> dren will benefit from these increases. The full year cost of these increases is £40.76 million. The total projected spend on child benefit in 1999 is £447.5 million.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement is designed to provide income support for low-wage employees with children. The payment is also available to single parents. The 1998 budget provided for the calculation of FIS on a net rather than gross income basis which significantly increased the supplements payable under the scheme. In addition, from June 1999, the weekly income thresholds for FIS will be increased by £8 which will result in a gain of £4.80 per week for many of the 13,000 families on FIS.</P>
    <P>Research has shown repeatedly that unemployment is a key factor in producing poor households and this includes households containing children. Unemployment has fallen substantially in recent years, standing at an estimated 7.4 per cent for 1998, down from 15.7 per cent in 1993, demonstrating the significant progress already made towards the National Anti-Poverty Strategy's target rate of 6 per cent by 2007 and the employment action plan target of 7 per cent by end-year 2000. Considerable progress has also been made on long-term unemployment which stood at 3.9 per cent for the period March to May 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, with the NAPS target of 3.5 per cent almost achieved.</P>
    <P>Under the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, a system of poverty proofing has also been introduced on a one-year pilot basis across Government Departments. This system ensures that the needs of the poor and socially excluded are considered as policy is being designed. Children, particularly those living in large families, are identified as one of the groups at particular risk of poverty and are thus given particular attention in this process.</P>
    <P>There are several relevant reports out this year. These include the publication of an ESRI report on trends in poverty between 1994 and 1997, expected around Easter, as well as research on child poverty being conducted by the ESRI on behalf of the Combat Poverty Agency, due to be completed in mid-1999. These publications, as well as other research, will help to inform policy in this area, thereby ensuring that this Government's commitment to meeting the needs of the disadvantaged in our society will continue to be achieved.</P>

      <P>Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 recognises the value of habitats <Col N="955" /> such as hedgerows for nesting birds and provides protection against cutting, grubbing, burning and destruction of vegetation on uncultivated land during the critical nesting period of 15 April to 31 August. In addition, regulations transposing the habitats directive into Irish law restrict damaging hedgerow destruction in special areas of conservation. The rural environment protection scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, also promotes the conservation and maintenance of existing features that make up farmland habitat such as hedgerows. Certain sections of the planning Acts contain specific provisions in relation to planting and protection of trees in urban areas and the Forestry Act, 1946, places restrictions on cutting down or injuring trees outside of urban areas.</P>
      <P>While local authorities are exempt from the section 40 provisions, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, requests local authorities for their continued co-operation in ensuring that hedge cutting operations, as far as possible, are undertaken outside the critical bird nesting period. In general terms, the response to such appeals has been positive. However, I do accept that there has been some public disquiet over the past number of years in relation to this matter. It is my intention to bring forward, under the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, stronger protective provisions in relation to the destruction of hedgerows etc. during the prohibited period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 to 307, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licences are issued by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, under section 23 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, to facilitate an ongoing <Col N="956" /> research programme by the Department of Agriculture and Food in relation to bovine tuberculosis in cattle and badgers. The provisional figure for the number of badgers snared under licence by the Department of Agriculture and Food in 1998 is 2,475. There are no definitive figures available for the number of lactating sows included in this figure but recent sample surveys undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and Food indicate the figure is less than 10 per cent of the total number of females snares. Most of these lacating females were snared at the end of the lactation period in April or May. The number of licences issued in respect of Counties Cork, Kilkenny and Monaghan in 1998 is 38, 26 and seven respectively.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to predict the number of badgers to be snared in the future under the Department of Agriculture and Food's research programme and I have no plans at present for the introduction of alternatives to snaring badgers. However, the research programme by the Department of Agriculture and Food is subject to review on an annual basis by officials of both Departments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as Minister, my prime responsibility in this area relates to wildlife conservation and I have no function in animal welfare. In this context, I have sought to balance the clearly established need for further scientific research for the purposes of the TB eradication programme with my statutory responsibilities for the protection of the badger under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Recent extensive research funded by Dúchas and the Department of Agriculture and Food estimated a national badger population of 200,000. I am satisfied that the current research programme will have little effect on the national population and poses no threat to the conservation of this species. This is not to ignore the unpalatable fact that badgers will be killed in the course of ongoing scientific research. However, on balance, I am of the view that the needs and benefits of the current research programme, both for the cattle and badger populations, in relation to our understanding of TB and the mechanics involved in its transmission among and between species must outweigh the limited casualties among the badger population. I understand that this research programme also provides for development work on a vaccine for badgers which will, if successful, ultimately provide considerable dividends for the badger population in its own right, which is also subject to tuberculosis.</P>

Dolphins are a protected species and receive protection under the Wildlife Act, 1976.

      <P>The last nationally relevant survey on otters was undertaken in 1989-92 by Lunnon and Reynolds of Dublin University but included no estimate of the national otter population. This is largely due to the difficulty in determining otter density because of the variety of their habitat and the lack of correlation between spraints, the principal method of determining otter presence, and their numbers. However, otter density is estimated to vary from circa. 1 per 1KM of coastline in parts of the west coast of Ireland to 1 per 2KM along water courses, large streams and rivers. Otters are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, but there is no specific national monitoring or sighting survey in place. Otters are widespread throughout Ireland and there are no indications of any obvious negative pressure on their current national conservation status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 337, 343 and 345 together.</P>
      <P>The expert group on the probation and welfare service in its first report, published on 2 November, 1998 made a number of recommendations as follows:&ndash;</P>
      <P>1.An increase in staff numbers and that staff recruitment be streamlined.</P>
      <P>2.That the service needs to develop a PR strategy.</P>
      <P>3.An up-to-date IT system must be established.</P>
      <P>4.A staff training analysis be carried out.</P>
      <P>5.Comprehensive research facilities should be available within the service.</P>
      <P>6.Insurance cover regulations for community service projects be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> In relation to staffing matters, there are 15 vacancies in the basic grade of permanent probation and welfare officer and the Civil Service Commission is currently recruiting staff to enable these posts to be filled in the first half of 1999. As regards the additional 65 probation and welfare officers and the ten other senior staff and clerical support staff recommended in the expert group's report, my Department is considering the recommendation made by the expert group, in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The group is continuing its work and I am awaiting the group's second report.</P>
    <P>In relation to providing a comprehensive public information and awareness programme I am sure the Deputy will agree that much of the excellent work done by the probation and welfare service goes unnoticed and I will be looking at how best a public relations initiative can be progressed to promote knowledge about the current and future development for the service.</P>
    <P>As regards an IT package for the service, it has been possible to make progress by putting in place local area networks in the probation and welfare offices. These are being installed at present and a considerable amount of computer hardware has been purchased. I hope that by the end of 1999 there will be a comprehensive information technology system in place. My Department will also be implementing a comprehensive training programme for the new IT system and will take into account other additional training needs as they arise.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service has a small research unit and when the extra staff and the improved IT system are in place this will allow for the development of more detailed statistics and data.</P>
    <P>As regards community service projects and related insurance issues, I will examine this whole area with a view to providing easier and more cost effective insurance cover for people doing community service work.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is financing two research projects as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)The evaluation of the operation of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, which is currently being carried out under the auspices of the Centre for Criminal Justice under the direct management and supervision of the Director of the Centre, Professor Dermot Walsh, University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>(b)A study on public attitudes regarding the treatment of offenders in the community as part of an ongoing research programme into various aspects of the criminal justice system was recently carried out by the research and evaluation services. The study will form part of the Irish Social Omnibus Survey and was carried out on 1,000 members of the public. My Department is awaiting this report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Finally, as regards whether this type of service is more cost effective to the taxpayer than detention, I am fully committed to the development of community sanctions and measures as an alternative to custody and as a means of combating crime. My Department's probation and welfare service has a significant role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of any sanction or sentence imposed by the courts must be the criteria for assessing costs. Custody facilities are by their very nature labour intensive and more costly to manage. It is recognised that community sanctions are cost effective.</P>
    <P>However, there are other factors which must be taken into account in measuring cost effectiveness, such as assessment of risk to the community at the sentencing stage and the management of risk; the concerns and the protection of the community and the reduction in opportunity for re-offending.</P>
    <P>Measuring the outcome of cases is an important criteria. International research shows that the probation services are achieving value for money. The probation and welfare service of my Department is no different.</P>

The programme has already commenced and it is expected that these particular systems will be deployed across the prison service by late 1999 or early 2000.

      <P>I have already informed the House, on a number of occasions, that a review of the licensing laws is currently taking place in my Department and that it is my intention to bring forward the Heads of a Bill for the Government's consideration at the earliest possible opportunity this year. The details of the legislative proposals will be announced in the usual way following their consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>The review has taken account of the report on liquor licensing laws by the Sub-Committee on Legislation and Security of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, the interim report of the Competition Authority, and the many submissions which have been received in response to the invitation, by way of advertisements placed by my Department in the national and local press in the week of 4 August 1998, for comments on our licensing laws. I can  confirm that changes in the trading hours of licensed premises will be among the proposals which I intend to bring before the Government.</P>

      <P>I should say by way of background that during the September to December period in 1998, there were approximately 100 incidents reported to the Garda where suspicious approaches were made to children. About half of these occurred in the Dublin region. I understand from An Garda Síochána that the National <Col N="971" /> Bureau of Criminal Investigation is co-ordinating all incidents of suspicious approaches made to children.</P>
      <P>I should, at this stage, point out that the classification of such incidents in the statistics depends on the outcome of each investigation, and the determination of whether a crime was committed at all in some of these cases or whether there was the intent to commit a crime has to be established. All reports, as I have said, are being taken seriously and being fully investigated by the Garda.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's specific question I am informed by the Garda authorities that there was an attempted abduction of a child in 1998 and that it occurred in County Waterford. I am further informed that a person was subsequently charged under section 2 and section 17 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, and that the matter is presently before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 358 together.</P>
      <P>The constitutional and legal rights of students to attend schools without attending classes in religious instruction is beyond doubt. Article 44.2.4 of the Constitution provides, among other provisions, that legislation providing for State aid for schools shall not affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school. This provision is supported by other constitutional provisions, notably Article 42 relating to the primary role of parents as the educators of their children and their rights in respect of any violation of their conscience.</P>
      <P>These constitutional guarantees are supported by statutory provisions enacted both before and after the adoption of the Constitution. Section 7 of the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1878, provides for the withholding of State funding from schools where pupils receive religious instruction which has not been sanctioned by the parents or guardians of a pupil. This provision is given a modern restatement and support in the Education Act, 1998. Section 15 of the Act requires school management authorities to have regard to the principles and requirements of a democratic society and have respect and promote respect for the diversity of values, beliefs, traditions, languages and ways of life in society. In addition, section 30(2)(e) provides that the Minister for Education and Science, in prescribing the curriculum for schools shall not require a student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of his or her parent or of the student where he or she is 18 or over. Both of these provisions will come into effect in the near future when I make a commencement order in respect of the sections in which they are included, after necessary planning and consultation has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in law therefore is quite clear and as far as my Department is concerned so is the position in practice. The teaching of religion in <Col N="974" /> schools must be conducted in a manner, which allows children, who do not wish to attend religious instruction, to avail themselves of an otherwise full education without exposure to religious instruction. The precise arrangements to be made are a matter for the individual school and my Department will advise and, as far as practicable, assist any school which experiences any difficulties. My Department will also inquire into any case where it is alleged that the school's responsibilities in this matter are not being fulfilled.</P>

      <P>The veterinary faculty at the National University of Ireland, Dublin, University College Dublin is the only veterinary faculty on the island. The Higher Education Authority authorises UCD to admit 65 Irish students to the faculty each year. This intake has always included a quota of students from Northern Ireland, which was fixed at ten in the mid 1980s. Since 1990-91 UCD has been authorised to admit up to ten overseas students, usually American, on an economic fee paying basis and on the understanding that the students return to their own countries following graduation. Accordingly, these places could not be offered to Irish students willing to pay the full economic rate, which indeed would be impractical and inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is the statutory body that advises my Department on the demand for third level places. The authority is satisfied that the current intake represents the national requirements for this profession. The annual survey of the first destination of award <Col N="976" /> recipients in higher education, which is published by the Higher Education Authority, supports this.</P>
    <P>The normal transfer regulations would apply to students wishing to complete their studies in Ireland. This means they would have to meet the normal matriculation requirements and if successful in gaining admission would then apply to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine for consideration for exemption(s). I understand the student in question did not receive sufficient points to be offered a place on the course. I further understand that no waiting list exists.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department does not have figures of the number of Irish citizens studying veterinary medicine abroad.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third level course. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand that similar residency requirements operate in the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The removal of this residency condition for Irish nationals would have to apply to EU nationals generally and could have significant resource implications for the Exchequer.

      <P>EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of a local authority from 1 October of the year prior to going to college may apply for assistance under the higher education grants scheme. In this regard, EU nationals who do not satisfy the residency requirement under the free fees initiative may apply to have their fees paid if they satisfy the residency requirement of one year in an EU member state and the means test under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The loading on school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the Road Traffic Regulations (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) which are laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Under PSV &ndash; Public Service Vehicle &ndash; regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats.</P>
      <P>Legislation regarding the fitting and use of seat belts in public vehicles is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Under existing regulations passenger seat belts are not compulsory in buses, including those operated under the school transport scheme. However, under the Government's strategy for road safety, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in consultation with my Department, is committed to developing a strategy for safety on school transport. In this context, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to consider the wide range of safety issues associated with the operation of the school transport scheme, including the matter of seat belts, and to assess the operational and financial implications of these proposals.</P>

      <P>The special class attended by the pupil in question was established in September 1998. I understand that the delay in putting the necessary transport service in place arose because of unexpected fluctuations in the number of children availing of the special class. A special transport service was sanctioned by my Department in December 1998 on the basis of the number of children then proposed for enrolment in the class. However, a number of the children in question subsequently withdrew from the class and the transport arrangement intended was no longer workable.</P>

      <P>In my reply to a question from the Deputy on this issue in the Adjournment Debate on 3 March 1998, I assured him that the use of educationally-linked promotional activity which involved the exploitation of schools, their pupils and parents by companies with commercial motives cannot be condoned under any circumstances. I also drew the Deputy's attention to three official circulars, Nos. 23/84, 7/87, 38/91, issued by my Department to the management authorities of first and second level schools concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools. I continue to recognise the sensitivities attaching to the issue of <Col N="987" /> particular promotional initiatives linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activities. I am satisfied, however, that school authorities are adequately guided by the official circulars and are aware of the need to guard against situations arising which could result in parents being put under undue pressure to purchase particular commercial products. In my view, therefore, appropriate guidelines already exist which require due awareness and vigilance on the part of school authorities in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy states, 19 schools in the south of County Kildare now have access to my Department's psychological service, as do six schools in Leixlip. However, I am aware that many primary schools in the country, including many in County Kildare, do not yet have access to my Department's psychological service. One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a National Educational Psychological Service, to be available to all schools at both levels. On Thursday 11 February, in the presence of the Taoiseach, I announced Government approval for the establishment of a national educational psychological service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase. At the end of the five year period, it is envisaged that every school in the country will have access to a schools psychological service.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It is intended that the psychological service will be an integrated service for the primary and second level sectors and, from now on, newly recruited psychologists will be expected to work in both sectors. My Department is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the needs and resources available in all parts of the country, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service.</P>

    <P>I am committed to the promotion of access to third level education, which must deal with tackling disincentives of tradition and support. In particular, colleges must outreach and additional support should be available where it is needed. Between direct funding from my Department and funding through the Higher Education Authority almost £900,000 is spent on this area in the current academic year, and I have recently announced details of a £6.9 million two year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantages in the third level sector. Of this funding £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. A further £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in institutes of technology. Details of the allocation of these additional resources will be announced in due course when I have fully considered how best to proceed in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389, 390 and 391 together.</P>
      <P>A phased programme for payment of additional capitation grants was introduced in 1992 in respect of schools not already in receipt of funding towards the employment of caretakers and secretaries under a scheme initiated in 1978-79. This programme has been expanded in line with undertakings given under PESP and PCW. The current position is that, at primary level, the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more. All secondary schools with 200 or more pupils are eligible for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The programme provides grants which are not directly related to any objective pay scales. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The level and extent of the service provided is a matter for school authorities who, through the discreation afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for caretaking and clerical services as resources permit. As the secretaries and caretakers concerned are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the employer.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the level of grant payable to schools, which I increased by £5 per student in 1997 in respect of the secondary school secretarial grant, will be examined in the budgetary context and in light of available resources. I assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.</P>

The two-year, £57 million plan for a wide range of initiatives specifically targeting educational disadvantage at all levels of education, which I announced on 3 December, represents the largest such programme ever in this country.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404 and 410 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been notified of a number of cases involving children with autism in the County Westmeath area for whom special educational provision has been requested. Until recently, such children were catered for in a number of special schools, including schools for children with mild learning disability and schools for children with emotional or behavioural disorders. However, I recently announced my Department's decision to formally recognise the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this decision, arrangements are being made to establish special dedicated classes to cater for the children in question. Each such class will operate at a special pupil teacher ratio of 6 to 1 and each class will also have the support of a special needs assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> At present, my Department's inspectorate is actively pursuing the establishment of special classes in County Westmeath to cater for children with autism in that area. I expect decisions on these classes will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department received a request in January 1999 for financial assistance towards transport arrangements from one of the families referred to by the Deputy. My Department is examining the matter and the Deputy will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>
      <P>Letters of complaint dated November 1998 were sent to the board of management of the school in Old Leighlin. Copies of these letters were forwarded by the board to my Department for information purposes. Other than the letter regarding transport referred to above, my Department has no record of any letters of complaint in January 1999 regarding this school. I understand that the board of management, in accordance with proper procedures, has investigated complaints against a teacher in this school, and that the outcome to the investigation has been communicated to the parties involved. In the circumstances, there is no basis for a further investigation by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers. I understand that, because of the absence of any suitable school transport service, my Department approved a transport grant of £1,500 to assist the parents of this child with private transport arrangements to the school in Leixlip, County Kildare. However, I also understand that the parents have recently requested the introduction of a special school transport arrangement to convey the child to the school. Given the location of this child's residence, it would be desirable for all concerned if suitable education provision could be made available in County Westmeath to meet his needs. At present, my Department's inspectorate is actively pursuing the establishment of special classes for children with autism in the Westmeath area. I expect decisions on these new classes to be taken shortly. I have requested my Department to seek to accommodate the child in question in any facility which may be established in County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>Safety is of paramount importance to my Department, and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on its behalf. Set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind. It is understood from Bus Éireann that its local inspector recently examined the suitability of the proposed pick-up point. Unfortunately, it was not possible to accede to this request, as it would expose other road users to an unacceptable degree of danger.</P>
