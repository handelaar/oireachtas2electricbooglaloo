      <P>It is with the deepest regret that everyone in the House and people throughout the country learned of the passing of one of our greatest statesmen and sportsmen, Jack Lynch. To many people's minds he will forever be the real Taoiseach. Born in the shadow of the Shandon Bells, he always exuded a special charisma which great sports people have brought to politics and he displayed a unique blend of charm, competence and integrity.</P>
      <P>Jack Lynch was a brilliant student, possessed an excellent temperament and was fired by great courage and stamina. Following his first election in 1948, he served in the House for 34 years until 1981. He initially served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, dealing mainly with the Gaeltacht and what were then called &ldquo;congested locations&rdquo;, a term which has another meaning today. He served as Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1959 to 1965 and moved on to become Minister for Finance. Later he served as Taoiseach, Leader of the Opposition and Taoiseach again. He did an enormous amount of work and was always conscious of his Cork roots. When he was elected Taoiseach in 1966, he returned triumphantly to Glen Rovers in Blackpool to the people he loved so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before his political triumphs, in addition to being a student and being called to the Bar, he served with distinction in the Civil Service, an <Col N="1058" /> experience he enjoyed. He was a legend because of his efforts on the sports field, winning All-Ireland finals in both hurling and football. His success in this area came mainly in hurling, with one exception in 1945 when he won a medal for football. That brought him to prominence nationally, a position he never lost. As we approach the end of the millennium, we recall what he said at the graveside of Christy Ring. If I could slightly twist the words he used on that day I would say: &ldquo;As long as young boys swing the camán for the sheer thrill of the tingle in their fingers of the impact on ash of leather, as long as hurling is played, the story of Jack Lynch will be told and that will be forever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In political terms, for his party, Fianna Fáil, Jack Lynch was an electoral phenomenon from his first election to becoming Taoiseach in 1969 to the astonishing landslide in 1977 when I was honoured to be elected on that high tide of victory. Fianna Fáil is proud of his magnificent contribution to Irish life and we acknowledge the strong leadership he always gave the party. Today I cannot but remember that some of those days were very difficult. There were turbulent times of great emotion at the end of the 1960s and in the early 1970s when he had to take the hardest steps to control and unite the party and deal with many difficulties. He did so, however, with the necessary toughness on the basis of bringing coherence and leadership to the country in order to ensure that democratic principles were upheld. He will always be remembered for that.</P>
    <P>During the difficult period to which I refer, he gave the country stability and confidence and successfully protected democracy. He did so because he was a politician of integrity. He began his political life at a time when the first generation of our nation's leaders were still at the helm. He modelled his public life on their example and moulded it in their company. For Jack Lynch, public life was a life of service dedicated to principles in which he quietly but passionately believed. His conduct in public life is a model to which succeeding generations should aspire and I hope they do so.</P>
    <P>Our special sympathies go to his devoted wife, Máirín. I spoke to her at some length before entering the Chamber and extended to her the sympathies of everyone in the House. She shared, more than most people could, his busy public life and quiet retirement years. She reminded me this morning of the difficulties of the past six years which they endured with a strong, independent spirit and in almost public silence. We thank her for her years of service to the nation with Jack and we express our deep appreciation to her, the members of Jack's family and the members of his great support base in Cork.</P>
    <P>As Taoiseach, Jack Lynch helped to lay the foundations of this country's economic success. As has been acknowledged on many occasions in the House, he also made a great contribution during his tenure as Minister for Education. When this country moved to more prosperous times he <Col N="1059" /> was Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Finance and Taoiseach during the prosperous 1960s. He was responsible for the Third Programme for Economic Development and for the introduction of collective bargaining and negotiations with the social partners which we follow in the successful 1990s. He introduced innovative measures such as school transport. With Paddy Hillery, he played a major role in the ten difficult years of our application to join the European Community and as Taoiseach he brought us into the European Monetary System in December 1979. For these and for so many other things, he will be remembered affectionately by the Irish public as a man of great ability, compelling charm and soft humour. We were privileged to know him and to serve with him. My party and the Irish nation mourn his passing greatly. We thank him for all he did. I thank him, particularly, for what he did for the development of Fianna Fáil. He changed Fianna Fáil's policy on Northern Ireland. He initiated the campaign for unity by agreement and we followed that campaign in making the Good Friday Agreement. This is different from what happened in the past and for that the country will be extremely grateful.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, the Fianna Fáil party and all the people, and on my own behalf, I express our deep sorrow on his passing from us. Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam fíor-uasal agus go gcanfaidh sé i measc na n-aingeal go deo. Ba ghile mear i gcónaí é.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>It is fair to say that Jack Lynch epitomised politics as the service of the public. He was a servant of the people in the truest sense of the word. To those of us who knew him, his most memorable characteristic was the self-effacement he showed in his dealings with other people. He never put himself forward as being better than other people and courtesy in his dealings with friends and opponents alike marked his approach to politics. That courtesy came from an inner confidence and the belief in political standards that epitomised his entire life.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil party will feel his passing very greatly. Jack Lynch epitomised all the great good that is in the Fianna Fáil party. He had a great sense of patriotism and a belief that the nation is greater than the individual. Yet his was a sense of nationhood which did not seek to take advantage of any other group of people. It is no accident that Jack Lynch, more than perhaps anybody else, was responsible for changing attitudes in this State to the problem of Northern Ireland. More than anyone else, he led a majority of the population in this State towards an attitude of respect for Unionists, in place of the antagonism towards that important Irish community which had marked previous generations in all parties to some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jack Lynch showed immense personal courage in dealing with the exceptionally difficult circum<Col N="1060" /> stances of 1970. For any Taoiseach to do what he had to at that time involved a huge personal toll. It is not easy to ask a number of Ministers to depart from office. These were pillars of the party and had given it great service but for particular reasons Jack Lynch felt he had to ask them to leave office, and he was right. It is not easy in any circumstances to ask people to resign from office but Jack Lynch had courage and did not flinch from doing what he believed was necessary in the interests of the peace and security of all the people of this island at that time. Anyone who might have been deceived into thinking that Jack Lynch was merely a kindly person who did not have the inner steel necessary for leadership could not hold to that conclusion after he had shown himself able to take very tough and hard decisions in 1970.</P>
    <P>Clearly he was a man of enormous talent. Seán Lemass probably enjoyed being Minister for Industry and Commerce more than any other job he ever held, including that of Taoiseach. When he came, as Taoiseach, to select another person from all the talent that existed then in the Fianna Fáil party to take on the job that he considered the most important in Government, he chose Jack Lynch. Seán Lemass who was a good judge of character and ability knew he was choosing a very good man for that job. In that capacity and subsequently as Minister for Finance, Jack Lynch was responsible, with Seán Lemass, for bringing forward Ireland's first application for membership of the Common Market, soon to become the European Union.</P>
    <P>Jack Lynch had a great sense of humour. He enjoyed company and social outings. I know from his former colleague in Cork, the late Stephen Barrett, that the two of them used to meet for their favourite tipple after almost every election count. Generally Stephen Barrett had to buy the drinks because Jack Lynch had done somewhat better in the election although there were occasions when Stephen Barrett did a little better than Jack.</P>
    <P>The country was very lucky to have Máirín Lynch working alongside Jack during his period as Taoiseach. I crossed paths with Máirín Lynch only last week and at all times she had a respect for those of us who work in the political arena which Jack served so well. She has an instinctive sympathy with those who put themselves forward in politics and face the &ldquo;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&rdquo; in this House. She knew the hard things that had been said about Jack Lynch and that some of them were said even from these benches. She also knew that people in politics were there to serve and were doing their best. Jack Lynch always did his best and Máirín was, in a sense, a mother to all of us in her dealings with us. She looked kindly on us and was concerned for the welfare not just of politics but also of mere politicians.</P>
    <P>This loss, although expected in some ways, came very suddenly this morning and we have not had time to compose words which would pay suf<Col N="1061" /> ficient tribute to a great Irishman, a great human being and a great servant of the Fianna Fáil Party. I extend the sympathy of Fine Gael to everyone in the Fianna Fáil family on this great loss. Whatever they may have felt on particular occasions in history, this is a personal loss for every member of Fianna Fáil and a very sad day for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I express my sympathy to the Lynch family, particularly Máirín Lynch, and to the Fianna Fáil family, who have lost a giant of a politician and statesman in Jack Lynch. He was first and foremost an extraordinary sportsman, as the Taoiseach said, and a legend in his own lifetime before he entered politics. He learned on the playing field a combination of skills which he brought into the political arena. After a long period of apprenticeship, that resulted in him emerging as one of Ireland's major statesmen in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His courage with Séan Lemass in pursuing entry into the EU will be seen in retrospect as a major historical step. It is extraordinary for the young people who are in the public gallery that we are talking about a man who is mentioned in history books now but who was real for many of us in this House.</P>
      <P>The other part of history that is indelibly marked by his contribution was his extraordinary courage, skill and understanding during a period of enormous turmoil in Ireland after the Troubles erupted in the North in 1969. It is hard for us in the South to understand the passion on the streets of Dublin as the British Embassy was burned. I recall being outside it when that happened. It is hard to contrast the extraordinary relationship that we currently have with our neighbour in London as witnessed by yesterday's visit by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with the raw anger on the streets of Dublin in the early days of the 1970s. Jack Lynch was one of the few people who steered us away from that abyss to the level of understanding, co-operation and mutual respect that Dublin and London have for each other now. Everybody in this House knows that was not easy. This country is a better place alone for the leadership he displayed on that occasion irrespective of political outlook. It was truly a time when a statesmen rose above the loyalty and pride of party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of personal memories of Jack Lynch. I was elected to the House in 1977, against the tide, along with the Taoiseach and some other current Members. Jack Lynch was the real Taoiseach who had been re-elected with a landslide majority of 22 seats and I recall as he walked down the corridor some days after he had been elected Taoiseach the electric excitement that was associated with those times in the Dáil. I stood aside to let him and three or four people who were animatedly talking to him pass by and he stopped. He put out his hand and said &ldquo;congratulations, very good performance in the circumstances&rdquo;. He knew my name because I had met him previously but he recognised, as Deputy Bru<Col N="1062" /> ton said, the common purpose we have in the House irrespective of political divisions, which always exist.</P>
    <P>Nobody should think that his gentleness, politeness or modesty was in some way to be mistaken for weakness or indecision. He was truly the iron fist in the velvet glove and those of us who doubted that were quickly reminded in the same way as his opponents on the field of play. However, he played within, and observed, the rules at all times. I express a particular word of sympathy to my colleagues &ndash; and I say that as a public representative &ndash; in the Fianna Fáil Party and those outside the House who are ardent members of the party. He was a leader of whom they should rightly be proud.</P>
    <P>While sadly they were not blessed with children, as Deputy Bruton said, Máirín in their political partnership adopted all of us who entered the political arena. Theirs was a political union and I have no doubt that she was at his side in different ways on many lonely occasions. She has my sympathy and that of everybody in the House. At a time when the profession of politics is in some disrepute and those of us who serve the citizens of this Republic are questioned about our motives, nobody could ever question the motives of Jack Lynch in serving this country. His modesty, both in his lifestyle and the way in which he treated everybody else, is a standard to which all of us should aspire in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my condolences and those of the Progressive Democrats Party to Máirín Lynch on her sad loss and to the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party. Almost 20 years ago Jack Lynch retired as Taoiseach and more than anything else his life in politics proves that a very ordinary person can make an extraordinary contribution. Jack Lynch was born when this country was under British rule but, notwithstanding that, he presided over the maturing of Ireland. He took up the Lemass legacy in many ways, whether it was in the Department of Industry and Commerce or, subsequently, as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Thirty years ago when Northern Ireland erupted we were fortunate, indeed, that somebody such as Jack Lynch was Taoiseach. When some sinister elements sought to plunge the country into war he remained determined to defend democracy and uphold the rule of law. Twenty years ago speaking in Waterville, Kerry, he said that we did not want to pressurise our fellow Northern people to take a course in history that they did not feel ready or able for. That remains as relevant today as it was then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He always had respect for other people. What I remember most about him was his ordinariness and modesty. If one had not known that he was a former Taoiseach, one would never have known. He was a man of simple taste and in his biography, written by T. P. O'Mahony, he said that while he played hurling and football he learned how to be a team player, deal with victory and defeat and have the control and self-dis<Col N="1063" /> cipline that is important in both political and sporting life. Jack Lynch steered Ireland into the EU, which was a major step forward for the country.</P>
    <P>He was Taoiseach at a testing and difficult time and, as previous speakers said, notwithstanding his demeanour, he was a man of steel. He always knew what was right and wrong. When he left public life, he maintained a keen interest in political affairs up to recent times and it is sad that he was ill for so long. He had a painful illness for six years and Máirín remained steadfast in supporting him as she did throughout his life.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that I would be in politics if it were not for Jack Lynch. There were not many options 22 years ago for a young woman without a political pedigree and if I had not been appointed to the Seanad then I doubt very much whether I would have pursued a career in politics. I owe everything I have achieved to him and I thank him for that. I have come to enjoy politics and if it was not for the opportunity he gave me, that would not have happened.</P>
    <P>He wanted to bring young people into politics then. He was always anxious to explore new ideas and ways of doing things. He was very much involved in developing free education, which is now the norm in Ireland, and the Taoiseach referred to school transport. Jack Lynch knew that by equipping people with a good education, one opened up enormous opportunities. He could have had a lucrative and successful career at the bar. He was successful while he practised but he chose public service and he was in every sense a public servant. He was not in politics for any personal gain and was a man, notwithstanding the fact that politics can often be divisive, that united people and his integrity shone all the time. He was highly respected by people in every walk of life, particularly his political opponents, something unusual. He was loved by his allies and his opponents and richly deserves everything that has been said about him. We are not good at teaching modern Irish history and I have no doubt there are many young people in Ireland who have hardly heard of Jack Lynch, that is the tragedy. It is often many years before we appreciate and understand the contribution made by outstanding figures and he was, in every sense, an outstanding statesman. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat what I have said, but I have a concern. I accept the Taoiseach's good faith when he says that, regardless of this decision, he will adhere to the agreement made between the Whips to the effect that the Dáil will be recalled next week if the nurses' strike is still on, but I am unclear as to how he proposes to give effect to that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have altered our business rightly and properly to pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and the House will not sit tomorrow as a result of this order going through, notwithstanding that many people would wish to visit the House tomorrow. My concern is along the lines already expressed by Deputy Bruton. I am not clear as to the precise mechanism the Taoiseach will use to facilitate an orderly recall of the Dáil next week. Monday is a bank holiday and polling day in the Dublin South Central by-election is on Wednesday. The normal procedure is that the House does not sit on polling day in a by-election or on a Tuesday after a bank holiday. I do not know if the Taoiseach and the Whips office have had time to consider when we might <Col N="1067" /> be in a position to resume if there is business to which this House should give its attention. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on the mechanism we can put in place today to order business so that, if necessary, a recall of the Dáil next week can be effected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to clarify, the order is that the House will meet on 2 November at 2.30 p.m. Given the arrangements we have made for tomorrow, which I appreciate, I understand that if circumstances &ndash; the Whips did not specify what they would be, Deputy Bruton raised the issue of the nurses' dispute &ndash; warrant it next week and it is felt desirable that we should meet, we will give the order to do so. We can keep in touch through the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to be helpful. The Whips agreed the House would meet on Tuesday week, as stated in the Order. We will vote on that in the normal course. I would say to Deputy Bruton it is only in recent times that we have had a break during mid-session. In recent decades the House used to come back on the third or fourth week of October but in the past few years it has come back in the last week of September. The House, therefore, is sitting about three weeks longer in the autumn session than it ever did before, and the committees also meet, which normally did not happen. I do not care what mechanism is used but if the Whips believe we should sit for a day next week, we can make whatever arrangement is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too vague to say &ldquo;if the Whips agree that it is warranted&rdquo;. What is warranted? How does the Taoiseach know whether it is warranted? The House should decide whether it will sit next week. An amendment should be made to this motion to the effect that if the nurses strike is still on, the House will meet at least one day next week. That should be added to the motion and we can agree on that basis to an adjournment until 2 November. The summoning of this House is a matter for this House. It is not something that can be delegated to any other body whether it be Whips or Taoisigh. The sitting times of this House are determined here by this House.</P>

      <P>It is precisely because of our awareness of that fact, a Cheann Comhairle, that Deputy Bruton and I are proposing that we order business now to provide for a meeting next week. <Col N="1068" /> I cannot, as such, propose an amendment to the Order of Business &ndash; that is the Government's prerogative &ndash; but I ask the Taoiseach to propose that if the nurses dispute is still ongoing, the House will sit next Wednesday and, failing that, that the House will resume on Tuesday week as normal. The Order of Business would then be clear and explicit. We will meet next Wednesday at the normal time if the nurses dispute is ongoing. If not, we will resume plenary sessions on the following Tuesday. I propose that to the Taoiseach.</P>

Sin an chosaint is fearr a d'fhéadfadh an Oireachtas a chur isteach maidir leis an rud atá ag cur imní ar an Teachta Ó Sé. Ní fheicim go bhfuil réiteach níos fearr ann.</P>

    <P>Bhí díospóireacht againn ag an Roghchoiste faoi seo agus tá a fhios agam gur suim leis an Aire Stáit cúrsaí forbartha na Gaeilge thart timpeall na <Col N="1073" /> tíre. Is fíor a rá go bhfuil an-chuid tionchair ag Raidió na Gaeltachta ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus tá tionchar maith ag TG4 ar stádas na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-údarás ag déileáil leis an nGaeltacht taobh istigh de na limistéir atá leagtha síos san Acht agus é mar phríomhaidhm acu jabanna a chur ar fáil. Molann an leasú seo ról níos lárnaí don údarás ó thaobh fhorbairt na teanga de. Pléadh é seo cheana agus ba chóir don údarás plean forbartha tionscail agus teanga a chur faoi bhráid an Aire i dtreo is go mbeidh a fhios ag chuile dhuine nach cúrsaí tionsclaíochta amháin is cúram don údarás sa Ghaeltacht ach go bhfuil ról níos leithne acu &ndash; forbairt an chultúir agus na teanga.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá gcuirfí brú ar an údarás é sin a dhéanamh. Cé go bhfuil an&ndash;chuid cleachtaidh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ar an sórt seo forbartha a chur ar bun agus a chur i gcrích tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh ról níos leithne ag an údarás agus go mbeadh a fhios ag chuile dhuine go soiléir taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ní hamháin go bhfuil an túdarás ag déileáil le cúrsaí tionscail, sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht ach go bhfuil sé ag déileáil leis an Ghaeilge, le forbairt teanga agus le cultúr freisin.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn plean leagtha síos ag an údarás leis an struchtúr atá ag Roinn na Gaeltachta beidh an teanga níos láidre dá bharr sin. Molaim an leasú don Aire Stáit.</P>

      <P>Tuigim an rud atá á mholadh ag an mbeirt Teachtaí Dála ach sílim nuair a dhéanfaidh siad scrúdú ar na leasaithe atá mé féin ag cur chun tosaigh go bhfeicfidh siad go bhfuil ar bhealaigh eile a bhfuil i gceist acu clúdaithe anseo. Seachas an rud a bheith scríofa san Acht táim ag iarraidh go mbeadh sé níos fearr ar bhealach mar tá cuid den rud á dhéanamh trí orduithe Aire a thabharfar don údarás más gá. Chomh maith leis sin tá na forálacha maidir leis an Ghaeilge á láidriú réasúnta mór i leasú a bheas mé féin ag cur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Glacaim leis an rud atá á rá ag an Teachta O'Shea maidir le tionscail a bheith bunaithe ar thraidisiúin an phobail. Bhí mé féin ag obair sa Ghaeltacht ar an gcineál sin tionscail ar feadh os cionn scór bliain Ach níl fhios agam an ceart é a chur isteach san Acht. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé mar choinníoll ar an údarás é a dhéanamh ar aon chaoi faoin Acht go ginearálta. Má cheapann Aire amach anseo go bhfuil faillí á déanamh sa treo sin beidh sé in ann orduithe a thabhairt go gcaithfear díriú ar an rud seo de réir mar a athróidh an saol. Bheadh sé níos fearr é a dhéanamh ar an mbealach sin ná é a scríobh isteach san Acht. An rud céann ó thaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge. Tá roinnt leasuithe á mholadh agam féin a láidreoidh go mór an bhéim ar an Ghaeilge. Arís táim ag caint ar orduithe ar féidir leis an Aire a thabhairt ag aon am má cheapann sé go bhfuil an t-údarás ag déanamh faillí ar an ndualgas soiléir a bheidh san Acht maidir leis an Ghaeilge.</P>

      <P>Is ionann an leasú seo agus feidhm de chuid údarás áitiúil a thabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta. Baineann cúrsaí pleanála leis na húdaráis áitiúla. Faoi alt 9 (2) den phríomh Acht is féidir le hordú an Rialtais feidhmeanna de chuid údaráis áitiúil a thabhairt don údarás agus ní gá é seo a chur san Acht. Chuige sin ní mór don údarás cás a dhéanamh go dtabharfaí na feidhmeanna sin dóibh nó aon ceann acu ar nós feidhmeanna pleanála. Bheadh ar an Roinn ansin an cás a bhreithniú i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil agus chaithfeadh an Roinn ansin cinneadh an Rialtais a lorg ina leith. Rud amháin atá spéisiúil i dtaobh na cainte uilig ná nár chuir an t-údarás aon chás faoi mo bhráid ag lorg cumhachtaí breise d'aon chineál faoi Acht 1979. Mar sin, má cheapann an t-údarás go bhfuil an chumhacht seo uathu am ar bith is féidir leo iarratas a dhéanamh agus déanfar í a bhreithniú agus ansin cinneadh an Rialtais a thógáil. Sin an bealach go gcaithfí an rud a dhéanamh. Tá freagrachtaí áirithe ormsa mar Aire i láthair na huaire maidir le cúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus tá scéimeanna tithíochta ann agus forbairt déanta ar na scéimeanna tithíochta sin. Ceann de na forbairtí tithíochta is spéisiúla ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht ach sa Ghalltacht freisin ná an dúblú ar an deontas tógála ar ha hoileáin. <Col N="1075" /> Tá sé spéisiúil a fheiceáil mar atá sé sin ag oibriú le cur ar chumas daoine tithe a thógaint dóibh féin agus dáiríre ní gá an leasú seo atá an Teachta O'Shea ag iarraidh a chur i gcrích. D'fhéadfaí é a dhéanamh amárach agus taréis an Bhille seo a bheith in a Acht fós is féidir é a dhéanamh ach iarratas a fháil ón údarás agus cinneadh an Rialtais a fháil</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;Leasaítear leis seo an Príomh Acht tríd an alt seo a leanas a chur isteach i ndiaidh alt 9:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;9A.&ndash;(1)A luaithe is indéanta agus laistigh de shé mhí ó thoghchán a dhéanfar de réir Chuid IV den Acht seo, déanfaidh an tÚdarás plean straitéiseach i leith fhorbairt na Gaeltachta don tréimhse cúig bliana dá éis a ullmhú agus a chur faoi bhráid an Aire.</P>
      <P>(2)Maidir le plean straitéiseach:</P>
      <P>(a)cuimseoidh sé na príomhchuspóirí, na hoibríochtaí agus na stratéisí gaolmhara atá ag an Údarás i ndáil le forbairt na Gaeltachta ó thaobh teanga, cultúir, sóisialachta, gnéithiúlachta agus geilleagair, agus</P>
      <P>(b) sonrófar ann go mion na cumhachtaí breise ar gá iad a thabhairt faoi alt 9 den Phríomh-Acht, chun a chumasú don Údarás a phleananna a chur i gcrích go héifeachtúil.</P>
      <P>(3) Cuirfidh an tAire faoi deara cóip den phlean straitéiseach a leagan faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Séard atá i gceist agam anseo ná go mbeadh plean stráitéiseach ag an údarás a bheadh dírithe ar chaomhnú agus forbairt na Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí cultúrtha, sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta a chur san áireamh. Ceapaim go n-éireoidh níos fearr leis an údarás má bhíonn plean cruinn acu leis na nithe éagsúla atá ar intinn acu a bhaint <Col N="1076" /> amach. Ba cheart plean mar sin a chur in áit sé mhí tar éis an toghcháin. Ní raibh an tAire Stáit dul síos an bóthair seo ar Chéim and Choiste ach is cosúil go bhfuil machnamh déanta aige air ó shin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Sé. Bhí sé pléite ag Céim an Choiste. Má théann duine isteach san údarás nach Éireannach é agus ceist a chur cad é atá á dhéanamh ann, bíonn neart freagraí le fáil. Aontaím gur chóir go mbeadh an t-údarás ann &ndash; tá sé nó seacht míle duine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht dá bharr, nach mbeadh ag obair, b'fhéidir, gan cabhair ón údarás. Ós rud é go gcaitheann sé suas le £30 milliún sa bhliain is mór an infheistíocht é sin sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh plean straitéiseach leagtha amach ag an údarás i dtreo is go mbeidh a fhios ag gach éinne cad é an sceideal geallúintí atá faoin údarás a chur i gcrích ó bhliain go bliain. Tá plean straitéiseach leagtha amach ag an gComhairle Ealaíon agus ag Bord Fáilte agus ag gach údarás eile agus tuige nach mbeadh ceann le réiteach ag an údarás?</P>
      <P>Ba chóir an plean sin a chur faoi bhráid na Dála ionas go mbeidh seans ag na Teachtaí an plean a phlé. Níl an t-údarás sách maith ag cur in iúl do na hionadaithe poiblí cad é atá ar bun acu. Bíonn easpa eolais ar a lán Teachtaí faoi cad go díreach atá ar bun acu maidir le hinfheistíocht sa Ghaeltacht agus plean forbartha tionscal. Tá siad an-lag ón taobh sin de agus tá níos mó díospóireachtaí idir na hionadaithe poiblí agus an t-údarás faoin tslí a chaitear an t-airgead a fhaigheann siad gach bliain. Le plean agus eolas ceart, ní bheadh an chúlchaint ann i dtaobh dreama atá ag iarraidh jab maith a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Cosúil le haon eagras eile ullmhaíonn an t-údarás pleananna straitéiseacha ó thráth go chéile agus cuirtear iad faoi bhráid na Roinne. Tá plean straitéiseach don tréimhse 1996-2000 ullmhaithe ag an údarás cheana féin. B'fhéidir go n-ardaíonn sé sin ceist eile, go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh rud a chur ann atá ann cheana féin. Faoin gcóras SMI is gá don údarás ráiteas straitéiseach a ullmhú agus tá a leithéid á réiteach don tréimhse 1999-2001. Ní miste a rá go bhfuil ról lárnach ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán i bpleanáil straitéiseach don Ghaeltacht go ginearálta.</P>
      <P>Tá dhá rud á mholadh anseo. Tá iarracht á dhéanamh &ndash; agus tuigim an t-údar atá leis &ndash; go gceanglófar réiteach phlean straitéiseach an údaráis le tréimhse bhord an údaráis, sé sin go ndéanfar é tar éis toghchán an údaráis. Bheadh buntáistí agus míbhuntáistí ag baint leis sin. D'fhéadfadh sé tarlú go mbeadh sé tráthúil ó am go chéile plean straitéiseach a réiteach nuair a bheadh an Roinn ag réiteach plean straitéiseach, mar shampla i gcás Rialtais nua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá iarracht á déanamh anseo a leagan síos cad é a bheas sa phlean straitéiseach. Beidh an tAire in ann ag am ar bith aon rud a cheapann sé a ba chóir a bheith sa phlean agus nár luaigh an <Col N="1077" /> t-údarás a ordú. Ní gá plean a éileamh mar caithfear ceann a réiteach faoin SMI agus b'fhearr liom é a fhágáil oscailte ó thaobh dáta de. Murach d'fhéadfadh go mbeadh dhá phlean á réiteach, ceann leis an mBille seo a shásamh nuair a bheidh sé ina Acht agus ceann eile chun riachtanais eile a shásamh agus b'fhearr liom éalú uaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Déantar pleananna forbartha contae gach cúig bliana. Maidir le heasnaimh ar na plean, is féidir leis an Rialtas ordú a thabhairt agus seasfaidh an t-ordú sin go dtí go dtabharfar a mhalairt. Níl gá leis an leasú seo agus glacaim leis na pointí a rinneadh agus i bhfeidhmiú an Achta, tógfar ar bord iad.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheas an plean straitéiseach 1999-2001 ceaptha ag an údarás, ní mór deimhin a dhéanamh de go bpléifear iad ag Roghchoiste de chuid an Oireachtais. Bheadh sé suas don choiste baill an údaráis a thabhairt i láthair an choiste agus an rud a phlé amach. B'fhéidir nach ndéantar dóthain plé ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta agus ar chúrsaí an údaráis i dTithe an Oireachtais. Is maith go raibh díospóireacht bhríomhar againn ar an ábhar seo de thoradh an Bhille seo.</P>

      <P>Is éard a theastaíonn uainn ná go mbeidh an t-údarás chomh gar don phobal agus is féidir. Rud daonna é sin agus caithfear srian a choimeád le líon na bpleananna &ndash; bíodh plean amháin ann agus bíodh sé ann do thréimhse. Mar dhuine a bhíodh ag treabhadh i ngort na Gaeltachta, bhíodh sé le rá gur gaire an gaol a bhí ann idir an Roinn agus an pobal ná idir an t-údarás agus an pobal. Agus go raibh an Roinn níos solúbtha agus iad dírithe ar fhadhbanna an phobail mar a chonacthas don phobal iad. Ceann de aidhmeanna an Bhille seo ná go mbeadh an t-údarás níos gaire don phobal agus trí breis ionadaithe pobail a chur ar bhord an údaráis, bheinn ag súil le beocht níos mó le gníomhaíocht an údaráis, agus iad níos interactive leis an bpobal. Agus go mothóidh an pobal gur leo é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Tá páirt lárnach ag an bpleanáil ansin ach caithfear déanamh cinnte nach gcuireann pleanáil cruth ró-righin ar an saol agus nach n-úsáidfear pleananna mar leithscéal gan rudaí a athrú de réir a chéile. Mar oibrí pobail, is fearr go mbeadh rudaí solúbtha mar athraíonn an saol go tobann: tá sé deacair cuimhneamh ar an am go rabhamar buartha mar go raibh daoine ag imeacht as an nGaeltacht agus anois níl dóthain spáis ann le tithe a thógáil.

      <P>Bhí díospóireacht cuíosach fada againn ar Chéim an Choiste ar na leasuithe seo agus i ndeireadh na dála is eard atá i gceist ná go mbeadh critéir teanga ag gabháil le haon airgead a bheadh a chur ar fáil do thograí sa Ghaeltacht.

      <P>Mar a gheall mé, rinne mé machnamh ar an gceist seo agus táim sásta gur cheart foráil maidir le cúrsaí teangan a chur isteach sa mBille. Nílim sásta áfach glacadh leis na leasuithe atá curtha síos ach tá malairt foclaíochta á mholadh agam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'ainneoin go bhfui foráil san Acht a deireann gur féidir leis an údarás coinníollacha cuí a leagan síos agus cúnamh á cheadú acu, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh foráil láidir maidir le coinníollacha teanga san Acht. Chuige sin tá leasú a 11 á mholadh agam. Leis na bhforálacha seo, beidh sé de dhualgas ar an údarás amach anseo coinníollacha a cheangal maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus cúnamh á chur ar fáil acu, rud atá á dhéan<Col N="1079" /> amh i láthair na huaire, ar ndóigh. Freisin, má tá an t-údarás ag déanamh cinnidh faoi chúnamh breise a thabhairt, beidh orthu athmheas a dhéanamh chomhlíonadh na gcoinníollacha sin. Clúdaíonn an leasú seo a bheag nó a mhór na rudaí a bhí á mholadh ag na Teachtaí. Beidh dualgas reachtúil ar an údarás agus tograí á cheadú, coinníollacha Gaeilge a chur isteach i gceadú an deontais. Agus scrúdófar an ndearnadh an rud a bhí leagtha síos dóibh má thagann siad ag iarraidh an dara deontais.</P>

    <P>Bhí easnaimh ar an mBille mar a dréachtaíodh é agus mar a gheall mé ar Chéim an Choiste tá leasú á mholadh agam in alt a 7 den Bhille. Foráil <Col N="1080" /> í i ndáil leis an gcuóram don Choiste Meastóireachta. Ag féachaint ar chomhdhéanamh an choiste dom, sílim go bhfuil gá le cuóram de thrí cheathrú de na baill. An fáth go bhfuil an cuóram ard sin á mholadh ná le déanamh cinnte go gcaithfidh tinreamh leathan a bheith ann i ngeall ar chomhdhéanamh an choiste.

      <P>Sin a bhí i gceist agamsa leis an leasú deiridh. Bhí sórt cúlchainte ann ag éirí as na coistí réigiúnacha go raibh airgead á thabhairt amach agus gan ach líon beag i láthair. Tá sé i gceist ag an Aire go mbeidh trí cheathrú de na comhaltaí ann tráth an chruinnithe. Muna mbíonn ach triúr ag an gcruinniú, cad a tharlóidh.</P>

      <P>Má scrúdaíonn an Teachta Ó Cionnaith an leasú gheobhaidh sé amach gur ceathrar ó theas agus ó thuaidh atá i gceist. Dúirt mé mórlach agus is ionann mórlach agus triúr as ceathrar. An t-aon áit nach bhfuil trí cheathrú i gceist ná i gcoiste an iarthair mar a chaithfidh cúigear as naonúr a bheith ann. Tá na cuóraim réasúnta san iomlán ach ní bheidh ar chumas duine nó beirt ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta nó ar an gCoiste Réigiúnach cinneadh a dhéanamh faoi airgead. Sin ceann de na fáthanna gur scríobhadh é isteach go soiléir san Acht mar ní raibh sé soiléir agus bhí caint ann faoi rudaí nach bhféadfainnse seasamh os a gcionn mar Aire.</P>

Nuair a bhíonn an trí cheathrú ag an gcruinniú, má théann beirt nó triúr acu abhaile, an gcaithfidh an trí cheathrú a bheith ag an gcruinniú ag an am a dhéantar an cinneadh faoi airgead a thabhairt do thogra ar bith? Ní leor go mbeadh siad ann ag tús an chruinnithe agus go mbeadh cuid acu imithe acu abhaile faoin am a ndéantar an cinneadh faoin togra. Sin an rud a tharla cheana agus ba cheart go mbeadh ar an trí cheathrú a bheith ann ag an am a dhéantar an cinneadh.</P>

      <P>Taimid ag caint ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta, coiste nach mbeidh mórán oibre le déanamh aige. Mar ní mórán tograí a thagann ar aghaidh, go mbíonn cead an Aire ag teastáil dóibh. Táimid ag caint faoi thrí nó cheithre cinn sa bhliain. B'aisteach liomsa dá dtiocfadh duine ag cruinniú coiste agus tuairim láidir acu agus gan ach togra amháin nó b'fhéidir, ar a mhéid, dhá thogra le plé agus tuairim laidir diúltach acu, mar shampla, in aghaidh togra agus go dtiocfadh siad abhaile roimh dheireadh an chruinnithe agus go ligfeadh siad don chuid eile an cinneadh a dhéan<Col N="1081" /> amh. B'ionann sin agus vótáil ar a shon. Agus mar sin, ó tharla nach clár fada a bheas ann, mar a bheadh ag cruinniú comhairle contae nó cruinniú den údarás féin ach ar choiste a thiocfaidh le chéile chun togra nó dhó a phlé. Agus go minic ní bheidh ann ach an t-aon ceann. Tá sé iontuigthe má thagann trí cheathrú ann chun an cruinniú a thosú go mbeidh siad go léir ann ag an críoch.

      <P>Tá an leasú seo teicniúil agus ní gá dom aon rud a rá ina thaobh. Is é atá i gceist i leasú a 16 ná na moltaí i scríbhinn a chuirfear ar aghaidh ón gCoiste Meastóireachta go dtí an t-údarás, go mbeadh na rudaí seo a leanas i measc na moltaí sin: go mbeifear ag díriú ar an tionchar teangan a bheas leis an togra lena mbaineann agus ina theannta san go mbeadh critéir teanga a chaithfeadh an togra a chomhlíonadh. Tá sé seo cosúil leis an díospóireacht a bhí againn tamall ó shin. An rud ata uaim ná go mbeadh béim i gcónaí ar an teanga a chaomhnú agus a leathnú.

Ba chóir go mbeadh a fhios ag tionsclóir ar bith atá ag lorg airgid go mbeidh coinníollacha teanga le comhlíonadh. Tá cuid acu a dhéanann iarracht a fháil ó aon cheann de na húdaráis san iarthar agus ní mór go mbeadh a fhios acu nach ionann an t-údarás agus na cinn eile ó thaobh na teanga de.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom fós go bhfuil míthuiscint ann faoin gCoiste Meastóireachta. Abraimid go dtagann togra mór ar aghaidh faoi bhráid an údaráis a bhfuil deontas á mholadh dó atá os cionn an teora atá leagtha síos agus go bhfuil cead an Aire nó cead an Rialtas ag teastáil lena aghaidh. 'Sé a dhéanfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta, i dtosach báire, ná an togra a mheas mar choiste ó thaobh inmharthanacht agus feiliúnacht na hinfheistíochta ó thaobh airgid de. Agus déanfaidh siadsan moladh moladh teicniúil faoi cé chomh ciallmhar agus atá an infheistíocht agus cé chomh inmholta is atá an togra ar an mbunús sin. Cuireann siad an moladh sin ar aghaidh go <Col N="1082" /> bord an údaráis beidh an say deiridh acu agus ní gá dóibh glacadh leis. Is féidir leo é a dhiúltú ar chúiseanna eile ar fad, mar shampla, an comhshaoil, cúrsaí Gaeilge, mí-oiriúnacht don Ghaeltacht agus cúiseanna nach iad.</P>
      <P>In ionad an t-Aire ag diúltú do thograí móra ar ball beag ó thaobh na hinfheistíochta de, má dhiúltaíonn an coiste dó, ní thiocfaidh sé roimh bhord an údaráis. Ach má mholtar é tiocfaidh sé agus beidh ar an mbord iomlán é a mheas, gan aon chur isteach ón gCoiste Meastóireachta, ó thaobh a oiriúnacht don Ghaeltacht agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Táimid cheana féin inniu tar éis a leagan síos sa Bhille agus tá mé tar éis glacadh le leasú go gcaithfidh an bord coinníollacha teangan a leagan síos. agus is gnó é sin don bhord agus ní don choiste. Déanfaidh an coiste an measúnú ó thaobh na hinfheistíochta agus na hinmharthanachta de agus tiocfaidh an bord iomlán le chéile ina dhiaidh sin agus tabharfaidh siadsan na critéir go léir le chéile agus déanfaidh siad cinneadh. Agus má cheapann siad go bhfuil sé mí-oiriúnach ar aon chúis tá dualgas orm é a dhiúltú agus tá sé sin soiléir san Acht mar atá sé agus níos soiléire fós sa mBille mar tá critéir láidir teanga curtha isteach ann.</P>
      <P>Agus gur thaining togra a cheadaigh an t-údarás ar ais an dara uair ach go raibh cead an Aire, mar a bhiodh ag teastáilm agus anois moladh ón gCoiste Meastóireachta. Is é a tharlódh anseo go ndéanfadh an Coiste Meastóireachta cinneadh maidir le hinmharthanacht an togra ach tá coinníoll á chur isteach againn inniu go gcaithfeadh bord an údaráis, nuair a thiocfadh sé chomh fada leo, athmheas a dhéanamh ar cé mar a comhlíonadh an coinníoll Gaeilge a cuireadh isteach leis an gcéad chead sula bhféadfadh siad an dara ceadú a thabhairt.</P>
      <P>Tá na rudaí faoin nGaeilge ann ach tá an cúram fágtha san áit cheart, le bord an údaráis.</P>
      <P>Bhí faitíos orm an chumhacht a roinnt an iomarca. Sé sin, má bhí leath den chumhacht maidir leis an nGaeilge ag an gcoiste agus an leath eile ag an mbord, chruthódh sé sin deacrachtaí dá mbeadh easaontas ann. Is fearr an chumhacht sin a fhágáil ag an mbord de mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar ní bhaineann an cheist leis na dreamanna eile.</P>

In ionad an cinneadh a roinnt idir dhá dhream, fanfaidh sé le bord an údaráis. Nuair a thiocfaidh rud faoi bhráid an Choiste Meastóireachta, fiú má mholann siad é, caithfidh sé ansin dul ag an mbord.

B'aisteach an rud é dá gceapfadh Aire Gaeltachta duine gan Gaeilge ar an mbord. An chontúirt a bhí ann ná go bhféadfadh an dá eagraíocht eile a luadh leis an gCoiste Meastóireachta ar eagraíochtaí seachtracha iad, daoine gan Gaeilge a cheapadh ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta. B'fhéidir go dtabharfaí an leithscéal go ndeacthas sa tóir ar na comhlachtaí sin agus ainneoin an chóras oideachas a mbímid ag maíomh as, nach bhféadfaí oiread is duine amháin le Gaeilge a fháil sna heagraíochtaí sin. Ó tharla go mbeidh na doiciméid agus an plé go léir trí Ghaeilge, shíl mé gur eagraíochtaí seachtracha nach mbeadh aon smacht ag an Aire Gaeltachta orthu a bhí i gceist. Má chaithfear coinníoll a chur ann, is do na heagraíochtaí seachtracha é. Ní bheidh ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta nó ar an mbord agus cé is moite de sin ach daoine a bheas ainmnithe ag Aire na Gaeltachta agus an dream a bheas tofa ag an bpobal.</P>

Nuair a pléadh é seo ar Chéim an Choiste, dúirt an tAire Stáit linn nach gcuirfeadh an fo-alt isteach a bheag nó a mhór ar aon chomhaontú a bheadh ann idir na ceardchumainn agus an t-údarás i dtaobh duine a bhriseadh as a phost.

      <P>I leathanach 17, roimh líne 1, an méid seo a leanas a chur isteach:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11. Leasaítear leis seo an tAcht um Shaoráil Faisnéise, 1997, trí &lsquo;Údarás na Gaeltachta' a chur isteach i ndiaidh &lsquo;an tSaotharlann Stáit' sa Chéad Sceideal.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Tá an leasú seo agus uimhir a 21 ar an ábhar céanna. Go mbainfeadh an tAcht um Shaoráil Faisnéise, 1997, agus an tAcht Ombudsman, 1980, le gnó an údaráis. Dúirt an tAire Stáit ag an gCéim dheiridh nach raibh aon rud aige i gcoinne na leasuithe seo ach go raibh slí níos fearr ann chun é a chur i gcrích. Dúirt sé go smaoineodh sé ar an ábhar idir an dá linn agus ba mhaith liom a chlos uaidh cad é a thuairim anois.</P>

      <P>De réir an chomhairle atá á cur orm, is féidir é seo a dhéanamh ar dhá bhealach. Tá córas leagtha síos faoi Acht um Shaoráil Faisnéise, 1997, chun tuilleadh eagras a chur ar an liosta sa Chéad Sceideal den Acht sin a shonraíonn na heagrais lena mbaineann an tAcht. Déantar é sin trí rialacháin arna ndearnadh ag an <Col N="1085" /> Aire Airgeadais tar éis comhairle a ghlacadh leis an Aire cuí. Tuigtear go bhfuil i gceist eagrais a chur ar an liosta an bhliain seo chugainn; ina measc tá an Independent Radio and Television Commission, RTÉ, TG4 agus An Chomhairle Ealaíon agus go mbeidh na heagrais fhorbartha tionscail eile, sin sin Fiontraíocht Eireann, SFADCO agus IDA Ireland ag teacht faoi scóip an Achta an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>Cé nach ndéanann sé móran difríochta don Roinn Airgeadais cé acu bealach a dhéanfar an rud seo, tá buntáistí ag baint le tabhairt faoi bealach an Achta um Shaoráil Faisnéise, 1997, a leasú nó cur lena sceideal. Ó thaobh dáta a shonrú nuair a thiocfadh sé i bhfeidhm bheadh sé níos oiriúnaí agus bheadh sé níos áisiúla don phobal amach anseo go mbeadh an liosta go léir in áit amháin.</P>
      <P>Ag glacadh leis an rud atá ráite, tá i gceist agam labhairt leis an Roinn Airgeadais maidir leis an údarás a chur ar an liosta. Ní fheicim fáth ar bith nach bhféadfaí agus beidh mé á mholadh sin. Glacaim le spiorad an ruda atá á mholadh agus táim ag moladh nach dtiocfar ar aghaidh leis an leasú inniu ar an tuiscint go mbeidh mise ag moladh go gcuirfí ainm an údaráis ar an liosta an chéad uair eile a bheas liosta á fhoilsiú.</P>
      <P>Tá i gceist freisin leasú a dhéanamh ar an Acht Ombudsman, 1980, agus Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur ar liosta na n-eagras Stáit a thiocfaidh faoin Acht sin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> Táimid ag filleadh ar an gceist seo go mbeadh béim lárnach i gcónaí ar cheist na Gaeilge. Is é atá i gceist anseo ná go mbeadh tuarascáil á cur ar fáil ag an údarás ar a laghad gach cúig bliana agus níos minice má iarrann an tAire é.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh rud a chur isteach sa Bhille ionas go mbeidh súil ar an nGaeilge i gcónaí agus go mbeidh an tuarascáil seo ag teacht os comhair an Oireachtais ionas gur féidir leis na Baill é a phlé.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis an méid a dúradh mar gheall ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta a tharraingt níos cóngaraí don údarás ach tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh chuile dhuine in ann a ladhar a chur isteach sa ghnó seo.</P>

      <P>Tá an leasú céanna thíos im' ainmse. Táimid ag caint faoi phleananna straitéiseacha agus pleananna SMI a bheith leagtha amach ag an údarás mar gheall ar an rud atá beartaithe acu le cúig bliana. Dúirt mé ag an Roghchoiste go raibh díomá orm faoin laghad tuairisce a cuireadh amach ar obair na dTeachtaí ar an mBille seo ag an Dara Céim, ag Céim an Choiste agus ag an gCéim seo.</P>
      <P>Táimid ag cur brú ar an údarás cúram lárnach a dhéanamh d'fhorbairt na teanga. Táimid ag déanamh iarracht an Ghaeilge a labhairt san Oireachtas agus labhraíonn an tAire Stáit Gaeilge an t-am ar fad ar fud na tíre. Ní fhaca mé focal amháin as Gaeilge mar gheall ar an gCoiste seo nó faoin Dáil ar RTÉ le fada. Ní bhíonn am agam breathnú ar an teilifís &ndash; is dócha go bhfuil tuairisc éigin ar TG4, n'fheadar an bhfuil aon rud ar TV3. Má táimid ag caint faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge anseo ba chóir go ndéanfadh na meáin chumharsáide cúram de é sin a thuairisciú, mar rud nádúrtha mar a dhéantar i gcás cúrsaí eile.</P>
      <P>Bheadh an-tionchar ar an tuairisciú sin ar fhorbairt na teanga. Baineann an cheist seo leis an leasú atá agam anseo. Dúirt mé ag an cruinniú deiridh leis an gCathaoirleach uasal scríobh chuig na stiúrthóirí craolacháin mar gheall ar an laghad tuairiscithe atá á dhéanamh ar chúrsaí an Bhille seo. Tá mé ag súil le hathrú ar an scéal sin. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an Taoiseach ag cur ráitis thábhachtacha amach trí Ghaeilge amháin agus bheadh ar na meáin ansin éisteacht leo agus iad a aistriú más mian leo nó an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.</P>

      <P>Tagaim go mór leis an méid a dúradh. Tá iontas orm faoin easpa poiblíochta a fuair an Bille seo. Dá mbeadh raic ar bun, bheadh lucht na meán le feiceáil. Ó thaobh RTÉ de, taispeánann an neamhaird a thugtar go minic ar chionníollacha reachtúla ó thaobh chaomhnú na teanga de. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an oiread béime á chur agamsa an t-am ar fad ar an Aire a bheith i gceannas ar chúrsaí Gaeilge fiú i leithéidí Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá sé éasca é a scríobh isteach san Acht agus dearmad a dhéanamh air. Caithfidh cumhacht a bheith ag duine éigin atá neamhspleách ar na heagraíochtaí seo ar fad greim a thógáil ar an stiúir agus feidhmiú go <Col N="1087" /> gníomhach más dóigh leo go bhfuil faillí á dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Má bhreathnaítear ar alt a 19 mar atá sé scríofa cheana féin, go gcuirfidh an t-údarás faoi bhráid an Aire gach bliain, tráth nach déanaí ná cibé dáta a cheapfaidh an tAire  tuarascáil ar imeachtaí an údaráis faoin Acht seo i gcaitheamh na bliana roimhe. Agus cuirfidh an tAire faoi deara cóipeanna den tuarascáil a leagadh faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas. Agus seo é an rud tábhachtach: Mír 2: Aon uair a ordóidh an tAire amhlaidh beidh sa tuarascáil bhliaintiúil sin freisin eolas ar chibé gnéithe a shonraíonn an tAire imeachtaí an Údaráis faoin Acht seo. Sé sin le rá is féidir leis an Aire, mar atá sé i láthair na huaire, ordú ar bith a thabhairt ag am ar bith maidir le céard a bheas sa tuarascáil bhliaintiúil. Má cheapann Aire go bhfuil faillí á dhéanamh maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge tá sé in ann teacht agus a leagan síos go gcaithfear tuilleadh sonruithe maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge a chur ann. Tá an chumhacht sin ann agus ní gá é a thabhairt an dara huair</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries general group last met on 8 December last year. The Government established a Cabinet Committee on Agenda 2000 at the beginning of January, which I chaired. This was supported by an expert technical group, which I also chaired, and which met nine times in the run up to the conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations in Berlin in March. In May, following the completion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs was established. It has met twice, most recently on Tuesday, 12 October, in preparation for the Tampere European Council and will meet again in mid-November and early-December. It will meet as required as key issues arise on the EU agenda and in preparation for European Councils.</P>
      <P>In advance of my visit to Hungary, Slovenia and Kosovo, on 29 October I will meet the relevant officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and members of the Defence Forces who are responsible for the visit. My Department has been in constant contact with the relevant Government Departments, embassies and the Defence Forces in relation to my visit for a number of months. While in Kosovo, I intend visiting the Irish Contingent in KFOR and I hope to meet senior representatives from KFOR, the UN and the OSCE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the East Timorese leaders Mr. Xanana Gusmao and Mr. José Ramos Horta at Government Buildings on 4 October 1999. During our meeting Mr. Gusmao expressed appreciation for Ireland's support during the recent electoral process, for subsequent actions within the EU and at the United Nations and, in particular, for the convening of the recent special session of the UN Commission for Human Rights. With the Irish Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva in the chair, that session adopted a resolution which will allow a meaningful investigation of <Col N="1089" /> human rights violations to be carried out. The UN Secretary General has since asked the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to proceed at once with the establishment of a commission of inquiry and for it to report by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gusmao drew attention, in particular, to the plight of displaced persons who wish to return to East Timor but who are being prevented from doing so. He wants the international community to do more to help these people to return as this would speed the reconstruction and repopulation of the towns and villages of East Timor. He also pointed out that it would ultimately save the international community money to have the displaced people back in their own communities. Mr. Gusmao asked me to keep the issue of East Timor to the forefront of the international agenda. To this end, I wrote to President Clinton on 7 October. President Clinton had written to me on 4 October and in this letter he stated that Ireland's voice had played an important role in mobilising the international community in the wake of the recent tragic events and he thanked me for the leading role which Ireland had played in supporting the people of East Timor during the current crisis.</P>
    <P>I will attend the Summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, which will take place in Istanbul on 18 and 19 November. Preparations for the summit are ongoing. A review conference, covering a wide range of activities within the OSCE, was recently adjourned in Vienna and will resume in Istanbul on 8 November. A preparatory conference which will address issues for the summit in a detailed manner will commence in Istanbul on 11 November. Ireland is liaising closely with EU partners and with the wider OSCE membership in preparation for the summit. I have also availed of bilateral meetings to discuss OSCE issues, most recently during my visit last month to Russia.</P>
    <P>While a definitive agenda has not yet been finalised for the summit, the main issues for discussion are likely to be: the possible adoption of a charter on European security for the 21st century; adoption of a political declaration covering a number of ongoing conflicts in the OSCE area, for example, in the western Balkans; and enhancing the role of the OSCE in the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider this matter in view of the damage it is doing to neighbouring Balkan countries? It must be borne in mind that the Danube navigation has been closed off as a result of the sanctions and this will have seriously deleterious effects on the economies of other countries dependent on that navigation, which is not a good development from the point of view of the reconstruction of south-eastern Europe. Will the Taoiseach bear in mind that one of the results of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was the knocking out of the central heating system in Belgrade, one result of which will be that people who had no part in deciding to launch ethnic cleansing will probably freeze to death this winter? People will die from the residual effects of NATO bombing which, apparently, the Taoiseach is effectively supporting through his continued support for continued sanctions against the people of Yugoslavia.</P>

      <P>It is, but I will state my position. Mr. Milosevic and his regime perpetrated serious atrocities on his own people. Because of those atrocities the international community had to act. We have seen those actions throughout this year. The object of the sanctions is to ensure that if a stability pact, backed by substantial resources, is to be put in place it will be done on the basis that human rights and dignity will be maintained. That is the position of the international community. I heard in Russia the very strong position of the Russian and Serbian people. One hundred and fifty thousand people are in an extremely difficult position and I am sure the problem of assistance to these people <Col N="1092" /> will be an issue at the forthcoming OSCE meeting. Dialogue on the question of assistance is taking place between a number of heads of state, including those of Russia and the United States.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach assure the House that Irish taxpayers' money, through the IMF and the World Bank, will not be used to finance the forced transmigration policy of the Indonesian government against the East Timorese people?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should submit a question to the Minister for Finance on IMF matters. The Government has already allocated money to assist the East Timorese people. This has been done through direct aid, through European funding and through the Rangers' participation in the security operation. Our aid is direct to East Timor. I hope aid will not be given by anybody else in a way that would affect the East Timorese people.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's response does not address the core of my question. The East Timorese solidarity campaign in Ireland reports that more than 200,000 East Timorese people have been forced out and are held in concentration camps and that they are being exterminated and exiled. A budget of $27 million has been allocated for this by Indonesia. If the Taoiseach cannot answer my question, will he assist me in directing it to the Minister for Finance? Will the Taoiseach press the IMF and the World Bank to ensure financial aid to Indonesia is not used to fund genocide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To gain support for IMF policy, the Deputy should put down a question. The Deputy knows the United States Administration has clearly laid down views, which have been supported by other IMF countries, regarding Indonesian involvement in any further violence against <Col N="1093" /> the East Timorese and has effectively threatened to stop resources if there is such involvement. That does not apply if there is no further action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to my earlier point of order, three separate sets of questions have been answered by the Taoiseach. I know you, Sir, have no responsibility for the grouping of questions, but I give notice that I would like to ask, separately, three sets of related questions because the Taoiseach has linked them. The first question relates to East Timor and I shall concentrate on it before returning to the other two. Does the Taoiseach agree the assembly yesterday recognised the independence of East Timor and annulled a decision of 1978 in relation to annexation and that East Timor is now an independent territory which sadly lacks the infrastructure to turn its territory into an independent state? Bearing in mind the difficulties we had in 1921 and 1922, we should empathise with that reality. Given the extraordinary empathy the Irish people have displayed with East Timor over many years, is the Taoiseach prepared to add that country to the list of priority countries for bilateral aid and institute a programme of solidarity engaging all the agencies &ndash; APSO and others &ndash; to enable the East Timorese people, and particularly the president designate, Xanana Gusmao, to turn that piece of territory into an independent nation state? Is the Taoiseach further prepared to provide the necessary resources, of which we are no longer short, to make that aspiration a reality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have announced a contribution of resources to the international agencies and some of these have already been allocated. The amount of money is not enormous but it is very helpful. The EU aid programme which we support has allocated approximately 5 million euros. We are also contributing to INTERFET. Deputy Quinn rightly points out that there are other major infrastructural issues, as Xanana Gusmao explained to me, which will require an enormous contribution to resolve. How this will be done is not clear yet but the world community will have to give assistance.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to decide how overseas development aid is allocated and I will not make decisions for him. The Department of Foreign Affairs moves very swiftly and will be keen to continue to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect the Taoiseach was distracted and prevented from hearing my question. With due respect, I will repeat it. I did not ask if we are meeting our obligations with regard to international contributions or the European Union. I asked the Taoiseach if he will initiate a process to add the country now formally recognised as independent, East Timor, to the list of countries for priority treatment under our bilateral aid agreement. That is a decision for the Government of which the Taoiseach is still the leader. Will the Taoiseach mobilise Irish agencies <Col N="1094" /> who have manifested themselves to support East Timor to transfer their anger into constructive energy and, led by people such as Tom Hyland through APSO and other agencies, to deliver such a programme? Will the Taoiseach suggest  &ndash; presumably he still has influence on his Minister for Finance &ndash; that a specific new financial programme for East Timor be put in place? We speak of a country of approximately 500,000 people, less than the population of Dublin city. I repeat my questions lest the Taoiseach did not hear them. Will East Timor be added to the list of countries for bilateral aid? Will the Taoiseach mobilise Irish agencies to deliver that aid in all its manifestations, above and beyond what they have already done? Between now and budget day, will the Taoiseach make an explicit allocation of budget surpluses to provide for the reconstruction of the social and physical infrastructure of that country?</P>

Slovenia will soon be a full member of the EU as it is the most compliant of the six applicant countries in terms of the Maastricht criteria. Will he outline a positive and constructive position to this request, which will be the first he will receive when he visits?</P>

      <P>No Government decision has been made yet about the extension of embassies to that region but the matter is constantly under consideration. By 2003 the first of the applicant countries will join the Union. Slovenia is one of the best prepared and it will be probably between <Col N="1098" /> 2003 and 2005 before others join. The EU decisions will have to be considered in regard to Ireland establishing further embassies and strengthening its diplomatic effort. There is unlikely to be a decision before 2000 but it is in our interest to strengthen diplomatic relations in these countries over the next five years.</P>

      <P>I understand that no decision has yet been made but when will one be taken? Does he consider it significant that three of the six applicant countries have populations smaller than that of the Republic of Ireland and most of them, if not all, are desirous of a residential embassy presence and access to Ireland's experience of having been a member of the EU for 26 years? When will a decision be made which will bring about the establishment of a residential embassy and related programmes in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from questions asked previously, and trying to be constructive, these nine questions refer to a number of meetings the Taoiseach has had. At these meetings, or as a result of them, will he consult the Minister for Foreign Affairs to prepare a position for Ireland in relation to the operation of sanctions? I am not tediously extending a question that was answered earlier but the point that Deputies Bruton and Finucane raised arises in relation to the operation of sanctions. In reply to the question on medical <Col N="1099" /> supplies, for example, the Taoiseach stated that it extended beyond medical supplies. The list is restricted in relation to humanitarian need. On foot of the Taoiseach's visit and the meetings which he will attend, will he prepare a review of the operation of sanctions to ensure that the humanitarian need being experienced in the countries mentioned today, and also in Iraq, is not one that cuts across a foreign policy which punishes civilians as a type of collateral damage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a copy of that list but I understood it covered extended medical and paramedical items, and essential clothing, children's items and other essential needs. I agree with extending or making that more effective for the purposes of humanitarian aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a short step from that point, to take up the political question of international relations, that the operation of sanctions, usually seen as accompanying or preceding the threat of force, will not succeed the use of force, that is, continue to be visited on a civilian population, the forms of the conflict in a military sense having been over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the people involved. The situation in Iran and in some other countries has existed for a long time and it is correct that they have not ended the sources of conflict or division and have not resolved any of the problems. Sanctions against humanitarian and medical supplies and other essential services only work against the local population, the ordinary people. It is unfair to use sanctions in that way. I will check what is on the list but I understood that medicines and essential supplies were included on that list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reflect on the new developments in international relations, expressed by the doctrine of humanitarian military intervention without UN Security Council sanction, as practised in Kosovo by NATO, allied to the decision to arrest people and try them in a foreign country for offences committed in a home country, as was seen the case of the former President of Chile? Is the Taoiseach concerned that, by moving away from the certain doctrine of state sovereignty, which had deficiencies but was certain in its application, we are moving towards the uncertain and subjective doctrine of extra-territorialism, based on the political judgment of whoever happens to be power? We are moving from an area in which there was a measure of predictability in international relations to an area where predictability will be less evident. As head of the Government of a country which fought hard to attain its sovereignty, is the Taoiseach concerned about these developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the issues which test all countries at almost every meeting. The <Col N="1100" /> demands for involvement of countries in the affairs of other regions are enormous &ndash; there are requests for military and professional involvement and assistance with financial resources. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the European Council and ECOFIN to follow the policies of the past. Last week Romano Prodi stated that we should seek means to define Europe in a European context. What are its parameters? Where are its priorities and commitments? Should we become involved in Islamic countries? These questions cause concern and create difficulties.</P>
      <P>I was asked how consistent and certain Irish policy is. Irish policy is important but, being honest, this is developing beyond our ability in the international community because it is no good saying that we can influence states which we cannot. That would be misleading. Now the demands and pressures from eastern and south-eastern Europe give concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has said about the geographic reach of our concerns. In terms of international law, would the Taoiseach agree that the previous doctrine of state sovereignty had legal certainty? There was no intervention in the sovereign territory of another country and it was not possible to arrest the citizens of another country for offences committed in their own country and try them overseas, other than on very clearly defined bases. Does the Taoiseach agree that we are moving away from that certainty in the interests of ostensibly humanitarian concerns?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal with this across the board. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a consideration that if we have elastic rules of international law, it leaves room for arbitrary decision making outside the law and that will mean that only power will count? Whatever was wrong with extradition treaties which could not be implemented, resulting in war criminals not being tried, and whatever was wrong with things being done within a sovereign state, at least there was a measure of certainty in the past. We are now moving into an area in which certainty is absent. That is inherently dangerous.</P>

      <P>It is difficult. In terms of international crime, particularly drug-related crime, <Col N="1101" /> however, this is an area which will grow and grow. If one looks at extradition law as it currently is, there are obvious difficulties. The Germans will not extradite their own citizens while other countries will not co-operate in any extradition processes. In the new effort for European security, the European Community &ndash; I want to only comment on the European Community &ndash; is seeking equity in the system, a level playing field, similar standards and that countries co-operate as members of the Community. I do not want to get into the argument about international figures who are currently the source of debate in other countries.</P>

He gave me his general views about what he thought, but nothing of great significance. That was not his concern. He had strong views that the international force and the safety of peacekeepers and other agencies should remain, in the long-term, under Australian control. He was very concerned and asked us to state wherever we could &ndash; I have done so &ndash; that it should not go back to an Asian leadership of the UN force. He felt it absolutely imperative that the Australians maintain the leadership not only for an extension of the four month period but into the future. That was his major concern for this period.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the discussions, if any, which have taken place with the ESRI to outline that its conclusions that public investment in the seafood sector should decrease were unfounded; his views on whether the reports recommending a large increase in funding for the seafood sector will be reflected in the national development plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has strongly refuted the conclusions in the ESRI report on national development priorities for 2000-06 and has expressed its views both orally and in writing. In addition, the CFP strategy review group published a report entitled National Investment Priorities for the Irish seafood industry. The review group disagrees fundamentally and in detail with the conclusions of the ESRI that public investment in the sector should decrease. Instead the group makes a compelling economic case for enhanced investment support for the sector, highlighting its importance for balanced socio-economic and regional development and an equitable distribution of economic activity.</P>
      <P>The review group recommends a total investment programme for the seafood sector of £365 million over the next seven years of which the EU and Exchequer would contribute £199 million and the private sector £166 million. The group's report fully backs up BIM's analysis of the investment needs of the sector in the latter's Seafood Industry Agenda 2000 &ndash; 2006. The review group's economic analysis points to the significant contribution the sector already makes to output, exports, jobs and regional and local development. It underlines the potential for further growth and added value which will create lasting jobs in the regions.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse this analysis and I am working with Government colleagues to secure the necessary investment support in the next round to underpin the development of the Irish seafood industry and of the marine and natural resources sectors generally. The National Development Plan is currently being finalised. I am confident the fisheries sector will be given a high priority to ensure a sustainable and vibrant future for the Irish seafood industry and the communities it supports.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State has refuted the conclusions of the ESRI report. In regard to those conclusions, did the ESRI say to the Minister of State that it accepts the arguments put forward for expansion of this sector? My concern is that when he comes to organise a <Col N="1104" /> national development plan that such an august body as the ESRI may be more sympathetic to the national development plan. Will the Minister of State give an assurance, given that all the reports submitted come to the conclusion that about £365 million is required over seven years for this vital industry, that he and his officials will win the argument against the ESRI and a national development plan in ensuring this industry gets proper financial investment over the next seven years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>I am pleased the Deputy asked that question because I disagree fundamentally with the ESRI analysis. It is the Government's intention to proceed. I accept the ESRI is an august body and has done tremendous work. We have left it in no doubt that sea fisheries is vital. It is indigenous and we have made that point in the strongest possible terms. While they have not come back to us to say they made a mistake, they opened a debate which was welcome. The Deputy will be aware, because he and his party spokesperson, Deputy Sheehan, attended a BIM launch recently, that these proposals can make a difference and create wealth and jobs in remote rural areas where jobs would not otherwise be created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, I am conscious of the widespread concerns now being expressed by many people about the safe use of recreational craft for personal purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of these concerns, and especially in the light of a number of recent serious accidents, and fatalities, involving jet skis and fast craft, I <Col N="1105" /> took the initiative to establish a broadly representative action group to address this important matter. Furthermore, following the recent tragedy off Dunany Point, County Louth, where four persons, including two children, tragically lost their lives, I secured Cabinet approval to include drawing up a safety policy for small powered leisure craft within the terms of reference of the action group.</P>
    <P>In setting up this action group, my central aim is to put in place policies and practical measures to protect the safety of all water users in the context of a comprehensive safety regime for recreational craft generally. My basic aim in relation to fast water craft and jet skis is to stop irresponsible behaviour by a small number of users, to protect the safety of other water users and to end the severe nuisance and distress being caused in certain locations and in traditional bathing, boating and angling areas. I have asked the action group to carry out a comprehensive review of the safe use of personal recreational water craft and to consider measures which will be effective, sensible and enforceable and will be instrumental in introducing a shift in the culture towards safety as the overriding consideration.</P>
    <P>I have outlined to the group that I envisage a new safety regime imposing strict controls on fast water craft which would include requirement on training and operator competence testing, operator licences and craft registration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>As regards other recreational craft, I have urged the group to address, urgently and imaginatively, how we can ensure that children in particular are adequately safeguarded in the event of a vessel capsize or other accidents. The wearing of suitable lifejackets or buoyancy aids is of central importance as is the need to get the safety message across to such craft users, particularly in terms of competence in the use of such craft and an understanding of risk to themselves and others.</P>
    <P>The action group, in its deliberations, will have particular regard to the Marine Institute's current study on safety policy in the marine leisure sector, the good work on zoning undertaken by a number of coastal local authorities, and best practice and ideas in place and being developed internationally to ensure that all water users can enjoy their activities in safety. In fact, only on Monday last, the Marine Institute held a seminar in Athlone on jet skis and fast pleasure craft which members of the action group attended and in which they played an active part. This seminar is the first stage of a full consultation process in which interested persons and organisations will have the opportunity to express their views and ideas to the group.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance I attach to this subject, I have asked that the action group submit an interim report to me by mid-November 1999 and a final report not later than the end of February 2000. I assure the Deputy that I intend to move <Col N="1106" /> quickly on foot of the interim report to provide a comprehensive legislative framework to enable me enact any new regulations necessary to address identified problems. I will also act quickly on the recommendations of the action group's final report and bring forward any legislation which may be required as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive reply. I am sure he will join me and Members of the House in conveying our deepest sympathy to the members of my constituency, and my neighbours in County Louth, who lost their lives in this tragic accident. Will the Minister agree that people licensed to drive a car have to wear a safety belt, as do their passengers, and they cannot carry more people in a vehicle than that which is allowed by law. In this review and in accordance with the action group he has set up, will the Minister of State ensure that safeguards similar to those which apply to road traffic safety will be introduced in relation to the use of water craft and the number of people who can travel in these boats? Will he ensure that people will be compelled to adhere to these safeguards in relation to travel on water?</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Bell in offering my deepest sympathy to the family concerned. All too often I have seen similar occurrences around the coast and to all the other families who have suffered in this way I offer my sympathy. Deputy Bell is right in that days which begin with the prospect of tremendous enjoyment sometimes end in tragedy. In fine summer weather, people who may not have much experience in this area are tempted to go to sea. I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy's sentiments that anyone can hire a boat and put to sea, and while I do not want to be a spoilsport, I am conscious of tragedies which have occurred and the great sadness that is brought on many families. A competence certificate should be produced before a boat can be released. I appeal again, as I have done so often this year, to all of those who are involved either in selling or renting these boats to ensure that people who are purchasing or renting can handle such craft at sea. That is absolutely essential. I do not want to witness again what we have seen in the recent past.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources if his attention has been drawn to the fury surrounding the publication of the investigation into the sinking in September 1992 of the Irish registered Orchidee by the Agena which resulted in the death of the crew members and led to criminal convictions of two of the French crew; if his attention has further been drawn to the dissatisfaction with the report and its conclusions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this is an extremely sensitive matter and understandably so for the families of the deceased members of the crew of the <i>Orchidee</i>, Mr. Jimmy Power and Mr. Bobby Doran.</P>
      <P>I saw the reported comments and these concerns were explored in detail at a lengthy meeting with the Power and Doran families held in my Department on 29 September last. The principal concern of the families is that the report and the media commentary on the report is open to the interpretation that both vessels were at fault in the tragic accident which occurred.</P>
      <P>It is not the purpose of the report, however, to attribute fault as such to any party but rather to identify what happened and if the accident could have been avoided. It is very important, if further accidents of this type are to be avoided, that the lessons of the tragic loss of the <i>Orchidee</i> are brought home to the owners and crews of all vessels.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, it was not the purpose of the report to apportion blame as between the parties. However, without in any way seeking to qualify the findings in the report, it seems it would be entirely wrong to draw an inference that both parties were equally at fault. On the contrary, it is my strong opinion, having considered all the circumstances of the case, that the Irish vessel, which was almost stationary in the water and which was struck at speed at night by another larger vessel on which proper watch was not being maintained, was a passive party to the accident and in that sense was in no way responsible for causing the accident. I am conveying these views to the families and I hope it will be of some solace to them in coping with the tragic losses they have had to endure.</P>

      <P>This unfortunate tragedy occurred in September 1992, over seven years ago. I am sure the release of the report brought the sad tragedy back to the minds of both families. Why did this report take seven years? Given that two of the French fishermen were convicted by the French courts of negligence, surely it would be only right and fitting for the report to firmly establish that the French fishermen were responsible for what happened, as was clearly proven in court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> The Minister of State is emotionally involved in this, in that he knows the family of one of the fishermen, and that he crusaded for the release of the report. However, a criticism has been made that the investigator from his Department did not inspect the vessel in Dunmore East and that if he had done so he would have clearly established that the damage was done on the port side of the vessel and not head on, as was claimed in the report. Will the Minister of State clarify the situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question related to why it took so long to publish the report. The Deputy is right that I have been heavily involved in this incident since it occurred seven years ago. It was a traumatic time for all the families and for all the fishermen fishing out of Kilmore, Duncannon and Dunmore East.</P>
      <P>The French maritime authorities decided in October 1992 to proceed with a judicial inquiry rather than a technical inquiry by a surveyor. As the judicial inquiry resulted in criminal proceedings being brought against two crew members of the French vessel, as the Deputy rightly said, and the matter, therefore, became <i>sub judice</i> in Irish terms, the investigation being carried out by the surveyor from the Department's marine survey office was necessarily suspended while awaiting the outcome of the French proceedings. It was only after these proceedings were completed that details were received which enabled the Irish inquiry to be completed in December 1997. As is standard practice in these matters, the report of the investigation was then forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for legal advice, prior to being made public.</P>
      <P>During that period I contacted the French Embassy, the then Minister for the Marine and the then Foreign Minister every other day asking for this to be speeded up. It is possibly as a result of the delay experienced in this instance that accidents will now be investigated and reported on in a much shorter timeframe.</P>
      <P>In regard to the accident itself, the report states pretty well everything that happened. I am personally satisfied with the report's findings in relation to what happened. I have facilitated meetings for the Doran and Power families with the Department officials. I am quite satisfied that, in light of my very strong statement today, while the families will not be happy, they will be satisfied with the outcome of this.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>and Natural Resources the number of hectares planted under forestry in 1998; if it is in line with the target set out in the Government approved strategic plan; and the percentage of the total planted in 1998 undertaken by individual farmers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The total area of new afforestation grant aided by my Department in 1998 was 12,928 hectares, of which 8,923 hectares were planted by farmers, which is about 70 per cent of the total. The planting targets set in the strategic plan for the forestry sector are 25,000 hectares annually to the year 2000 and 20,000 hectares annually thereafter to the year 2035.</P>
      <P>Proposals for substantial increases in the level of afforestation grants and loss of income premiums have been submitted to the European Commission. At a meeting with Commissioner Fischler last week, the Minister stressed the importance of an early and positive response to the Irish proposals. Follow-up discussions at official level will be held shortly. Increases in the level of financial support are essential if planting levels are to be brought in line with targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that farmers are dismayed by the delay caused by the EU not giving the green light to the Department to go ahead with the new forestry premiums? This has a disastrous result. The REP scheme is now more attractive than the forestry premiums and it has a detrimental effect on the acreage being planted.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on the Government's target of 25,000 hectares that only 12,928 hectares were planted in 1998. The industry is in dire straits. It will not take off and the targets will not be met until a substantial increase in forestry grants is announced. We will lose another year's planting if this is not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The air of dismay among farmers at the recent National Ploughing Championships in Cork was alarming. The alarm bells are ringing. There will be no increase in the hectares planted until the Department gives a definite lead on what the increases will be. A farmer cannot be expected to <Col N="1110" /> commit to a 30 year afforestation scheme until he knows what he will get for it, because he will have to borrow money in those circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the ploughing championships, although I did not see the Deputy there, and I met many people there. I visited all the stands relating to forestry, which I was happy to see were all in one location this year because of my initiative in that regard. It is their view that there is tremendous interest in forestry this year. That is probably because there is a fairly clear indication that the grant for forestry will increase substantially. I hope to be in a position to announce that in the very near future. I accept what the Deputy said about how we are not meeting the target, but I intend to come very close to that target in the next year. I know I am under pressure to tell the people the grants are available. That will happen in the next fortnight.</P>
      <P>Regarding the REP scheme, some schemes compete with forestry. Forestry is a tremendous alternative to conventional farming, especially on poorer soils. The income from forestry lasts for 20 years and is tax free. Farmers should consider it carefully as an alternative, especially given that the new grants will be greatly in excess of those provided under the REPS programme. An investment in forestry is a tremendous one for the country, albeit after 40 years, and I encourage farmers to become involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State consider the 20 year premium to be too short and does he agree it should be extended to 30 years because some forests will not be ready for felling until after that time? Will the Minister of State extend the premium to include forestry growth up to then? What will farmers do for an income after the 20 year term has expired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant aid will be for 20 years. Following &ndash; or maybe even before &ndash; that, a thinning operation will be carried out in forests where small logs will be removed. A number of processing factories take such logs. There will be an income from forests from 20 years on, and a substantial one at clear felling stage.</P>

In the context of the negotiations on the allocations of moneys within the national plan, I am working with my colleagues to ensure the fisheries sector is given a high priority to ensure a sustainable and vibrant future for the seafood industry and the communities it supports. I am pleased to have the full backing and commitment of BIM in the task of delivering on that strategic objective for the sector. The BIM plan for 2000-06 is an invaluable input into the challenging task of delivering a sustainable future for the industry and coastal communities.</P>
      <P>The fleet, processing, aquaculture and ancillary service sectors already support jobs for 16,000 people in areas where there are few alternative employment opportunities. The sector is worth £300 million per annum to the national economy and seafood exports are now valued at some £250 million. The achievements to date underline the significant potential for further growth in this indigenous natural resource based sector which will deliver jobs and growth, especially in peripheral coastal communities.</P>
      <P>Existing development strategies have focused on the modernisation and renewal of the fleet, the continued sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector, expansion in onshore processing and the development of fishery harbours' infrastructure and aquaculture landing places. Much remains to be done and the immediate challenge is to position the sector firmly to deliver on its recognised economic potential and development needs into the next millennium, with EU Structural Funds support.</P>

The Deputy might glean from that that I am keen to ensure the future of aquaculture in Wexford, Cork and around the coast because tremendous potential exists for the industry. I assure the Deputy that, while the impact of regionalisation has not been clearly defined, it is clear that areas in the Objective One region will receive higher levels of support. In the context of the fisheries sector, the industry is concentrated along the western seaboard, which will have Objective One status. Nevertheless, some very important fishery areas will be included in the Objective One in transition region, such as the Deputy's and mine.

      <P>The action group which I have recently established to carry out a comprehensive review of the safe use of small recreational craft, including jet skis and fast power craft, includes representatives of relevant agencies and Departments as well as nominees from the broad spectrum of the marine leisure sector. The review will cover the use of recreational water craft throughout the country in both coastal waters and in all inland waterways, including lakes, rivers and canals.</P>
      <P>The broad range of representation chosen will ensure the necessary level of expertise required to tackle the important subject at hand. The action group will engage in a full consultation process which will provide the opportunity for interested parties or organisations to put forward their views and ideas. In this regard, an advertisement has already been placed in the national press inviting submissions to the group by 27 October 1999. Indeed, the first stage of this consultative process took place on Monday last in Athlone where a seminar was held by the Marine Institute on jet skis and fast power craft. I understand that members of the action group attended and played an active part in the seminar. There are 23 members on the group, including the chairman, and I am arranging to have the full list of membership circulated for Deputies' information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference for the action group are: to determine the current extent, nature and trends of usage of small powered recreational craft, including jet skis, by location, user characteristics, accidents and issues arising etc.; assess and review the adequacy of existing legislation and practice governing the use for personal purposes of such craft; review best practice in other jurisdictions on how to ensure maximum safety for persons using such craft and other water users arising from the use of these craft; and, make recommendations on a best practice model for introduction in Ireland having regard to the overriding necessity to avoid accident and loss of life, the need to avoid nuisance or distress to other water users, the need to have an <Col N="1114" /> adequate policing regime and the need to avoid undue bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The group should submit an interim report by mid-November 1999 and a final report by end February 2000. The interim report will make recommendations on the form of any necessary framework legislation. The final report will include proposals for any necessary regulations and other measures needed to establish a best practice regime in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the House previously, the French authorities initiated a health alert last January arising from two apparent outbreaks of illness in September 1998. These events were allegedly associated with the consumption of mussels exported from Ireland. My Department, in co-operation with the other relevant State agencies, has pursued this matter vigorously with the French authorities and the European Commission to establish conclusively the association, if any, of Irish mussels with the alleged outbreaks of illness. Despite numerous requests, there was a considerable delay in the provision by the French authorities of an epidemiological report on the reported events of September 1998.</P>
      <P>A brief epidemiological report was received at the end of June. I am advised, however, that it gives insufficient data in relation to the alleged incidents. My Department is, therefore, pressing for more comprehensive information which would allow definite conclusions to be drawn in relation to the reported outbreaks of illness. I would like to assure the Deputy that contact will be maintained at all appropriate levels with the French authorities until this matter has been definitively and satisfactorily resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is amazing that we have had two alleged outbreaks of DSP as a result of alleged incidents involving Irish mussels as far back as September 1998? I received a reply on this matter on 23 June last in which the Minister stated that he was making vigorous requests of the French Government for a report on this alleged outbreak. Some 600 tonnes of mussels were locked up because of this alleged outbreak. Is it not deplorable that France, an EU member state, is allowing such disdain to prevail and is failing to produce an epidemiological report on this incident which dates back more than a year ago? The French authorities have acted disgracefully by bringing the credibility of the shellfish industry into disrepute. We are entitled to receive this report. Will the Minister <Col N="1116" /> quantify the loss to the shellfish industry as a result of these two alleged outbreaks which were supposed to have occurred in September 1998? Will the Minister impress on the French Embassy our entitlement to such a report?</P>

      <P>It is difficult to disagree with anything the Deputy said. I assure him that if we do not receive the necessary and final information within one month, I will visit France to speak to my counterpart there. It is a very unsatisfactory situation. The Deputy asked me to quantify the losses. I cannot do so at this stage but I will certainly convey the information my Department has to the Deputy as soon as I can. I understand 230 tonnes of the withdrawn product were released for sale following testing. That means 350 tonnes remains, although some of it may have been destroyed. It is essential that we have the information as soon as possible to ensure we can make a final decision on this matter. It is the first item on the agenda of my meetings with my officials, who are vigorously following this up in Europe and France but, to date, to no avail. If nothing happens within one month, I will follow this matter up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The global market for herring continues to be weak. The problem is due mainly to difficulties in the Russian economy. My Department and BIM are working closely with the Irish fish processors and exporters to maximise all possible market openings for Irish herring, notably in eastern Europe. In this regard, of particular advantage has been the recent appointment of a pelagic market co-ordinator who is now working with the industry to further develop market co-ordination and co-operative strategies for the herring industry.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on the Management and Marketing of Herring recommended a series of measures, including the appointment of the pelagic market co-ordinator, to maintain and enhance the Irish herring exports in the very difficult global environment. All these recommendations have already been implemented or are in progress, including quality development programmes for the fleet and herring processors, an industry marketing group, market research and new product development. These initiatives will help the industry through the present difficult market and position it well for development in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present scenario the Department is also working with the industry to ensure use is made, as appropriate, of the existing EU market support <Col N="1117" /> schemes. The schemes allow for withdrawal of herring from the market when the minimum withdrawal price for sale is not reached and the payment of a subsidy where product is held over with a view to reintroducing it to the market at a later stage. On a European level, I have raised the difficulties being experienced in the Irish herring market at my recent meeting with the Commissioner and the EU Presidency. I emphasised the need to have the market experience taken fully into account in the determination of tariff rates for the import of herring into the Community.</P>

      <i>
      </i>While I accept that the herring market remains difficult, this is due primarily to external factors over which we have no control.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister failed to tell me what action his Department has taken on the recommendations of the task force, which he set up last year. Furthermore, he must realise the price of herrings has fallen from £450 per tonne to £100 per tonne or less. They are now only going to the fish meal plant. Fishermen are in dire straits and the herring fishing industry is in a shambles because Norway, which is not in the EU, has caused a glut in the market. Has the Minister contacted the EU Fisheries Commissioner to inquire about the process whereby Norway can capitalise on the herring industry while member states cannot do so? The Minister should call an urgent meeting with the EU Fisheries Commissioner to ensure something is done to stabilise the price of herring. We seem to have completely forgotten about it&mdash;</P>

      <P>Who me? The red herring helped me out a little. I cannot disagree with much of what Deputy Sheehan said. It is a weak Minister who blames another country for their ills but we are having difficulties with the Russian market. The Russian economy, which was one of our largest markets, is not strong and has fallen asunder. We are making genuine attempts and have fol<Col N="1118" /> lowed all the initiatives the Deputy suggested today and I hope we will achieve some success. The roe of herring has increased in price and that, in some way, will redress the balance, but it is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about herring imports into the EU. We were successful in reducing the quantity of herring which could be imported tariff free into the Community this year, which was strongly recommended by the task force. I also made it clear during my recent meeting with the Commissioner, Franz Fischler, that further imports of herring into the EU are completely unjustifiable at a time when EU supplies are up and prices are down. My objective is to abolish tax free quotas of herring.</P>

In relation to the Dutch market, I am reliably informed that herring from this part of the world is not large enough, and that is what caused that problem.</P>

      <P>A feasibility study on the development of Dungarvan harbour was forwarded to my Department by Dungarvan Urban District Council last year. This study, which followed on from an earlier report on the condition of the harbour wall, focused in particular on how the harbour might be developed to service marine tourism and leisure activities. It recommended a range of works with an estimated total cost of £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has now been advised by the urban district council that a further study on the development of the harbour has been completed and will be forwarded shortly.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched, on behalf of the Marine Institute, an important report setting out the investment needs over the period 2000-6 of the water-based tourism and leisure sector. The report proposed an investment programme of £130 million for infrastructure, product development, marketing/awareness, training, environmental management and technical assistance.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the Special European Council in Tampere from 15 to 16 October 1999 with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who deputised for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As has become almost traditional at this point, I held a bilateral meeting with <Col N="1122" /> Prime Minister Blair on the eve of the summit at which we reviewed the agenda for Tampere and, of course, the current situation in Northern Ireland and the progress of the review being undertaken by Senator Mitchell.</P>
      <P>The Council was addressed by the President of the European Parliament, Madame Nicole Fontaine. This was her first attendance at the European Council since her election and she spoke on a variety of issues of concern to the Parliament including justice and home affairs, the role of Parliament in drafting the European Charter, the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the promotion of better relations between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.</P>
      <P>With the adoption of economic and monetary union, and the completion of the Single Market and the resulting freedom of movement across the internal borders of the Union, it is almost inevitable that the next major challenge for the EU would be to accelerate the process of convergence in the justice and home affairs area. With an increasing, amount of intra-Union business being conducted, with leisure and business travel rising and with growing numbers of member state nationals resident in other member states. the issues of protection, assistance and access to redress, in both civil and criminal matters. clearly need to be addressed. This was the primary goal of the Tampere Summit. The holding of this Special Council sends out clear messages: first, to the Union's citizens that their leaders are listening and acting upon their concerns and second, to the rest of the world about the values and aspirations of the Union.</P>
      <P>The core agenda for Tampere had three main elements: a common EU asylum and migration policy, a genuine European area of justice and a Union-wide fight against crime. Decisions were taken on a package of measures that will be of lasting benefit to the citizen. While there will be the opportunity to examine particular aspects of the progress being made at each European Council meeting, I fully supported the decision to review the entire area at our meeting in December 2001. I will also touch on a number of other issues towards the end of this statement, such as the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Enlargement, which arose in our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum and migration policy is an area of great complexity and one in which member states have been forced to resort to unilateral actions in recent years. However, as demonstrated by the scale of the tragedies of Bosnia and Kosovo, no individual member state can, on its own, satisfactorily resolve the problems which arise in dealing with asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. Equally, this is an area where action by a single state can impact directly on other member states, for instance, leading to waves of secondary migration within the Union. Unfortunately, in the past 14 years, since co-operation in this field began, only one significant legal instrument, the Dublin Convention, has been agreed. Given the <Col N="1123" /> increase in numbers seeking asylum and refugee status and subsidiary forms of temporary protection, it is clearly time for the Union to act.</P>
    <P>It is important that our discussions of this topic at Tampere and thereafter are seen to be routine and the exercise by leaders of their duty to manage asylum policy and migration flows into and within the Union. Prior to the summit there were some fears among the various NGOs who work in this area that a so-called &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; approach would result from Tampere. These fears were expressed directly to me in submissions and at meetings between officials of my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with representatives of organisations such as UNHCR, Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Refugees.</P>
    <P>Examination of the conclusions shows that these fears were unfounded. Instead, along with all our partners, I insisted that the Union's policies should be grounded in the spirit of the Geneva refugee convention and that, to the extent that harmonisation of admission, reception, integration and other procedures occurs, it should be undertaken in consultation with the relevant institutions, especially the UNHCR and NGOs.</P>
    <P>The Commission which, with the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, has new powers of initiative in this area has been asked to bring forward proposals to allow for the establishment of a common European asylum system. The system is to include clear rules and common standards as to the state responsible for processing asylum applications and receiving asylum seekers. It will also seek to codify refugee status and subsidiary forms of temporary protection.</P>
    <P>The conclusions reflect the real concern of EU leaders that, along with the procedures for the better management of asylum and migration, such as Eurodac, which are by their nature control orientated, the Union should be seen to tackle in a genuine way the issue of the integration of those who have come to its territories. The treatment of third country nationals by the Governments of member states should be fair and be seen to be so if we are to combat racism and xenophobia. Member states are encouraged to draw up national programmes to combat discrimination and we in Ireland, with the coming into force of the Employment Equality Act and enactment in the near future of the Equal Status Bill, will be ahead of a number of countries in this field. It is noteworthy that EU leaders called for third country nationals to be granted rights in all member states, as close as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens. The conclusions also endorse the proposal that long-term legally resident third country nationals should have the opportunity to gain citizenship.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, as was demonstrated during the Kosovan and Bosnian crises, mass movements of refugees have cost implications for all member states. While Ireland received some funding <Col N="1124" /> toward the cost of accommodating those from Kosovo, an <i>ad hoc</i> approach is not appropriate. Accordingly, I fully supported the proposal to consider the establishment of a financial reserve that would be available to assist member states in such circumstances and I would have preferred a concrete decision on this point.</P>
    <P>We are all too familiar with the complexity of the legal system in this country and the high costs that can arise in pursuing cases or claims. The difficulties can be magnified many times when cases have to be pursued in other jurisdictions within the Union. As I indicated in my opening remarks, the frequency with which such cases occur is rising as the volume of intra-Union trade grows, and the number of EU citizens working and living outside their home country increases. Clearly the simplification of legal procedures offers some scope to alleviate the problem but much more is necessary by way of mutual recognition of court decisions, and harmonisation and approximation of legislation. There are very different constitutional and legal traditions across the Union and so it would not be feasible at this point, for instance, to take on a global programme of harmonisation. However, priority areas such as family law and small business claims have been identified for early action.</P>
    <P>A number of key actions were identified at Tampere which will assist the ordinary citizen in accessing the legal system of their own and other member states. These include the publication of user guides on judicial co-operation and the legal systems of member states, the establishment of easily accessible information systems and the production of multilingual forms and documents. The Council also called on the Commission to bring forward proposals to establish minimum standards in relation to adequate legal aid in trans-national cases.</P>
    <P>Another area where minimum standards are to be established is in relation to the rights of victims of crime. We have experienced a very positive reaction in Ireland to the recently published Victims' Charter and look forward, therefore, to the introduction of minimum standards across the Union on the protection of victims and the provision of assistance to them. The proposed minimum standards will also cover the issue of access to appropriate compensation. In relation to the longer term issues of convergence in the civil law area, the Council called for a report by 2001 on approximation of legislation.</P>
    <P>The creation of the European area of justice which I have outlined, at least as far as the criminal area is concerned, is focused very much on dealing with situations which have occurred, namely, with the successful prosecution of crime. However, clearly the prevention and detection of crime, particularly organised crime, is a matter where Union-wide action is needed. There are a number of successful mechanisms in place, such as Europol, the European Judicial Network, mutual legal assistance, Interpol and the joint action adopted by the Council, making it a criminal <Col N="1125" /> offence to participate in a criminal organisation in the member states of the European Union. In Tampere, however, we examined ways to build on these and develop new instruments, procedures and institutions.</P>
    <P>In relation to crime prevention at local level, we have a very useful community-based model in the form of the Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes and the drugs task forces. These models should be examined with a view to strengthening them because they focus on the crime, much of which is drug related, which directly impacts on the ordinary person. Through the network of national crime prevention authorities which is to be established, we can share our experience with our partners and learn from the successful crime prevention strategies they have implemented. The proposal for a Community funded programme of co-operation between national bodies, aimed at tackling juvenile, urban and drug-related crime in the first instance, is to be examined and is one I would strongly support.</P>
    <P>At national and cross-border level, the Council called for the investigative teams provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty to be set up without delay. These would focus on trafficking in drugs and human beings and terrorism and would be supported by Europol. Furthermore, a task force of European police chiefs is to be established which would also work with Europol in tackling cross-border crime. Events in Ireland demonstrate the utility of such actions and show the value of such teams.</P>
    <P>These measures are part of a package which involves the strengthening over time of Europol and its greater involvement with authorities at national level in the conduct of joint investigations of cross-border crime. Similarly, the establishment of EUROJUST is to be welcomed. It will bring together prosecuting authorities, magistrates, judges and police personnel to support and co-ordinate the prosecution of organised crime. The necessary legal instrument is to be brought forward by the end of 2001. I welcome the proposal to develop a European police college which will begin its life as a network of existing colleges and importantly, in view of the Union's impending enlargement, allow for the participation of the relevant bodies in the applicant states. In relation to action against drugs, we have seen the implementation of the Commission's action plan up to the year 2000 dealing with demand reduction, and the Council called for the adoption before Helsinki of the 2000-04 European strategy against drugs.</P>
    <P>The European Council wanted to give particular impetus to combating money laundering, given its relationship with so many aspects of organised crime. I outlined in some detail the success we have experienced in Ireland from the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. I indicated that the integrated approach of police, taxation and welfare personnel working together and supported by appropriate legislation had lead <Col N="1126" /> to the successful seizure of criminal assets and prosecutions. I mentioned that the financial action task force of the Group of Seven, G7, suggested that the Criminal Assets Bureau could serve as a model for other countries. I am pleased to report that the conclusions call for the approximation of criminal law in regard to the tracing, freezing and confiscation of funds.</P>
    <P>Ireland is at the forefront of tackling money laundering and will shortly, by way of regulation, given the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, extend reporting obligations to additional professions such as solicitors, auctioneers, estate agents and accountants, irrespective of any decision at EU level to extend the scope of the 1991 money laundering directive. We will press for the extension of the directive to these professions and for the early adoption of the extension.</P>
    <P>The issue of so-called &ldquo;safe havens&rdquo; must be tackled urgently if the Union's actions are not to be undermined. I welcome the signals given by the UK at the informal Justice Council of 11 October of its willingness to deal with the problems posed by Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>President Prodi has suggested that a score board system, similar to that employed in relation to the Single Market, should be used to monitor the progress of convergence across the whole justice and home affairs area. This is an approach I welcomed as it identifies in a very public way the areas of progress and where the obstacles lie. It will be recalled that in June last the Cologne European Council decided that a European charter of fundamental rights should be developed. At Tampere, the nature of the body to be charged with the formulation of the charter was endorsed. The body will consist of 62 members. Sixteen of these will be drawn from the European Parliament, 30 will be drawn from the national parliaments, 15 will be representatives of Heads of State and Government, and there will be a representative of President Prodi. A number of other institutions and representative groups will attend as observers or be consulted, as will the applicant states.</P>
    <P>The body will elect its own President and, when consensus is reached on a final draft, submit the draft charter to the European Council for adoption. The aim of the charter is to bring together, in a single politically binding declaration, all the fundamental rights applicable at Union level to make these rights more visible to the citizens of the Union.</P>
    <P>Two days before the summit, the Commission published its report on the enlargement process, which included detailed country by country analysis of the current status of each of the 12 applicant states and Turkey. No decisions will be taken on enlargement until the Helsinki Council. Tampere, however, offered a useful opportunity for Leaders to note the ongoing progress and to consider informally the matters they will discuss in December. I welcomed the report and the pro<Col N="1127" /> posed revised arrangements for the conduct of the negotiations with individual applicants.</P>
    <P>The Tampere Summit, taking place as it did in the immediate aftermath of the <i>coup d' état</i> in Pakistan and the rejection by the US Senate of the proposal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, provided an opportunity for the European Council to make known its views and two separate declarations on these matters were also issued at the conclusion of the Council. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, will address these matters in his contribution. The ongoing resolution of the situation in East Timor and the conflict in Chechnya were also discussed by Heads of State and Government during their working dinner.</P>
    <P>Two other current events were noted at Tampere, the taking up of his new post, as Secretary General of the Council-High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, by Mr. Javier Solana on Monday of this week and the retirement of Mr. Jurgen Trumpf as Secretary General to the Council. I had the opportunity to mark Mr. Trumpf's departure and thank him on behalf of the Government during his recent visit to Dublin when he accompanied Prime Minister Lipponen.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Lipponen and his colleagues are to be congratulated on the outcome of the summit. It was a difficult task for a country holding its first Presidency but, as one would expect of the Finnish, the task was taken on enthusiastically and, on foot of thorough preparation, completed successfully. I am confident the summit will be remembered as a watershed in the Union's dealings in this area and I look forward to similarly positive outcomes from the Helsinki Summit in December.</P>

      <P>The Tampere Summit in many regards has its origin in the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 1996, where we stated that safe streets should be one of the objectives of European action. That led directly to the provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty which, in turn, formed the basis of the decisions which were taken at Tampere. The European Union must show that it is relevant to its citizens and one way in which it can do that is by dealing with day to day problems they face.</P>
      <P>As any public representative will be aware, drugs and crime are prominent concerns in the minds of Irish people, not just in urban areas but now increasingly in rural areas also. Drugs are a pervasive problem directed at children and young people. A small tablet changing hands for a few pounds in a teenage disco in rural Ireland may seem peripheral to global crime but it is not. Every illicit drug deal, no matter how small in value, fuels a global international criminal system which is imposing chains on the future of our people. Drugs are about money, illegally earned money, and where there is a drug trade there is also money laundering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I welcome the decisions taken at the European Council at Tampere. We must recognise that, as the US Treasury Secretary pointed out recently, the activities of the Russian Mafia now represent a threat to the integrity of the global financial system and to our civilisation. The recent allegations that up to $10 billion in suspected Russian funds were laundered through accounts in the Bank of New York are very serious.</P>
    <P>Some estimates suggest that almost half the entire wealth of the world is held in offshore bank accounts. Offshore banking of course has legitimate purposes. Offshore holding companies can enable multinational companies to exploit international markets effectively and this helps them achieve tax effectiveness in a legitimate way, but not all offshore banking has such a benign purpose, as we will be aware from the offshore banking activities of the Nazis in Switzerland during the World War II.</P>

      <P>Or a bit closer to home, but these were moneys obtained from the gold in the fillings of Jews, who were being roasted in the concentration camps, which Nazis placed in Swiss banks.</P>
      <P>The laundering of money from criminals has become a highly professional business. Educated, sophisticated, suave people are engaged in this activity. Highly qualified bankers, accountants and lawyers are providing their services to criminals. Increasingly, criminals are not all crude people with accents which would be strange in this House. Increasingly, they are sophisticated, well spoken people who are just criminal in their purpose and activity.</P>
      <P>While only between 3 and 4 per cent of the world's population use illicit drugs, the world trade of $400 million in these drugs is equivalent to 8 per cent of international trade. The world's illicit drugs trade is now bigger than the trade in iron and steel and about as big as the trade in textiles. The profit margins in the drugs trade are enormous. The gross profit margins at retail level for crack cocaine and heroin are 300 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The drugs trade has become so powerful that it can override sovereign states. The money at the disposal of individual drug barons now exceeds the gross national product of countries like Bolivia, Peru, Columbia, Burma and Afghanistan. These people can literally buy and sell states and Governments and they can buy elections in some cases &ndash; we have almost reached that point.</P>
      <P>Only a tiny proportion of the profits of drug production stay in the Third World. The difficulty is that production of the plants which are used for drugs is so much more profitable than other forms of agriculture. It is only by making the necessary investment in infrastructure in countries, such as Peru, Bolivia, Columbia, Afghanistan and Burma, for the distribution of&mdash;</P>

      <P>This criminal trade begets corruption, which is becoming a major concern of the International Monetary Fund. Despite the successes of the Criminal Assets Bureau, Irish legislation on money laundering, although quite up to date, is not comprehensive. For example, the purchase of a single premium life assurance policy has become increasingly popular as a way of shifting money but insurance brokers are not covered by the current requirements to report suspicious transactions of this nature. Buying property is another way of laundering money and estate agents are not currently required to report transactions. Equally, lawyers who handle money are not covered by the current legislation. Therefore, while we have every reason to congratulate ourselves on the effectiveness of the legislation which was pioneered by Deputies Quinn and Owen, as Ministers, and others, we must recognise that there are gaps still to be filled in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Moriarty and Flood tribunals are engaging in retrospective analyses of what happened in the past. It is appropriate to attribute blame, but it is also appropriate to develop a constructive programme of action for the future to avoid a recurrence of these sorts of activity. One of the issues, about which I have been concerned and in which Deputy Flanagan of the Fine Gael Party has been particularly active, is that of modernising our corruption legislation. The legislation against corrupt activities by politicians, planning officers or people in any area who are capable of trafficking influence consists of the Sale of Offices Act, 1809, an Act concerning corruption, and amending legislation passed in 1916. Therefore, 1916 is the date of the most recent Irish corruption legislation. That legislation was not passed here but in Westminster during the Great War because of concern about war profiteering, which was a matter of great interest to Lloyd George. In the long period of sovereign Irish statehood we have not passed any legislation to deal with corruption in terms of shifting the burden of proof or establishing greater clarity as to the types of activity that would create a presumption of corrupt motive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme agreed at Tampere was comprehensive and deserves support. I am glad work is to be done not just on mutual recognition of judgments but also on some common guidelines for free legal aid. It is important that people have a system that is not only theoretically but financially accessible. As regards substantive law, that is civil law, an overall study is to be requested to approximate the civil law of all the member states of the European Union. The Council is to have a report on this matter in 2001, which is not much more than 18 months away. This must rate as the single biggest task ever undertaken by the European Union. It is a huge but necessary task and while I wish everyone well, I wonder if the Euro<Col N="1130" /> pean Union has the resources and capacity to do this type of work. It will require tremendous effort, not just because of the diversity of the provisions of the civil law in different member countries but the very different jurisprudential assumptions that are made by countries in the way they apply the law and interpret particular legal concepts. I strongly welcome the proposals for EUROJUST, a proposed co-ordination of European prosecutors which will run in parallel with Europol which is already operating in the police field.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a degree of uniformity with regard to bank confidentiality. As we know through the various tribunals, we are now going behind bank confidentiality with regard to specific concerns. It is fair to say that some countries have much more protective approaches to confidentiality than others, Luxembourg being a case in point. Unless there can be agreement on this, the banking systems of the countries that maintain the maximum confidentiality, regardless of the public concerns that might require confidentiality to be set aside, will attract deposits from other countries. People should not profit from that. It is important that issue be dealt with and confronted honestly by heads of governments. I would be interested to hear from the Government how far we have got with that.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of the summit is in regard to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. I note that at Tampere a body has been established to draw up this charter. It will consist of 62 members, 16 of whom will be drawn from the European Parliament, 30 from national parliaments, 15 from representatives of heads of governments and a representative of President Prodi. Have the heads of government of the European Union ever heard of the Council of Europe? Is the Council of Europe not the body that contains the existing fundamental law? Why is the European Union setting up a body to draw up a new charter of fundamental rights and leaving the Council of Europe out of it? Surely the Council of Europe, which already has in its membership most if not all the countries applying to join the European Union, should be closely associated with any body of this kind? Is it the case that the institutional jealousy that exists between the civil service of the European Commission and that of the European Union is such that the jealous Commission people do not want to let the Council of Europe in on the act? If that is the case, it should not be allowed. Why did this happen? I have experience of the Council of Europe. I will not overstate its wonderfulness; it is an intergovernmental body and, therefore, moves extremely slowly because it moves at the speed of the lowest mover in the trail, so to speak. It has 50 years of work behind it. It existed before the European Union was created. It was created under a treaty in 1949 and has a very effective record in human rights. On a number of occasions it has made judgments against the Government <Col N="1131" /> and forced it to change the law. It has tremendous moral force. What is the European Union doing setting up a separate charter of fundamental freedoms that does not include the Council of Europe in the drawing up of it let alone take account of what has already been achieved by it? I do not expect an answer to the other questions I posed, but I hope the Minister of State will reply to that one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tampere summit was the first dedicated to the discussion of what is known in Eurospeak as the third pillar or justice and home affairs in everyday parlance. A summit dedicated to these issues was made possible by the final ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty by France. The third pillar was established by the Maastricht Treaty and inaugurated meetings of justice and home affairs Ministers meeting outside the Council of Europe framework.</P>
      <P>The further development of the third pillar was one of the key arguments advanced by supporters of European integration at the time of the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty. The incorporation of many of its elements such as police co-operation against international organised crime, co-operation on emigration issues and overall judicial co-operation, were held out as indications of the European Union being prepared to tackle issues of concern and interest to its citizens. The purpose of the Tampere summit, as I understand it, was to ensure that the possibilities opened up by the Amsterdam Treaty to make the Union a place where its citizens and others can move freely and safely within it while, at the same time, protecting them from those who would use these freedoms for malicious ends. Hence the concentration at Tampere on crime and interest in agencies such as the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau which has proved to be a very successful organisation in tackling organised crime and drug gangs in particular.</P>
      <P>There was welcome agreement to increase the resources available to Europol and the significance of data pooling between member states; discussions on the compatibility of the legal codes of individual member states and the establishment of a charter of victims' rights. However, none of these proposals represents brand new ground for the Union but more work in progress than anything earth-shatteringly new. Nonetheless, the emphasis on the victims of crime is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I raised with the Taoiseach in the House yesterday, there remains a space to be carved out within our judicial system between the absolute independence of our prosecution systems and the need for some accountability for overall policy direction. Before I turn to the two items that warranted most publicity from the summit, I put on record a welcome for the proposal to begin work on a draft charter of fundamental human rights. The proposal to involve national parliaments in this exercise is also to be welcomed, yet it will be <Col N="1132" /> rendered ineffective without the accompanying intention to give real effect to any charter that is developed. I support the observations made by Deputy Bruton on the existence not only of a European charter of human rights but an effective court with an established corpus of jurisprudence and enforcement, indeed the transposing into domestic law, for which this country has some direct experience, of an existing system embodying the existing members of the European Union and, by definition, the applicant or potential applicant members states.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Bruton's request for a response, either today or at some future date, from the Taoiseach or the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, regarding whether the existence of such an institution or set of institutions was a matter for discussion at Tampere and whether we are now attempting to re-invent the wheel because of what Deputy Bruton described as &ldquo;institutional jealousy&rdquo;. In that context, I would welcome a commitment to incorporate into any charter of rights developed in respect of the European treaties at the next revision something that is tangible and real and to which European citizens can relate.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a coincidence that a summit which concentrated a great deal of its time on the issues of asylum and immigration also dealt with a report prepared by those individuals who have become known colloquially as the &ldquo;three wise men&rdquo;. As Christmas approaches it is interesting to note that the original three wise men were migrants. The Bible does not inform us whether they remained in Bethlehem but they travelled a long distance to witness a new truth as they perceived it. Perhaps we should have regard to that historical reality.</P>
    <P>While the summit's conclusions in respect of asylum and immigration push all the right buttons, so to speak, the conclusions, for example, refer to freedoms that &ldquo;should not be regarded as the exclusive preserve of the Union's own citizens. Its very existence acts as a draw to many others worldwide who cannot enjoy the freedom Union citizens take for granted. It would be in contradiction with Europe's traditions to deny such freedom to those whose circumstances lead them justifiably to seek access to our territory.&rdquo;  It is difficult to square that position with those adopted prior to the summit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went to Tampere to develop common policies on asylum and immigration. Perhaps some of our European partners have a better idea as to what are Ireland's policies on these issues, but they would do well to inform the Taoiseach and me. The simple truth of the matter is that despite this being an issue of growing importance, the Government has developed no policy at all in respect of it. Indeed, any progressive or reasoned measures seem capable of being taken only against the implacable opposition of the responsible Minister. On yesterday's Order of Business, the Taoiseach stated that the Govern<Col N="1133" /> ment does have a policy in this area. I challenge him to inform us of the nature of that policy. If it does exist, it should be published and debated in the House.</P>
    <P>In that context, there are a number of points I wish to raise. First, legal immigration into this country is running at approximately 20,000 people a year. These people are, for the most part, returning Irish exiles, members of the European Union or American or even Australian students. Their place in the software belts around Dublin, Cork and Limerick is a phenomenon of which we are becoming increasingly aware. Buying a cup of coffee in this city, for example, would be practically impossible if it was not for these new labourers who are doing here what young Irish people have always done and continue to do abroad. If the economy is to continue to grow at its current pace, it is important that it continues to draw this reserve pool of labour. By and large these immigrants are well educated, skilled and English speaking, the kind of immigration described in papers issued by economists in Kenmare at the weekend as that which this country requires.</P>
    <P>Our other so-called immigration problem &ndash; the influx of 20,000 legal immigrants per annum is not deemed to be a problem &ndash; is the arrival of unprecedented numbers of asylum seekers, a term which is also a misnomer. The Government's response appears to be that these people should be spread throughout the country. I refer here to a decision announced either yesterday or earlier this morning. I would like the Government to outline what is meant by this response. The tardiness of this decision answers, in some ways, the question I put to the Taoiseach yesterday. How can he suggest that there is some form of coherent policy in place when the Government is only now recognising the idea that it is not in the interests of both asylum seekers and local communities to be heaped upon each other as they are at present, principally in my constituency and that of the Taoiseach?</P>
    <P>The reality is that a considerable section of these asylum seekers are, in effect, economic migrants, driven from their countries by the kind of economic circumstances that drove tens of thousands of Irish people abroad until very recently. Until the summer we prevented these people from working when they arrived in Ireland and it is too early to judge the merits of that policy change, despite what is being fed to some newspapers by Government sources. There is one point worth making in this regard, namely, that only 11 out of 36 applications have been granted thus far. Whatever was responsible for the upturn in the numbers of asylum seekers, the &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo; continuously referred to by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, even after the decision was made, would not appear to be it. I would also be interested in the Minister's views as to why the number of applications is so low and what efforts he has made <Col N="1134" /> to encourage applications to work from asylum seekers in the country for over six months.</P>
    <P>Principally, however, the Government is faced with a choice. Under international law it is obliged to offer due process to any asylum seeker who makes an application within this jurisdiction; it is entitled to expect other countries to live up to their obligations under the Dublin Convention; it is entitled to deport people, a right which I readily recognise; it is entitled to process applications for asylum speedily and efficiently; and it is certainly entitled to pursue vigorously the callous and uncaring people who traffic in the human misery that is economic migration. However, we must make a decision regarding whether we are going to tolerate any economic immigration at all, with the exception of those who are educated, skilled and, I must say it, white. If we are, we should adopt a proactive approach. Their numbers should be decided upon, they should be assisted to learn English, if necessary, and they should be assisted in finding work, something which, in the current climate, should not prove difficult.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this would constitute an immigration policy, not the <i>ad hoc</i> madness that amounts to one at present. It is not good enough for us to attend European summits and discuss this problem in a European context when we have not even started to address it at home. The reality is probably that a well defined and widely known policy in this area might help resolve some of the difficult ethical questions that surround this issue. However, the appointment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to chair the interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues does not augur well, given the policy fiasco over which he has presided since taking office.</P>
    <P>The Tampere summit was the first attended by the new Commission President, Mr. Prodi, in his official capacity. In preparation for the summit and partially in recognition of the speed at which discussions on enlargement were proceeding, Mr. Prodi had asked those who have become known as the &ldquo;three wise men&rdquo; to prepare a report on the implications for the European Union arising from the impending enlargement. Existing treaty provisions dictate that reform of the existing system &ndash; effectively established, albeit with some modifications, by the foundation of the original European Community &ndash; would not take place until after the next enlargement, with limited reform in the meantime. However, because the first stage of enlargement will probably bring Union membership over the 20 mark, the President seems intent on merging the two staged reform processes envisaged at Amsterdam into one. As the report puts it &ldquo;an effort at comprehensive reform should be undertaken right now.&rdquo;  That report was published after the summit broke up, but comments made in expectation of it figured prominently in the coverage in the aftermath of the summit. As I understand it, it is being <Col N="1135" /> prepared as a primer document for the next intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>It is far too early to be definitive about the report, although some early comments are possible. I welcome, for example, that no attempt is being made to divest each individual member state of a Commissioner. That is a battle successive Governments have fought on behalf of the Republic and their efforts appear to have been successful. The report is correct to point out that the Commission should not and must not amount to an amalgamation of national interests. No state should be satisfied with exclusion from the collective involvement with the body charged with initiating proposals within the Union. Some concern would have to be expressed in the section on the Commission to the significance being attached to the power of the president. As the Commission crisis of earlier this year would seem to indicate, it is particularly important to increase the powers of the Parliament <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Commission and the president himself. As the report points out, there is less to be feared from the extension of qualified majority voting at the Council. The report correctly points out that since the introduction of QMV countries have attempted to avoid it by arriving at consensual decisions. Rather than fracturing the Council, where it applies it seems to have had the opposite effect. It must, however, be repeated that a strong and powerful Commission is very much in the interest of the smaller member states, including Ireland. Increasingly however, that Commission with its additional powers must be made more democratically accountable to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The report contains significant sections on the reorganisation of the treaty text, making the case, as I understand it, for the division of the existing treaty text into two separate sections: a core text and a current policy text. I am aware that this section has already been subject to queries in other places and I would welcome the Minister's observations on it. However, it poses obvious logistical difficulties for Ireland in areas which, under our constitutional amendment on Amsterdam, are required to be referred back to this House. This is a difficult and complex question and I do not expect the Minister to respond to it this afternoon but, given the debate we have had on other matters, some attention needs to be given to it by the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the report is to address issues of institutional reform but one policy area, defence, is picked out for treatment. The issues of security and defence have figured prominently on Council agenda since the Kosovo crisis. The Cologne summit was taken up with the appointment of the so-called &ldquo;Mr. Common Foreign and Security Policy&rdquo; position. The report states that the issue of defence cannot be ignored in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference although the president's scheduling of the next <Col N="1136" /> Intergovernmental Conference may prove to be optimistic.</P>
    <P>One of our national newspapers carried a report citing the Taoiseach as stating that he will have no truck with proposals to move towards a mutual defence arrangement. I am sure people who felt reassured by the Taoiseach's former remarks about the Partnership for Peace view these reassurances in a new light. However, a proposal to incorporate immediately the functions of the Western European Union into the European Union itself is a case of putting the cart before the horse. Mutual defence is not an immediate problem for the European Union, punching its political weight in security crises and bringing its unique experience to bear on real conflict resolution, both long-term and short-term, is an immediate problem. I have stated my preference that the European Union, not NATO, act as whatever regional force is necessary to keep an enforced peace, particularly on this continent. I would prefer to see the European Union rather than some of its individual component states sit at the United Nations Security Council. In the reform of the Security Council we should look at the possibility of enlarging the Security Council and replacing the European individual members, that is France and Britain, with the European Union itself. I have no illusions about how difficult that proposal might be, particularly for the two countries which would have to vacate their seats, but that is the direction in which we should be travelling. This issue will not go away and it should be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>The Tampere summit was a workmanlike summit which will not live long in memory. However, the Union has critical issues to resolve and I am sure progress was made last weekend. For Ireland, the critical problem remains of how we are to retain and even expand our influence as a small member state in an enlarged Union. To do so will require a proactive approach, sadly yet to be seen, from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach indicated in his statement, Tampere was the first occasion on which a special meeting of the European Council was convened for the purpose of considering developments in the field of justice and home affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State respond to the questions raised in the debate or will he merely read a script?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond by saying that the Council of Europe will be an observer and other bodies such as trade unions, employers and other groups will also be consulted. The charter will be a politically binding statement to begin with but, ultimately, it may form the basis for treaty amendments. The rights as set down in the treaty would then be legally exercisable by the Union's citizens. No timescale or decision on treaty incor<Col N="1137" /> poration has been made. The annex to the conclusions sets out who will be observers and who will be consulted on the charter. As this could, in time, become part of our law it was felt necessary to have a group comprised only of European Union members. Given that this is such an important document of fundamental rights aiming at the highest level of fundamental rights, it is important that the body comprise the European Union only and that countries outside the Union should not be involved, other than as observers. That was the thinking behind the setting up of the body and, based on my limited experience of attending Ministers' meetings when the Minister for Foreign Affairs was involved in the Northern Ireland talks, I agree that the organisation should comprise only European Union countries.</P>
      <P>The wide-ranging conclusions adopted by the European Council in the fields of immigration and asylum, the fight against organised crime and the improvement of access to justice for individuals and commercial concerns right across the Community indicates the Unions's determination to come to grips with the increasingly global nature of the problems facing all our societies. The European Council fully recognised that responding effectively to these challenges required an integrated approach which must include close co-operation with the wider international community.</P>
      <P>The decision to convene the European Council and the significant conclusions adopted at Tampere indicate a shared determination to make a reality of the commitment in the Treaty of Amsterdam to create an area of freedom, security and justice within the European Union. The extensive programme of work commissioned by heads of state and Governments and the decision to establish a score card mechanism to monitor implementation are indicative of the unity of purpose among member states and of their determination to ensure that commitments made are translated into practical reality for all our citizens.</P>
      <P>I propose to draw attention to certain aspects of the conclusions at Tampere which will have a particular bearing on the conduct of the Union's relations with third countries, in particular the commitment to work in tandem with developing countries in tackling the root causes of these problems. I will also comment on a number of foreign policy issues which were discussed at Tampere, particularly the military coup in Pakistan and the situation with regard to CTBT. Before doing so, I wish to say something with regard to the charter of fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union, as reaffirmed in the Tampere conclusions, is &ldquo;rooted in a shared commitment to freedom based on human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law&rdquo;. While determined to impose their effectiveness in tackling, on a Union-wide basis, the serious challenges posed by trans-frontier crime, partners were resolved to do so in a manner consistent with their commitment to respect for human rights and freedoms. They wished to ensure that <Col N="1138" /> the European Council would not, as some had feared, be repressive in tone but rather to create an environment consistent with the basic values to which the Union is committed. The comments in the aftermath of the meeting by non-governmental organizations active in the human rights area are encouraging in this regard.</P>
    <P>An indication of the priority which the Union attaches to ensuring a balanced approach was the agreement reached in relation to the body established to prepare an EU charter of fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>The European Council, meeting in Cologne last June, decided to establish a charter of fundamental rights which would bring together, in one comprehensive document, all the fundamental rights applicable at Union level in order to make these rights more visible to citizens of the Union. The Cologne Council directed Finland, as the incoming Presidency, to establish the conditions for implementation of this decision in time for the Tampere Summit.</P>

      <P>The current situation will be examined. Topics are under discussion whereby other more fundamental rights will be taken into account also. Therefore, both options will be considered in drafting the document.</P>
      <P>This paper was approved by the European Council in Tampere and all parties were encouraged to ensure that the substantive work of drafting the Charter commenced as quickly as possible. The body will be composed of representatives of the Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission, as well as 16 members of the European Parliament and 30 members of national parliaments &ndash; two from each member state. A decision on the Taoiseach's representative on the body is being finalised and will be made known in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to representatives from the Oireachtas, the offices of the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach were informed of this process in August, as were the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and on European Affairs.

      <P>The first meeting of the body is likely to take place in December and a draft charter is expected to be prepared in time for the European Council in December 2000. It is envisaged that the charter will take the form of a politically binding declaration. In preparing such a charter, it is important to have broad consultation and we, therefore, very much welcome the inclusive process agreed at Tampere.</P>
      <P>The Court of Justice of the European Communities will be invited to nominate observers, as will the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights. The views of a number of EU bodies, such as the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman will be sought. Furthermore, representatives of social groups and experts may be invited to present their views during the drafting stage. Transparency will be an important feature of the drafting exercise and hearings held by the body and documents submitted during its work will, in principle, be accessible to the public.</P>
      <P>The EU and its member states have embarked on this exercise in order to provide greater transparency in the area of fundamental rights. It is in keeping with other endeavours of the Union in the field of human rights &ndash; for example, the entry into force on 1 May 1999 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which reinforced the position of human rights within the Union and enhanced its potential to counteract discrimination based on age, disability, ethnic origin, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>It is a timely project which is also very much in step with the Government's efforts to put in place a new human rights structure in this country &ndash; for example, the establishment of the Human Rights Commission and the enactment of employment equality and equal status legislation. Our representative will, therefore, take an active part in drafting the Charter, together with the nominees of the Oireachtas. On behalf of the Government, I thank the Finnish Presidency for its preparation of this paper and for the work it has put into it.</P>
      <P>The European Council recognises that its responsibilities are not limited to citizens only, but extend to ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place to deal with those drawn to the Union from outside its borders. For this reason the European Council was at pains to emphasise that it remains fully committed to meeting its obligations under the Geneva Refugee Conventions and other relevant international instruments. The need to assist the full integration of those third country nationals who are lawfully resident in the Union was also highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reaffirming the rights of legal residents, the European Council also signalled its determination to take action against those who traffic in <Col N="1140" /> human beings and seek financial gain from the promotion of illegal inflows, often with cynical disregard for the welfare of the individuals involved. The House has heard previously of the commitment to work towards a Common European Asylum System, and the measures which this will involve. The European Council confirmed that a comprehensive response by the Union to the issue of migration flows must be built on a close partnership with the countries of origin.</P>
    <P>To this end the European Council welcomed the report of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration. The working group was established last December with a mandate to consider all aspects of the migration problem in selected countries of origin. It undertook a detailed examination of the political, economic and human rights factors relevant to the situation in the countries concerned, and sought to ensure that the root causes of migration, including poverty and underdevelopment, were identified.</P>
    <P>On the basis of its findings the working group prepared action plans detailing a comprehensive programme of measures across the full range of Union and member state competences, aimed at addressing the underlying causes of these migration flows. The countries covered by the action plans &ndash; Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq, Morocco, Somalia and Sri Lanka &ndash; include some of the most significant countries of origin for migration to the EU and the plans will be of considerable assistance in ensuring an effective and comprehensive response by the Union in the period ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Council take any decisions or provide money from the EU budget to support the action plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a wide ranging discussion on the issue of money and it was agreed, in principle, that a fund would be available but the detail of the fund, and how it would be executed was not finalised. There was agreement that money would be made available from existing resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that other aspects of the EU's work<i> vis-à-vis</i> third world countries will be cut back to provide the resources for the action plans for the countries from which the immigrants are travelling or will new money be provided for this type of activity from areas of the EU budget not concerned with third world countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of extra financial contributions by various countries was raised by the Commission President who indicated that extra money was not required. He will be able work from within the existing budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In endorsing the high level working group's report, and the cross pillar approach which informed its work, the Council decided that the <Col N="1141" /> working group should be asked to remain in existence, both to monitor implementation of the action plans already prepared, and extend the list of countries examined to date. As an indication of the priority given to this issue, the Council and the Commission were invited to report on the implementation of the action plans at the December 2000 meeting of the European Council under the French Presidency.</P>
    <P>The value of the integrated cross pillar approach followed by the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration extends to all aspects of the Union's work in the field of justice and home affairs. Recognising this, the European Council agreed that all the competences and instances at the disposal of the Union, particularly in the field of external relations, should be used in developing a comprehensive response to the many challenges facing the Union in creating an area of freedom, justice and security.</P>
    <P>In practical terms this means that issues such as organised crime, money laundering, drug trafficking, as well as the growing problem of trafficking in persons, will form part of the Union's dialogue with relevant third countries. The dialogue will be undertaken on the basis of partnership with the countries concerned and with a recognition that solutions to problems of migration outflows can only be based on a full understanding of the underlying situation in the countries concerned. The Union will make full use of the range of instruments which the Treaty of Amsterdam provides in the external relations area, including the use of common strategies, and Community agreements.</P>
    <P>At the Friday evening dinner, foreign ministers discussed a number of current international issues. These included the decision of the United States Senate on the comprehensive test ban treaty and the situation in Pakistan. A declaration was issued to indicate the dismay of Ministers over the coup in that country. The foreign ministers welcomed the new General Secretary of the Council, Javier Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. I am confident Mr. Solana's stature will allow him to make a key contribution to the strengthening of the common foreign and security policy in line with the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam and he will co-operate with the presidency to ensure the EU's conduct on foreign policy is as efficient and effective as possible, bearing in mind the common interests of the Union.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis on leasú seo, tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigfeadh an t-údarás go bhfuil cúraimí teanga agus cultúrtha air, chomh maith le cúraimí tionsclaíochta agus fostaíochta. Nuair a chuaigh an t-udarás i mbun dualgaisí sa Ghaeltacht, 20 bliain ó shoin, bhí deacrachtaí aige maidir le teanga mar go minic ní raibh daoine oilte sa Ghaeltacht chun dul i mbun monarchan nó i mbun bainistíochta. B'éigean dul taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, nó taobh amuigh den tír féin agus na daoine seo a mhealladh isteach. De bharr na hathraithe móra a tháinig ar an nGaeltacht, ó thaobh oideachais agus traenála de, tá sé ar chumas go leor de mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin anois postanna freagracha agus bainistíochta a ghlacadh sna monarchana sin. Is dócha go mbéadh sé níos fusa go mbeadh an Ghaeilge i réim ins na monarchana féin. Is maith an rud go mbeadh teagmháil rialta idir an tAire, a bhfuil dualgas náisiúnta air i leith na teanga, agus an t-<Col N="1144" /> údarás agus go mbeadh sé seo ag tarlúint ins na monarchana.</P>
      <P>Taobh amuigh de na monarchana agus de na heastáit tionscail, ba cheart, chomh maith, go mbeadh ról níos cinnte agus níos deimhne ag an údarás i gcur chun cinn an chultúir agus na teanga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Ba chóir machnamh a dhéanamh ar sin agus deiseanna a thapú chun é sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé ar siúl ag an údarás i láthair na huaire ar dhóigh teoranta &ndash; b'fhéidir nach bhfuil na hacmhainní aige. Tugann an t-údarás tacaíocht agus cabhair d'imeachtaí sóisialta agus cultúrtha idir fhéilte agus eile. Níl fáth ar bith nach bhféadfadh an t-údarás tacaíocht a thabhairt do chúrsaí drámaíochta. D'fhéadfadh gach monarcha drámaíocht a chur ar fáil agus úsáid a bhaint as na háiseanna atá go fliúirseach ar fud na nGaeltachtaí. D'fhéadfaí páirt ghníomhach fheisceanach a bheith ag an údarás i saol cultúrtha agus teanga na Gaeltachta.</P>

Deir an leasú go bhféadfadh an tAire cibé ordacháin is cuí leis a thabhairt don údarás maidir le feidhmeanna an údaráis faoi mar a shonraítear é in alt 8(1). Deir alt 8(1) den Phríomh-Acht go ndéanfaidh an t-údarás caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar phríomhmheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus go gcinnteoidh sé gurb í an Ghaeilge a úsáidtear, an méid agus is féidir, nuair a bheidh a fheidhmeanna á chomhlíonadh aige agus thar a cheann.</P>
      <P>Tá sin soléir. Beidh an tAire in ann ordacháin a thabhairt maidir leis na rudaí sin, sé sin, cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge i gcur chun cinn na Gaeltachta. Cumhacht an-tábhachtach agus an-sonrach atá á thabhairt anseo. Tá dualgas á chur ar Aire diriú ar an rud seo agus déanamh cinnte go bhfuil an t-údarás ag feidhmiú de réir an Achta.

      <P>&ldquo;15.&ndash;Le héifeacht ón 1ú lá d'Eanáir, 2000, cuirfear an méid seo a leanas in ionad alt 28(1) den Phríomh-Acht&ndash;</P>

      <P>Molaim leasú a 28 agus is é atá mé ag iarraidh a bhaint amach go mbeadh tréimhse cúig bliana idir thoghcháin don údarás agus nach mbeadh níos mó na san. Ón 1ú Eanáir 2000, molaim go mbéadh toghchán 30 lá roimh dáta cúig bliana agus an lá a raibh an toghchán deiridh ann.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh an toghchán siar i mbliana agus tá a fhios agam go raibh cúiseanna faoi leith leis sin. Bhí díospóireacht ar an gceist seo ar Chéim an Choiste agus ceapaim go n-aontaíonn an tAire nach ceart go gcuirfear na toghcháin siar, bliain i ndiaidh bliana. Mar a sheasann an dlí ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh mar caithfidh an toghchán a bheith ann idir ceithre bliana agus cúig bliana go leith ó dháta an toghcháin deiridh. Eisceacht a bhí ann i mbliana. Táimse ag moladh go gcaithfidh toghchán a bheith ann gach cúig bliana agus nach mbéadh tréimhse bhord an údaráis níos faide ná níos giorra ná sin.</P>

      <P>Bhí díospóireacht ar an gceist seo ar Chéim an Choiste. Tá difríocht idir leasú an Teachta Uí Shé agus mo cheannsa. Rinne baill an bhoird teagmháil liom, tar éis chruinniú a bhí ag an mbord, agus mhol siad nach mbeadh toghcháin ar siúl i mbliana ós rud é go bhfuil sé ag druidim le deireadh na bliana, go mbeadh droch-aimsir ann i rith an toghcháin, nach mbeadh fonn orthu dul thart ag iarraidh vótaí sa dorchadas agus go mbeadh imní ar dhaoine agus lucht toghchánaíochta ag teacht chucu ar uair an mheán oíche. Is cuma liom féin cén uair a mbíonn toghchán ar siúil. Más gá toghchán a bheith ann i rith na Nollag, caithfear é a bheith ann. Sin atá i gceist agam sa leasú seo.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liom go nduirt an tAire Stáit uair amháin gur cheart go mbeadh a lá féin ag muintir na Gaeltachta. B'fhéidir go gcuirfí níos mó suime sa toghchán dá mbeadh sé ar siúil i rith an earraigh nó an tsamhraidh agus na laethanta níos faide. Tá a fhios agam nach nglacfaidh an tAire Stáit leis na leasuithe seo agus, mar sin, níl me ag dul an leasú seo a bhrú.</P>

      <P>Ceist ghairid. Más rud é nach nglactar leis na leasuithe agus go dtéann rudaí ar aghaidh mar atá sé ar intinn ag an Aire, sé sin go mbeidh an toghchán idir seo agus mí na Nollag, cén uair a bheas an chéad toghchán eile ann, tar éis ceithre bliana go leith, cúig bliana go leith nó cúig bliana? Ní shílim go bhfuil sé sin soléir in intinn na ndaoine. An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit é sin a shoiléiriú?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Is dóigh gurb é an freagra simplí a d'fhéadfainn a thabhairt inniu, go bhfuil mé sásta teacht ar chomhréiteach idir moladh an Teachta Uí Shé, cúig bliana maximum agus moladh an Teachta Uí Chionnaith, sé bliana, agus tiocfaimid ar chúig bliana go leith agus, ar ndóigh, sin atá ann. Tá mé ag éisteacht leis an dá thaobh agus tá mé tagtha ar an rud go raibh mé ar chomh-mheá faoi an t-am ar fad. Níl mórán faidhbe agam leis na cúig bliana ach go bhfágann an cúig bliana go leith beagáinín solúbachta má theastaíonn ó dhaoine amach anseo dul ar ais go dtí amanna éagsúla gan dul ag ceithre bliana, ceithre bliana go leith nó ceithre bliana agus trí cheathrú. Ach má théimid go sé bliana bheimis beagnach sé bliana go dtí an bhliain chuile uair as seo amach. Feicim contúirt ag baint leis sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an am den bhliain is mó spéise, ó bhí an coiste ann cheana bhí mé ag éisteacht agus ag comhrá le daoine. Ainneoin an rud a deirtear, agus seo barúil atá agamsa le fada an lá, is maith le daoine toghcháin. B'fhéidir nach vótáilfidh siad ach is maith leo muide a fheiceáil ag rith thart ar fud na tíre. Is maith leo iad ar an gcaoi chéanna gur maith leo cluichí peile ar an teilifís mar is píosa spóirt atá ann dóibh. Cothaíonn toghcháin spéis sa pholaitíocht. Is dearmad mór a rinneamar, mar shampla, nár chuireamar uilig eadrainn féin na toghcháin áitiúla ar siúl go rialta. Tarraingíonn sin droch-cháil ar an bpolaitíocht i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an am den bhliain is feiliúnaí, dar liomsa agus seasaim leis seo, is fearr an gheimhreadh ná an samhradh ó thaobh an phobail de. Tá níos mó seans acu a bheith ag breathnú ar theilifís, a bheith ag éisteacht le raidio agus a bheith páirteach ann ar an mbealach sin. B'fhéidir nach bhfeileann sé do lucht na canbhasála ach ní raibh mé riamh d'uireasa daoine i rith an gheimhridh ag canbhasáil. Tá chuile dhuine crúógach sa samhradh san áit a bhfuil mise. Caithfidh siad i bhfad níos mó íobairtí a dhéanamh le dul ag canbhasáil sa samhradh seachas sa gheimhreadh. Tá siad níos saoire sna tráthnóntaí fada dorcha. Tá chuile áit éagsúil ach sin é mo thaithíse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá gcuirfimis siar é fós thosódh an feachtas an tseachtain seo. Tosóidh an feachtas toghchánaíochta an lá a shíneoidh an tUachtarán an Bille seo muna dtosóidh sé roimhe sin. An dteastaíonn feachtas mí go leith nó sé mhí? Is fearr do chuile dhuine, agus na hiarrthóirí san áireamh, go mbeadh an toghchán ann go luath seachas i bhfad uainn. Ach tá mé ag díriú m'intinn ar cheist an pobal a thabhairt amach. Tá mé an-tógtha leis an smaoineamh go mbeidh an toghchán seo as féin, <Col N="1147" /> gur toghchán do phobal na Gaeltachta a bheas anseo. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh spéis ag pobal na tíre i gcoitinne ann agus go dtabharfadh na meáin i gcoitinne clúdach dó ach leis an rud atá feicthe le cúpla seachtain ní chuirfinn aon airgead air. Ag deireadh an lae is é an rud atá tábhachtach sa chás áirithe seo ná go mbeadh aird an phobail air. Agus leis an ionadaíocht bhreise atá i gceist anseo beidh aird an phobail ar an dtoghchán seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh coimhlint ghéar ann ar nós na cluichí peile agus na cluichí iománaíochta is fearr dá mbíonn ann agus nuair a bheidh sé thart go gcroitheadh chuile dhuine láimh le chéile. Ní drochrud ar bith é coimhlint toghchánaíochta a bheith ann agus creidim leis an méadú i líon na n-iarrthóirí go dtarlóidh sé sin.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, mar a thuar Raidio na Gaeltachta i ngeall ar rudaí a dúirt mise ag cruinnithe an lá faoi dheireadh, tá mé ag breathnú ar an lá den tseachtain is fearr a d'fheilfeadh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Níl mé ceangailte le rud ar bith a tharla roimhe seo. Teastaíonn uaim a chinntiú go mbeidh an oiread deise ag muintir na Gaeltachta vótáil agus na daoine óga go mór mhór. Tá go leor de na daoine óga sa Ghaeltacht ag freastal ar choláistí tríú leibhéal ar fud na tíre. Teastaíonn uaim go mbeadh deis acu dul abhaile. Mar a chéile muintir Mhuigheo, na Gaillimhe agus na contaethe eile. Mar sin, tá mé oscailte don tuairim go mbeadh an toghchán lá eile seachas lá seachtaine, go mbeadh sé ag deireadh seachtaine agus ar an Satharn.</P>
    <P>Má thugann sé sin deis don phobal  &ndash; agus is lá saoire é sin do bhunáite an phobail agus níl aon leithscéal ann &ndash; bíodh sin mar atá. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé iontuigthe nach bhfuil mé ag iarraidh rud ar bith a dhéanamh a stopfadh an pobal ó theacht amach. Creidim go dtiocfaidh siad ach sílim féin ó thaobh chuile dhuine go mb'fhearr dul ar aghaidh leis. Teastaíonn ón bpobal go dtiocfaimis ar aghaidh leis seo &ndash; agus ag deireadh an lae is don phobal é seo &ndash; agus ní mhaithfidh dúinn é má chuirfimid siar é. Níl mé ag tabhairt neamhaird ar dhaoine ach tá mé ag tabhairt aird ar an rud atá mise ag cloisteáil ó ghnáthphobal ar an talamh. Teastaíonn uaim dul ar aghaidh leis a luaithe is a bheidh an Bille seo rite.</P>
    <P>Níl i gceist agam, mar sin, glacadh le ceachtar den dá leasú. Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí go bhfuil mé ag tógaint an rud fad-téarmach san áireamh.</P>

Ní féidir leis a bheith níos lú ná ceithre bliana ná, de réir an Achta atá ann anois, ní féidir leis dul níos faide ná cúig bliana go leith.

    <Title>Partnership for Peace: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, 13 October 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann approves participation by Ireland in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), and that it further approves the terms of Ireland's PfP Presentation Document, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 5th October, 1999.</P>

    <P Just="Center">To add the following to the motion:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;and further accepts that any proposed future amendment to the areas of participation by Ireland in the Partnership for Peace as outlined in the Presentation Document will be put before Dáil Éireann for approval.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my deepest sympathy on the death of Jack Lynch and to express to Máirín Lynch, his widow, his other family members and the people of Cork the deepest sympathy of the people in the Clare constituency and our sadness at his passing.</P>
      <P>When I last spoke on the motion, I pointed out that around 1993-94 some attempts were made, in light of the end of the Cold War, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the international realignments taking place, to encourage emerging democracies in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to realign with NATO, now that the Warsaw Pact had been broken up, and to be part of new arrangements which would set a new international political dimension for the foreseeable future. Not alone were there attempts to have the new democracies aligned with NATO, there were also attempts to encourage neutral states to be involved in a new partnership arrangement, given that the new changes were likely to lead to increasing tension and conflict, some of which we witnessed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and elsewhere. It was against this background that realignment, adaptation and reform took place in the Atlantic alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was also reflected in discussions which took place in the Western European Union, and most of these took the form of amendments to <Col N="1153" /> European Union treaties which were voted on in the Amsterdam Treaty. These matters relating to the arrangements and new alignments between the Western European Union, NATO, the European Union, the United States and Canada were examined in the discussion on the Amsterdam Treaty. There was no question but that there was a keen desire on the part of the member states which were also looking at the fact that there would be enlargement of the Union and its responsibilities and, as had been voted on in the Maastricht Treaty, a reaffirmation of the necessity for a common security and defence policy.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union was involved in an active way with NATO in discussing a common defence policy, NATO defence planning and ten or 12 other objectives with a view to strengthening the defence arrangements within a new enlarging Union and finding ways in which it would be possible to strengthen and put in place a European Union defence identity, the ESDI, which was promoted at that stage in an attempt to create a strong European defence alignment. The view was that the European Union was enlarging and strengthening and there was likely to be ethnic and other tensions and difficulties within and outside it, so it would be necessary to have in place not only a clear policy on defence arrangements but also a response which could deal with some of the problems emerging at the time.</P>
    <P>A great deal of time was taken up in the Council of Europe in discussing the developing situation in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Union failed miserably at the outset to take the initiatives essential to avoiding the massive destruction of property and the death and despair we witnessed in those countries. Had a more effective defence and common security arrangement been in place earlier, it would have been possible, rather than talk about these issues at the Council of Europe, the European Union and the United Nations with all the various disagreements which manifested themselves afterwards, to have avoided the resulting death, destruction, hunger, deprivation and hundreds of thousands of refugees with whom we must still deal. If there is a lesson to be learned from the Balkan situation, it is that the time for discussion, dialogue and talking must certainly be replaced by a period of speedy action to deal with the issues and problems which arise.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of discussion in 1994-95 and before the intergovernmental conference and the Amsterdam Treaty about relations between the Western European Union, NATO and the European Union. It is well known on both sides of the House that there is Irish participation in Western European Union and that we have had observers there for some time. Four Members of the House representing the three main parties, Deputies Michael Kitt, Roche and&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;Deputy Ferris from the Labour Party attend the Western European Union as observers and are part of the evolving Western European Union. There is greater liaison between the Western European Union and NATO than there is or ever will be between Partnership for Peace and NATO. Nonetheless, it is evolving and changing. In that context, we contested the election in June 1997 with no clear indication emanating from the discussion and dialogue taking place as to the future shape of this, and that is still the case. There will be a certain amount of dialogue, discussion and debate before we put in place a partnership alignment and arrangement able to deal effectively and quickly with some of the issues which will arise.</P>
      <P>Some of this is borne out in a statement the Taoiseach made in Bruree on 24 May 1997, a few weeks before the general election. I shall put on record what he said on that occasion:</P>
      <P>In a month or so's time, a new body called the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council will be established following a meeting in Madrid. Its purpose will be to conduct dialogue between countries of western and eastern Europe and Canada and the United States on the political aspects of security matters that we already discuss in the European Union.</P>
      <P>It is open to European democracies who may never wish to become members of NATO or, as I understand it, members of PfP. It carries no military obligations of any kind and, if my understanding is correct, I believe Ireland should seriously consider the merits of joining that body. While strongly attached to our military neutrality, we have no desire to be politically isolationist or to turn our backs on the United States which has been particularly helpful to us throughout the peace process nor do we want to give the impression that the stability and security of Europe is of no concern to us. We want to make our own contribution along with our friends and partners in a way in which we feel comfortable and which is most appropriate to our political traditions.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that if his understanding is correct &ndash; I believe he understood the position clearly &ndash; he would recommend participation in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presentation document on Partnership for Peace contains two important paragraphs. In the first paragraph, Ireland clearly states its policy of military neutrality and further states that it does not intend to become a member of NATO and, in the second paragraph, it restates its commitment to the development of a just and peaceful international security. We have made it very clear that while we are willing to be involved in the new alignment of the Partnership for Peace arrangement in a meaningful way with our partners, with the important results participation will have for members of the Defence Forces and its recognition of their tremendous work to date in peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts, Ireland <Col N="1155" /> will continue to play an ever-increasing role in an area in which such initiatives will be more in demand in the future than ever before. This is a very timely participation and one which I believe will have enormous benefits for the evolution and development of the European Union and its political institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any mutual defence commitment in the PfP and, therefore, membership does not affect our policy of military neutrality. The decision to join this body is a routine foreign policy decision and such decisions do not require referenda. That has always been the position of Fine Gael and we do not see any reason to change it now.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about Ireland's policy of military neutrality &ndash; what it means, where it may lead us and its costs and benefits. In essence, Ireland's neutrality is a modestly armed neutrality. Unlike other neutrals, such as Sweden and Switzerland, which guarantee their neutrality by developing large armies and armaments industries, Ireland has chosen to keep a very modest military establishment. As an island nation, we did not even have a Navy or merchant fleet large enough to guarantee our own supplies at the outbreak of war in 1939. We do not command that capacity in 1999 either.</P>
      <P>Neutrality is a strategy, not a religion. Realism is a necessary component in any discussion on neutrality. I will quote from one of the more realistic contributions made on neutrality in this House. Fianna Fáil Deputies, particularly Deputies from County Clare, might pay particular attention to this quotation from a former Member of the House who asked:</P>
      <P>Is it likely that we could escape if there was a major European conflict at the present time? If there is such a condition, will we continue to export cattle and food to Great Britain? Will the export of food be regarded as contraband of war or would it not? If we are going to send food from our ports to Britain, when Britain's enemies, let us say, will be trying to starve her, will our position be respected by other people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy in question was Eamon de Valera. He was speaking in this House on 29 April 1938. He was much more realistic in his appraisal of the realities of a European war than are many Deputies in the House today. Many Deputies speak about neutrality as if we had never joined the European Union in 1972 and as if this island was completely isolated from events on the mainland of Europe or on our neighbouring island. They have internalized a romantic version of de Valera's achievement in maintaining neutrality between 1939 and 1945 in a way that de Valera himself never romanticised it. He was realistic enough to know that four factors preserved Ireland's neutrality in that period &ndash; the good fortune of our island status, the fortuitous defeat of the <i>Luftwaffe</i> over Britain in 1940, the timely <Col N="1156" /> diversion of Germany's energies towards Russia and away from the West in 1941 and American entry to the war in 1942. If Ireland had been attacked at any stage between 1939 and 1945, it would not have been neutral.</P>
    <P>When de Valera spoke in 1938 in such a downbeat way about our capacity to maintain neutrality, we were probably more self sufficient as a nation than we ever were in our history before or since. Our economy in 1938 was a comparatively closed economy. Our needs were simple and we could survive on our own. Nowadays, we are one of the most open economies in the world. We depend on other countries and they depend on us. If de Valera had doubts in 1938 about our ability to stay unaffected by a European war at that time, how much more doubt must there be about that today?</P>
    <P>Eamon de Valera's successor as leader of Fianna Fáil, former Deputy Seán Lemass, was equally realistic about neutrality. He understood that, when we joined the European Union, we were moving towards a political as well as an economic commitment to our neighbours in Europe. He realised that, ultimately, we might create a political union in Europe and, if we did so, that would involve us in an obligation to defend what we had jointly created.</P>
    <P>In July 1962, Seán Lemass told the <i>New York Times</i> that: &ldquo;We are prepared to go into this integrated Europe without any reservations as to how far this will take us in the field of foreign policy and defence.&rdquo;. The leadership of Fianna Fáil today does not have that full-hearted commitment to Europe which Seán Lemass displayed. The current leadership of Fianna Fáil, like the current leadership of the British Conservative Party, wants to dine <i>à la carte</i> at the European table. It wants to take the benefits without taking full responsibility for the means by which those benefits are created. An undefended Europe would not be the peaceful or prosperous place it is today and would not be such a good market for Irish goods and services.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution states that &ldquo;war shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war, save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;. That provision should not change. Ireland should ensure that any decision committing us to war is one that this House, and this House alone, should take. However, that does not mean we should be uninvolved with other European countries in pursuing a policy of collective security in Europe. The Constitution states the legal position but Ireland can and should, where and when appropriate, give political commitments to defend the values we share alongside our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in debate here at home to underestimate the extent to which Ireland has already committed itself to European defence. The Taoiseach told the Dáil on 14 October that &ldquo;a mutual defence pact is not even on the agenda of this European Union's Common Foreign Security Policy.&rdquo;. In contrast, I ask Members of <Col N="1157" /> this House to listen to some of the things to which the Taoiseach agreed in the conclusions of the European Summit in Cologne on 3 and 4 June of this year. The Taoiseach agreed to the following statements, made by him, on our behalf, jointly with the other EU Heads of Government:</P>
    <P>We, the members of the European Council, intend to give the European Union the necessary means and capabilities to assume its responsibilities regarding a common European policy on security and defence. We are determined to foster the restructuring of the European defence industries amongst those states involved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also approved and adopted a report, prepared by the German Presidency for the Cologne Summit, which included the following statements:</P>
    <P>The focus of our efforts, therefore, should be to ensure that the European Union has at its disposal the necessary capabilities, including military capabilities, and appropriate structures for effective EU decision making in crisis management within the scope of the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>The Petersberg Tasks are defined in this report, as including tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. I stress that &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo;, as well as peacekeeping, is included in the Petersberg Tasks. Peacemaking means imposing, by the use of force, peaceful conditions under terms laid down by the peacemaker. It is very difficult to distinguish that from war making, unless one gets into subjective questions of motivation which are highly elastic.</P>
    <P>To give effect to these decisions in Cologne, the Taoiseach also approved a decision making structure for the European Union which will include regular meetings of the General Affairs Council, as appropriate, including Defence Ministers, an EU military committee consisting of military representatives making recommendations to the political and security committee, and an EU military staff including a situation centre. If the Taoiseach agreed to these things in Cologne in June, how could he tell the House last week that a military pact is not even on the EU agenda?</P>
    <P>These plans for the maintenance of security within the continent of Europe are reasonable and necessary &ndash; I support them. Subject to the maintenance of the constitutional guarantee I quoted earlier, Ireland should support them. These plans are necessary. The United States will not continue to pay the costs of European defence for the next 50 years in the same way as it has done for the past 50 years. At present most European states have large standing armies, but little capacity to deal with any problems any distance away from their own borders. They do not have transport capacity and have to rely entirely on the United States for that type of logistical support. While the United States may be willing <Col N="1158" /> and may want for the moment to have a virtual monopoly of this type of logistical capacity for some time to come, there is no guarantee that it will always want it. If the United States was to suffer an economic setback, the forces of isolationism would take hold there and Europe could find itself suddenly on its own as far as its defence was concerned.</P>
    <P>After a century of isolationism, in the 19th century the United States became actively involved in regulating the peace of Europe in the period between 1917 and 1919. Thereafter, the US Congress rejected the Treaty of Versailles and lapsed into isolationism again until it was attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbour in 1942. It was during that period from 1919 to 1942 when the United States maintained a stance of military isolation from Europe, that the Nazis and the Fascists rose to power in Europe and took over the entire continent, with the exception of Sweden and Switzerland, without any military response from America. There is no reason to be certain that isolationism <i>vis-à-vis</i> Europe will not become a predominant political attitude in the United States again during the next century.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as US economic interests move towards the west coast and the Pacific Basin, it is increasingly likely that the United States will concentrate its strategic interests in that sphere. The growth of armaments in the east Asian area is a matter of grave worry to us all, but it is a special worry to the United States. Remember, it was from across the Pacific that the United States was attacked in 1942.</P>
    <P>Thus, if the United States were to be forced by economics to make a choice between its commitment to European defence and a commitment to security issues in the Pacific, it is not impossible that it might decide that they had even more at stake in the Pacific, than it has on this side of the Atlantic. It is for these geo-strategic reasons that Europe must equip itself to defend itself, and to maintain security in and around the borders of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot stand aside from this and say we will not take part, and that the outcome of any discussion on European security will not involve any moral commitment by Ireland. Seán Lemass would not have taken that position and did not take that position. The Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil on 14 October in this debate that a mutual defence pact was not on the EU agenda was invalidated within four days by the Dehaene report published on 18 October. This report put a defence pact definitively on the EU agenda. It called for a merger of the EU and the Western European Union within a single institutional framework. The Western European Union is, by any definition, a mutual defence pact. If Western European Union and EU are merged before enlargement, all new members will join the merged organisation taking on all the commitments, including those inherited from the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> I note the Taoiseach told the press on 18 October that he would never agree, in the context of such a merger, to an EU mutual defence guarantee like that in the Western European Union Treaty. This is very different from the position taken by Seán Lemass, who as I have shown, did not place a limit on Ireland's commitment to European Union. In taking his position, the Taoiseach may be relying on one sentence in the Cologne declaration which states: &ldquo;The different status of Member States with regard to collective guarantees will not be affected&rdquo;. That is quite different from saying that no such collective guarantees should ever be put in the EU treaties. Collective guarantees could be put into the EU treaties but with a right for some countries, existing members but not new ones, to opt out. The Taoiseach said last week he is opposed to any collective security guarantees for anybody going into the EU treaties, but he did not get a declaration to that effect at Cologne in June. All he got was a right to opt out, and no more.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach really believes that collective guarantees should not be included in the EU treaties, why did he not seek an assurance on that at Cologne? The Taoiseach quoted a speech by Eamon de Valera in 1946 earlier in this debate. Reflecting on the League of Nations, Mr. de Valera said that if there was to be an alternative to futile discussions &ldquo;there must be a method whereby effective forcible action may be taken&rdquo;. If this is so, I put the following question to the Taoiseach. If at some time in the future the United States no longer maintains a military presence in Europe, a threat to European security emerges and the United Nations is deadlocked by the veto of one of the permanent members of the Security Council, by whom would the peace and security of the European Union then be protected?</P>
    <P>Is it the position of other parties in this House that Ireland will not offer an answer to that question? Is it their position that we will leave it to the British, the Germans and the French to find an answer? If we opt out, they will find an answer because they will have to find one. However, it may be an answer that Ireland will not like. It may be the wrong answer. It may be a belligerent and foolish answer, and those countries are capable of belligerence and foolishness. Ireland will then have no substantial grounds for complaint, because we will have freely opted out of any say in their decision.</P>
    <P>Opting out of commitments relieves us of a burden, but it does not relieve us of responsibility. Opting out of commitment may mean that we will have no say in what is decided, but it does not mean we will be unaffected by what is decided. That is the dilemma that Ireland will have to face in the negotiations that are now under way to develop a Common European Defence Policy. Members of this House should realise that these are serious negotiations which will come to a conclusion probably within the <Col N="1160" /> next year and it is important that we are clear-sighted in the choices we make. We should be in having a say rather than outside not having a say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. There has been a wide range of contributions in recent days, some of which were thought provoking and interesting and some of which were typical and predictable. It is important to understand what Partnership for Peace is about and how new it is, as that might help to explain attitudes towards it in this House and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace is a voluntary co-operative framework for regional security co-operation between NATO and individual States which are not members of NATO. Of the 43 States which are members of Partnership for Peace, 24 &ndash; just over half &ndash; are not members of NATO. It is very important to make that point. Those looking at the birth of Partnership for Peace would have had concerns about NATO influence, but it is important to stress that more than half its present members are not in NATO. All our EU colleagues are members of PfP. Countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden are members, as is Switzerland, which could be considered one of the neutral countries in the world. Switzerland's membership has not caused any great difficulty in that country, where people saw it as a natural progression and welcomed it with open arms. Many central and eastern European States which were associated with the old Soviet Union are also involved.</P>
      <P>I do not want to castigate others' contributions or their criticisms of Fianna Fáil's handling of this issue. It is obvious that there are differences within Fianna Fáil about our membership of Partnership for Peace, but those concerns are very understandable. However, if people look in detail at what is involved they will see the benefits of membership for us and the benefits we can bring to others, given the tremendous contribution PfP has made to world peace in less than six years. From that point of view I am very keen to see Ireland participate in PfP.</P>
      <P>When President Clinton launched Partnership for Peace just over five years ago, many saw it as providing reassurance to the new democracies in eastern Europe, many of which made no secret of their desire to become members of NATO. Many people were unhappy about this and it made their minds up about PfP. I accept that many in Fianna Fáil still have doubts today about joining Partnership for Peace, particularly given its early links with NATO. However, PfP has proven itself in the recent years and what is appealling to many members is that each participating country can decide on its role. There is no compulsion on any country when signing up, as countries decide then on how they wish to participate. That is very important. We are not being compelled to do anything. We can become members but it is left up to ourselves to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Opposition contributions have made great play out of what they perceive to be a major U-turn on the part of Fianna Fáil. Anyone who has been in politics for more than a week will realise that when a party changes its opinion it gives its opposition a stick with which to beat it. That has happened but I think the stick has been used so much that it is broken. It is important for the Government, no matter how embarrassing it may be, to make sure the right decision is made and the Opposition's reaction is understandable. The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained the Government's position regarding this change of heart very clearly and honestly last week. He said:</P>
    <P>To those who claim the Government changed its mind on Partnership for Peace I say: yes we have and we are not afraid to admit it. We are not afraid to admit that we can change our minds in the light of new facts and changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>I remember as a small boy passing an establishment where there was a great deal of drinking, dancing and singing. It was clear that there was a happy occasion so I looked in and asked what was going on. I was informed that a couple had got engaged. I was not too familiar with the term at the time and someone explained to me that a couple had decided to get married. I asked why they did not get married straight away and why they needed the engagement. I was told that the engagement was to give them time to change their minds. This is a similar situation for the Government, but while we might have been criticised for lukewarm support for Partnership for Peace in the past, our cards were on the table before the local and general elections. The electorate was in no doubt as to where Fianna Fáil stood on the matter and what our intentions were.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the Cold War there has been a major change in the way countries work together, as old methods of security and defence no longer apply. The doubts and lack of trust between countries has been replaced. There is now a realisation that no country can be considered to be an island and co-operation is the order of the day. Speakers have mentioned Ireland's proud role as a peacekeeper and we should acknowledge the tremendous contribution that Irish peacekeepers have made throughout the world, in the Lebanon, Congo and elsewhere. Irish soldiers seem acceptable no matter where they go and that may have much to do with the perception of us as a neutral nation which is good at peacekeeping. We have a long record of more than 40 years' experience in peacekeeping and there have been more than 46,000 individual tours of duty. However, we have paid a big price in our peacekeeping role, as many soldiers have lost their lives on these missions. These are the sacrifices soldiers have made and will continue to make in the interests of world peace.</P>
    <P>Last week the House passed a motion agreeing to send troops to East Timor. We are sending the <Col N="1162" /> Army ranger wing to East Timor. I hope this will be a successful tour but we cannot underestimate the risks involved. However, regardless of the dangers, this tour shows the gut instinct and the reaction of Irish soldiers &ndash; when there is trouble or a call from abroad, there are many within the Defence Forces prepared to take the risks to promote peace throughout the world. I am sure that tradition will continue. If we are to play a more meaningful peacekeeping role it is vital that we look forward and not backward. Joining Partnership for Peace will give us an opportunity to continue our peacekeeping role throughout the world but in a more meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to our modest Army. It may be modest in comparison with some of our European colleagues, but it is important that we properly equip the Army. The Minister announced major changes in this regard and we have a plan in place. However, it is important that the plan is brought forward and that the equipment needed is provided as quickly as possible, as has been highlighted on many occasions. The lack of equipment is preventing the Army from carrying out some of the duties it could take part in overseas, and it is important that this issue is address as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government has been criticised for its decision not to hold a referendum on this issue. The Fianna Fáil manifesto did not make such a promise. I accept that there is a public perception that Fianna Fáil did promise such a referendum but the current Attorney General and his two predecessors are of the opinion that a referendum is not required with regard to joining PfP. I appreciate that one does not have to be constitutionally bound in order to hold a referendum and there are times when it is in the country's interest to seek the public's opinion. However, not many people wish to discuss this issue and I have not received many representations on the matter. I am convinced that the Government is taking the right course of action and that the vast majority of people support the decision to join PfP.</P>
    <P>We recently witnessed terrible atrocities in Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor. People ask why the rest of the world allows such events to take place. We need a more speedy method of dealing with atrocities such as these. We must put in place a system which can deal more rapidly with outbreaks of violence and ensure peace throughout the world. There will always be flash points but it is important for the international community to organise itself so that it is in a better position to deal with war and to ensure, as best as is possible, that peacekeeping will become a priority for all countries. We must also ensure that, regardless of colour or creed, the lives of people in Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor and Ireland are of the same value.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Government proposes that the Dáil, the national Parliament, approves participation by Ireland in Partnership <Col N="1163" /> for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. Partnership for Peace is an organisation sponsored by the dominant military bloc, NATO, which is dominated by the United States, the major military power. Over the past decade, humanity's prime means of communication, language, has been perverted out of all recognition by that bloc, acting in its own interest and to cover up its real intentions. In the Gulf War and during NATO's bombing of Kosovo, the NATO powers attempted to sanitise the carnage they inflicted. Thus, the killing of thousands of innocent civilians is not referred to as slaughter or carnage but as &ldquo;collateral damage&rdquo;. The razing of industrial complexes is not the criminal destruction of people's resources and livelihoods but is the &ldquo;degrading of targets&rdquo;. It is language which has been degraded to try to hide the brutal consequences of NATO's bombs and policies.</P>
      <P>Now, shamefully, the Government has joined that cynical degradation of language in proposing to the Dáil that this country join the entity called Partnership for Peace. It is not as the name purports a partnership for peace but an association of states for military action, an alliance of states for military action by another name. The partnership does not benefit peace but answers to the agenda, primarily of the war mongers and manufacturers of the obscene weapons of awful destruction. Any honest assessment of PfP must conclude that it is first and last a tool of NATO.</P>
      <P>Set up by NATO in 1994, the framework document objectives are quite clear as to PfP's intention. It states:</P>
      <P>The development of co-operative military relations with NATO. The development over the longer term of forces that are better able to operate with those of the members of the North Atlantic Alliance.</P>
      <P>A US defence document produced in 1996 clearly lays out the US's intentions in moving, through NATO, for the establishment of PfP. It states:</P>
      <P>Confronting concerns about its political relevance in the post Cold War era, NATO has reaffirmed its place at the core of trans-Atlantic security through its sponsorship of PfP. NATO's international staff work daily to help partners develop standard operating procedures, understand the protocols of consultation and achieve inter-operability with NATO forces. PfP has evolved quickly from a bare concept to an active association of military and defence institutions.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be clearer. Furthermore, PfP has its base in NATO's headquarters. It is a creature of NATO from beginning to end, attempting to masquerade as a humanitarian initiative. The Government's Presentation Document is a fraud and a deceit to the Irish people. That document states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland shares the values fundamental to PfP, set out in the PfP Framework Document, <Col N="1164" /> including protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, and safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace through democracy.</P>
    <P>To say that these are the values underlying PfP and, therefore, that each country which is a member of PfP subscribes to those values, is monumental hypocrisy and deceit. That is demonstrably the case. It is a lie to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the paragons of democracy and human rights with which this country will rub shoulders as a member of PfP. Turkey, for example, is a leading NATO country and a leading PfP country. Amnesty International's 1999 report states:</P>
    <P>Hundreds of people were detained because of their non-violent political activities; most were released after a short period of police detention but others were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Torture was commonplace.There were at least 10 reported deaths in custody apparently as a result of torture. Five people reportedly &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; and at least 15 people were killed in circumstances suggesting that they had been extrajudicially executed.</P>
    <P>Demonstrators, including human rights defenders, students and Islamists, were frequently taken into custody from peaceful public meetings or their organization's offices, and held for hours or days in police detention solely because of their non-violent political activities.</P>
    <P>The US State Department made an evaluation of Turkey's human rights practices in 1997. That assessment supported the conclusion that Turkey was flagrantly violating human rights across the board. The million strong Kurdish population of Turkey has had its cultural and linguistic rights crushed. That regime has depopulated up to 3,000 villages, forcibly moving more than 500,000 people from their homes. It is a brutal regime which crushes opposition, including freedom of expression, democratic socialists and trades unionists.</P>
    <P>Kazakhstan is another paragon of virtue according to the Government's Presentation Document. In February 1998, Madel Ishmailov was sent to prison for insulting the President of Kazakhstan at a peaceful opposition demonstration. He was the chairman of an opposition coalition to the Government. I met him a number of months ago. He was sentenced to the brutal conditions of the Kazakhstan prison service 1,000 kilometres from home and, as is commonly the case for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Kazakhstan, was put in cells with unfortunate criminal prisoners suffering from tuberculosis of an advanced stage so that his spirit would be broken and he would contract the deadly disease. Is the Government content to endorse the perversion of NATO language to the extent of pretending that arbitrary arrest, torture, murder and repression of an entire people of <Col N="1165" /> their cultural language can be described as, to quote the Presentation Document again, the &ldquo;promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace through democracy&ldquo;? What a fraud to foist on the Irish people.</P>
    <P>What is the real agenda of PfP and who stands to benefit? Of course the major powers stand to benefit. That is why they set it up. Can anybody seriously believe Britain and the US, the foremost military powers, genuinely care for the peoples, particularly the poor peoples, of this world, that they care, for example, for the peoples of East Timor, when both countries supported and armed the brutal Suharto dictatorship and supported the Indonesian dictatorship in its crushing of the rights of the people of East Timor?</P>
    <P>The makers and peddlers of arms are the ones who stand to gain. The armaments industry, the most vile, immoral and despicable industry known to humanity, creates weapons to sell to dictatorships the world over which inflict appalling suffering. Who are the sponsors of the armaments industry who sell to the dictators? They are not faceless criminals hiding out in the sewers of the world but the so-called paragons of democracy, the arch-hypocrite Prime Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, and the sanctimonious President of the US, Bill Clinton. They are the ones who sell the arms to dictatorships to repress the rights and freedoms of poor peoples throughout the world. The four leading countries of PfP control 90 per cent of world arms production outside of China. Some $745 billion is spent on arms each year, more than the total income of the poorest 45 per cent of the world population.</P>
    <P>This is the company, these are the so-called partners, which the craven political parties in the State wish us to join. The agenda is clear. The agenda of the main parties is to bring Ireland into a <i>de facto</i> military alliance. Some people in the EU support the EU becoming a military block in its own right. Others support it becoming a military block in association with the US. The President of the EU Commission is openly calling for the EU to become a military block. Astonishingly, on national radio on 3 June last Deputy Quinn, the Leader of the Labour Party, called on the EU to be one of three major blocks which should dominate the world. What would James Connolly, founder of the Labour Party and a vehement opponent of militarism, think of that?</P>
    <P>The second part of the agenda of PfP is to bring the countries of Eastern and Central Europe into a block where their fabulous mineral wealth can be bartered over and exploited. Kazakhstan, for example, has fabulous oil wells which NATO powers wish to have under the control of their major companies. The amendment tabled to the Government motion in my name and that of other Deputies calls for a referendum of the Irish people. It is treacherous of Fianna Fáil to propose that we join this alliance without a referendum of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> The alternative of the Socialist Party to NATO and PfP is not that each country should become an island or, as some advocate, become more involved in the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council, is made up of the NATO countries with a few other attachments, China, a brutal dictatorship and Russia, a regime mired in corruption. The alternative is a world free of militarism and dictatorship and free of the armaments industry. That means a world free from the rapacious greed of the multinationals where revolutionary change is affected by mass movements of working people and of the dispossessed to replace both blatant dictators and the hypocritical Governments pretending to have a facade of democracy while being the manufacturers of the weapons of mass destruction, and to take the resources of the world and develop them for the well-being of all peoples. The swords shall be beaten into ploughshares. That is the alternative. The tremendous human genius and astonishing technology, which is criminally wasted on armaments and on war, would be geared to the relief of poverty, hunger and destitution, and to protect the environment of the world. The world resources would be taken from the grasp of the powerful and ruthless minority and democratically organised and controlled by the majority, thereby not requiring military alliances of any kind, which are the organisation of power to protect power, privilege and the greed of a powerful minority.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Nurses Dispute: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy McManus on Tuesday, 19 October 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann censures the Minister for Health and Children for his failure to take appropriate action to secure a solution to the nurses dispute and avert a national nursing strike; notes the belated invitation issued by the Minister to the unions to preliminary talks; and, having regard to the serious hardship being created for patients and others dependent on the health services and the potentially catastrophic implications for the health services of a prolonged dispute, urges the Minister to instruct the health service employers to enter into immediate negotiations with the Nursing Alliance with a view to concluding an agreement capable of addressing the legitimate grievances of the nurses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with Deputies Perry and Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>It is with reluctance and shame that we must again plead with the Minister for Health and Children and his Ministers of State to take action. They have sat idly by for the past three weeks and done nothing, hoping to turn the tide of opinion against the nursing profession. They have failed to do that and well beyond the twelfth hour they have dillied and dallied, playing for time and hoping the nurses will cave in and go back to work. The Minister has failed to understand the resolute determination of the nursing profession that has provided care for the people through the centuries. The Government has turned its back on the nurses. Ministers Cowen and McCreevy have insulted them over the past three weeks. They have spoken down to them and at them rather than to them. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has failed the nursing profession. He has failed the old, sick and handicapped. He has insulted so many people in this debacle. He has dismantled the health services and lengthened the waiting lists, leaving people suffering and in pain.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to continue this cruel assault on this section of the population who live in fear of being stricken with an emergency? Does he wish to deny the nursing profession its entitlement to a just wage for the services it provides? Will he allow young nurses to leave this country next week, as they are bound to do, and at the same time see other young emigrants return home? Has he any consideration for what the country and particularly the elderly are suffering? This is discrimination at its worst. I hope the Minister and Minister of State will stand aside from the ministries they now hold and let others come in with new determination to rectify the matter. It is unbelievable in this day and age that we allow and expect a nurse to work on a Saturday for £8 additional pay. Would the Minister accept such remuneration? </P>
      <P>There are ways to resolve this dispute. Because of the urgency of the matter I hope the Minister will take it in hand, even at this late stage, and show that care will be provided. Someone should get hold of the two Ministers who are holding fast in a bullish way to deny the nursing profession adequate and reasonable remuneration for their efforts and the care they provide. No further time should be lost in ensuring a reasonable settlement is provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>After 80 years of service the Irish Nursing Organisation must be very disappointed because the Government has failed to address in an adequate and appropriate manner the three <Col N="1168" /> pay related recommendations specified by the Commission on Nursing in September. It failed to address the need to give improved recognition for long service at staff nurse grade. The proposal in regard to the allowance is too narrow in scope to fully acknowledge the skills accruing to further, specialist and post-graduate qualifications, for example, public health nurses and those with additional qualifications in psychiatry and mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The proposals for improved recognition for all promotional grades fall short of that required to fully recognise and reward the changing roles and increased level of responsibility which will accrue to those grades now and in the years ahead. For example, the proposal in regard to nurse teachers and senior nurse managers would result in the demise of nurse teachers within the profession and the downgrading of the role and influence of nurse managers at both hospital and community care level.</P>
      <P>The decision to strike was not taken lightly. It is to protect the interests of nurses and nursing now and in the future. With the acknowledged crisis in recruitment and the continuing retention of nurses, it is essential to take this stance and so ensure a quality nursing service endures to serve our health needs. I received a fax within the past half an hour from the Sligo General Hospital strike committee which it wishes me to read into the record. It states:</P>
      <P>(a) We want the Government to know and acknowledge that nurses are emotionally involved both with ill patients and illness within their own families.</P>
      <P>(b) Escalation is under discussion.</P>
      <P>(c) What are the Government's plans to remove this threat?</P>
      <P>(d) We believe this is the health service of the future and are very disappointed in it.</P>
      <P>The talk among young newly qualified nurses is that they will emigrate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>After 80 years of service, on October 19, the entire nursing staff went on strike leaving hospitals operating with an emergency service only. It was the first full scale national strike by nurses. An accumulation of years of festering discontent among health service workers meant that, in the end, the decision to strike was overwhelming. The Government, on the other hand, argued that nurses had stepped outside the normal pay dispute procedures and their hands are tied. The level of service, dedication and commitment given by the nursing profession over the years has been remarkable. It is regrettable that, at this time of buoyancy in the economy, highly qualified nurses are waving placards outside hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of public concern mounts at the prospect of this strike continuing. The duties performed by nurses are such as to have gained the respect and admiration of their fellow citizens. In recent times, we have witnessed <Col N="1169" /> the enhancement of the core skills and the increase in the level of responsibility which are undertaken on a daily basis by the members of this caring profession. Constant change in the technology and in the management of health care is such as to require ongoing training and upgrading of various special skills to enable them to provide the best care and nursing support skill suitable to the needs of a modern health service.</P>
      <P>It is right that nurses believe their skills are not properly acknowledged and that they consider themselves inadequately rewarded, taking account of their training, skill and capacity to do the job. The health service cannot afford this strike. Waiting lists for hospital inpatient treatment are already too large. It is inadequately addressed with too few resources applied to significantly reduce the burden which affects patients and medical care professionals, such as nurses, while also impacting on all engaged in the work within hospitals. The stress of inadequate staff and bed facilities make a physical and emotional job more difficult than it needs to be. These factors, which are within the control of the Minister for Health and Children, appear to have escaped both his and his fellow Government members.</P>
      <P>The Minister's performance in dealing with this sensitive issue shows his capacity to disregard the nurses' feelings or pay any respect to their just cause. Rather his behaviour is such as to be reminiscent of a well-fed, short trousered schoolboy terrorising his school yard colleagues as he smashes his way to victory, as he wields his conkers with no regard for the damage he will cause. Damage this Minister will do without cause unless he is prepared to stop his condescending, confrontational ways. The health service, which is overworked, understaffed and inadequately resourced, urgently needs a leader who can see the bigger picture, understands the opportunities and constraints and can take a position that promotes confidence and understanding.</P>
      <P>The country cannot afford this strike within this vital service. It will cause further chaos in the waiting lists, which are too long, and cause sour industrial relations to linger within our hospitals for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, and Deputies Batt O'Keeffe, Hanafin, Conor Lenihan and Eoin Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the amendment in the name of the Minister for Health and Children. As Deputy Cowen stated last night, this is a complex and difficult dispute. The Government is not seeking to face anyone down or to deny any group, particularly one such as the nurses who deserve recognition for the major contribution they have made to our society. We are, however, insisting on seeking to protect the principle of the partnership <Col N="1170" /> agreements which have achieved so much in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that for many years the nursing profession did not receive the attention it deserved. Significant improvements in the position of nurses have clearly been warranted, as a special case, and a comprehensive approach has been required in respect of the issue of concern to the profession and to the health sector as a whole. It is because the Government recognises this that we have been willing to go as far as we have in agreeing to the wide range of improvements which have been implemented or offered in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children outlined to the House the Government's absolute commitment to the Commission on Nursing, the report of which involves some 200 recommendations and sets out a comprehensive agenda for the development of the profession. Since the publication of the commission's report 13 months ago, significant progress has been made across a wide range of areas. Each of these developments has been helping to forward a progressive and ambitious programme for the nursing profession. The Minister for Health and Children has reiterated to the House that he intends to press on with this programme and is seeking agreement on the identification of priorities and implementation strategies. This is the only way of tackling as expansive an agenda as that set out by the commission.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the Government's commitment to fully meet the costly recommendations of the Labour Court and the Minister's funding for various professional development measures, we have clearly demonstrated that we are willing to put major funding behind our commitment to the nursing profession. However, we must work on the basis of protecting the policies which have enabled us to provide such a major allocation toward improving the position of such a major profession.</P>
    <P>There are those who have taken to publicly challenging the role of partnership agreements and have suggested that they have done nothing for ordinary people. This is absolute nonsense. Partnership is not some abstract economic idea which has no relevance to the real world, it has delivered in a major way for our society. Because of partnership, there are fewer unemployed people, the incomes of all groups have expanded beyond the cost of living, taxes are down for all groups and our social services have been greatly improved. In the area for which I have responsibility, among many other improvements, classes have become smaller, programmes are more responsive and funding has been increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>Partnership has also delivered for our health services. The expanded funding which has been put in place during the past two years has made a great difference. The physical infrastructure of hospitals throughout the country is being transformed by the largest capital investment pro<Col N="1171" /> gramme in the history of the health services. There are thousands of additional people working to deliver health services and previously excluded groups, such as people with disabilities, have seen a dramatic expansion in targeted services. This is not to say, however, that everything which needs to be done has been done. This is clearly not the case. However, it is equally clear that the only basis upon which we can guarantee investment needs, not just now but in the long-term, is if we continue in the way in which the partnership process has delivered.</P>
    <P>If we casually disregard the obvious effects of overturning the sound policies which have brought us to our current position, we will undermine our international competitiveness and we will suffer. The result will be reduced employment, weaker public services and lower standards of living in the long-term. Public sector pay requires a new approach along the lines outlined by the Taoiseach last month. Traditional relativities lead to an inflexible approach which bears little or no relation to performance. An imaginative approach which recognises performance and genuine reform is what is needed.</P>
    <P>Sunday's statement by the Nursing Alliance recognising the fact that the Government has to be concerned with operating within the context of the partnership process was welcome. The Minister for Health and Children has responded positively and has been working hard to find a process to deal with the issues raised by nurses which would facilitate the maintenance of social partnership in the future. The positive role of the ICTU in working to find a solution is also welcome. We trust that the talks currently under way will bring about such a solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has clearly demonstrated the good faith and the commitment of the Government in terms of investing in the future of the nursing profession and the health service as a whole. He is not being confrontational, despite attempts to stereotype him or subject him to the type of personal invective we witnessed earlier. That is not fair and it does not fit the bill. The Minister is committed to resolving this issue in the correct context by using the correct process. He has the full support of the Government in that regard. We will continue to do everything in our power to bring this dispute to an end as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I have been involved in a number of difficult disputes and I recognise that the nurses' dispute is the most difficult industrial dispute we have faced in a number of years. The Government's view, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, is that a way forward must be found which does not undermine our commitment to social partnership. I accept that this point has been made on a number of occasions but it is important to re-empha<Col N="1172" /> sise it. We support an imaginative approach to public service pay and structures within which the legitimate aims and aspirations of public servants, including nurses, can best be met.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that the nurses' dispute cannot be resolved in isolation from the wider public sector pay implications. Neither can the existing social partnership agreement be torn up and disregarded. On this basis, there is a whole range of possibilities opened up for nurses to pursue their legitimate agenda. Underlying the Government's approach is the concept that existing social partnership agreements must be honoured by all and the primacy of the Labour Court as a means of settling disputes must be upheld.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Nursing Alliance indicated, when meeting the Minister for Health and Children on Monday, that it is anxious not to undermine the Labour Court's role. In addition, it recognised the importance of ensuring that existing partnership agreements are not jeopardised. As Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I know how critical is the role of the Labour Court to the successful operation of our dispute settling procedures. This system is based on a voluntary and consensus approach by both employers and workers. Ignoring the existence of the Labour Court is not part of the solution to this dispute.</P>
      <P>In a sense this dispute is a test for the social partnership agreements which have served this country so well in the past 12 years. Again, as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I am conscious of the many valuable jobs provided for our young population as a result of this social partnership. If the social partnership model is to work effectively in the future, it must be capable of facilitating a speedy resolution of this dispute. Its integrity must be preserved by ensuring that existing agreements are honoured. This requires trust by all sides and I am sure that, in the overall framework of social partnership, a process can be devised which satisfies the needs of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While much of the commentary on the nurses dispute is focused on the pay issue, let us not forget that the Commission on Nursing's report contained more than 200 recommendations, of which only three related to pay. It is clear that the commission's report will feature in any process that will be put in place to resolve this dispute. In that context, the Government has already indicated its full commitment to the implementation of the commission's recommendations. These are designed to tackle the underlying problems within the nursing profession and to develop nursing as a key profession within the health service. The commission's report provided a significant framework for getting to grips with the more fundamental problems of nursing which need to be addressed. It outlined approaches for improving the way nurses are managed, for involving them in decision making, for giving them new career pathways, and for empowering them generally. Real and substantial progress has been <Col N="1173" /> made during the past year in addressing and implementing the central recommendations of the commission. It is worth noting that half the ordinary members of the commission came from the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>Issues advanced in the past year include: the establishment of a nursing education forum; the funding of nursing and midwifery planning and development units in each health board area; the enhancement of nursing input in Department of Health and Children policy development, by increasing the number of nurses directly involved in such activities from four to nine; the greater involvement of nurses in the management of the health service; the transfer to An Bord Altranais of responsibility for the management of pre-registration nursing and the promotion of nursing as a career; and the development of clinical career pathways which will allow staff nurses, in particular, an opportunity to progress up the promotional ladder.</P>
    <P>While it has been overshadowed by the problems associated with the pay related recommendations, clearly, considerable progress has been made in a difficult industrial relations situation in implementing many of the commission's recommendations. In short, the commission's report is about developing the role of nurses and giving concrete expression to the recognition of that role. The Government strongly supports these objectives. I am concerned that in the context of social partnership, a process be found quickly for dealing with the issues raised by nurses in this dispute. This must be done in a way which is consistent with the existing social partnership agreement and which does not undermine the continuance of social partnership in the future. I am convinced from my contacts with the social partners over the past week that they share this analysis and are working with Government towards finding such a solution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the indications from the Nursing Alliance that they too are willing to work to achieve this and I know from my experience as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs that all industrial disputes are resolved eventually. This may sound basic but it is the reality. I have been involved in a number of high-profile and difficult disputes that went on far too long. I welcome the central role being played by the ICTU in the discussions which have been taking place in the last few hours. I urge all concerned in this dispute to continue to work, in the spirit of partnership, to find the inevitable solution without further delay. Such delay can only result in more suffering for those who must do without the care and attention for which our nurses are justly highly regarded.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed that nobody wants this nurses' strike. The public do not want it, neither the Government nor the Opposition want it and the nurses certainly do not want it. The strike will cause hardship for many people, not least the nurses who are on the picket line. <Col N="1174" /> While it is very unusual to see anyone on a picket line these days, it is rare to see nurses there, who are probably the most highly regarded and respected profession in the country. It is not too long, however, since strikes were an everyday occurrence. That was a time when incomes were low, taxes and inflation were high, the present was black and the future was bleak. When a strike occurred in those days one had an offer on the table, a demand came from the other side of the table, negotiations took place and often the two sides split the difference. This strike is not like that and these times are not like those times. In the past ten years social partnership has changed the atmosphere to ensure that all of us can benefit from economic success.</P>
      <P>The nurses' strike is unusual in that nobody is saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The nurses have made demands in recent years. When those demands were met by awards of the Labour Court or other bodies, the Government said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. There is no bargaining involved in this strike. All that is needed is a process by which the Government can sit with the nurses and fulfil their demands. The Government is willing to do this. There is a willingness to recognise that nursing and midwifery needs to develop as a key profession within the health service. All of this has been outlined by the Commission on Nursing. The 202 recommendations of the commission are crucial to the future of the nursing profession. It is unfortunate that we have become bogged down in the three elements which relate to pay but the Government is committed to implementing the other 199 recommendations and has already spent money on that.</P>
      <P>Nurses deserve recognition for their work and all the pay awards that have been made to them. They deserve incremental recognition, formal education programmes and degrees and they deserve to be involved in management. However, the country deserves a process which will ensure that these demands and needs can be met while ensuring that social partnership is maintained.</P>
      <P>During the next few weeks we hope the social partners will agree a new partnership. It is in that context that we must find a settlement. I watched the ICTU representatives this evening when they were about to begin negotiations with the Government. They said they will not leave until a process has been found. Neither will the Government leave because despite what the Opposition claims, this is not a case of a schoolboy talking to the schoolgirls. This issue is not anti-woman. It is a question of social partners coming together to agree how to meet the demands of the nurses. There is a recognition of their real needs and a real desire to find a process by which they can be accommodated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We must address this issue from the point of view of partnership. What is partnership and what is a partnership approach? Patient care involves many skills and requires team spirit and a team approach. The patient, who is the first person to be cared for must be <Col N="1175" /> the centre of the team's attention. Whether in industrial relations or in a hospital, partnership is important. It is in everybody's interest that a partnership approach continues.</P>
      <P>We all agree that nurses' contribution to patient care has been enormous. It is a matter of great regret to all of us that this dispute has come to a head. It is particularly disappointing that so many of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Nursing were not debated and were not dealt with by negotiation. Because the three pay elements of the report have been isolated, many of the other recommendations which would have enhanced the stature of the nursing profession have been ignored. The nurses' representatives have said that nurses want to be appreciated and made a part of the system. Within the report is the basis for that recognition and status. This is what we would all like to see and the Government is committed to this. We should look at all of the 202 recommendations rather than concentrate on the three which refer to pay.</P>
      <P>We are all disappointed by the negotiating stance which has been taken by the nursing unions. The Government is faced with a difficulty with regard to partnership. There is an agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and industrial relations mechanisms have been put in place. A union has referred three recommendations to the Labour Court, which it has a right to do, and the decision of the Labour Court must be accepted.</P>

      <P>This difficulty is now accepted by the nursing unions. Because of Partnership 2000, there is a major problem for other unions within Congress. ICTU should talk to the nursing unions. The Government will talk to the employers and try to reach some measure of agreement within the parameters of Partnership 2000 whereby this dispute can be brought to a logical and meaningful conclusion.</P>

      <P>A number of members of my family have fallen ill and I have great admiration for the nursing profession, as does everybody else. However, it is important to underline that this is not just an issue about nurses but the wider partnership process and whether it is desirable to continue with it. It would be wise to negotiate a new national pay deal and within its confines nurses will get the justice that they richly deserve in terms of pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>The Government has adopted a developmental approach to the nursing profession by setting out clear objectives. It wants to upgrade the profession, introduce degree status and create extra grades, as was recommended in the report of the Commission on Nursing.</P>

      <P>Government members have mentioned that the focus of this dispute has been the three pay recommendations to the detriment of 197 others in that report. Public sympathy for nurses must be countered with the undesirability of failing to resolve this dispute. It is important that it should be resolved because it has implications for partnership and patient care and this must be at the heart of the approach of the Government, Opposition and the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>Focus must be put on patient care at every level of our health services and nurses do that work. There is a danger that patient care might suffer. Nurses have a responsibility in this regard and they will rise to that challenge. The LRC document should be looked at again as it suggested that there should be no strike deals for all the essential services &ndash; I do not suggest this as Government policy. If this were pursued it could lead to even greater pay rewards for the nursing profession and others who provide essential services. That should be examined in the long-term so that continuity of service can be guaranteed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beyond belief that a Government can stand by while such hardship is suffered by thousands of patients in need of care, by the families who depend on day care and residential places for children with disabilities and by those in receipt of daily visits from health board nurses.</P>
      <P>I declare an interest in the plight of the nurses. My daughter is a nurse and I have seen at first hand the pressures they must endure daily. I cannot understand how the Government allowed this crisis to happen, a crisis which affects every household in the country, either through involvement in the profession or reliance on the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ham-fisted approach of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance in the lead-up to the dispute was insulting to the nursing profession and repulsive to the majority of people. Every Member of the House has received hundreds of calls from anxious patients or their close family members demanding to know what will happen to their loved ones while the nurses are forced out on the picket lines. Sadly, the attitude of most senior members of the Government has only led to deeper anger and anxiety among the nurses and the public. It is only when the strike is over that the full extent of the misery and hardship which <Col N="1180" /> thousands of families have endured will be chronicled.</P>
    <P>I see the effects of the strike in my constituency in St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy, a geriatric hospital with a respite unit which is now closed. Naas General Hospital is in a similar position. Nurses are no longer willing to be treated as second class citizens or employees. They want to be recognised for their work, dedication, professional qualification and years of service in the health services. I ask the Minister to recognise the damage he has caused and ensure the strike is settled as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It was the attitude of this Government and Minister which forced the nurses onto the picket line. Why were the efforts which are now under way to find a resolution to the dispute not put in place weeks ago? Did the Minister honestly think the strike would not take place, that a largely female profession would not have the nerve to go on strike for its legitimate demands? Does the Minister feel any remorse or regret for the manner in which he has handled the dispute? If the Government had talked to the nurses in the proper fashion, it would have known the extent of the anger and frustration they felt. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance obviously decided that berating nurses and talking down to them would produce better results than dealing professionally with the outstanding issues which must be addressed. It was an ignorant and foolish policy and it was responsible for the crisis we face today.</P>
    <P>The nurses have served this country through good and bad times and will not be brushed aside anymore. They have said enough is enough. They have legitimate demands which deserve to be treated with respect and in a professional manner. Nurses will not accept second rate treatment from the Minister or anyone else. The Government must realise the damage it has already caused and ensure the dispute is resolved so that nurses can get back to what they want to do &ndash; give the best quality care to people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know much about nursing, but I know a thing or two about industrial relations. I know that if one allows a dispute to happen, attitudes inevitably harden and it is more difficult to resolve the dispute. The tentative steps now taking place ought to have happened at least two weeks ago. That is the ABC of industrial relations. The Taoiseach has built his reputation on his alleged bedside skills in that area, but those skills are entirely absent from his Cabinet and entirely foreign to the Minister for Health and Children, a stranger to the sensitivity required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing new about Labour Court recommendations being rejected. When a group of workers rejects a Labour Court recommendation by 95 per cent, that simply must be taken as meaning there is a serious problem. The Government allowed this dispute to happen and we listened to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, <Col N="1181" /> Deputy Kitt, as he repeated the mantra of social partnership. He stated:</P>
    <P>In a sense this dispute is a test for the social partnership agreements which have served this country so well in the past 12 years.</P>
    <P>That is meaningless. If there is to be effective social partnership it must be managed. No Minister in this Government has managed the process of social partnership. If it means no more than workers engaging in pay restraint in return for, albeit expanding, employment, that is not sufficient. It is not good enough for Deputy Eoin Ryan to say we now have a successful economy. That is the nurses' point. For too long they have been undervalued and have not been allowed to participate in that successful economy. They do not want to be on the picket line. There have been developments in nursing &ndash; Deputy Ryan should not shake his head.</P>

      <P>The HSEA must be given Government sanction to enable it to manoeuvre to settle a dispute that should never have happened. There are many things which must be resolved &ndash; the 2 per cent under Partnership 2000 which has not been utilised, roughly equivalent to £15 million; the question of annual leave, which does not have a knock-on effect; the proposals made by the Commission on Nursing; the building of a bridge to the next agreement and the real prospect of meaningful increases in take home pay through budget tax reform. There are many elements which could be resolved if there was someone in the Government who knew something about industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The Government clearly believes, as Deputy Conor Lenihan said, that it was unwise of the nurses to reject the Labour Court recommendation and that they are being foolish. The nurses are not being foolish, they are angry. They are angry after many years of being undervalued for the contribution they made when the economy was less successful. It is a tragedy that this dispute, through the indolence and lack of sensitivity on the Government benches, has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> Now that it has taken place, making the fatuous speeches which we have heard will not help. I do not want to say derogatory things about the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, because he is one of the nice Deputies on the other side of the House, but I hope he is not masquerading as Minister with responsibility for labour because he has never intervened in a dispute in his life. I do not know what his domestic situation is like, but on the national scale he does not know anything about it. If the Government cannot find someone to do that, a sad situation will occur.</P>

      <P>A leaflet handed out by nurses outside Naas Hospital had the heading: nurses still under stress, still underpaid and still under-valued. Nurses have been driven to the picket line by an intransigent and inflexible Government. Comments made by the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance who said nurses are hell-bent on national chaos, and the Minister for Health and Children have served to strengthen the resolve of nurses. No later than this evening, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy is again on record in the<i> Evening Herald, </i>with a &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; speech, in which he said he noticed a softening up in recent days. He was laying it on again, there was to be no change in the Government's position.</P>
      <P>At a time when our health service is barely managing to meet the needs of the public, it is unbelievable that the Government would plunge the health service into a crisis of this magnitude. Many nurses believe the Government's attitude is based on the fact that they are largely a female workforce. It was the Government's view that when &ldquo;push came to shove&rdquo; the nurses would cave in. I can assure the House and the Minister, who is not present to listen to me, this was a gross under-estimation of the anger felt by nurses and the justice of their demands. I saw that palpable anger in the picket lines in my constituency.</P>
      <P>What is the pay of a staff nurse who has worked for 40 years in the Irish health service? If she was starting off, presently, with a third level degree and work experience, she would be paid £14,000 per year. After 40 years of service she would be on £22,339 per year. Having reached that maximum after 11 years service, she can get no further increases. Some 80 per cent of nurses are in that category. That is the level of pay we as a society have decided to give nurses. That is why they feel under stress, under paid and under-valued. They have a genuine case compared with other paramedics, such as medical technologists and radiologists, who have a far superior level of pay and whose tasks are not as onerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With each hour the nurses are forced to remain on the picket line, those who depend on our health care system have to suffer increased hardship. It will take months, if not years, for the Irish health care system to recover from a protracted strike. The Government and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, know that at some stage they will have to sit down and deal with the nurses. The Nursing <Col N="1183" /> Alliance and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are anxious to facilitate such a development. The only intransigence remains on the Government's side. In an extraordinary statement the Minister for Finance this evening demanded his colleagues not to budge one inch in the talks and that the Government should not move from its present position. The Government is more interested in using taxpayers' money to place expensive advertisements in newspapers than in talking to the nurses.</P>
    <P>Nurses do not want to be on a picket line. They have been forced to take this action by the Government. It is time Ministers Cowen and McCreevy and the Taoiseach realised the harm they have caused over the past three weeks and have the decency to sit down like responsible employers and deal with the nurses' genuine grievances. I call on Independent Deputies Guildea, Healy-Rea, Fox and Blaney, to support the demand from this House and the Labour Party motion calling on the Government to enter&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a crying shame that the talks which are taking place did not commence much earlier when this crisis could have been averted. It was clear from watching &ldquo;The News&rdquo; this evening that the senior representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions walked willingly and positively into the discussions. That could have happened weeks ago and the dispute could have been settled long before the deadline for the strike. It is a shame that patients have had to endure suffering before the Minister commenced talks with the nurses' representatives. That is the main point being made in our motion of censure.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Stagg said. I too call on Deputies Blaney, Guildea, Fox and Healy-Rea to show they are worth their salt as public representatives, to stand up to the Government and vote with the Opposition in support of the nurses and to censure the Minister for Health and Children given that he did not enter into talks when it was opportune. We know this strike will not be settled in a day or two, that there are many issues to be discussed, that we are at the early stages of the process, the talks about talks. These talks should have taken place well in advance of the strike. Nurses' frustration, particularly for those who have been in the service for a long time, has much to do with the reward for the work they do. It is also about severe under resourcing in the health service. I will give a few examples in the health board of which I am a member. A paediatric ward cannot be opened due to lack of funds. Wards and theatres are being closed due to lack of funds despite the fact that waiting lists are increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Nationally, there are 2,530 people with intellectual disabilities waiting for appropriate places. There are people waiting for wheelchairs. St. Camillus', a geriatric hospital in Limerick which I visited this week, had to close long stay beds in order to open a stroke unit. We need both a stroke unit and long stay beds but a choice has to be made. That is disgraceful in a Celtic tiger economy where there is funding to spare.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and his colleagues in Government to wake up to the crisis in the health service. The health service needs tender loving care urgently. That is as much in the background of the nurses' dispute as the pay issue. However, the pay issue must be focused on now. We are censuring the Minister because the dispute has got to this stage. I plead with the Independent Deputies to support our motion and the Minister to deal seriously with the nurses because this issue has got to be resolved. I congratulate the nurses' strike committees for their work around the country. I have been in close touch with the committees in my constituency. They are working well in terms of keeping the emergency services in operation. Nobody wants this strike to continue, everybody wants it to be settled.</P>
    <P>There is huge public support for the nurses' grievances which must be addressed immediately. Nurses, as many speakers have said, have been undervalued. The system of connecting their demands with those of other people in the public service is of long standing. In my opinion the Commission on Nursing offers a way in which the issues can be addressed in a positive way. The whole question of relationships in terms of percentages must also be looked at in the context of future negotiations. For a person who earns £15,000 per year, a 3 per cent increase is much less than for a person who earns £60,000 and also gets a 3 per cent increase. However, that is a separate issue. The issue today is the nurses' dispute which must be dealt with seriously by the Minister and those negotiating on his behalf, so that we can get back to a caring health service. In the context of that dispute the Minister must address the other issues I have outlined. Deputies from all over the country would have similar stories about under funding in the health service. It is extremely difficult for nurses and other health professionals to do their job and it is making it very difficult for patients to receive the care we can afford and should give them.</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank the Labour Party for sharing some of its time with me. I support the motion before the House. The mentality that caused the 1913 lockout seems to be alive and well in this Government because it has made no effort to avert this strike. A meeting will be held to solve this dispute while it is taking place. The difficulties that existed two or three weeks ago will have to be faced in the coming days and a solution will have to be found. Nurses want to be in the wards looking after their patients. Public health nurses, who do such mar<Col N="1185" /> vellous work looking after people in their homes, are on the picket line but, like those to whom I have spoken, they do not want to be there. Nobody wants to go on strike but nurses in particular have a vocation and they want to look after their patients.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues have wasted a great deal of time telling the nurses to be good little girls and boys and accept what they have been offered. It is totally unacceptable that they let matters reach the stage where we now have a strike on our hands. Most strikes cause hardship but a strike in the medical profession causes even more hardship because, apart from the inconvenience to the nurses, ill patients are sent home and others who perhaps need operations cannot be admitted to hospital. In addition, relatives are concerned about their family members who need operations. It is totally unacceptable that a Minister would fail to sit down and talk to these people. At the very least he would have got some credit if he had sat down with them on a regular basis. It is better to try and fail than not try at all. The Minister and his advisers should have tried to sort out the problem before the strike began. He may have had to compromise somewhat but the inequities that currently exist in nurses' pay should be addressed.</P>
      <P>When we were in power some years ago, I advised the nurses to forget about a percentage increase and look for a review of their salary. As Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned, 5 per cent of nothing means a person ends up with nothing. A review of nurses' salaries was urgently needed. There was a statement in one of the newspapers that nurses were underpaid and undervalued. They are certainly underpaid and they may be undervalued by the Government but they are not undervalued by the public. Nurses carry out important and difficult work. We all want to be treated by nice nurses when we are in hospital. It is crazy not to have dealt with their grievances because they are few in number at this stage.</P>
      <P>I compliment the nurses on their generosity and their magnanimous approach in dealing with emergency cases while on strike. No other body would allow that to happen because it might be viewed as breaking a strike, but in an effort to look after their patients the nurses decided to be on standby and have left the picket line on occasions to help out in emergencies. That is an indication of the interest they have in the patients and it is to their credit that they are prepared to work for no pay. It is unfortunate that strong arm tactics have been adopted. One of the speakers on the Government side referred to a dispute between a boy and girl in the playground but it was a form of bullying in the playground that took place because the nurses were not listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the talks currently taking place, and in which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is involved, will come to a rapid and successful conclusion. This strike should never have started. <Col N="1186" /> The chaos that is being caused is indefensible. Even if the talks are successful, it will probably take another ten days to get matters moving again. I urge everybody involved in these talks to bring this unfortunate strike to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>On my way to Dublin this morning I passed through two towns, Letterkenny and Monaghan, and it was a disturbing spectacle to see so many nurses on picket duty outside their hospitals and health centres. It is unprecedented in the history of the State that such dedicated and committed people should be obliged to take to the streets to fight for their rights. It is even more disturbing when one realises that this strike could have been easily avoided. It is unbelievable that little or no effort has been made by the Minister or the Government to hold meaningful negotiations which could have averted the disaster we are now facing. Avenues of communication and negotiation, such as the Employer Labour Conference, were bypassed. It appears there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government and the Minister to bring about a showdown with the nurses. If that is their strategy, it is highly irresponsible. It is worse than playing with fire because they are playing with the health and welfare of people.</P>
      <P>Over recent days I have received messages from my constituents, as I am sure have many other Members, whose appointments have been cancelled. Some of those people have been waiting for a year or more for those appointments only to have their hopes dashed by lack of action on the Minister's part. Others who were due to have hip and joint replacement operations and other urgent procedures carried out had their admission dates cancelled and postponed. That will only lead to a lengthening of the already long waiting lists. We all know people who are two, three and even four years on a waiting list for urgent procedures. This strike will exacerbate an already serious situation in the health services.</P>
      <P>This dispute is prolonging the discomfort and the pain that accompanies illness. This strike should not have happened and it must not be allowed to continue. The Minister had all the answers while in Opposition two years ago and my colleague, Deputy Shatter, quoted extensively from some of the contributions made by the Minister when he sat on this side of the House. He is now in a position to do something about it but where has he led us? He must now act without further delay to bring this unnecessary strike, which is of his own making, to an end. Every hour of delay will endanger the lives of people and prolong their suffering and anxieties.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I agree with Deputy Stagg that the Independent Deputies &ndash; Deputy Blaney and Deputy Gildea are from my own county &ndash; could have an influence on this debate this evening. I am aware that Deputy Blaney had a meeting with the Taoiseach last night to discuss his serious concerns about a vote that will be taken at midnight in this House on Partnership for Peace. I hope he will have the same concern for the nurses' grievances at 8.30 this evening when we vote on this motion.</P>
    <P>As a former State employee I know it is possible to remunerate people without disturbing the structures of basic pay. As a former teacher I am aware that substantial allowances can be given for degrees, a higher diploma in education and certificates in various courses. Long service increments can be awarded to vice-principals, deputy vice-principals and people who hold other posts of responsibility. That is an area which should have been explored. The issue should not have been allowed to reach this stage without exploring all the possibilities.</P>
    <P>No nurse wants to be on a picket line outside his or her hospital. The Minister and the Government did not have the will to explore these avenues and that has resulted in the situation we now face. I implore the Minister and the Government to waste no time in getting nurses back to the wards where they want to be.</P>

      <P>As regards the impact of the strike on health services, the reports submitted to the Department of Health and Children today indicate that there have been no major difficulties on the ground so far. The acute hospital services are continuing to cope with the disruption arising from the strike, but constant monitoring and continued co-operation is required for the duration of the strike. In general, all day services, with the exception of dialysis and chemotherapy, have been cancelled. Fracture, warfarin and ante-natal out-patient clinics appear to be operating countrywide, with additional outpatient services in ophthalmology, paediatrics, cardiology, diagnostic breast and hepatitis C available in some regions. Accident and emergency departments are either quieter than normal or no busier than would be expected for the time of year. In-patient bed availability is generally adequate with a high proportion of vacant beds in most hospitals.</P>

      <P>Nobody should underestimate the significance of a national nurses' strike. When a group with no previous history of engaging in industrial action goes on strike, one may rest assured that something radically new is happening. One thing which is certainly new is the manner in which the Government has handled this dispute.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children drew attention in the House last week to my own role as Minister for Finance in other industrial disputes. I suppose, on one level, it was a fair point to make. However, the reality is that no Government of which I was a member was as prepared &ndash; and, probably, intent &ndash; on provoking a confrontation with a group of workers as this one clearly has been.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has come close to reprimanding the current Minister for Finance for his input thus far into this dispute. After the Minister's latest comments today, he should now go further. The Minister for Finance is responsible for a great deal of the anger now evident on picket lines and, despite the mild rebuke from the Taoiseach, he seems intent on digging the Government into an even deeper hole. It is surprising to see a Government so out of touch on an issue such as this. As is to be expected, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is leading the way.</P>
      <P>I have noted the Government's insistence on meeting the requirements of social partnership, and on one level I understand it. However, social partnership has replaced the Labour Court recommendation as the line the Government refuses to cross &ndash; the line in the sand, to use a phrase used in this House on a previous infamous occasion. The sanctity of the Labour Court recommendation diminished somewhat over the weekend.</P>
      <P>When reflected upon, this dispute may be seen as the final dispute of one era of social partnership or the first of another. This point seems lost on the Government. Growing economic affluence has seriously undermined the wage restraint for taxation equation which successfully lifted us all out of the economic doldrums. However, the doldrums are no more and the public will not be persuaded to the contrary by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, or anybody else.</P>
      <P>If that agreement was dying, it was dealt a final blow by the revelations from Ansbacher, the DIRT inquiry and the tribunals. Nothing annoys people more than when those preaching restraint are proved absolutely incapable of following their own advice. The other reality is that when Partnership 2000 was agreed, the fear was that the Celtic tiger, then a relatively new phenomenon, would not last. There was no current budget surplus planned then. This year, it will be in excess of £4,000 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that figures like that would have given rise to an excited debate about what <Col N="1192" /> could be done with the money, that the Government would be excited at the prospect of making this a fairer place to live or a country in which basic rights that have been denied to a substantial section of our population could, at last, be addressed. Take, for instance, what might be done in the health services. Anyone who buys the argument that more money would not make for a better service, as the Taoiseach said last week, is mistaken. More resources would not obviate the need for value for money spending, but they would certainly facilitate more and better delivered services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Critically, too, it would send a strong signal to a whole section of public sector workers, including nurses, that we, as a society, set great store on what they do. The Government had better realise that if it wants another round of social partnership, it urgently needs to articulate a sense of purpose that will persuade workers to sign up for it &ndash; in short, a vision of a new Ireland. The Government seems incapable of rising to this task. Social partnership is about more than a set of rules. It should also be a process. The Government's refusal, even at this stage, to negotiate with the nurses is a breach of the spirit of social partnership. It has known for three weeks that the Labour Court recommendations will have to be revisited in light of the extent of their rejection by the nurses. <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 September carried a story on the dispute under the headline, &ldquo;Cowen accepts strike is inevitable&rdquo;. It must be the first time that a strike was accepted as inevitable almost three weeks before it was scheduled to take place.</P>
      <P>This dispute must be resolved. Each day it drifts on, more damage is done to a health service already in crisis. Waiting lists, already unacceptably high, will lengthen. There is an obligation on both sides to bring it to an end. I note from the radio this morning that one side is ready and willing to engage in face to face talks with the people who have been taking out propaganda advertisements in the newspapers over the past few days. The question is whether the other side is willing to do likewise or if it is playing to another agenda. The next few days will answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everyone who spoke in favour of the motion. We are now 36 hours into the country's first ever nurses' strike &ndash; a strike which could and should have been prevented &ndash; and there is still no end in sight. There is no word for the sick and elderly who are directly affected by this breakdown in our health services. Throughout the country, nurses who should be at work are still on the picket line and they are frustrated, angry and determined. The Government bears full responsibility for this shambles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children refuses to listen and appears to have deliberately set <Col N="1193" /> about creating the conditions for the strike. He stated in this debate that, on Saturday last, he heard for the first time that the Nursing Alliance recognised the Government's difficulties in dealing with this matter. Did he once ask that question in the weeks leading up to the strike? Did it not cross his mind that perhaps he should sit down with the Nursing Alliance while there was still time and listen to what it did and did not recognise? In the response promptly given to him by the Nursing Alliance, Liam Doran made clear that he had always recognised the difficulty and not just at the eleventh hour. Until that point, the Minister had blocked all communication with the nurses, just when it was most needed. If nurses had been listened to with an open mind and given a fair hearing by the Minster and the Government, the likelihood of a strike would certainly have been greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>The Government is not interested in listening. The Minister for Finance prefers to insult nurses. The Taoiseach has proved himself very willing to sign hundreds of blank cheques worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, but he could not concern himself directly with the payment of wage cheques to nurses. He has, in effect, lent public support to the bad mouthing of nurses by his Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Where does that leave the Minister for Health and Children? He has been bellicose in style and yet, at the same time, inert in substance. The lethal mixture of the two has blown apart our health service at a time when it was already under serious and grave pressure. It has resulted in a disintegration of many of the normal daily services delivered by our hospitals and community care. The Minister, who was elected to run the health services, is leaving a strange legacy for posterity. He will be remembered as the Minister who went for his tea when the nurses went out on strike. He was elected to tackle the waiting lists and has succeeded in driving more patients onto longer lists. The message is clear: vote Fianna Fáil and the poor, elderly and children will suffer, and will continue to suffer unless the strike ends quickly. Since the Minister left no line of communication open to the Nursing Alliance, it took him until this weekend to discover that talking to nurses is feasible. That was well beyond the point when the strike could have been averted. It took until his meeting on Monday with members of the alliance for him to realise that there was mutual recognition of the problems which exist on both sides.</P>
    <P>Even until today, the Government approach has been desultory. It is as if this is a strike which could go on and which could be prolonged indefinitely. How different has been the approach adopted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Peter Cassells said today that he will not leave today's meeting without a formula or process for talks being agreed. It is the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which is driving the issue and which appreciates the urgency. What is needed at this point is an understanding of what is at issue <Col N="1194" /> in terms of the future of our health service and the important central role nurses play in it. We have not yet reached the point of talks. What we are reaching is day three of a strike which should never have happened. Is it any wonder there is a public perception that the Minister is in no hurry, that it is his intention to starve the nurses into submission? If that is the intention, it is a very dangerous one. The long-term damage to industrial relations within the health service will be incalculable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister does not want to pay the bills. As each day passes, his Department saves £2 million in nurses' salaries alone. The heroism shown by nurses in working to provide emergency cover without pay must not be used as a weapon against them. If that is the intention, the outcome is obvious. One does not need to look to Australia to know what can happen and to see where such tactics can end. The majority of nurses on strike do so without strike pay. The Government lost no time in stopping their pay on day one of the dispute. At the same time in many cases, nurses' workloads during the strike has increased by anything up to 40 per cent as they attempt to cover for their picketing colleagues. Hospital doctors are doing double and treble shifts. Their difficulties will become more acute as people are pushed to their limits, as the tiredness engendered from the lack of relief sets in, and as people have to cover duties normally covered by nurses as well as their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has tabled this motion because we believe it is a positive way to resolve the strike. We call on every Deputy to support the motion, especially those Deputies who describe themselves as Independents and who represent counties such as Kerry, Donegal and my county of Wicklow. I want to see a resolution of the strike and many other Deputies have said the same during this debate. The motion offers the opportunity to sort this out swiftly and fairly and to make up for all the prevarication, failure and abuse which lies at the door of the Government. We have an opportunity and the Independent Deputies, who meet every week with the Government Whip and who are the most powerful people in this Chamber, have it on their conscience to make the choice to stand with the nurses and patients and the resolution of the strike so that the nurses can return to the hospital wards and care for the sick and the elderly who depend on them. Sick and elderly people live in Counties Donegal, Kerry and Wicklow. They want their nurses to return to work.</P>
    <P>Independent Deputies will prevent this from happening if they cravenly and silently support the Government. Not one of them has turned up this evening and I ask them why. I challenge them now: why does the sick and elderly in the communities they represent matter so little to them? Do they matter less than having tarmacadam laid on a few roads? People need the support of all <Col N="1195" /> Deputies in the House and I urge them to support the Labour Party motion tonight.</P>

    <Title>Partnership for Peace: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, 13 October 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann approves participation by Ireland in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), and that it further approves the terms of Ireland's PfP Presentation Document, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 5th October, 1999.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To add the following to the motion:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;and further accepts that any proposed future amendment to the areas of participation by Ireland in the Partnership for Peace as outlined in the Presentation Document will be put before Dáil Éireann for approval.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to my fellow county man, the late Jack Lynch, who will go down as one of the great leaders of this country and of Fianna Fáil. Jack Lynch was respected by his peers in the sporting, political and legal fields and was revered by the public. He steered the country through difficult times in the early 1970s, never taking his eye off the ball. He also steered Ireland into membership of the EEC which brought us socially and economically into new markets and transformed Ireland into a dynamic, forward-looking country. I extend my condolences to his wife, Máirín, his brother Finbarr and the other members of his family. Ar dheis Dé a anam dílis.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate time to discuss Partnership for Peace, as Jack Lynch, who led us into the EEC, had a vision for Ireland. He saw Ireland developing in a Europe which would come together and grow, and felt it was our destiny to join in that development of the European Union. When discussing PfP it is important to examine our motives for entering the organisation. In accepting the invitation to participate in PfP, Ireland is restating its commitment to the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the peaceful settlement of disputes. PfP, and the co-operative values which underlie the partnership, are compatible with these commitments and objectives. We must not forget this fact and we must emphasise those principles.</P>
      <P>It is also important to state that Ireland pursues, and will continue to pursue, a policy of military neutrality and does not intend to become a member of NATO. Ireland's decision to participate in PfP is in full accordance with our policy of military neutrality which has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security based on international law. The partnership is established as an expression of a joint conviction that stability and security in the Euro-Atlantic area can be achieved only through co-operation and common action. The protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, and the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace through democracy are shared values fundamental to the partnership.</P>
      <P>In joining the partnership, the member states of NATO and the other states subscribing to this document recall that they are committed to the preservation of democratic societies, their freedom from coercion and intimidation, and the maintenance of the principles of international law. They reaffirm their commitment to fulfil, in good faith, the obligations of the charter of the United Nations and the principles of the universal declaration of human rights, specifically to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, to respect existing borders and to settle disputes by peaceful means. They also reaffirm their commitment to the Helsinki final act and all subsequent CSCE documents, and to the fulfilment of the commitments and obligations undertaken in the field of disarmament and arms control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and other speakers have stated that we are committed to the PfP only in so far as we <Col N="1201" /> wish. There are those who claim Ireland is the only neutral country entering PfP. It is important to stress this is not true. Of the 43 countries who have signed up for PfP, 24 are non-members of NATO. The member states include all our EU partners and the neutral states of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. Most of those who oppose joining PfP also led the opposition to joining the EEC, the Maastricht Treaty and the euro. They have been wrong every time and there is no reason to believe they are right on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long and honourable tradition in peacekeeping. Some would like to keep our soldiers in the 1958 mode when the Army was first deployed under the UN in Africa. At that time our soldiers wore bull's wool uniforms which were most uncomfortable in the tropical heat, and used 1958 weapons. Some of those who oppose this motion would like the Army to remain in a 1958 mode. It is time the Army was allowed to operate in the realities of 1990s and the new millennium. Times have changed and we must be open to change. Successive Governments, including those involving the Labour Party, have favoured joining PfP as they knew it was the right course of action. Some of the present Opposition have changed their minds for the sake of opposition, which does not say much for that party.</P>
    <P>Relations between the Western European Union, NATO and the EU were enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty of 2 October 1997. That treaty was ratified by the Irish people on 22 May 1998. That is why it is false to suggest that the people did not have an opportunity to state their views on the relationship between Ireland, the EU, NATO and the Western European Union. I support the motion and look forward to Ireland taking its place among the nations of Europe and going forward in that Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to contribute to this important debate. I support Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace, but I also deplore the decision of the Government to abandon the undertaking it gave to the people to first put the matter to a referendum. That undertaking was given by the Taoiseach in clear and unambiguous terms and it has been cited by many colleagues during the course of this debate. I will not repeat it now. The decision to abandon the commitment is dangerously cynical in that nothing has changed since 1997 to alter the argument in any way. The merits and demerits of the argument are exactly the same as they were two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has changed of course is that Fianna Fáil is now in Government and those at the top of that party have changed their minds or seem to have changed their minds. In saying that, perhaps I am giving them too much credit. Perhaps it is more reasonable to presume they were always in favour of participation and chose deliberately to mislead that section of the electorate who cared deeply about this sort of issue. The decision of the Government is dangerous in that it will feed pub<Col N="1202" /> lic cynicism about the political process. Some people did believe the Taoiseach when he made his promise. I met some of them myself during the European elections campaign and I am sure other colleagues did also. Those people are understandably and justifiably disillusioned and angry at what they rightly see as a breach of trust. Huge damage has been done to the institutions of our democracy already by the events which are unfolding at Dublin Castle. The Taoiseach is adding to the damage done by his predecessors by this act of deliberate cynicism.</P>
    <P>To return to the merits of the argument itself, I said at the outset that I support participation in PfP and I do, but I want to go further than that. I also believe that it is time for us Europeans to find a way to deal with our own security needs without recourse to our friends across the Atlantic. This will not be easy and it will not come cheap, but it must be done and the time to do it is now.</P>
    <P>I have not always held this view. Until a few years ago I could never have imagined myself in a position where I would argue publicly for an increase in Defence spending, but I changed my mind. Many people like me changed their minds because of what happened in places like Zepa, Srebenica and Gorazde, the names of which should be burnt irrevocably into the minds of anyone who wants to contribute to this debate. Before Yugoslavia, Europeans of my age, and those a little older, had no experience, however indirect, of war in Europe. In truth, most of us assumed we would live out our lives without the experience of the wars which were visited on previous generations this century. In so far as we thought about it at all, we were complacent. Yugoslavia changed all that and the massacres of Gorazde and Srebenica changed it irrevocably. What was shocking about the atrocities of Yugoslavia was that it happened just a few hundred kilometres from the borders of the EU, just a few hundred miles from Venice and Trieste.</P>
    <P>What was shocking about Yugoslavia was that it demonstrated with brutal clarity that even sophisticated communities such as those of Sarajevo could be rent apart by the power of nationalism or, as some would have us call it, ultra nationalism. What was perhaps even more shocking about Srebenica was that it happened under the eyes of Dutch troops who were unable to stop it. It is easy to get emotional and angry about the massacres in Yugoslavia and in a sense it is important that we should do just that, but the facts bear some study and we can learn from what happened.</P>
    <P>The United Nations was in Bosnia more or less from the start. Its initial role was to provide escorts for food convoys and humanitarian relief. Later the UN troops were asked to open Sarajevo Airport to ensure the city would have a lifeline to the outside world. This they did with a greater or lesser degree of success, but things started to get complicated in the face of ethnic cleansing, which was practised largely by the Serbs. Finally <Col N="1203" /> the UN mandated the creation of six safe areas, including Srebenica, Gorazde and Sarajevo. UN mandated forces were dispatched to these six areas with instructions to protect the local populations. The problem was of course that it was all a big bluff. The UN troops never had the wherewithal to carry out their mandate and everyone knew it. The Serbs knew it and so did the US, the UN and the EU. We sent in a token force of under-armed troops in the hope that the Serbs would back off. We asked the UN to do a job and then denied it any possibility of doing that job. The safe areas were a joke and the Serbs knew it. The result was that Dutch teenagers stood by when the men of Srebenica were taken away in their thousands to be shot in the woods.</P>
    <P>The lessons are stark and clear. All the UN resolutions in the world are not worth a damn in the face of forces who are prepared to use force to get their way. A token international presence is of little help and may even make things worse. It is clear, for example, that the NATO bombing of Serb gun positions in Bosnia outside Sarajevo was postponed several times because the UN feared justifiably that its forces might be taken hostage.</P>
    <P>For me, the moral and political imperative is crystal clear. What happened in Yugoslavia must never be allowed to happen in Europe again. There are a host of ways in which we can go about ensuring it does not happen again. We can and we must demonstrate political and economic solidarity, and use all our powers of persuasion to persuade those who are intent on violence that this is not the way to go. However, when push comes to shove and all else has failed, fascism must be stopped. People like Slobodan Milosevic must know they cannot win because we will not allow them to win.</P>
    <P>This demands, irrespective of whether we like it, that we have the military capacity to stop people like him. At present, the only game in town is NATO. I do not like that and I resent it. We should not have to call on the Americans to be the policemen of Europe. I suspect they do not like doing the job and I do not imagine they will continue to do it for much longer, but it is then incumbent on those of us who make this argument to say what we can put in its place. Never before has there been such an imperative, such a need. Never before has there been such a possibility to develop an alternative structure. Earlier Deputy Bruton spoke about the events at Cologne earlier this year, and he is right. Many of our European colleagues at the highest level are speaking about the possibility of developing alternative structures for security in Europe. We cannot stand idly by and say and do nothing. We cannot pretend the debate is not happening because it is. It is incumbent on Ireland, as a sovereign State with a unique input into these matters, to make our voice heard and to make our contribution.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that future UN mandates will be carried out by regional forces. In Europe the <Col N="1204" /> likelihood is that must be some form of structure centred on the Western European Union. At present, IFOR and SFOR are operated effectively by NATO under UN mandates and, therefore, we must engage at EU and Western European Union levels to develop an alternative structure with which we will be comfortable.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the UN. It is of course ideal and preferable that we should in all cases operate under UN mandates, but we must be critical about this and we must consider how the veto works. For the life of me, I do not understand why, 55 years after World War II and some 30 years after the decolonisation of most of the world, the United Kingdom and France continue to wield veto powers at the UN. I am not prepared to concede to Russia and, with all due respect to him and to our Russian friends, to Boris Yeltsin the power to decide whether people in Yugoslavia get slaughtered, nor am I prepared to concede to China, a country whose human rights record does not stand much scrutiny, the power to decide whether people in East Timor get slaughtered. The veto must change and it must change soon.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend all of what I have said is directly related to PfP. The PfP cannot do what I have just described. It cannot provide the entire security infrastructure for Europe because PfP is something far more modest than that. In many ways talking about PfP is a bit of a misnomer because it is not an organisation as such.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of opponents of PfP oppose it in the same way as they oppose EU integration and the single currency and, by and large, they are the same people. PfP is portrayed as some sort of uniform definable organisation with set goals and rules of membership. Nothing could be further from the truth. PfP must be one of the few organisations that allows its members to set their own rules. The presentation document illustrates what the priorities are in terms of our historical foreign policy and constitutional provision and, by and large, I am happy with that document.</P>
    <P>One of PfP's central objectives is promoting the civilian control of the military and, contrary to the hysterics of some, PfP has a real and substantial agenda to limit and regulate armaments sales and, most significantly, to enforce current international agreements on non-proliferation. I looked at the PfP work programme for the years 2000-2002 and it contains quite a few specific commitments which were interesting. It also contains a very interesting work programme. Even if we set aside the political work programme and look purely at the military it bears study. We are talking about, for example, the improvement of inter-operability in the field of peacekeeping; the exchange of experience, developments and lessons learned from peacekeeping operations; the development of common procedures and rules of engagement and consideration of equipment related issues; mine awareness and demining training; developing knowledge and understand<Col N="1205" /> ing of the legal parameters covering peacekeeping, peace enforcement and other peace support operations and so on. What do we have to fear from these activities and values? Nothing.</P>
    <P>Many people watched the tragedy in Bosnia and wondered what could be done. Even at the time, international commentators were predicting further trouble in Kosovo and sadly it was not long before it came to pass with little advance in the interim in terms of the ability of the international community to respond quickly and early. Yet today, unfortunately, we are in no different a position. Throughout Europe there are potential flash points that could easily develop into similarly grim conflicts. All around Central Europe ethnic minorities are caught on the wrong side of borders, Slovakia and Hungary, Romania and Hungary, the Baltic States. Further east into the Caucasus it is patently obvious that the assistance of nations experienced in peacekeeping may help deal with conflict &ndash; all this before we look at Russia proper.</P>
    <P>Anchoring Russia into a co-operative security relationship with Europe is the most important task in European security and clearly PfP has a role to play in this. Building trust in Europe between the peoples is a political and economic challenge but we would be kidding ourselves if we did not also acknowledge that there is a security aspect as well. I am not suggesting that security flows exclusively from military capacity, far from it. But I believe that building a mutual interdependency in matters of defence as well as everything else can help to make this continent a safer place in which to live. We can play only a small part in all of this but we should not hesitate to play that part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. In participating in PfP Ireland restates its commitment to the development of a just and peaceful international society based on democracy. Mention of democracy prompts me to ask why has this Government not given a democratic choice to the electorate to express its opinion on our participation in PfP. The Government promised a referendum but has reneged on its promise. For the Taoiseach and the Minister to say the public has little interest in this debate indicates that they are not listening and are only searching for an excuse not to grant the electorate such an opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a debate has led to uncertainty and much misinformation. The Government's lack of initiative in this area is responsible for this. I question the Government's stated commitments and how particular its objectives are given its lack of enthusiasm towards PfP. Ireland has established itself as a recognised peace-keeper on the world stage within the United Nations. It is important that we retain this status in a European and world context. The Government has shown itself to be uncertain and reluctant participants in the whole concept. Its U-turn is evidence of this. As a result, its voice is weak and lacks the leader<Col N="1206" /> ship we could give because of our record within the UN peacekeeping programme.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been cynical on this issue. It promised one thing in Opposition and in Government did the opposite. In a speech as Opposition Leader in 1996 the Taoiseach said in a debate on the White Paper: </P>
    <P>The PfP involves joint exercises with NATO on sea or land. Will they take place in Ireland? Will we be able to choose the NATO countries with whom we wish to have exercises? Will we have British troops back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans on Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle? Is that what we are talking about, or will we take part in exercises abroad under NATO command?</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>We would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in Western European Union tasks by resolution through this House without reference to the people who, under our Constitution, have the right &lsquo;in final appeal to decide on all questions of national policy' as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic.</P>
    <P>Was the Taoiseach uninformed when he made that contribution or was he trying to arouse public debate through such provocative statements? Some of those on the Government side have a tradition of making such statements at an appropriate time and withdrawing from them later. That is a damning statement and I do not know how the Taoiseach can stand by his present position having made that statement a few years ago.</P>
    <P>There were statements in the Fianna Fáil manifesto opposing PfP membership. The Minister, Deputy Andrews, stated in the House in December 1997 that the PfP is a back door to NATO. It is strange that he said that when in her contribution to this debate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, stated that, as has been made clear in the House on previous occasions, a referendum on the matter is not required for PfP, would not be in conflict with our neutrality. Participation in PfP will be in full accordance with our policy of military neutrality and participation in PfP does not entail membership of NATO or any alliance commitments. If ever there was a case of confusion within the Government ranks there is the evidence of it. As a result of these comments, I believe the position being put forward by the Government is seriously weakened. On the contrary, our party's policy on this issue is clear and consistent, as presented by Deputy Gay Mitchell. We initiated the debate on this topic and, as part of the rainbow Government, published a White Paper on this issue.</P>
    <P>The current Administration has not fostered that debate and it has denied the people an opportunity to express their opinion &ndash; an opportunity it promised to give them when in Opposition. Such a debate could help to refute many <Col N="1207" /> of the unfounded statements and the raft of misinformation now in circulation in the absence of public participation in the debate.</P>
    <P>Forty three countries participated in the establishment of PfP, 16 of which are NATO member states. We must participate and not stand idly by. We must lead and direct the PfP's policy relative to our proud tradition. We must demand that the Government, despite its lacklustre contribution, clearly decides on our behalf the level and nature of its commitment and participation in the future. PfP must show itself to be an organisation which will allow dialogue and co-operation between former adversaries and prevent the re-emergence of conflict in a Europe as we leave behind centuries of strife and war and begin a new millennium where peaceful co-existence and co-operation will be consolidated for future generations. Human rights must be protected in Europe and throughout the world. We should become leaders in this important area. It is fundamental for Ireland to participate in this area and direct policy.</P>
    <P>Can we stand idly by at a time when 1.5 billion people earn less than a dollar a day and the same number have no access to clear water? Mrs. Robinson, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, has stated that &ldquo;we are in danger of reaching a point where the world is divided &ndash; not between developing and developed states, but between overdeveloped and never-to-be-developed states&rdquo;. She blamed &ldquo;a failure of will on the part of governments&rdquo;, who spend $800 billion a year on weapons and concluded that &ldquo;we can, and must, do better&rdquo;. She also stated that &ldquo;the credibility of our institutions of governance is at issue.&rdquo;  This comes at a time when half the nations of the world participate in torture.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should participate in human rights protection. Torture remains a global problem of great magnitude. It is carried out systematically in more than 40 countries which are members of the United Nations and is practised sporadically in many more. Many of the countries which have ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture still practice or tolerate the use of torture within their boundaries. Consequently, every day new names are added to an already huge list of torture victims throughout the world. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of victims. However, in January 1997 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that there were 13.2 million external refugees and 4.9 million internal refugees in the world. Many of these, who belong to opposition or national minority groups, are torture victims. Prior to leaving their homes they have been persecuted and often tortured in police stations, prisons or detention camps. Surely we must have a part to play in changing this.</P>
    <P>When we sign the partnership framework document relating to PfP, we must insist on a flexible and beneficial input for Ireland. This should set out our agenda for our participation and it should clearly indicate our priorities for our <Col N="1208" /> involvement, namely, in the areas of human rights, freedom, justice, peace and crisis management. I am glad that support for our membership is not, and never will be, a backdoor to NATO membership. Proof of this is the fact that the neutral countries within the EU, Austria, Finland and Sweden, and Switzerland from outside it are all participants in PfP. I hope our participation could facilitate greater North-South co-operation and extend and further develop British-Irish co-operation.</P>
    <P>Since 1958, Irish peacekeepers and military observers have participated in 46,000 individual tours of duty involving 36 United Nations peacekeeping missions. Based on this experience, Ireland is prepared to participate and contribute to a co-operation and partnership framework. It is important that our experience in peacekeeping operations should underline the importance of our participation in the future. As peacekeepers and crisis management personnel, Irish forces serving abroad have contributed advice to Third World countries and to refugees throughout the world. I hope our participation in PfP will lead to our increased participation in areas where we have built up a wealth of experience and goodwill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the debate on Partnership for Peace has centred around the concept of Ireland's neutrality and how our neutral status would be affected under the new regime. In Opposition in 1996, as I am sure Members on this side of the House have already recalled, Fianna Fáil, as the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, will remember, was of the view that signing up for PfP was a step towards compromising Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. So misguided was Fianna Fáil at that time that its then Foreign Affairs spokesman, Mr. Raphael Burke, said membership of Partnership for Peace amounts to second class membership of NATO. He pointed out that PfP has a nuclear capability which is &ldquo;anathema to the Irish people&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil promised a referendum and we know the rest. It refused, however, to point out that many members of the United Nations have the nuclear capability so much feared by Mr. Burke. Fianna Fáil, however, did not see the inconsistency of its argument and, in the interest of base political motives, it promised, from the Opposition benches, to hold a referendum &ndash; a commitment on which it is now welching. Such breathtaking hypocrisy only increases public cynicism and the Taoiseach and his Ministers must stand indicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour Ireland joining PfP and my party, Fine Gael, has been consistent in this regard. I would go further than some within my party and state that Ireland should join the Western European Union, to which it has much to contribute and offer in terms of shaping a new Europe for a new millennium. For some reason, the mere mention of NATO excites people to a state of apoplexy. <Col N="1209" /> We have seen some of this hysteria in recent days. This fear has been unfairly exploited by those opposing PfP in the current debate. PfP is not NATO and much of what has been said to date against Ireland's participation is simply scaremongering. PfP was a response to the ending of the Cold War, largely aimed at Baltic, central and eastern European states. While many of the recently formed independent states that were formerly members of the Soviet Union wish to consider joining NATO, PfP was established to allow them to enjoy a positive relationship with NATO without being obliged to join it.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider the position of Russia, Sweden, the Ukraine, Austria, Finland and Malta, none of which has joined NATO. Russia remains positively against the concept of NATO. It is worth examining the status of European states in relation to PfP and NATO. In addition to the countries to which I already referred, PfP includes such diverse states as Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and Moldova. Forty three OSCE members are now in PfP, with only Cyprus and Ireland, along with three states of the former Yugoslavia, outside the group. The fact that Switzerland, the most neutral of states, has joined PfP puts much of Ireland's opposition into stark perspective and puts paid to many of the anti-NATO neutral sentiments of the Green Party and others opposing from within this jurisdiction. Switzerland has joined PfP and refuses to join the United Nations because, it says, the United Nations carries legal obligations with which it might not be entirely happy. Partnership for Peace, we are told, threatens Ireland's neutrality but in no way interferes with the neutrality of Switzerland. Yet our membership of the United Nations raises no hackles in any quarter other than the argument that we are owed money by the UN.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is not a back door to NATO. Rather, it is a response to the totally new landscape of European security opened up by the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of communist eastern bloc and Soviet states. It offers a means of co-operating on military and peacekeeping matters to countries anxious to remove themselves from the adversarial structures imposed by years of confrontation between the two mighty blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union from the Second World War until the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>Our proud membership of the European Union should manifest itself in greater participation in political matters at the heart of Europe. Ireland should develop closer links with the Western European Union by sharing, as the foreign policy White Paper says, &ldquo;its extensive experience of international peacekeeping with other European states&rdquo;. We have been far too preoccupied with the financial benefits of our EU membership. For many Irish people Europe means no more than Structural Funds and headage payments. As we approach the new millennium, Europe impacts positively in so many <Col N="1210" /> ways on the life of the average Irish citizen, areas of consumer protection, equality issues, health protection, food safety, recognition of educational degrees mutually between states of the Union as well as freedom of movement and of trade and commerce. The European Union has been a great success, not only for Europe but also for this country. To prove this we only have to look at Europe in the 40 years from 1917 to 1957 and contrast it with Europe in the 40 years from 1957 to 1997. The European Union is now the world's premier economic bloc. Economic success and closer political co-operation go hand in hand so it is logical and desirable that closer political ties are established among the states of the European Union. If Europe does not engage in common security and defence arrangements we will continue to exhibit the paralysis that was dependent on the United States taking an initiative on our part in Bosnia and, earlier this year, Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot stand back from further evolution of common foreign and security policy. We have a proud record in the area of peacekeeping and crisis management. This will continue in PfP with emphasis also on international human rights. As the Fine Gael leader, John Bruton, has said on numerous occasions, &ldquo;If one is willing to be part of a political union one must also be willing to defend this union&rdquo;. I share this view.</P>
    <P>Central to defence and security in Europe is the relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union. The Western European Union is recognised by the Maastricht Treaty as an integral part of the development of the Union and a majority of our partners in the European Union are of the view that the Western European Union should be developed as the defence component of the European Union. I fully agree with this. I attended sub-committee meetings of the Western European Assembly in my capacity as chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Defence in the last Dáil. This was under our current observer status. Such a role is informative only and we are disadvantaged by the fact that Western European Union members are not obliged to act on any view that Ireland might have on any subject at any time. It is like being picked on an All-Ireland football final team and, while being fully fit, confined to the sideline on the day of the match. We should become full members of the Western European Union alongside our European partners. This would give Ireland full access to the decision making process and enable us to impress our views on European security and defence issues within the Western European Union. This would involve mutual defence arrangements of a type not envisaged before and would, by definition, change our concept of neutrality. If that demands a referendum, which I believe it would, so be it.</P>
    <P>A European defence and security arrangement in the post-Cold War and post-Maastricht era must be developed and cannot be left up in the air. There is a web of relationships between the EU, Western European Union, NATO, CSCE <Col N="1211" /> and the UN. Working by means of a pan-European organisation is both difficult and complex but we cannot opt out and decide that we shall have no involvement. The late Seán Lemass anticipated Ireland contributing to the new European Community defence structures as economic and political union progressed and developed. His successors as Taoiseach shared his view. In March 1981 the Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, told the Dáil, &ldquo;Neutrality and non-alignment is incompatible with membership of the European Community and with our interests and ideas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We do not have a tradition of neutrality like that of Sweden, Switzerland or Austria. Moreover, we are not in a position to defend ourselves from external aggression from whatever source it comes. There is no mention of neutrality in our Constitution and the use of our neutral status as a bargaining chip during the past 60 years removes credibility from a claim of moral conviction in the matter of neutrality which we like to point out from time to time. This claim is fundamentally flawed. After the Second World War our neutral position and the question of joining NATO were handled by successive Governments, not as a matter of national principle but as a bargaining chip linked to the partition of this island. In 1949 when NATO was being structured, Ireland's rejection was not due to any principled stance on neutrality but because the partition of Ireland was judged to make it impossible for us to join any military alliance beside Britain. Seán MacBride, the Minister for External Affairs, was adamant that as long as partition remained, any military alliance was totally out of the question. When he visited the United States in 1949, Seán MacBride committed Ireland to full NATO membership if Britain withdrew from Northern Ireland. Two years later, Mr. de Valera took exactly the same line. Partition was the stated stumbling block, not any principled neutral stance. The late Jack Lynch &ndash; I join fellow Members in offering sympathy to his wife Máirín on his passing &ndash; and Paddy Hillery, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, made it clear in the course of preparation for EEC membership that as the Community developed towards political unity and common defence, Ireland would play its part. Ireland's traditional principled military neutrality does not stand up to examination and is shown to be little more than a sham when subjected to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, in the context of the PfP debate, seem anxious to cling to policies and ideals more appropriate to the war-torn 1930s than to the Europe of the new millennium. Of course, we have a positive role to play and, while remaining outside NATO, we should actively participate in the Western European Union so that our influence can be exercised on EU defence policy. We can add our voice within the Western European Union towards proposing a defence and security philosophy more in line with that of Sweden, Austria and Finland that with that of the NATO <Col N="1212" /> countries. European defence policy can be non-aggressive and acceptable to countries like Ireland, Sweden and Austria. We can benefit from the availability of jobs and investment which the major European powers are committing to defence and security within the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>We have other options but one option which is not available is to stand back, stick our heads in the sand and do nothing. Economic and political isolation is not a possibility. We cannot turn back the clock on the unprecedented opportunity presented by the end of the Cold War to create a prosperous and peaceful Europe. We must play our part positively and actively. Ireland should play its role, perform its duty and meet its obligations for European defence. Never before have so many people in Europe lived together in a period of peace and harmony. We can continue to build on this peace and prosperity among our culturally diverse European neighbours from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. Joining PfP is part of the structure that, with economic and political union, will put an end to strife and war in Europe and beyond. Anything less is a negative cop-out of Pontius Pilate proportions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I join colleagues in offering my sympathy to Máirín Lynch, widow of the late Jack Lynch. I had great respect for a loved son of Cork who was a great politician and leader of the Fianna Fáil Party. Indeed, he showed his prowess at an early stage on the hurling and football fields. I received nothing but kindness and courtesy from the man whenever we met. He will be missed deeply.</P>
      <P>I speak tonight with mixed feelings. On the one hand, Ireland should join PfP &ndash; it should have done so many years ago &ndash; while, on the other, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the Government's approach to this issue and, in particular, that of Fianna Fáil. It is unfortunate that we are dealing with this issue in this manner because in recent years, especially since the publication of the White Paper on foreign policy into which all parties had an input, we tried for the first time since the foundation of the State to give the public a sense of ownership in terms of the formulation of foreign policy. I mean no disrespect to the civil servants working in the Department of Foreign Affairs, for whom I have the utmost respect following my time working with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of submissions received and seminars around the country, in developing foreign policy we set out to give the people a sense of belonging which they did not have heretofore. That was achieved to a certain extent. Many people involved in non-governmental organisations and members of the Defence Forces who have served abroad with the UN and other organisations have an abiding and continued interest in foreign policy. However, it is unfortunate that I detect a great degree of discomfort in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1213" /> Party regarding the manner in which this matter has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>That is understandable, particularly when one looks at the record of the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, and the present Minister for Foreign Affairs. When in Opposition they displayed an absolute lack of understanding of PfP. I do not know whether that was deliberate but for many years, they raised this issue, as others have put on record during this debate. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have found justification for Ireland joining PfP which they did not have prior to the 1997 general election.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of Ireland joining in terms of its responsibilities and obligations on the international stage but it would have been more in the interest of political parties if the issue had been put before the electorate. Some people say it would have been an expensive exercise. However, it would have been a worthwhile exercise in democracy. The House will ratify our membership of PfP but it would be stronger and more meaningful if it were ratified by the people. This is the first meaningful debate on what PfP is about even though the conclusions are predictable. It is not a back door into NATO, as has been said by Fianna Fáil spokespersons in the past, and it would have indicated a stronger commitment by the Government if it had been ratified by the people.</P>
    <P>However, that will not happen and it is a sad reflection on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, especially given their position on this issue. I am not surprised because it is another indication of the Taoiseach's capacity to have one position in Opposition and another in Government. It will be a further indictment of his reputation which reached its zenith approximately two years ago but is now on a slippery slope as a result of the evidence unfolding at the tribunals regarding the leadership allowance during the Haughey era and Fianna Fáil's absolute U-turn on PfP. This will be evidenced in next week's by-election in Dublin and in future debates as another all too clever gesture by the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil despite rumblings within the party. Last week, seven or eight people were going to the barriers but they seemed to have slipped off as quickly as they were climbing upon them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach cannot &ldquo;disremember&rdquo; what he said prior to the election in 1997. I am not sure how one does that. He did not go as far as using the great words of Charles J. Haughey that Fianna Fáil had a &ldquo;solemn commitment&rdquo; to opposition to PfP. The people will see it for what it is worth but it is regrettable because the Government could have won this issue on both counts. On the one hand, it has undermined the sense of ownership that the people had acquired in regard to foreign policy, particularly during this decade, and, on the other, it could have garnered the people's support. Whatever is said between individuals in various political parties, the people <Col N="1214" /> in their wisdom would support the political will of this House and efforts to join PfP.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has always been consistent on this issue and has made its position clear. It is an error on the part of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Fianna Fáil Party that they have not found a mechanism whereby the issue could be put before the people. They said they would put it before the people and they have reneged on that. All of us knew what the legal advice would be and to use that as a reason is akin to hiding behind a fig leaf given that a commitment was made before the general election. People interested in foreign policy who read the various party manifestos prior to the election would have voted for Fianna Fáil on the basis that if Ireland were to join PfP the people would decide. I am astounded that the Fianna Fáil leadership has become comfortable with PfP. The reality is that it was comfortable all the time but for political reasons it would not state that before the election. It had a similar difficulty during recent events.</P>
    <P>When I was in Government I tried to convince my colleagues of the necessity and desirability of Ireland playing its role in terms of foreign policy and we should have joined PfP before now. It was launched at the NATO Summit in Brussels in 1994. It set out to be a co-operative security initiative designed to intensify political and military co-operation in Europe, promote stability, reduce threats to peace and build strengthened relationships by promoting practical co-operation among the participants. I have difficulty understanding how anybody in his or her right mind could be opposed to Ireland joining PfP given its aims and design. It is related to NATO but for too long we tried to pretend that NATO did not exist. It was difficult to have a rational debate on the functions of NATO or whether Ireland was in favour it. It was almost taboo to discuss NATO's role. The reality is that NATO exists and we must live with it whether we are for or against it.</P>
    <P>The second most important aspect of this debate is how we want to situate Ireland's execution of foreign policy in relation to European security architecture. The only certainties in security arrangements in Europe are the changes which have taken place and which will continue to do so. If one looks at the evolution of Irish foreign policy and the background to Ireland becoming a neutral State, the particular circumstances in which that happened in 1939, one will see that many changes have taken place since then, particularly our participation in the European Union. Deputy Flanagan traced the evolution of foreign policy succinctly. I will go back only as far as our entry into the European Economic Community. It is well known that in the discussions which took place in the ten years prior to our membership, the question of European security architecture and Ireland participating with other European countries at some stage in <Col N="1215" /> common foreign and security policy, ultimately leading to a common defence, would have been discussed. No Irish leader, going back to the late Jack Lynch and the then Minister for External Affairs, Paddy Hillery, would have had any doubt that this issue would have to be grappled with at some stage.</P>
    <P>The situation has changed dramatically in the ten years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the ending of the Cold War and the certainties which it once provided. They were certainties which may have been founded on undemocratic states and values but they were the certainties of that time. When certainties go out the window, other certainties must be found to replace them to ensure security and stability on the European continent.</P>
    <P>The common foreign and security policy is a child of the 1990s. It is currently in a state of evolution and I wish to see it developing sooner rather than later. I welcome the appointment of Javier Solana, the former Secretary General of NATO, as the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and I hope he will be in a position to speak, act and develop policy on behalf of a European Union that can find common positions in foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Common foreign and security policy has been developed by the Maastrict and Amsterdam Treaties and, looking at the initiatives coming from President Prodi's office, it would appear that there will be another intergovernmental conference which will conclude in 2002 or 2003. Of course common foreign and security policy will form a major part of that debate, as important as the machinery for the efficient running of the European Union, particularly following enlargement.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are comfortable when acting within the ambit of the United Nations. If we look at the recent development of the United Nations, we will see that it is beginning to rely on regionalisation. The UN itself, as Deputy McDowell stated earlier, is in dire need of reform. It is important that we ensure that missions such as those in Bosnia under the auspices of IFOR are undertaken with the agreement of the United Nations. Reform of the UN would give it a more reflective composition, particularly at Security Council level, of the world in which we live, not the world as it was following World War Two, which is reflected in the balance on the Security Council. We must also look for co-operation within the OSCE and Western European Union, where we have observer status.</P>
    <P>The reality is NATO will be needed in crisis areas such as Bosnia, Kosovo and the Middle East. In this House we are facing up to our responsibilities on the international stage. We have a proud record, which is recognised in many fora throughout the world, of action on behalf of the United Nations. That will not be jeopardised by our joining Partnership for Peace because Partnership for Peace is an important initiative <Col N="1216" /> taken in 1994 to reflect the new situation which has prevailed since the end of the Cold War.</P>
    <P>We should join Partnership for Peace but I would be more comfortable if the Government had decided to seek a mandate from the people to do so. I say that in the full confidence the majority of Irish people would support our joining Partnership for Peace because it is a realistic reflection of the role we want to play on the international stage in foreign policy affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that we should be having this debate on the sad occasion of the passing of a former Taoiseach who established a great role for Ireland by becoming involved in the European scene and taking his responsibilities there seriously. Like other speakers I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to him and extend my personal sympathy to Mairín and the Lynch family.</P>
      <P>The debate tonight is taking place at an interesting time from the point of view of the evolution of Irish foreign policy and European policy. We have seen the map of Europe redrawn since the end of the Cold War, the changes which have taken place and the responsibilities which fall upon those within the new Union which is envisaged. The European Union progressed satisfactorily for 50 years in the midst of the Cold War. It did so successfully and survived that difficult era economically and politically. There were hiccups but it achieved something which had not been achieved in the previous 50 years &ndash; it established a degree of understanding and peaceful co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, Ireland has changed considerably. We must accept that certain responsibilities have been thrust upon us by those changes. We come from a background of a century and a half of emigration. In that period we did not have the same responsibilities because we were not in the economic or political position to exert any influence in Europe or the rest of the world. Our people travelled to all corners of the world and faced the challenges presented to them in a manner which did us proud. Now that we have come into our own as one of the most vibrant economies in the world, there is a duty placed on us whereby we are expected by our current and future European partners to take our responsibilities seriously and to make a commitment of our own to the future of Europe as it unfolds. If we do not do that, given the benefits we have achieved as a result of membership of the European Union, it will be a sad reflection on us on our commitment to the modern Europe. I mention the modern Europe because every decade sets its own framework within which it must operate. Without any shadow of doubt, this millennium and the forthcoming century thrust upon us greater responsibilities than ever before. As a small country we can be a great example to our neighbours. I emphasise, as Chairman of the European Affairs Committee, that the applicant countries in the EU look upon Ireland as an example to follow <Col N="1217" /> and expect us to give them support. They expect us to give leadership, to show by our involvement that we are committed to the new Europe, that we have no fears of a new Europe. If we have benefited from the new Europe we would be expected to have little fear and I do not see why we should be worried and fearsome of joining PfP.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that in the past, neutrality was a major issue here, and there are still many people who have serious concerns about it. Let us talk about those concerns, debate them rationally and come to a conclusion. There is only one side we can come down on, that is the side of continued involvement, co-operation and integration. One of the things we could be pardoned for in the past, when we did not have economic independence, was that we could opt out and say we were a poor country, that we could not be expected to contribute in the same way as our rich and powerful neighbours. On that basis there was a reason for our neutrality. We were lucky in many situations in the past. Lest anybody thinks otherwise, if circumstances had been somewhat different, in 1939 to 1945 we could have been in a very difficult position. There is no point in saying today we would have survived: we might have and we might not have. Other people outside were paying a very high price at that time. I am not suggesting we should have become immersed in that struggle; we had paid our own price years before. Notwithstanding all that, there is now a responsibility on us to set an example.   Our economy is developing rapidly. We are the success story of Europe. Those countries that are now looking forward to membership of the Europe Union expect the country that is most successful within that Union to set an example and a headline for them. The benefits we have achieved as a result of our EU membership can, in some way, be accounted for if we can commit ourselves to the responsibility of membership of PfP. To those who say this is militarism, that it is involvement in nuclear armament and all the other associated scare stories that go with it, all I can say is that the incoming states &ndash; those states that have applied for EU membership &ndash; have a deep concern for their own security. Almost as we speak there is a move towards some form of a defence association or involvement within the European Union to such an extent that many have already joined NATO. They have taken that step, simply because they are concerned about their security and the vulnerable geographic position they hold in the centre of Europe. It is quite easy for us to opt out. It is quite easy for us to remain aloof. In today's modern world one cannot remain aloof and accept the benefits without taking some responsibility and getting involved. This gives us an opportunity here to show we are committed to the new Europe and that we are capable of participating at all levels economically and, in some fashion, towards getting discussion going in relation to a common defence policy or something similar. There have been various arguments <Col N="1218" /> as to the extent to which we should go along those lines. There will be those who suggest, as in the past, that this is the first stage of the introduction of body bags and the pictures of the Vietnam war will be turned up again. That is fine if one wants to scare people away from that.</P>
    <P>We have a commitment to Europe: to the Belgians, the Dutch and the other applicant countries, such as the Czech Republic, Poland, etc. They are small countries, many of which are like us but much more vulnerable than us because they are at the front line. In the event of a situation arising, where they have to rely on the rest of Europe, they expect us to give a headline.</P>
    <P>The other option is to opt out. On what basis do we opt out? How do we opt out of membership of PfP which is a minimal involvement at this stage? How do we explain to our European partners that we are delighted to have been members of the European Union, that we are part of Europe, true Europeans, the embodiment of Europe while at the same time saying we are a little worried about defence and all that goes with it and wish to reserve our case there? That is not acceptable and it will not be acceptable in the modern Europe. I emphasise from the little experience I have had as a member of the committee and previously in the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities that many of the smaller countries throughout Europe have seen what has happened in European history in the past 100 years. They have seen Europe's faults and failings and where it went wrong. It is easy to examine our history afterwards and identify what went wrong. It is a different story to chart the course for the future and that is what we have to do. If we do not chart that course properly, identify where we are going and make a commitment as a small country others, more influential than us, will say, obviously, they do not want it, they are a small country, they have benefited greatly from European membership, why should anybody else get involved and why should anybody else make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>EU membership is more beneficial to the smaller countries than to anybody else. That goes without saying because, if we look again at our history, we have at least three, and potentially four, main powers who at varying times were dominant forces in Europe. It would be to their advantage to keep that position indefinitely. It is not to the advantage of the greater newer Europe to allow that to continue so sacrifices are being made by them. They have had to devolve a certain amount of powers and sovereignty to their lesser neighbours. In general, the European Union has benefited greatly from that. I have often said, as have many others here &ndash; this is something that should never be forgotten &ndash; that what we have benefited most from in Europe is not necessarily the direct payments but the markets it has opened up to us. Without opening the markets and removing the barriers the three or four main powers in Europe would reign supreme <Col N="1219" /> and the rest of us would have to take what was left.</P>
    <P>The present situation is of great importance to us. We have an opportunity to make a commitment that goes a little further than we have gone in the past for the very good reason that we are a good example in the modern Europe. We are a shining example to all others throughout Europe and we should be seen to play a leading role in the development of the Europe of the future. Other issues will arise in the future. Deputy Spring mentioned Bosnia. We have seen Kosovo on our televisions and have agonised as to what should be done. Everybody said something should be done, everybody said somebody should do something. Generally speaking we allow that to be done by somebody else. That is no longer sufficient or acceptable. It is imperative that we nail our colours to the mast, and the Irish people want to do that because we have developed a pride from our economic sovereignty that we did not have previously. Arising from that it is expected that we make a commitment above and beyond that which we previously made, and PfP is the minimal commitment that should be expected of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. Joining Partnership for Peace reflects the State's central role in contributing to peace in the world. Ireland has a proud tradition of peacekeeping since the first Irish troops went to the then Belgian Congo in the 1950s. We must continue to develop this proud tradition by joining the principal form in Europe through which peacekeeping missions are being increasingly organised. We must not remain on the sidelines. We must be central to ensuring that there is full co-operation within the European Union for peace in our time. We are in a position to make a distinctive contribution to the maintenance of peace and security in the world by bringing our unique values and principles to the forum and to argue for them in that forum.</P>
      <P>This debate was initiated four years ago with the public consultation process when the White Paper on Foreign Policy was published by the previous coalition Government. The paper clearly outlined that Partnership for Peace objectives are similar to Ireland's historical approach to international peace and European security. Fine Gael has always been clear in its support for Irish membership of Partnership for Peace. We believe that Partnership for Peace is a flexible programme of military and security co-operation between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the non-NATO states. There are no commitments from participants other than voluntary co-operation in Partnership for Peace programmes. There are no defence commitments nor commitments to membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> Partnership for Peace is purely a voluntary agreement. Switzerland, a country which will not even join the United Nations, is prepared to join Partnership for Peace without holding a referendum. In Switzerland, there are between three and six referenda in any year on various issues but on this issue Switzerland does not believe that it should have a referendum to consult its people.</P>
    <P>The Presentation Document outlines clearly the areas in which Ireland proposes to work in Partnership for Peace &ndash; co-operation in peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, search and rescue operations, co-operation in the protection of the environment and co-operation in marine matters. It states clearly that Ireland's decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is in full accordance with its policy of military neutrality which has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security based on international law.</P>
    <P>The arguments that membership of this body is a back door to joining NATO does not stand. The Irish position on this was clearly stated in June 1922 in that Irish membership of Partnership for Peace would not affect Irish neutrality as Partnership for Peace involves no mutual defence obligations. It is clearly stated, with all-party support, that Irish neutrality will be ended only if the Irish people so decide in a referendum.</P>
    <P>I often question our pride in our neutrality. I do not believe Ireland was neutral between the allies and the Nazi regime during the Second World War. No country can say it does not have an opinion on whether a butcher like Hitler should not be opposed or that all efforts should be made to ensure this evil is removed from the face of the earth. A week after the publication of the biography of James Dillon by Senator Maurice Manning, we should remember the very difficult decision he had to make in the 1940s, for which he had to give up membership of my party. He stood alone and said that this nation should not be neutral while Hitler was butchering people throughout Germany.</P>
    <P>The view has been expressed that membership of Partnership for Peace would be detrimental to our peacekeeping reputation and would affect our ability to contribute to future peacekeeping activities. This ignores the fact that the number of peacekeeping troops under the command of the United Nations has fallen dramatically from 800,000 to approximately 14,000. The future of peacekeeping lies in regional organisations taking the lead and as long as Ireland remains outside Partnership for Peace, we will not have a critical role and will be less able to continue our proud tradition of peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that rather than Partnership for Peace damaging our peacekeeping role, it will strengthen it and enhance its contribution for the future. It will enable us to work with OSCE partners in programmes of co-operation which are aimed at reducing tension and promoting the security of the European Union. It will develop the skills and morale of the Defence Forces and <Col N="1221" /> enable them to fully participate in UN or OSCE peacekeeping operations. It will facilitate them in training and exercising with the states with which we will share peacekeeping duties in the future and those with which we shared peacekeeping duties over the past 40 years. That will enable us carry on the proud tradition we have built up in peacekeeping throughout the world over that period.</P>
    <P>We will make a positive contribution through our vast experience in international peacekeeping organisations. Membership will improve Ireland's capacity to carry out search and rescue operations off our coast and will also involve the Defence Forces in humanitarian responses to national and other disasters. It will enhance co-operation to deal with drug trafficking, an issue which has caused extreme concern throughout Europe &ndash; it is accepted that 10 per cent of drug trafficking activity in Europe never comes to the notice of European police forces.</P>
    <P>Over the past quarter of a century, Ireland has built up a reputation as being a positive member of the European Union. The Irish people have always responded enthusiastically to the development of the European Union. In response to that, the European Union has contributed positively to the development of our State, from coping with crises of poverty to examining the difficulties experienced as a result of our growing wealth.</P>
    <P>The European Union played a key role over the past quarter of a century in assisting the development of this position. Partnership for Peace has nothing to do with choosing between one side or another and compromising neutrality. It is about siding with other European partners in a contribution to peace on our continent supervised by ourselves. I am pleased we are now sending a signal to our partners in Europe that we are willing to work together in Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>This debate launches Ireland into a position where it will play a better role in pursuing the protection of human rights internationally. Earlier this month we saw Irish troops going to East Timor with the full support and encouragement of the Irish people. Several months ago, Irish troops were sent to Kosovo and their roles in both East Timor and Kosovo will be more effective than their previous roles in peacekeeping operations. We have a proud tradition of this and we currently have more than 800 personnel involved in the area. It has given us a very positive image in the international community. We have played a proud role in promoting global peace and security over almost 50 years.</P>
    <P>As we enter a new political time, we must rethink our strategies and modernise our approach. Ireland is a very different place from what it was in the 1950s, when this State decided to assist the UN in its peacekeeping role in the Congo. The UN is no longer able to react to crises on its own. It is widely recognised that regional organisations have a key role to play in preventing and containing conflict. We must not shrink from our continued responsibility towards <Col N="1222" /> the international community. The experience gained from our involvement in the UN must be put into organisations such as the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>We require initiatives in peacekeeping, and must now focus on humanitarian issues and post-conflict rehabilitation. There is increased emphasis on conflict prevention and the development of early warning systems. This will involve more work with non-governmental organisations and will require specific training in such areas for our Defence Forces. We must work in a more creative and meaningful way with the non-Government organisations. This will require new approaches from the Army, which will need improvements in communication and other skills to develop the relationships which will now be required with the non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister outlined the basis for Ireland's individual partnership programme. It covers the area of peacekeeping, which will be the central focus of our participation. The Minister said that we were prepared to participate and contribute, through co-operation in the Partnership for Peace framework, in such areas as interoperability; planning for peacekeeping and peace support; communications, command and control; operational procedures; logistics and training. With regard to humanitarian operations, the Minister said that we are interested in the development of co-operation and the exchange of experience and expertise in that area, and that we have many insights and skills to share. With regard to available assets, the Minister stated that an infantry battalion group could be available for Partnership for Peace activities, subject to a national decision.</P>
    <P>The commitment will radically alter our approach to peacekeeping, training and preparation. It will be no longer acceptable to form a peacekeeping force from various and differing Army units for use at relatively short notice, as has been the case over the past 40 years. To ensure that we can participate in a meaningful way with other member states, it may be necessary for the Minister for Defence to examine the feasibility of establishing something along the lines of a peace corps. It will have to be an established unit, consisting of members with a total commitment. For this to arise, the Minister must have adequate and suitable recruitment policies.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, Partnership for Peace has evolved into a key European security institution. It now comprises 43 participants, including the 19 NATO member states. Its primary purposes are the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the preservation of democracy; the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the UN obligations and the obligations of the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe. I welcome the opportunity to support it tonight.</P>

      <P>Before I commence my contribution on the motion, I wish to join in the expressions of sympathy on the death of the late Jack Lynch.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the debate regarding Partnership for Peace over recent days and weeks, and I have listened to both sides of the argument. I will not support the Government's decision to join Partnership for Peace at this stage. I will give my reasons for not doing so.</P>
      <P>I am concerned by the way in which we are entering Partnership for Peace. I am concerned that we are rushing into an alliance without consulting the people through a referendum. While I realise it is not legally necessary to hold a referendum, the Government should deliver on this election promise, given that it so strongly opposed joining Partnership for Peace at one stage.</P>
      <P>There have been many well documented reasons to join Partnership for Peace. We are told that Partnership for Peace has no implications for our sovereignty and is not in conflict with our neutrality. I am very glad and reassured that this is the case.</P>
      <P>Peacekeeping and humanitarian missions have been mentioned quite often in the discussions in recent weeks, in the promotion of Partnership for Peace. Ireland has played a key role in peacekeeping efforts over the past 40 years under the auspices of the UN, and in accordance with UN mandates. Ireland should continue that policy and only participate in peacekeeping missions as part of UN mandates. I hope that at no time in the future will Ireland be required to act outside a UN mandate due to the commitments of Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>More than 140 countries are members of the UN but not of Partnership for Peace. Their role as peacekeepers will not be diminished because they are only in the UN and not in Partnership for Peace. I am sure that, were Ireland to decide to hold off joining Partnership for Peace for the moment, its role as a peacekeeper would not be diminished either.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Fianna Fáil election manifesto stated:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to nuclear disarmament. We will oppose any moves to edge Ireland closer to membership of an alliance still committed to the deployment and use of nuclear weapons</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace, whatever way one dresses it up, is associated with, and co-operates with, NATO. It was launched at a NATO summit in 1994. NATO's defence policy is based on nuclear weapons and a first use of nuclear weapons policy. It seems to me to be an organisation we should be edging away from, rather than towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been suggested by previous speakers in this House, if it is the intention of NATO to take on more and more of the UN's role in international security and to become involved in military operations outside of NATO's area, with the assistance of Partnership for Peace, where does <Col N="1224" /> that leave Ireland? As a member of Partnership for Peace, we will be associated with its decisions, regardless of whether we agree with them or whether we avail of the opt-out clause.</P>
    <P>There are negative perceptions about Partnership for Peace, for many of which Fianna Fáil is responsible.</P>

      <P>With the Minister for Foreign Affairs describing Partnership for Peace as &ldquo;a back door to NATO&rdquo; and as a &ldquo;door opening process to NATO&rdquo;, and the Taoiseach saying that to join Partnership for Peace &ldquo;would send the wrong signals about our future intentions&rdquo;, it is no wonder that people are fearful about what we are signing up to.</P>
      <P>It seems the position has changed. It has suddenly become safe in the past year, according to the Government, to go ahead and join up with Partnership for Peace. Obviously, its fears have been dramatically allayed. However, unfortunately, not everybody's fears have been allayed in that manner.</P>
      <P>On 5 June 1997, the day before the last general election, <i>The Irish Times</i> published a summary of where the parties stood on various issues. Fianna Fáil clearly stated that it was &ldquo;against involvement in Partnership for Peace&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil does not have a mandate from the people to join Partnership for Peace. Its mandate is to do the opposite &ndash; to oppose joining Partnership for Peace. I am not willing to endorse this U-turn.</P>
      <P>There appears to be widespread support in this house for joining Partnership for Peace and it is inevitable, at this stage, that the motion will be passed. I hope that the fears of the people who have been denied a say in this whole debate are groundless.</P>
      <P>I would be willing to discuss joining Partnership for Peace at a later date, but only after receiving a mandate from the people, either through a referendum or plebiscite, or by waiting until after the next general election. I do not think that is too much to ask, and it is the least Fianna Fáil owes the people after the very strong commitments it gave and the misleading perceptions that were created before the last general election.</P>

      <P>When I came to Leinster House this morning and saw the Tricolour flying at half mast, I instinctively knew that the reason was that my fellow Corkonian, Jack Lynch, had, unfortunately, died after a long illness. This is the first opportunity I have had to pay a consummate tribute to a great Corkman. It is appropriate for me as a west Corkman to pay that tribute because, although Jack Lynch was especially associated with the north side of Cork city, his home for many years was in west Cork near my home town of Skibbereen. It is for that reason we had a great deal of contact with him. I had a great deal of contact with him even before I went into <Col N="1225" /> politics. He continued to be patron of Skibbereen golf club until his death. Some months ago I played in the Jack Lynch classic there. We had a strong personal connection with him. He was one of the most decent men I ever knew. He was courteous and civil but tough behind it all. Above all, he was as straight as a die. If he were to be compared to any metal, it would be stainless steel. He was someone I was proud to know and I offer on my behalf and on behalf of Cork generally, this House and the national Parliament my condolences to Máirín Lynch on the passing of her husband who was for us a great Corkman and Irishman.</P>
      <P>I am glad so many Deputies have contributed to the debate. There is not enough debate on foreign affairs issues in the House. I say that without casting aspersions on the way Governments generally operate foreign affairs and on civil servants in Iveagh House. I spent five years there as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and had the opportunity to learn of the professionalism of the mandarins there. However, the elected representatives of the people should be involved in foreign affairs decisions. For that reason, I am glad so many have contributed to the debate. I would be tempted to look at Article 29 of the Constitution to see whether there should be a greater requirement for votes of the Oireachtas on foreign affairs issues.</P>
      <P>What is this debate about? If one were to listen to it without examining the documentation, one would think it was about joining NATO as far as its opponents are concerned. The first thing to be said about this debate is that it is not about joining NATO &ndash; that will have to be hit firmly on the head &ndash; it is about joining Partnership for Peace. I agree with Deputy Fox that there are negative perceptions about that and I lay the blame at the door of Fianna Fáil. The role of that party in Opposition on Partnership for Peace was less than honourable. It has been in existence since 1994 and there has been ample opportunity for reasoned debate. The stance taken by Fianna Fáil in Opposition on Partnership for Peace was dishonest. I agree with Deputy Fox that the election manifesto pledge about a referendum was also dishonest. It is not the way Members should contribute to policy.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace is a voluntary, non-binding, co-operative security framework between NATO and those who are not members of NATO. It is significant that, apart from the 19 members of NATO, there will be, when we join, which I hope we will do shortly, 25 countries in the partnership which are not members of NATO. Tajikistan, Cyprus, some of the former republics of Yugoslavia, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and the Vatican State are members of the European club out of which opponents of joining Partnership for Peace wish us to stay. It is ridiculous that a self-respecting country such as ours should give consideration to remaining outside that club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> Looking at the areas of involvement included in our presentation document, how can anyone seriously object to peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, search and rescue operations and co-operation in the protection of the environment and marine matters? These issues have been set forward in the Presentation Document and who can honestly, genuinely and sincerely say that we should not be involved in them? I am glad the Government has accepted the Fine Gael amendment to the motion that if there are to be additions to the list of areas in which we will be involved, the Government must have them debated by the Oireachtas. I approve of that.</P>
    <P>Ireland has an honourable role in peacekeeping but we will become marginalised if we do not join Partnership for Peace because the peacekeeping operations in which we are involved, although mandated by and under the control of the United Nations, are increasingly implemented through regional organisations. For example, in East Timor, Australia heads the group implementing the UN mandate there. The same is the case with NATO in Bosnia and Sierra Leone in west Africa. That is the way the world has changed and we ought to be prepared to go along with those changes.</P>
    <P>Neutrality is one of those sacred cows which we ought to debate. More is read into our sacred neutrality than exists. If one were to examine it, we are not a neutral country. We do not and have not conformed to the classic definition of neutrality. Neutrality is a voluntary policy assumed temporarily in regard to a state of war and terminable at any time. A state which has declared its neutrality must abstain from any part in the conflict, must provide no assistance and must prevent the enlistment of troops within its territory. Those are the principles given effect in the Hague Convention of 1907 to which we are not a party.</P>
    <P>During the Second World War de Valera declared the country neutral. I am glad he did so and I support that move, but we did not conform to the classic principle of neutrality during the Second World War. When the US joined the war, de Valera welcomed the fact but stated that the policy of the State would remain unchanged and that we could only be a friendly neutral. One can see the contradiction in terms there. I am glad we were a friendly neutral, but we got by in the war not because we had declared neutrality &ndash; it was not much good to others which had done so, such as Norway, Belgium, Holland and Denmark &ndash; but because we had a strategic remoteness and because the UK won the Battle of Britain. That was what saved us during the Second World War.</P>
    <P>The world has changed since. We did not join NATO after the war and I am glad we did not. While we were happy to hide under its umbrella during the Cold War, I am glad we were not involved. However, matters have changed so we must ask what we should do now. We adopt a pragmatic approach to what we do. There is not a case for joining NATO at this stage, but there <Col N="1227" /> is every case for joining Partnership for Peace. Switzerland is the most neutral country in the world and it did not have a problem with joining Partnership for Peace. Why should we then have a problem?</P>
    <P>The other red herring has been the referendum. I have spoken of Fianna Fáil muddying the waters with its famous promise that it would hold a referendum. It was a base, dishonest and dishonourable promise which it is now throwing out. It should never have been given. There should not be a referendum. Why should we hold a referendum to join Partnership for Peace? Democrats can be divided into two schools, the direct democracy school which follows the principles of Rousseau and the representational school which follows those of John Stuart Mill. We are in the latter group. Which of the democracies in the world might implement the direct democracy ideal? The answer is Switzerland. Approximately 800 referenda have been held in the world's democracies and half of those were held in Switzerland. Yet, where was the democracy in regard to PfP? Switzerland will hold a referendum in regard to altering a by-road or by-passing a town but it did not consider it necessary to hold a referendum on joining PfP. Why should we feel it is necessary to do so? It is completely unnecessary and those who say we are rushing into PfP are not correct &ndash; it has been around since 1994. Those who say they were misled and that an incorrect impression was given are correct. Fianna Fáil gave a misleading impression but, thankfully, it has overcome its populist urges and reality has dawned. It is now prepared to go along with the future, namely, that we must join PfP.</P>
    <P>The future is a serious matter. What do we do now in regard to the future of Europe and the question of a common defence policy? I appeal for an open and honest debate on those issues as opposed to the kind of debate we had on PfP. Let us not jump to conclusions &ndash; the Dehaene report has not even been published, yet the Taoiseach, following the summit in Finland, stated earlier this week that he would not agree to EU mutual defence guarantees under any circumstances. He has already committed us to that position without having read the report. We should neither commit ourselves to that position nor to its converse, rather we should hold a reasoned debate on the matter. In regard to the intergovernmental conference, we should consider whether there is an opt-out clause for Ireland and other neutrals. Let us have a sensible and reasoned debate on the Dehaene proposals rather than jumping to conclusions before people have read the report.</P>
    <P>Ireland should join the Partnership for Peace now and pursue the role set out in the Presentation Document. More importantly, we must contribute to the future of Europe's security and defence. The manner in which we do that must be fully and properly debated and I urge the Government to ensure that a reasoned and <Col N="1228" /> rational debate occurs before we make a final decision about our future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy Fox will be using her vote in joining with at least some members of the Opposition and I hope she will join with us again in future cases in which the vote might not be so easily won.</P>
      <P>This debate has shown that a great number of issues in regard to PfP need to be teased out and the people of Ireland should have a say in that, particularly in light of the promise made by the Taoiseach when he said that any attempt to join PfP in the absence of a referendum would be a serious breach of faith and would be fundamentally undemocratic. Deputy O'Keeffe stated that it is important that we debate these issues seriously and widely. Surely, the most effective and widespread debate on this issue could take place via a referendum which would allow all the people of Ireland, not just those privileged to be elected to this House or those asked to write articles for <i>The Irish Times</i>, to express their views. The arguments advanced in favour of widespread debate strongly support holding a referendum on this issue.</P>
      <P>The 1997 Fianna Fáil election manifesto states:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to nuclear disarmament. We oppose any move to edge Ireland closer to membership of an alliance still committed to the deployment and use of nuclear weapons. We oppose Irish participation in NATO itself, in NATO-led organisations, such as the Partnership for Peace, or in the Western European Union observer status. Fianna Fáil, in Government, will not participate in any co-operative security structure which has implications for Irish neutrality without first consulting the people through a referendum. Fianna Fáil will strive to achieve a fresh vision of the European Union as a political and economic community rather than a military superpower or federal super-state.</P>
      <P>A number of very serious issues have not been properly addressed or debated in regard to this issue, one of which relates to cost which I will refer to later. I accept that joining PfP is not the same as joining NATO, but will NATO be strengthened as a result? I believe NATO's role will be strengthened. Do we want to strengthen the role of NATO or that of the UN? That question has not been accorded the serious consideration it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has played a fine part in UN peacekeeping roles. Some speakers tonight have stated that we will be opting out if we do not join PfP. However, I suggest that Ireland has opted into rather than out of peacekeeping and has done so very honourably under the banner of the United Nations. I commend the members of the Army for the work they have done in that regard. I visited Lebanon recently with other Members of this Parliament. I did not know much about the Army's operations there but was very impressed <Col N="1229" /> by the work it is doing, of which the local people are very appreciative. Members of the Army are putting their lives at risk in Lebanon &ndash; we had to go into the bunkers while I was there and I am aware of the serious risks they face. Our soldiers have done a tremendous job in international peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>It was suggested at the recent PDFORRA conference that a sum of £200 million would be required over the course of the next four years in order to strengthen and modernise the Army. I do not know whether that is the case but the issue should be debated. Edward Horgan, an ex-Army officer, estimates that the figure would increase to £5 billion if we join PfP. I do not know how true that is but, again, the issue of cost must be debated, particularly in the context of the earlier debate in the House tonight in which we heard that we cannot afford to pay nurses or build up our health service. Cost issues must be seriously considered. I am not saying the Army should not be properly equipped. I was in an APC supplied by the UN because the Irish Army has had to use UN equipment to carry out its peacekeeping role. I accept there is a need for the Army to be properly equipped but do we need to be equipped in terms of interoperability with NATO? I do not know what that implies but it raises certain issues.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from CND today which raises serious issues to which I do not have the answers. However, I consider CND to be a reputable organisation which has carried out good work and is highly esteemed in this country. We should at least address the questions it raises seriously. CND states:</P>
    <P>Depleted uranium missiles and armory were used extensively in bombing civilian and military targets in Yugoslavia. Four years ago, the Pentagon admitted that henceforth all tanks and fighting vehicles will possibly contain DU contamination. The interoperability of NATO military forces could enable armed forces throughout Europe to obtain and use depleted uranium weapons.</P>
    <P>It goes on to explain the term &ldquo;depleted uranium&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It is a cheap waste product of the nuclear industry now used in the manufacture of military vehicles, shells and missiles. It makes weapons very hard and penetrative and more efficient in terms of killing power. When DU shells explode, particles released into the air, soil and water can cause lung cancer if ingested or inhaled.</P>
    <P>Uranium can pass through the placenta, frequently causing congenital malformations and is transmitted to infants via mother's milk. It can damage ova and sperm causing genetic defects in off-spring and cause irreparable damage to the kidney and liver.</P>
    <P>I have not had an opportunity to research this data to find out whether there is any truth in it but if we had a referendum, at least we would <Col N="1230" /> have the opportunity for such questions, which are raised by reputable organisations, to be answered.</P>
    <P>Who are we defending ourselves against if we work with NATO? I do not know of any large groupings against whom we need to defend ourselves. I have not heard a good argument that we should co-operate with NATO as an alternative to working within the UN. I know the UN needs reform; everyone would admit that. Surely, our emphasis should instead be on how that reform might take place, how the UN might be more effective, how the UN might be more inclusive in terms of its ability to take action and how the UN might be paid the money owed to it, and the US is one of the countries which needs to answer that question. There is also the question of armaments and the considerable dependence of countries involved in NATO on the armaments industry. Those questions have not been answered.</P>
    <P>In the context of the UN, I will take up the point raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. He spoke about East Timor and the fact that the team that has gone there is under the direction of people from that part of the world, but it has a UN mandate. NATO, however, has shown itself capable of taking action without waiting for a UN mandate. It is a completely different situation.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of countries left outside NATO and Partnership for Peace. What is their strength on the world stage? What is the strength of Third World and African countries? We have a long-standing tradition of standing by the weaker countries. Will that be diminished, in some way, by our joining Partnership for Peace? That is a valid question and is one which has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>There are many questions which have not been addressed in this rush to join Partnership for Peace without consulting the people and they need to be addressed before we make such a move. I know the aspects we are going in on are fairly innocuous but, at the same time, it is an indication that we would like to and will work with NATO, albeit on our own terms. It is changing the balance in terms of how we secure the world. Instead of doing it through an organisation such as the United Nations, which is representative of the world at large, we are moving towards doing it through an organisation which is led by countries which have specific foreign policies and specific interests in armaments. We should not go down this road. If I was to vote tomorrow, I would not vote in favour of joining Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Many people have not had an opportunity, as we have had, to express their views and to raise the type of question we have had the opportunity to raise. We owe it to those people to consult them and allow them to express their views. We owe it to the people because a promise was made in the election manifesto of the largest party in Government. How can people believe promises which any party makes in their election manifesto <Col N="1231" /> if U-turns such as this are made when large parties like Fianna Fáil get into Government? This contributes to the distrust of politics and of political promises which is widespread at present. As working politicians, we should strive to change that view rather than add to it by going against promises made in election manifestos. This is a serious issue because it is fundamental to what we do as politicians. We indicate to the people before an election what we intend to do if we get into Government and we then follow it through, otherwise there is no point making promises before an election. We may as well tell the people to take their chances and that whoever gets into Government will do what they wish. The democratic process is undermined by that.  Even if the majority of those in the Government parties believe we should join PfP, there is an obligation on the largest party in Government to fulfil the promise it made before the last election. That is the substance of the amendment our party has tabled to this motion. I would go further &ndash; as I said, I am not in favour of joining Partnership for Peace. This House should stand by the promises made before an election and insist on a referendum or, at least, a consultation of the people because we have been told a referendum is not what is necessary. There should be a consultation process or a plebiscite with the people who elected us not only to represent them, but to keep the promises we make before we come to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Coveney. Ireland with its long tradition of peacekeeping deserves to be to the forefront of all world initiatives designed to enhance peace and harmony. This country has played a significant role in UN operations since 1955. Our forces have been there when it mattered, making the difference and giving the helping hand to peace.</P>
      <P>With the ending of the Cold War, the level and type of conflict has altered. Until that time, the two super powers effectively controlled regional conflict, but no so today. With the collapse of the eastern bloc power circle, many of the former Warsaw Pact members looked for alternatives to help to ensure their own security. In response to this development, coupled with the increasing local regional conflicts with which the UN was unable to adequately deal, the 16 member NATO group launched Partnership for Peace in 1994. Some 43 countries now participate in the partnership, some of which are neutral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great attraction of Partnership for Peace is that each state decides the level of its own involvement &ndash; it has an ethic of flexibility. The primary purpose of Partnership for Peace is the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy and the upholding of international law. All are matters to which every Irish man and woman worth their salt would readily subscribe. We, as a nation, see ourselves <Col N="1232" /> as peacemakers and peacekeepers. Article 29.1 of our Constitutions states that the nation is devoted to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace brings together people from every corner of Europe in co-operation and in a spirit of goodwill, each giving to the extent of their own capacity, learning from each other, developing and perfecting their skills, be it humanitarian, search and rescue, peacemaking, peacekeeping or enforcement, learning to work together so that they might unite in times of crisis. Such crisis may not be of a military nature but may, be environmental or humanitarian. This partnership affords our country a real opportunity to develop our skills through participation in the best of modern training with access to up to date equipment supported by professional personnel who have field experience.</P>
    <P>Our nation wants to play an international role; our people want to be part of the larger community. They do not want to be left to the side &ndash; a group which does not have the capacity or the courage to be there as equals with other nations. Ours is a proud history enhanced by the contribution which we have made since independence be it within the League of Nations and the United Nations. We have been there with the best of them and we must be prepared to state our position with other nations, ready to listen and take our place because if we do not, we will be seen as being not prepared to accept our common share of responsibility. If we do not participate in Partnership for Peace, our standing will diminish and our place on the world stage will be reduced. Ireland has everything to gain and nothing to lose by entering PfP and choosing from its attractive new range of options.</P>
    <P>I am a keen student of history and enjoy television documentaries, particularly those about the First and Second World Wars. The devastation those wars caused was horrific, particularly the Pacific and European campaigns and a horrific number of people lost their lives in these wars. There are now wars in Kosovo and East Timor and again we see devastation. If nations come together under this umbrella organisation, they can do much to stop this from ever happening again. I support Ireland's entry into Partnership for Peace and believe we should go forward from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on whether Ireland should join Partnership for Peace is a very important one. Ireland's future role in international peacekeeping will be directly affected by our decision on Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over the last half century or so, Ireland has more than played her role in international peacekeeping. We are very proud of Irish work through the United Nations. Our troops abroad have served this country with distinction in various conflicts under the blue UN flag. Tragically, some members of our Defence Forces have made the ultimate sacrifice in their work abroad. It is fair to say that our personnel <Col N="1233" /> serving abroad have often not had the recognition and thanks at home that they deserve for their bravery and work in hostile parts of the world as peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to international peace keeping is highlighted by the fact that at present we have approximately 775 military personnel deployed on peace keeping missions in 35 different countries. Ireland has also played her part in the success and growth of the European Union by joining 25 years ago and the EU has been a major stabilising factor in the development of modern Europe. Other speakers have stated that the development of a successful and internationally respected modern Ireland as an independent sovereign state has been helped by the fact that we have been willing to join and work with specific organisations, most notably, the United Nations, the European Union but also organisations such as the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe. We have chosen to join organisations in which we can play a constructive part for the good of Ireland and for the wider good. We have resisted joining certain bodies, however, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, if we felt that Ireland did not have a role to play in them. The decision not to become part of the NATO bloc is one that most Irish support, as do I. We have taken the view that neutrality was our best way forward.</P>
    <P>This is not a debate on neutrality, although some insist on trying to turn it into just that. It is a debate on how best Ireland can take on her responsibilities in the future in a peacekeeping capacity. A separate debate on neutrality is needed for another day, but because there are people who may feel our neutrality is threatened by membership of PfP the issue of neutrality cannot be ignored completely in this debate.</P>
    <P>There is a big difference between a neutrality policy and isolationism. Whether people like it or not we cannot isolate ourselves from the conflict and terrible injustices around the world that are before us on TV screens. We have not been isolated in the past, given our work for the UN and the EU, and the best way to ensure we are not isolated in future is to join Partnership for Peace. A true neutral state is a country that has the ability to choose, in consultation with other states, when we should play our part in international affairs, on a diplomatic and sometimes military level for the sake of peacekeeping. The vehicle through which we can best play this positive neutral role is what we are debating here this evening.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the Cold War there has been a huge shift in how peace is kept in the world. In the not too distant past, peace was kept by way of the threat of nuclear war between East and West, but this is not what keeps peace today. Partnership for Peace, whether we are part of it or not, will play an increasingly significant role in world peace keeping in the future. PfP is a programme of military and security co-operation between NATO and non-NATO countries. If we <Col N="1234" /> take part we will definitely be entering as a non-NATO member. Some people say that this is a back door or stepping stone to joining NATO, but it is nothing of the sort. There are 43 nations involved in PfP, but only 16 are NATO member states. The other members include EU neutral states such as Austria, Finland and Sweden, as well as Switzerland, which is totally neutral. Even Russia and all but one of the former Soviet Union states have joined PfP.</P>
    <P>It is true that the richest and most powerful military nations within PfP are NATO members, but that in itself is not a reason for Ireland not to work within the group to contribute towards the specific goal of international peacekeeping. To accommodate all nations involved, PfP is an exceptionally broad-based structure, with an ethic of flexibility which allows it to encompass a broad range of different participants. The key to this principle of flexibility is voluntary commitment. Each state decides for itself the level and type of participation when signing the framework document. Ireland can therefore be realistic about the level of our participation and will not have to overstretch our resources.</P>
    <P>Unless one is paranoid about NATO's motives for involvement in PfP, nothing but good can come out of participation. The idea is to try and build relationships and promote co-operation between countries with different political structures but with a common goal of wanting to play a part in international stability and peace. The primary purposes of Partnership for Peace, as set out in the PfP framework document, are: the protection and promotion of human rights; the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the preservation of democracy; the upholding of international law; and most important, the fulfillment of the UN Charter obligations and OSCE commitments.</P>
    <P>These principles and aims are what we are signing up to if we join PfP and they need to be enforced in the modern world. We do not need to look too far into the past to find examples of gross breaches of human rights law and international law even within Europe. Perhaps the most beneficial aspect to PfP membership for Ireland is that there will be a constant interchange and updating of peacekeeping skills between member states. This means that when Irish troops are required to participate in peacekeeping roles they will have trained with the other countries involved and will have ensured that all of our equipment is compatible so as to maximise the impact of any military peacekeeping operation. Staying out of PfP may lead to a less than perfect working relationship with other PfP States.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace will assist in equipping our Defence Forces to continue, in an effective way, our strong tradition as a nation that wants to be involved in peacekeeping. This, more than anything else, is the reason our military are so in favour of PfP membership.</P>
    <P>It is important for those sceptics who are not <Col N="1235" /> in favour of PfP membership to remember that we can pull out of PfP at any stage should we feel that neutrality is threatened or that our original objectives are not being met. We must take a positive view toward Partnership for Peace. The overall objectives of PfP are consistent with our approach to international peace and European security. This is a vehicle through which we can enhance the capacity and readiness of our Defence Forces to participate in UN or OSCE peacekeeping operations, through training and exercises with countries which share a common goal of peacekeeping. This in itself must promote stability, particularly in Europe, where it is needed.</P>
    <P>PfP will work and is working for other nations. It can assist Ireland is preparing for a future role as a neutral, sovereign state anxious to continue to play a part in world peacekeeping. Unlike other parties, Fine Gael has been consistent and unified on PfP from the start. We have not taken a populist view and we support membership of PfP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with colleagues in paying tribute to the late Jack Lynch, former Taoiseach and Member of this House. As a young man in Cork, I looked up to and admired Jack Lynch, even though he was from a different tradition. He strode like a colossus across the stage in Cork and I wish to express my sympathy to his wife and family. May he rest in peace.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long and proud tradition and history of peacekeeping around the world, from the Congo in the 1960s to Cyprus, Lebanon, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Western Sahara and, most recently, Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor. Irish troops have never been found wanting in our role as peacekeepers under the UN mandate or under the OSCE.</P>
      <P>We joined the EEC in 1972 and we pride ourselves on being good Europeans. However, before that date, from independence, and before and during the Second World War, we adopted a neutral or non-aligned position. More than that again, it could be said that we were isolationist &ndash; we looked inward. Everything out there was bad and some of our best writers were censored. We all know that social, medical, educational, agricultural and industrial progress was stifled at that time. It could be said that we lived through our own dark ages. We were a closed society with simple needs. We exported our young people. Dollars from America and pounds from Britain kept the home fires burning and many Members know of the package from America, the clothes and food which kept people going at home.</P>
      <P>Times have changed and today we have taken our place among the nations of the world. We are the fastest growing economy in Europe. We have net immigration and a young, educated, articulate and confident workforce. Ireland no longer looks inward but outward. We are dependent on other nations and there is a growing interdependence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> As we move into the next millennium we have much to be proud of as a nation. This progress is not without problems and we know of the skills shortages, the housing problem with which the Government is grappling unsuccessfully, the terrible health issues, epitomised by the nurses strike, the traffic problems and so on. However, these are challenges on which we must work together to try to overcome so that our people can prosper in peace and security.</P>
    <P>Much has changed in Europe in the past few decades, particularly due to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. The Cold War created a certain balance known as the balance of power. However, it was also a stranglehold &ndash; two power blocs, both with a capacity for mass destruction. We know what happened to the Soviet power bloc which could not be sustained. It was dependent on fear and tyranny, and history has shown that such evil empires eventually crumble and fall apart. The vacuum left in the East was and still is very dangerous. As new nations emerge the world has been very fortunate that no major conflict has occurred. The EU has invited many of these new democracies to join the Union. Like Ireland, they will have a democratic voice in the new Europe. Before joining the EU, these nations have opted to join the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and Partnership for Peace. Many of these countries were not ready to join NATO but many have applied to join.</P>
    <P>With our tradition of peacekeeping, Ireland should no longer be isolationist. By joining PfP we will be in the mainstream of security policy making and decision taking. We will have a respected voice, respected even more because of our past traditions in peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks all over the world. Almost all other European states are involved in PfP, including the neutral states of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. Only a small number of countries &ndash; Ireland, Andorra, San Marino, Liechtenstein and the Vatican are not members of PfP. Perhaps the Vatican will join at some stage.</P>
    <P>Conflicts which may emerge in Europe will, more than likely, have their roots in ethnic, religious, social or economic differences, as shown by events in the Balkans and Chechnya. By co-operating in security, the danger of conflict between individual states in PfP is minimised and eliminated. Many central and eastern European nations which were members of the Warsaw Pact are anxious to become full members of NATO. The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary joined NATO this year and nine others are interested in joining. Russia, Finland and Switzerland are involved in PfP but have no plans to join NATO.</P>
    <P>If we are to remain involved in peacekeeping worldwide, it behoves us to ensure that our soldiers and gardaí who work abroad on peacekeeping missions have the best protection and training. They will not get this exposure to modern methods and technology if we remain isolated. Our Defence Forces can only benefit from training with other forces. They will have to work with <Col N="1237" /> others in peacekeeping missions and they would be a danger to themselves and others if they do not have training in and use of the best modern equipment and methods. Even our interaction with other defence forces in Lebanon and elsewhere has had a major effect on our soldiers. Deputy O'Sullivan stated that she was impressed by our soldiers in Lebanon and they are impressive. The involvement and interaction with other nations has improved morale in our armed forces. They have learnt from that interaction and improved their capability. The potential for further improvement by involvement with PfP is immense and can only be beneficial to our soldiers and to the people they serve in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the changes in uniforms and weaponry, but we must keep up with developments. Involvement with PfP will serve our soldiers well, as it will the people they work for abroad. Europe needs to be able to act within or on its borders if another crisis such as that in Bosnia or Kosovo should develop. What would have happened in Europe if Milosevic was not stopped? He had one of the largest standing armies in the world, which was well equipped and trained. There was a danger that other countries could have been pulled into that conflict. If the US had decided to stay out, the whole of Europe could have been engulfed in a land war for many years. Only for NATO, Milosevic could have overrun the Balkans and drawn others into the turmoil. Europe would have been unable to stop him and a major land war could have resulted, with devastating consequences. Such a Europe at war must never be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has always contended that a referendum was not needed on this issue. Joining PfP is not the same as joining NATO. We are not involved, nor have we any intention of joining a military alliance with a mutual defence requirement. Malta was a member of PfP but left the organisation after a change of government. Ireland could do likewise if this House so decided. It may not be that easy to withdraw if a referendum was held and the people agreed to join PfP. It would be wrong to hold a referendum if there is no need to do so.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing campaign of misinformation regarding PfP. PfP is a bilateral arrangement between NATO and non-NATO states, covering co-operation and co-ordination in areas designated by the individual states as priority. The agreement is open and transparent and is written down for all to see. We can choose our own priority areas, such as human rights and peacekeeping operations, and we can always opt out at any time if we so wish. I also said that Switzerland, Russia, Austria and Sweden are all involved in PfP. It has been argued that Ireland would be in association with nuclear powers. Does that mean that we should leave the UN, the OSCE and the EU? People say that PfP is a back door to NATO, but surely we are beyond that. We should look at evolving European structures and <Col N="1238" /> should not have to rely on the US for our security and defence. If we stay out of PfP, we will be on our own. It will be like a mother looking at the soldiers walking down the road and saying &ldquo;They are all out of step except my Johnny&rdquo;. We would be one of the few countries doing so and the other countries are very small.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the public has expressed concern but concern has been fuelled and fed by the political opportunism of the Taoiseach, who stated in 1996 that Fianna Fáil would regard any attempt to push PfP or participation in Western European Union tasks by a resolution through this House without reference to the people as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic. He fanned the embers of doubt in the people. He threw the fuel of misinformation on the fire. He promised that, if elected, he would hold a referendum. He was elected and he has betrayed the promises that he made. He says he changed his mind. The information which was available then has not changed. It is the same PfP, but the doubt which the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil sowed in the minds of the people is still evident. The fire which the Taoiseach fanned is still burning. Is it any wonder that there is apathy and cynicism towards politics among the people when politicians behave in this way?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael policy has been consistent. Nobody can say that we changed our minds. Our policy from day one was that Ireland should join PfP. We laid out our stand before the people and Fianna Fáil put forward a different one. It was elected and then went against its promise. That is dishonest. If that happened outside politics, a person would be sued for dishonesty. We said that a referendum was not needed and if the people had not been given false information and if false promises were not made, then a referendum would not even be an issue and joining PfP would not be an issue for the people because they would have been in possession of the true information. However, doubt has been sown. We have much work to do to convince the people that we are right and I am happy that Fianna Fáil has come around to our way of thinking. If the Government had decided to hold a referendum as promised, we would have canvassed for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to join PfP. I am convinced that if the people were given full and true information, there would be an overwhelming &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in such a referendum.</P>
    <P>The objectives of PfP include facilitating transparency in national defence planning and budgeting processes; ensuring democratic control of defence forces, which is vitally important; the maintenance of the capability and readiness to contribute, subject to constitutional considerations, to operations under the authority of the UN and/or the responsibility of the OSCE; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; peacekeeping; the development of co-operative military relations with NATO for the purposes of joint planning and training exercises in order to strengthen the ability of PfP participants to <Col N="1239" /> undertake work in those areas, as I mentioned; and the preservation of democratic societies and the maintenance of the principles of international law. Who could be against that? The members reaffirm their commitment to fulfil in good faith the obligations of the Charter of the UN and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and specifically to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, to respect existing borders and to settle disputes by peaceful means. Each country negotiates its individual partnership programme, choosing from a NATO menu of potential co-operative activities. As I stated already, Malta opted in and opted out and it is now thinking of renewing its membership.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers suggested that Third World countries may lose out if we join PfP, but by staying out of PfP we are in a weak position. By being involved our voice will be heard and we will be more respected. Questions have also been raised about the cost to our country of involvement with PfP. One way or the other, we must upgrade the Army and make sure it has proper equipment. We certainly must provide the Naval Service with the equipment and training it requires. Ireland has a huge area of sea to patrol and there are problems other than military threats, such as the continuous threat of international terrorism, the drugs issue and the transportation of human beings which is a virtual slave trade. This is happening at present and the Naval Service is almost powerless to intervene. It is like having one Garda car to cover the country. Certainly membership of PfP would benefit Ireland and we should join.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Ferris.</P>
      <P>There are two key issues in the proposal that Ireland join the Partnership for Peace: first, why the people have been denied a referendum, and second, Ireland's future role within the evolving international context and what role we envisage for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil's position on PfP has been highlighted by a number of contributors to this debate. In opposition Fianna Fáil played a populist game with PfP. Colourful soundbites from the pen of a spindoctor replaced considered contribution to debate. Fianna Fáil abused cherished concepts such as neutrality and democracy for its own selfish electoral benefit.</P>
      <P>The Irish people have a deep commitment to the principle and policy of neutrality. These important sentiments were pounced upon by Fianna Fáil in Opposition in the run up to the 1997 election. It debased politics, it demeaned the political system and Fianna Fáil deserve all the opprobrium which has been directed their way in this debate. Believe me, that party earned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to political parties evolving their policy positions over a number of years. In fact, it is a healthy sign that debate and thought <Col N="1240" /> informs political policy positions over a period of time. Political positions should not be written in stone. However, there is a line which cannot be crossed. When a political party promises to hold a referendum then it must adhere to that commitment. For in promising a referendum, in going before the people at an election with this commitment, a political party enters into a contract with the electorate. Fianna Fáil has betrayed this contract. It has gone back on its word. It has fundamentally breached faith with the people. The blatant refusal of the Government to allow a plebiscite on Partnership for Peace is shameful.</P>
    <P>The implications of Fianna Fáil's betrayal go far beyond the issue of Partnership for Peace. As Members will be aware, politics is at a low ebb. Due to the actions of a certain number of politicians the whole profession of politics and the concept of public service has been debased. Falling turnouts in elections and the general cynicism of young people in particular towards politics are just some of the tangible effects of the damage which a few have inflicted on the operation of politics. There is an obligation on all political parties, and on the current leadership of Fianna Fáil in particular, to restore public trust in the political process. The Taoiseach has made numerous speeches since becoming president of Fianna Fáil which recognised the damage that has been inflicted on politics. His words would lead one to believe that he understands the need to restore faith in the political process but his actions, particularly over PfP, achieve the exact opposite. The behaviour of Fianna Fáil over a referendum on PfP has fed into the growing cynicism about politics. Fianna Fáil's betrayal has fed into the bleak sentiments that every Member of this House hears increasingly these days. Its decision to promise a referendum in 1996 and to do the exact opposite when in Government was a disgrace. It has debased politics, the profession to which all Members of this House have dedicated themselves.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury the Taoiseach further undermined the democratic process by declaring that the recent European elections would be a referendum by proxy on PfP. The Taoiseach repeated this bizarre claim in the House last week. This is nonsense. In a desperate effort to extricate Fianna Fáil from its U-turn on PfP the Taoiseach proceeded to abuse the legal and political framework of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's contention that the people had an opportunity to debate and vote on the proposal to join PfP in the European elections is utter nonsense and deserves to be exposed as such. PfP has nothing to do with the European Union, it is not a European issue and the Taoiseach should desist from attempting to pull the wool over the electorate's eyes by repeating this ridiculous claim. The failure to hold a referendum has also clouded the important debate that should be taking place on PfP and Ireland's evolving international role. If there was a referendum on <Col N="1241" /> joining PfP in the morning I would vote in favour. This is not because Ireland's defence and security obligations in the future will, or indeed should, be focused on participation in PfP. It is because the future development of the Irish Defence Forces needs to take place in an international context. The Defence Forces should not be required to be hurlers on the ditch. The men and woman who make up our Defence Forces have a proud role in peacekeeping, a role that is recognised by every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>However, the ability of the Defence Forces to contribute to this important international role has been curtailed due to the lack of co-operation and training which the Irish Defence Forces undertake with other countries.</P>
    <P>Participation in PfP, of the type outlined in the presentation document which forms the background to this debate, will address this issue. It is an important development for the Defence Forces and one which has my support. Our participation in PfP will lead to the much needed upgrading of the Defence Forces. It has been starved of adequate resources for a number of years and this official neglect has undermined the morale of the forces. Participation in PfP will focus attention on the proper development of the Defence Forces over the coming decade.</P>
    <P>Investment in personnel and equipment must accompany this new development and that is an issue which I am sure this House will return to before Christmas when we eventually see the long awaited White Paper on defence. However, we cannot allow the limited debate about PfP to cloud the issue of the future development of Ireland's foreign and security policy. While, for reasons closely associated with my commitment to the Defence Forces, I support participation in PfP I believe our future foreign and security policy must be developed within a European context.</P>
    <P>The institutions of the European Union are accountable and democratic to the citizens of Union. After the Amsterdam Treaty, momentum towards developing a common foreign and security policy has gathered. This is a process from which Ireland should not recoil. It is a vital policy area where Ireland should play a constructive and positive role. It is also a process that is intrinsically linked with the future enlargement of the Union over the coming decade. Ireland has much to offer to this process. Our experience within the Union is of huge benefit to prospective members, such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</P>
    <P>An expanding European Union raises important questions about defence and security. Ireland cannot abdicate its responsibility in this regard. We must recognise that the physical and political expansion of the Union will present us with many challenges and new obligations. It is the outcome of this debate which will prove most important to Irish foreign and defence policy. I urge the Government to engage fully in this process as the European Union continues to expand and evolve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the wife of the former Taoiseach, the late Jack Lynch. I was as a Member of the Seanad between 1975 and 1977 when he was leader of the Opposition and I grew to respect him.</P>
      <P>This debate is a hollow one. My colleague, Deputy Wall, has allowed me a few minutes to express an opinion. He said that if a referendum were held he would vote in favour of this proposal. When preparing for Government and publishing its manifesto the present Government stated categorically that it would consult the people, irrespective of the point we made at the time that a referendum was not required to enable us join the PfP. We have published a Bill which would facilitate the Government and the electorate to hold a plebiscite on this issue.</P>
      <P>As one of the four member team representing this Parliament as observers in the Western European Union I have taken the opportunity in recent years to inform myself about matters of common defence and security within the European structures. I have taken it upon myself on numerous occasions to re-emphasise Ireland's position as a neutral nation when it comes to matters of defence and military alignments. I have listened to our ambassador and others at such fora, quoting Ireland's commitment to neutrality and our involvement in peacekeeping, peace making, peace enforcement and now, with the advent of membership of the Partnership for Peace, our involvement with the Petersberg Tasks. From what I know of PfP I would not worry about it involving us as a nation in compromising our neutral position. The agenda set down by Partnership for Peace is an <i>a la carte</i> menu from which Ireland can pick and choose what it wants to be, and should be, involved in. We would not be obliged to participate in any tasks about which we had reservations. I am certain that participation in Partnership for Peace in the long-term will be a minimum requirement for any legitimate member of the EU particularly as other neutral members of the EU and Switzerland are already members. Representatives of those countries are satisfied that their neutrality has not been compromised as a result of their membership.   The only problem we have as a party, and we have different views on this subject, is the broken promise of Fianna Fáil. That bonds us together. It turns the public off. They do not believe anyone any more. They do not trust Fianna Fáil's promise that it will not join NATO without holding a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my party leader said earlier today, the decision of the EU and some members such as the Britain, Germany and France in particular, on abolishing the Western European Union and absorbing it into the EU ignores the fact that there would not be parliamentary scrutiny of any decisions on matters of common defence and security in the future. How can 15 member states represent 28 sovereign states within both the Council of Europe and the Western European <Col N="1243" /> Union which involves members of NATO, the EU, applicant members of the EU, associate members, neutral members like us and others? There is widespread concern that the leaders of some of the most powerful nations within the EU will not be satisfied until the EU, which has no competency in some of these areas, absorbs many of the responsibilities currently handled by NATO and-or the capabilities of the Western European Union. The Western European Union will be stripped of its assets if this procedure is followed through in the aftermath of the Cologne Declaration.</P>
    <P>We are alerting the people to the fact that if this happens without changes to one of the treaties or to one of the second pillars, they will have to be consulted again, regardless of whether the Government favours such a move, in respect of the new role the EU is assuming. Unless the Government is honest &ndash; on this occasion it has been totally dishonest &ndash; that type of referendum, which would be obligatory under the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties and the Cologne Declaration, would be likely to fail because people no longer trust as a result of the commitment given by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Many papers have been published on the possible abolition of the Western European Union. Views have been expressed that this organisation may have fulfilled its usefulness. However, without the parliamentary assembly, which has democratic control over and can scrutinise all decisions in connection with the area of defence and at which Ireland can be represented, albeit as a neutral state, the EU is heading towards a situation where neutral nations such as Ireland, Sweden, Austria, and Finland, and any other states that join the Union, wish to maintain their neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Government has been dishonest with regard to whether there should be a referendum or a plebiscite. It is that to which we are objecting and we published our Private Members' Bill to facilitate members of the public expressing their views.</P>

Cé go bhfuil Fianna Fáil, an Páirtí Daonlathach agus Fine Gael ag iarraidh cuma fíordhíospóireachta a chur ar an ndíospóireacht bíodh a fhios ag an bpobal go bhfuil an Dáil ar siúl go déanach anocht d'aonghnó chun deacrachtaí a chruthú do dhaoine ar mian leo labhairt ar an ábhar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá mbeadh reifreann ann faoi Partnership for Peace, chaillfeadh an Rialtas é mar ab amhlaidh beagnach i gcás conradh Amsterdam. De bharr feachtas fothoghchánaíochta ar siúl, beidh na Teachtaí Dála ag iarraidh a bheith amuigh ag canbhasáil, dar ndóigh. Tá iarrthóir an Chomhaontais Ghlais, John Goodwillie, gan comhluadar Teachta Dála ar bith anocht de bharr straitéis an Rialtais anocht. Bhí cuireadh agamsa labhairt ar GMOanna i Mullach Íde anocht ach bhí orm é a <Col N="1244" /> chur ar ceal. Agus déarfainnn go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh do dhaoine eile chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ba bhreá leo siúd atá ar son Partnership for Peace &ndash; go mór mór Fianna Fáil &ndash; vótáil ar ár mballraíocht i bPartnership for Peace roimh meánoíche anocht. Ach ní tharlóidh sé sin anois. Bheadh na hiriseoirí imithe, bheadh an nuacht teilifíse thart agus ní bheadh mórán poiblíochta ag baint leis. Má tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh a bheith glic i dtaobh Partnership for Peace, tá pobal na hÉireann san airdeall chomh maith. Ní dhéanfar dearúd ar an ngliceas, ar an gcur i gcéill, ar iarrachtaí an Rialtais seo chun dallamullóg a chur ar an bpobal.</P>
    <P>D'éist mé go géar leis an Teachta John Bruton anocht agus molaim é as an fhírinne lom a insint faoi Partnership for Peace. Dhein sé iarracht sainmhíniú a thabhairt ar an téarma &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo; ann seachas &ldquo;peacekeeping&rdquo;, a bhí mar ról ag an airm go dtí seo faoi smacht na Náisiún Aontaithe. Dúirt sé gur dóigh leis gur téarma leaisteach é &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo; agus gurb ionann é agus &ldquo;warmaking&rdquo;, ó am go chéile, dar leis. Feictear dó go soiléir go bhfuil comhaontú míleata ar chlár an Aontais Eorpaigh agus nach bhfuil aon dul as ag muintir na hÉireann ach a bheith leis, go míleata agus go hiomlán.</P>
    <P>Ach bíonn scéal eile ar fad ag an Taoiseach agus ag lucht Fhianna Fáil. A la carte a thugann Fianna Fáil ar an socrú. Níl ballraíocht NATO nó Western European Union i gceist, a deir siad. Níl anseo ach cur i gcéill an tslíbhín. Ag iarraidh an dá thrá a fhreastal. Ar an dtaobh amháin, an tseanmheon náisiúnach agus ar an dtaobh eile ag iarraidh leas a bhaint as club na dtíortha is saibhre ar domhain, gan smaoineamh ar an tionchar a bheas ag an socrú seo ar na tíortha bochta.</P>
    <P>Ar a laghad, tá Fine Gael sásta an fhírinne a insint, cé nach bhfuil ina meon siúd ach sodar i ndiaidh na n-uaisle chomh maith. Ach tá siad oscailte faoi. Is é dearcadh an Chomhaontais Ghlais go bhfuil an tír ina bhall den bhfíor Partnership for Peace, sé sin na Náisiúin Aontaithe, agus mo náire ar an Teachta John Bruton nuair a deir sé go bhfuil daoine atá i gcoinne Partnership for Peace sásta faic a dhéanamh. An é go raibh na trúpaí Éireannacha sa Chongó, sa Lebanon, sa Chipir, agus na trúpaí sin atá Timor Thoir anois ag déanamh faic? Fuair trúpaí Éireannacha bás ar son na síochána agus is masla uafásach a rá go bhfuil na daoine atá i gcoinne Partnership for Peace sásta faic a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Muna bhfuil na Náisiúin Aontaithe sásúil, ná cuir an milleán ar na grúpaí sin atá i gcoinne Partnership for Peace; cuir an milleán ar Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá, i dtús báire, a bhfuil na milliún dollar acu ar chiste na Náisiún Aontaithe. Níos dochreidte fós, maíonn an Teachta John Bruton go raibh na Náisiúin Aontaithe ag brath ar Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá mar chosantóir, le caoga bliain anuas. Bheul, chomh fada agus is eol domsa, níor ionsaigh aon arm iasachta an tír seo le caoga bliain anuas. Níl a fhios agam cad atá i gceist aige le buíochas a ghabháil le Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> An é go raibh Éire faoi chosaint na ndiúracán núicléach i Sasana le caoga bliain anuas? Seo croí na ceiste dar liom. An dóigh le hÉireannaigh a bheith ceangailte leis an socrú Partnership for Peace, faoin NATO a bhíonn ag brath ar na diúracáin núicléacha? Nó an fearr a bheith páirteach in eagraíocht domhanda a bhíonn ag díriú ar &ldquo;peacekeeping&rdquo; agus ní ar &ldquo;warmaking&rdquo;. Nó &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo; nuair is an lámh láidir claonta atá ann.</P>
    <P>Cad é costas Partnership for Peace do shaoránaigh na tíre seo? Níl éinne ag tabhairt freagra lom ar seo ach tá a lán daoine ag tabhairt buille faoi thuairim. Cad as a dtiocfaidh na milliún punt chun íoc as an trealamh míleata do slua coise nua san arm? Ní bheidh aon dul as ag Rialtas agus ag arm na hÉireann ach eitleáin troda, &ldquo;intercepts&rdquo; mar a thugtar orthu agus eitleáin strike agus tancanna nua a cheannach, de réir PDFORRA, ar aon chuma.</P>
    <P>Bíonn an chogaíocht an-chostasach. Chosnaigh sé £6 milliún ar NATO droichead amháin ar an Danube a scrios i Kosovo. Agus cosnóidh sé £10 milliún chun é a athógáil. Chosnaigh bhuamáil NATO £2.6 billiún ar fad i Kosovo agus is é praghas an athógála ná £30 billiún. Lena hais seo, chun na fiacha atá ag fiche cinn de na tíortha is boichte ar domhain a ghlanadh, ní chosnódh sé ach £3 billiún. £30 billiún chun tír a athógáil tar éis cogaidh agus £3 billiún chun fiacha a ghlanadh do thíortha bochta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As I raise a sporting issue it is only right that I pay tribute to the late Jack Lynch and send my sympathy to his family.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that we regard Tuam town as the home of football in County Galway. We have always stressed that Tuam stadium is good enough for county football finals, county senior championships and Connacht finals and is a stadium worth preserving and promoting. There has been a campaign in the media to downgrade and ridicule Tuam stadium. We saw this before the Connacht final when there were even reports of infestations of rats and mice in the stadium which were completely untrue. The Minister knows that more than 30,000 people attended the Connacht final in Tuam. This is roughly the same number who would attend a championship match or final in any of the other stadiums in Connacht, whether Roscommon or Castlebar or the proposed development in Pearse Stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great work has been done in Tuam stadium to improve the facilities, particularly by FÁS schemes. However, no major capital grants have been given by a succession of Governments for development work at the stadium and I ask the Minister to look at the application that has been made. There is no conflict between what is pro<Col N="1246" /> posed for Tuam stadium and the development of Pearse Stadium in Galway. Galway is the second largest county in Ireland and there is concern about the development of Gaelic football in the city and a need for facilities in west Galway. These needs should be addressed. However, I have consistently lobbied the Minister for capital funding for Tuam for the past two years. The Minister was hardly a month in office when he agreed to meet a delegation from the Tuam stadium committee. I thank him for granting that meeting and for the reception he gave the deputation.</P>
    <P>If money is available for GAA pitches in Connacht &ndash; what are known as country grounds &ndash; Tuam is entitled to some of that money. The fact that senior college matches are played there is an important factor. Tuam is the principal pitch for football training in the county and that was certainly to the benefit of Galway last year. Tuam stadium committee seeks a £200,000 capital grant and I believe it is entitled to it. The committee needs to cover both sides of the stand, to provide fencing, particularly along the back of the terraces and to provide barriers for safety. The Tuam stadium application received a very high mark under the points system in 1998 but it was not successful.</P>
    <P>The fact that Gaelic games are played in Tuam means a lot to the economy of Tuam and north Galway. The stadium has been used for county and Connacht finals and in a few weeks time it will host the Connacht club championship final between the County Galway champions Killererin and the County Mayo champions, Crossmolina. The Minister knows that this pitch is my priority. It was the first capital project I mentioned to the Minister and I look forward to a positive reply from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising the matter of Tuam stadium as he has done on a number of occasions in the past. The sports capital programme was comprehensively reviewed by my Department in 1998. Following receipt of the report of the review group I announced details of the new programme late last December, based on the review programme's recommendations. These recommendations incorporate revised guidelines, assessment criteria and terms and conditions. Almost 1,900 applications were received by the closing date, 12 February 1999. Included in these was an application in respect of the development of Tuam stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application was assessed and evaluated by officers from the sports unit of my Department. In the interest of consistency and fairness all the applications from a particular county were assessed by one officer. While all applications were treated on their merits the highest priority was afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increased participation, particularly by young people. The assessment criteria under which applications were evaluated are set out in paragraph 34 of the guidelines which issued with each application form. Among the factors taken <Col N="1247" /> into consideration are the technical merit of the project, for example, whether the project complies with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; the financial viability of the project, that is, whether, in additon to lottery funding, the club or organisation has sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic time; the level of local funding available; the need to achieve an equitable geographic spread of funds having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county and the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups.</P>
    <P>A scoring system was developed under which individual applications were scored between 0 and 5 under each heading, depending on the extent to which they met the assessment criteria. Different weights, from 1 to 4 were attached to the various criteria, depending on their importance. The highest weighting was given to the disadvantage criterion, given that special priority is being given to the development of facilities in disadvantaged areas. At the end of the assessment process, each application received a score which decided its order of priority within its own county. Comparisons were made between the scores for applications in respect of projects from individual counties and they showed that in some counties a lower overall threshold applied than in others, primarily because of the different weightings attributed to various assessment criteria, for example, whether the county had disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>In July last, following this extensive assessment process, I announced grants totalling £14.44 million to almost 400 local community based projects and a further £2.15 million to six regional and national projects throughout the country. Any applicant which sought a report on the assessment carried out on its application was provided with such a report, which may be of assistance in the event of the organisation applying for further assistance under the new sports capital programme in 2000-01.</P>
    <P>Discussions are at an advanced stage with certain national governing bodies regarding proposals for the development of national, regional and county venues submitted under the 1999 round of applications and I expect to make announcements in this regard very shortly. As the Tuam project received lower marks relative to other applicants in Galway &ndash; and it is up to the club to find out those scorings &ndash; it was not possible to grant aid it on this occasion. I expect to be advertising details of the programme for 2000 next month and it will be open to it to reapply and upgrade its application for support under that programme at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing this matter and the Minister for taking it. When the Gleeson Commission con<Col N="1248" /> sidered the military service allowance, MSA, it concluded that it constituted an integral part of military pay and recommended that the Departments of Defence and Finance should give early and positive consideration to making the allowance fully reckonable for superannuation purposes. The Department had discussions without representatives of RACO and PDFORRA. These bodies represent serving personnel of the Defence Forces and are precluded from representing retired personnel.</P>
      <P>As a result of these discussions MSA was included as part of reckonable income for superannuation purposes for personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. However, no organisation purporting to represent the interests of retired personnel was admitted to what proved to be crucial negotiations on this important issue. They feel aggrieved about the manner in which retired personnel were excluded from discussions concerning a matter of vital importance to the welfare of pensioners. The Chief of Staff who, in accordance with defence regulations, had a responsibility in this area, apparently made no contribution and had no say in the matter. The negotiations, therefore, on the implementation of the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission continued without consultation on the interests of retired personnel.</P>
      <P>I ask that MSA should be pensioned for all Defence Forces pensioners, not just those who retired on or after 1 August 1990. The commission intended the pensioning of MSA to be retrospective and prospective, but MSA has only been pensioned in respect of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. This is the only recommendation by the commission which has not yet been implemented. The commission's report states in chapter 10, paragraph 10(a)(2):</P>
      <P>The Commission considers that Military Service Allowance is an integral part of military pay and, accordingly, recommends that the pension scheme be amended to provide for the reckoning of Military Service Allowance in calculating benefits.</P>
      <P>The adoption of this provision since 1 August 1990 has been totally arbitrary. It has created a huge anomaly in that those who retired prior to that date are in receipt of a significantly lower pension than those who retired after that date with the same rank and service. Some individuals who retired on or after that date receive a greater pension than a person who had a higher rank and/or more years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arbitrary selection of August 1990 as the qualifying date for the inclusion of MSA in the pension entitlements has resulted in retired personnel and surviving spouses being treated unfairly. It smacks of a parsimonious approach to the needs of Defence Forces' pensioners and there is no need for this group to suffer needlessly for an allowance which in an overall budget context is negligible. Retired personnel numbering <Col N="1249" /> less than 1,000 who were in receipt of MSA during their service are deemed ineligible to have MSA included in their pensions because they retired before August 1990. The Department has accepted the principle of pensioning MSA but it has deemed it appropriate to reduce the cost of doing so in the short term through the introduction of an arbitrary cut-off date. It has justified the pensioning of MSA only to those retiring on or after that date on the grounds of cost and possible implications in other areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>The pension provisions for the Defence Forces are unique in many respects for the public sector and on this basis I do not see how a precedent could be created for other areas. In 1995 a total of 5,600 pensioners were estimated to have been excluded from the MSA additional payment and it is calculated that it would cost approximately £4 million per annum to extend the payment to this group. However, in 1996 the total number of pensioners excluded from the payment had reduced to 5,400 and thus the annual cost of the allowance had decreased. The reason for this reduction is a high mortality rate among the group and it is estimated that the number will decrease steadily over the coming years and, thus, the cost of extending the allowance will shrink and eventually disappear as the individuals concerned do not have an infinite life expectancy.</P>
    <P>The depth of resentment among retired personnel and surviving spouses, most of whom live on modest pensions, cannot be understated, especially in light of long service to the State at home and abroad with the UN, frequently in hazardous circumstances. If the Minister does not adopt a positive approach, I have no doubt that they will seek other means of obtaining their entitlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The Defence Forces pensions code is unique in the public sector in that provision is made for the payment of immediate pensions and gratuities after unusually short periods of service and regardless of age. The minimum service required for a pension and gratuity is 12 years in the case of commissioned officers and 21 years in the case of enlisted personnel. Maximum pension can be attained after as few as 24 to 25 years service for officers and 31 years for enlisted personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Military service allowance, MSA, was introduced in 1979 as compensation for the special disadvantages associated with military life and was not reckonable for pension or gratuity purposes. The inclusion of MSA in the calculation of superannuation benefits arose from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Gleeson Commission which has been implemented. The agreed arrangements for the implementation of the recommendation provide, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring <Col N="1250" /> on or after 1 August 1990, the day following publication of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>MSA has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified persons who retired since that date. The various arguments in support of the view that MSA should be reflected in the pensions of personnel who retired before 1 August 1990 were considered fully in the context of the detailed and lengthy discussions with the military representative associations which preceded the implementation of the recommendation of the Gleeson Commission. However, having regard to the practice followed in other areas of the public service and the considerable cost involved, which is not confined to my Department alone, it has not been possible to extend the scope of the commission's recommendation to those who retired before 1 August 1990. The cost to my Department of extending this benefit to such pensioners is estimated at £4.8 million a year.</P>
    <P>It is a core element of public service pensions parity policy that, when an allowance is being made pensionable for serving personnel, the benefit does not apply to existing pensioners. Accordingly, the stance adopted on the pensionability of MSA is consistent with settled pensions policy in the public service generally. As the Deputy is aware, the Commission on Public Service Pensions was established by the Government in February 1996 against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging cost of existing public service pensions. The commission has broad terms of reference to examine and report on occupational pension arrangements of public servants, including claims for improvements in existing superannuation benefits. It was open to individuals and groups to make submissions to the commission and I understand that various organisations representative of military pensioners did so.</P>
    <P>The commission is an independent body and is scheduled to make its final report to Government in the near future. In its interim report, published in November 1997, it listed the pensionability of allowances generally as one of the main issues raised by various interested parties who made submissions. The Government will consider any recommendations the commission may make in this regard. The position of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces' pensioners in the context of the MSA, will be further considered in light of the final report of the commission and any relevant Government decisions taken thereon.</P>
    <P>The pension payable to an NCO or private on retirement consists of a basic flat rate in respect of 21 years service, which ranges from £109.13 per week for a private to £162.30 for a sergeant-major with an addition to basic pension of £23.52 per week in respect of MSA, 40 per cent of the rate of that allowance. Where pensionable service is 31 or more years an increased addition in respect of MSA of £29.40 a week is paid, 50 per cent of the rate of that allowance, and an additional increment of £4.17 a week in respect of each year <Col N="1251" /> of pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years. The minimum pension payable to a captain retiring with 12 years service is £5,732 per year while the maximum pension for a lieutenant-colonel with 25 years service is £18,812 per year inclusive of the MSA addition in each case.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Social Welfare Benefits.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this debate. Since the introduction of the one parent family payment in 1997 to replace the lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and prisoner's wife's allowance, anomalies have appeared which require adjustment. Those on deserted wife's benefit will remain on it until they reach the age of qualification for old age pension. At present they get an allowance of £77.10 per week. In 1999 a deserted wife gets a one parent family payment of £73.80 per week, a reduction of £3.30 per week. The children of the parent on deserted wife's benefit get an allowance of £17 while the one parent category award per child is £15.20 per week. A mother on deserted wife's benefit can remain on that benefit when her family has grown up while a mother on the one parent allowance must sign on the dole to obtain an allowance under the social welfare code. When her children reach the age of 18 or complete their education, she will not qualify for the allowance for which the woman on deserted wife's benefit will qualify.</P>
      <P>The system is clearly unfair and the discrimination is obvious. Benefit was replaced by an allowance &ndash; the benefit payment continues up to old age pension qualification whereas the allowance stops at a certain age, which places many women in a disadvantageous position. It is unfair that those who qualify for the new payment do so on different terms from those who have the advantage of being in receipt of deserted wife's benefit. A person on the one parent family allowance is at a disadvantage of £4 per week. That is unjustifiable and the situation should be adjusted to remedy the anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Until 1990 the needs of lone parents were provided for under the social welfare code through a variety of schemes, including the unmarried mother's allowance, deserted wife's allowance and deserted wife's benefit. The operation of these schemes proved problematic for many lone parents and, indeed, some could not qualify because of the strict qualifying conditions, particularly in relation to desertion, which applied to the schemes. Some also found the investigations necessary to establish entitlement to deserted wife's allowance-benefit to be very intrusive and upsetting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 a process of rationalising provision for lone parents commenced with the introduction of the lone parent's allowance. This scheme intro<Col N="1252" /> duced some new features in provision for lone parents in that it was available to both fathers and mothers and removed the need for separated spouses with children to prove desertion.</P>
    <P>However, the deserted wife's allowance and benefit remained in place and the Department was criticised for not having similar payments available to men. These payments had been introduced at a time when the accepted norms in society envisaged a male breadwinner and dependent wife and children. These roles have become eroded down the years, with women becoming increasingly independent through their growing involvement in the workforce. Changes in family law have also undermined the basis of these schemes. In the circumstances, it was felt that desertion was no longer a contingency for which people could reasonably expect to be insured.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Social Welfare, 1986, questioned the validity of desertion being regarded as an insurable contingency. In the circumstances, it was decided as part of the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, to further streamline payments to lone parents and this resulted in the introduction of the one parent family payment in 1997. The scheme requires that a lone parent has the main care and charge of at least one qualified child. It focuses on the presence of children in a household and makes the route to lone parenthood irrelevant. The scheme is non-discriminatory in that it is available to both men and women and non-judgmental in that it does not depend on the reasons for lone parenthood. In particular, the requirement on women to prove desertion and the intrusive questioning which that entailed were dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The scheme also features a very strong employment-led approach which seeks to encourage lone parents to consider employment as a viable alternative to long-term welfare dependency. The main element of this policy is the earnings disregard which allows a lone parent earn £115.38 per week without payment being affected, with earnings from that up to £230.76 assessed at 50 per cent. There are also transitional arrangements in place for when a lone parent exceeds the upper income limit.</P>
    <P>The operation of the scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as part of its expenditure review programme. The review is, among other things, intended to see if the scheme is meeting its objectives in the most efficient and effective manner. It is expected that work on the review will be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>When the one parent family payment was introduced no further applications were accepted for deserted wife's benefit and allowance. However, arrangements were put in place to ensure the position for those who were receiving payment under these schemes at the time was maintained. At the end of 1998 there were 15,642 people still receiving payment under these schemes and they will retain their entitlement as <Col N="1253" /> long as they continue to satisfy the conditions attaching to the schemes.</P>
    <P>There are certainly differences between the one parent family payment and the old deserted schemes. However, the introduction of the one parent family payment has entailed many advantages for lone parents, including equality of treatment for all lone parents with children, less intrusive investigations to establish entitlement and a liberal approach to earnings, which is designed to encourage them to take up employment so that they may avoid long-term welfare dependency. At the same time the position of those on deserted schemes who would not have gained under the one parent family payment was safeguarded.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Suicide Prevention Programme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his presence at this late hour.</P>
      <P>A remand prisoner hanged himself last Saturday afternoon in Mountjoy Prison. This tragic death took place despite a previous history of self-harm. The person was in the high risk group for suicide &ndash; he had had two drug overdoses in prison, one of which led to his being rushed to hospital. I sympathise with the victim's family and recognise that their hurt is most profound. In a suicide death there are special difficulties for the bereaved which are compounded by the circumstances of the young man's death. I also sympathise with the governor and prison staff. Suicide profoundly affects those who deal with the situation. We should recognise the personal trauma with which they are dealing and hope the necessary services are available to assist them to come to terms with their situation.</P>
      <P>The number of suicides in prison is far too high. One is too many. I ask the Minister to outline to the House the suicide prevention programmes in place in our Prison Service. What training is given to staff in the implementation of such procedures? Are staff aware of the signs which should alert them to a person who is displaying suicidal feelings? Research in the United Kingdom estimated that the risk of suicide for prisoners was five times that of the general population. Is there a special understanding of the unique pressures on the prison population?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the way the needs of relatives of a prisoner who has committed suicide are handled after the trauma of the suicide itself? What treatment is available to prisoners suffering from mental illness, including depression? In California state prisons, psychiatric technicians were introduced into the prisons to deal with this important issue. It is estimated in California that one out of every 12 inmates suffers from serious mental illness. Are figures concerning Irish prisons available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> The psychiatric technicians in the state prisons in California function in various aspects of a new programme which they have introduced. It includes crisis intervention, mental health screening, patient assessment, implementing treatment programmes, supervising suicide risks, administering medication, maintaining medical records and quality assurance. Another function involves parole programmes which prepare inmates for productive lives after release.</P>
    <P>The national task force on suicide published its recommendations in a report in January 1998. Perhaps the Minister will outline his response to the developments in regard to its recommendations. The report stated that the national task force on suicide was concerned about the level and organisation of mental health services provided in the prison system. It stated that there is a need to augment significantly existing provision of what could be considered the caring services in the prison environment, for example medical services, which include psychiatric and psychological services.</P>
    <P>The task force endorsed the recommendations of the report of the advisory group on prison deaths published in August 1991. Perhaps the Minister would inform the House how his Department and the Prison Service have responded to that report. This group examined the level of suicide in Irish prisons and considered that a more positive and intensive approach to suicide prevention was required. The group made recommendations concerning the provision of medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare and counselling services in prison. A number of recommendations in relation to the physical design of prisons and cells and the collection and analysis of prison data were made. In its report, the task force recommended to the Minister that the mentally ill in prison be given appropriate treatment in view of the marked association between drug abuse and both self-injury and death, including suicide in prison, that particular effort and resources be devoted, in conjunction with community strategies, to addressing the drug dependency problem of prisoners and that medical and caring services within prison be developed to a level equivalent to community services. It would be appreciated if the Minister would indicate the progress made in implementing in the prison service the recommendations contained in the report of the national task force on suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my deep concern at any loss of life in the prisons and particularly death by suicide. Every such death is a tragedy, not just for the family, relatives and friends of the deceased but also for the Prison Service. I take this opportunity to extend my sincere sympathy to the family of the deceased. I know these sentiments have also been conveyed directly to the family by some of the most senior officials in the Prison Service, including the Director General, who spoke to a sister of the deceased, and one of <Col N="1255" /> the governors attached to Mountjoy Prison who also met with a member of the deceased man's family.</P>
      <P>I have been briefed by the Director General of the Prison Service who is responsible for all operational matters in relation to places of custody. He has informed me that the deceased was committed on remand to Mountjoy Prison on 28 June 1999. He was placed on protection sharing a single cell by choice with another prisoner and was being kept under special observation every 15 minutes. On Saturday, 16 October at 3.45 p.m., he requested permission to use the toilet on the landing. Shortly afterwards an officer found him hanging from the ceiling in the toilet. He was immediately attended to by prison staff and medical orderlies who tried to revive him. An ambulance was called and he was taken to the Mater Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4.35 p.m.</P>
      <P>The Director General has informed me that he is satisfied, from the information in his possession at this juncture, that in the circumstances nothing more could have been done to prevent this tragic loss of life. In accordance with normal practice, this death will be the subject of a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest. The circumstances of the death will also be examined by the suicide awareness group in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, strategies in place for the prevention of suicide in each prison. However, unless there is to be a total denial of all personal privacy to all prisoners at all times, the possibility of suicide in custody cannot be prevented, no more than it can be prevented in the wider community.</P>
      <P>The preventative measures currently in place to deter suicide are kept under continuous review. As I have already mentioned, the circumstances of each death in custody are examined by the suicide awareness group in each prison. The examinations carried out by these groups cover the background and circumstances of each death. Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken in the future to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature. This is an important mechanism for absorbing the lessons to be learned in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> There are also procedures in place for identifying and monitoring offenders at special risk. Such offenders are usually placed under special observation. However, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is determined to take his or her life, and not infrequently there is no prior warning of any such intent, the scope for prevention is limited. Suicide is not a completely preventable act in a free society or in a prison system which accords any respect to the personal dignity and privacy of prisoners.</P>
    <P>In May this year, my Department published the report of the national steering group on deaths in prisons. The group which was established under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor comprised representatives of various disciplines involved in the care of prisoners. They had been assigned the task of reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the advisory group on prison deaths published in 1991.</P>
    <P>The group reported that there are good policies in place and a good level of awareness among prison staff in relation to suicide awareness. The group also reported that many possible deaths are saved by the alertness and vigilance of staff. Following the publication of its reports, I invited the group to continue to meet on a regular basis to provide a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and to disseminate significant findings and lessons learned through the prison system. The group was also invited to organise an annual forum for the suicide awareness groups in each institution. I am informed by the Director General that the first such forum took place recently.</P>
    <P>I hope, in conjunction with all concerned, that the Prison Service will continue to build on its existing policies aimed at suicide prevention. I can assure the Deputy that the Director General is similarly committed and that every effort will continue to be made in this regard.</P>

    <P>I maintain regular contact with Prime Minister Blair and I met him most recently on the margins of the Tampere Summit. We discussed the ongoing review of the Good Friday Agreement, taking place under the chairmanship of Senator Mitchell. The review is a complex and difficult process and I believe that it is best left to Senator Mitchell and the parties to continue their work, without assessment from outside the process. The coming week will be crucial. I continue to urge the parties participating in the review to make the supreme effort to overcome the outstanding obstacles to agreement. I have always acknowledged the contributions of the parties engaged in the process and I believe that these contributions should be built on and enhanced through the implementation of the Agreement. I also spoke with the Prime Minister on 5 October last, when <Col N="1258" /> I telephoned him to offer my condolences and the condolences of the Government and the people of Ireland, following the London rail disaster.</P>
    <P>I met Gerry Adams, President of Sinn Féin, on 2 October last. Our discussions focused on the review and the achievement of a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Mandelson, yesterday. I congratulated the Secretary of State on his appointment and wished him well in his new role.</P>

      <P>The progress to date of the national millennium committee is outlined in detail in the progress report which I circulated to all Members of the House on 28 September last. I intend circulating an updated version of the report to Members shortly. The national millennium committee was established in November 1998 to advise on suitable projects for inclusion in the Government's millennium programme and its work will cover the period 1999 through to the end of the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific regard to Dublin, the Government on the recommendation of the committee, has to date approved over £3.75 million to the following millennium projects: £2 million towards the cost of the two flagship projects of Míle Átha Cliath &ndash; the Liffey of Lights and the Liffey Board Walk; up to £500,000 for the refurbishment <Col N="1259" /> of the front of the Gaiety Theatre; £300,000 to the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery to reconstruct the Francis Bacon Studio as a centrepiece of the gallery's collection; £50,000 to the Children's Cultural Centre, The Ark, Temple Bar for a millennium music theatre show and a visual arts programme on the Nativity; £400,000 towards the new Gascoigne home for the elderly in Rathmines; £100,000 to St. Brigid's parish, Stillorgan, for its children's centre project; £100,000 for the permanent floodlighting of over 20 churches in the diocese of Dublin; £50,000 to rehang the St. George's Bells in the tower of Christ Church, Taney; and £250,000 to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to develop a community resource and sports centre at its premises in Mountjoy Square. In addition, £210,000 is to be made available to the Simon Community for a volunteers project and a refurbishment programme which will include its centre in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Regarding activities for the New Year celebrations, there are a number of major events to take place in Dublin over the weekend of the New Year and these are outlined in the progress report. In respect of smaller projects and events for Dublin, millennium funding has been made available under the millennium recognition awards and the millennium events awards initiatives. Details of awards under these initiatives will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter of free public transport for New Year's Eve, the national millennium committee has not received any such proposal for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission promotes the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fisheries resources of areas of the north-east Atlantic which lie outside the jurisdiction of its contracting parties. To that end, the commission adopted, in November 1998, recommendations on a scheme of control and enforcement for vessels of the contracting parties operating in those areas.</P>
      <P>The effect of the commission's recommendations will be to require fishing vessels of the contracting parties fishing in the areas concerned to comply with a series of requirements on matters including recording and reporting of catches. The recommendations also establish obligations for states to carry out surveillance and inspection of their fishing vessels which fish there.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is a contracting party to the NEAFC, and a draft Council regulation to give effect to the commission's recommendations within the EU is under consideration at present. I understand that the aim is to have this measure adopted by the end of this year. In the meantime, member states are addressing the practical implications of the NEAFC recommendations and how best to give effect to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> My Department engages in ongoing consultation with the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Air Corps on fisheries surveillance, with a view to ensuring optimum effectiveness in the monitoring and control of fishing activities. Preliminary discussions on the operational implications of the NEAFC recommendations have taken place, and further meetings to address all necessary preparations are planned.</P>
    <P>The extent of the operational obligations of the Naval Service and the Air Corps arising from the NEAFC recommendations will depend, in practice, on the amount of Irish fishing activity in the relevant areas, and on the overall arrangements made for policing of the fishing activities of EU vessels generally. The Deputy can be assured, however, that a key objective in drawing up arrangements for the discharge of Ireland's NEAFC responsibilities will be to ensure that Ireland can fulfil its obligations without detriment to the existing rigorous policing of fishing activities in Irish waters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June of this year I published the report of the interdepartmental working group which I set up to carry out a review of the safety regulation in adventure-activity centres in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental working group made a number of important recommendations. Principally, it found that while the sector in Ireland is generally safe, there may be provision of adventure activities, on a commercial basis, which is not in accordance with accepted safety practices and which may pose an undue risk to participants. The group considered that there is a case for a form of statutory regulation of safety in adventure centre activities in Ireland and recommended the establishment of a new statutory authority to manage the regulatory scheme.</P>
      <P>The aim of the new authority should be to encourage high safety standards, particularly in that part of the sector which has not participated in the existing voluntary approval schemes run by the Centre Standards Board of the Association for Adventure Sports and the Irish Sailing Association.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the group's recommendations and in July I secured Government approval to establish the new statutory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also recently secured Government <Col N="1263" /> approval for the establishing of a new marine leisure division within my Department to address safety regulation of marine leisure activity, including adventure centres. Arrangements for the setting up of this new division are being finalised by my Department and work is progressing with a view to introducing the necessary legislation to establish the new statutory authority as early as possible next year.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, however, that setting up the new authority and putting in place statutory codes will take some time. It is important that existing voluntary schemes not only continue in operation but are enhanced and extended in the interim. With this in mind I have recently provided a grant of £30,000 for the Centre Standards Board of the AFAS, to maintain and expand its work to provide an effective approval scheme pending the establishment of the new authority.</P>
    <P>My Department is working with the AFAS to prepare the ground for the new statutory authority. As part of this process the AFAS will be carrying out a consultation process, including hosting a major seminar for national governing bodies and providers, early next year, with the aim of achieving consensus on the best way forward in Ireland. I encourage all national governing bodies, centres and organisations involved in adventure activities to associate themselves with the interim measures with a view to extending their coverage in advance of the statutory scheme.</P>

As I have said before, I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so. I have designated Enterprise Ireland to act as facilitator between operators of petroleum exploration licences and Irish providers of goods and services.</P>

      <P>In the event that Dublin Corporation, or any other party, wishes to undertake any work on or impacting on the foreshore it will be necessary, under the Foreshore Acts, 1933-98, for it to obtain a foreshore lease, licence or permission as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Application for a foreshore lease, licence or permission must be accompanied by copies of all drawings and plans relating to the proposed works. It is likely from the wording of the Deputy's question, that an environmental impact statement would also be required. Plans and other documentation submitted are examined at administrative and technical level within my Department to assess the impact of the proposed works on coastal erosion, accretion, navigation, safety at sea, fishing and fish stocks, etc. Further detail is requested if required. Assuming that there is no objection to the proposed works the issue is put to public consultation. The public consultation period is 21 days where an EIS is not required and one month where an EIS is required. In the event of an objection being made during the consultation period, the corporation would be given an opportunity to respond to the objection. It would then be a matter for the Minister, in the light of all the available information, to decide whether to offer terms of a foreshore lease, licence or permission to the corporation. When <Col N="1265" /> the terms are accepted, a formal legal document is issued.</P>
    <P>I understand that the area is designated by Dúchas and has the status of special area of protection. It would therefore be necessary for the corporation to consult with that body before undertaking any work and comply with any requirements for the protection of flora and fauna which it might impose arising from its obligations under the Birds and Habitats Directives of the European Union.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that the Dublin City Council favours an approach to this problem based on a breaching of the causeway, it seems to me that a considerable amount of work remains to be undertaken to confirm that this would represent the best technical and economic response at this time.</P>
    <P>It is important that progress is made in developing the necessary technical analysis. In this respect, my Department will be shortly exploring with the Dublin City Council the scope for co-operation on the undertaking of the further studies required.</P>

The principal finding was that the estimated exposures to these chemicals from the diet of UK consumers were within current UK safety guidelines.

    <P>Planting of broadleaves by Coillte Teoranta is included in the figures for 1996 to 1998 but excluded from those for earlier years.</P>
    <P>The strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector sets out an annual target of 20 per cent for broadleaf planting. The figures quoted above in respect of broadleaf planting reflect the planted area in hectares of commercial broadleaves. These figures do not include broadleaves planted near rivers, roads and scenic areas, which amount to an additional 4 per cent approximately of all grant aided planting. In addition, the stocking level for broadleaves is 250 per cent that of conifers per hectare. When these factors are taken into consideration, I am satisfied that the target of 20 per cent broadleaves as set out in the strategic plan has been met over the last few years. Grants and premiums under the afforestation scheme are, and will continue to be, heavily biased in favour of broadleaves. The emphasis now is on increasing the diversity of species planted which will enhance the environment and broaden downstream timber processing activities and protect forest health. I am particularly anxious to see a reintroduction of native hardwoods.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I recently published a major independent review of the State's 16 commercial regional ports and harbours, including the River Moy harbour which the Deputy refers to as Ballina harbour. The River Moy harbour is located outside the area of Ballina UDC. The recommendation in the study is that the River Moy harbour would be transferred to Mayo County Council.</P>
      <P>The review develops a general strategic framework for the ports and harbours concerned which aims to maximise their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socio-economic impacts.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the report I initiated a full consultative process. While I am aware that the consultants met and took on board the views of relevant interests, including those of the port authorities and management and other interested State, tourism and local commercial development bodies, I believe that it is essential that all stakeholders and interests are given an opportunity to comment on the recommendations which emerged from the review in advance of any decisions being made.</P>
      <P>All harbour authorities, including the River Moy Harbour Commissioners, are being consulted in this regard.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the consultative process which will help me to determine the most appropriate and beneficial future management/operation arrangements for those regional ports in the interests of the local economy and those who depend on them for their livelihoods.</P>

      <P>The up-to-date position is that 22 fish counters are already installed around the country and a further 13 will be in place by the end of the year 2000. I am providing the Deputy <Col N="1271" /> with a table which sets out the location and current status of all 35 counters. The investment in fish counters is being supported by the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 135 main stem rivers in Ireland supporting salmon populations. The goal of the project is to provide stock information for 34 of these rivers by the end of the year 2000. The counters are located in strategic locations to allow spawning target estimations to be made in specific rivers and to use these results as an index for the other rivers in the region.</P>
      <P>The national fish counter programme is a vitally important element of salmon management policy. By providing essential data on salmon numbers and distribution it will enable real time management to be applied to the salmon resource. The fish counter programme underpins the current salmon conservation measures, the proposed salmon tagging and quota scheme and the catchment management approach. All of these are key components of an integrated and effective salmon conservation and management programme.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): Tonnage objectives are set for the Irish fishing fleet by the EU MGP decision for Ireland up to 2001 and a policy of 100 per cent replacement capacity for the introduction of vessels is applied to ensure conformity with those objectives. My policy for the fleet, therefore, is to facilitate vessel modernisation and upgrading within the mandatory capacity limits. To that end, the Whitefish fleet renewal programme is supporting investment in new and modern second hand boats, vessel modernisation and safety improvements. This will ensure that the Irish fishing industry can utilise the available fishing opportunities to best effect and compete effectively in terms of efficiency and technology with its EU counterparts.</P>

In its final report presented to me in October 1998, the task force stressed that more detailed costings would be necessary before the national maritime college development could proceed.</P>
      <P>In order to progress the recommendations of the task force I established an interdepartmental expert working group comprising senior officials and technical experts from my Department, the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and Defence as well as representatives of the Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and FÁS. The group is now completing its examination of the costings, financing and timing of the new college, including the possibility of funding the development through a public private sector partnership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, I secured EU and Exchequer funding to carry out trials on alternative methods of fishing for tuna, other than drift netting. This year I again secured EU and Exchequer funding to carry out further trials. Owners of vessels interested in participating in pelagic trawling, surface long lining and trolling trials were invited to apply and their applications were subsequently evaluated by BIM on the basis of a number of criteria including experience and performance, vessel range, deck layout, fish handling and holding arrangements and communications equipment.</P>
      <P>Following assessment, 20 vessels were contracted by BIM to carry out tuna diversification trials. Over the next two months BIM will be carrying out a thorough evaluation of the trials. The board expects that reports on the trials, to be submitted to the Department and to the EU respectively, will be available over the coming months. Early indications are very positive as good quantities of tuna were caught using methods other than drift netting, and many of the technical difficulties encountered during the 1998 trials were overcome. A workshop will be hosted by BIM and the Marine Institute in the south west in late November and this will provide an opportunity for the fishing industry to assess the outcome of the trials.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware I have no direct function in relation to seals which are a protected species under the terms of the Wildlife Acts administered by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. That being said, I would be concerned at any excessive losses incurred in Irish fisheries due to predation. In addition, the Marine Institute and BIM, in association with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, are involved in examining the impact of predators on fish stocks and undertake studies as necessary to assess such impacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BIM's report on the physical interactions between grey seals and fishing gear, to which the Deputy refers, assessed the extent of seal predation on inshore gilllnet fisheries in Irish coastal waters. The results of this study pointed to the need to carry out further research. Further <Col N="1275" /> research work is being undertaken at present by UCD, under the aegis of BIM, and a report on this research is expected within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I have asked BIM to provide me in due course with the findings of this research which will contribute to understanding of the extent of the impact of seal predation on fish stocks. I will, on receipt of the findings review the data in conjunction with BIM, the Marine Institute and other appropriate agencies and I will also ensure that the findings of the report are submitted to my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Enterprise Oil and its partners Saga Petroleum, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited have drilled three wells in the Corrib gas accumulation located in the Slyne Trough &ndash; an exploration well in 1996 and two appraisal wells, one in 1998 and the second this year.</P>
      <P>The exploration well was a gas discovery well but the operator was unable to test it at the time. The first appraisal well produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The second appraisal well flowed gas at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day and was successfully completed in August, 1999. The data acquired by the operator, which has been made available to my Department, is being evaluated by the licensees. However, I understand that additional appraisal work is required and that a further appraisal well may be necessary before it can be determined whether the field is commercial.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the size of the field, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, flow rate of the well, the market price and the cost of development of the field. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage and this will not be possible until the accumulation has been fully appraised. The Deputy will appreciate that all data from the well must remain confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the results of their appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for Enterprise Oil to apply to me for a petroleum lease and submit <Col N="1276" /> a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A report on the investigation into the collision between the French f.v. <i>Agena</i> and the Irish f.v. <i>Orchidee</i>, undertaken by the Marine Survey Office of my Department, was published on 19 September, 1999. Officials from my Department travelled to Tramore and to Wexford on Saturday, 18 September, 1999 to deliver copies of the report to the bereaved families and to the surviving crewman prior to its general release.</P>
      <P>The collision between the <i>Agena</i> and the <i>Orchidee</i> happened at about 03.18 a.m. on the morning of 22 September, 1992 in an area of fishing grounds known as the &ldquo;Smalls&rdquo; off the Welsh coast. The <i>Orchidee</i> was lying-to for the night when she was struck almost head on by the French vessel with the result that the <i>Orchidee</i> sank within minutes and two of her three crew were drowned. The remaining crewman was rescued by the French vessel.</P>
      <P>A full Judicial investigation was held into the collision by a French Judge at the Lorient Maritime and Commercial Court on 27 September 1996 and the Officer of the Watch and the Watchkeeping Rating from the French vessel were both found guilty of committing acts of negligence involving the collision, causing the loss of the <i>Orchidee</i> and the deaths of the two crewmen. They were sentenced to suspended terms of imprisonment. My Department's investigation, which had been necessarily suspended pending the outcome of the French Court proceedings, could only be finalised once these proceedings were completed.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the publication of this report is an extremely sensitive matter and understandably so for the families of the deceased members of the crew of the <i>Orchidee</i>, Mr. James Power and Mr. Robert Doran.</P>
      <P>I know that the families have expressed concerns about the report and these concerns were explored in detail at a lengthy meeting with the Power and Doran families held in my Department on 29 September last. The principal concern of the families is that the report and the media commentary on the report is in their view open to the interpretation that both vessels were at equal fault in the tragic accident which occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, however, the purpose of the report to attribute fault or blame as such to any party but rather to identify what happened and if the acci<Col N="1277" /> dent could have been avoided. The report found that the accident would most likely not have happened if either or both vessels had observed the rules in relation to the avoidance of collisions at sea which lay a clear onus on all vessels to follow stated procedures. It is very important if further accidents of this type are to be avoided that the lessons of the tragic loss of the <i>Orchidee</i> are brought home to the owners and crews of all vessels.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, it was not the purpose of the report to apportion blame as between the parties. However, without in any way seeking to qualify the findings in the report, it seems to me that it would be entirely wrong to draw any inference that both parties were equally at fault. On the contrary, it is my strong opinion having considered all the circumstances of the case, that the Irish vessel, which was almost stationary in the water and which was struck into at speed at night by another larger vessel on which proper watch was not being maintained, was a passive party to the accident and, in that sense, was in no way responsible for causing the accident.</P>
    <P>I am conveying these views to the families and I would hope that it will be of some solace to them in coping with the tragic losses they have had to endure.</P>

      <P>A fishing vessel is not precluded from fishing in inshore waters unless, because of its size, its licence contains a specific condition prohibiting it from fishing within a prescribed distance from baselines. There will, therefore, be a variety of types and sizes of vessels operating on individual fishing grounds, particularly as fleet modernisation and upgrading is assisting vessels' mobility between grounds and allowing the inshore fleet to move further offshore. Accordingly there is a need for mutual understanding and co-operation between fishermen engaged in different types of fishing in shared fisheries.</P>
      <P>The necessary co-operation and consensus can best be achieved by direct dialogue between the fishermen concerned, focused on agreeing mutually acceptable codes of conduct. I have already indicated, in the context of ongoing discussions between representatives of vessels fishing by means of beam trawls and other fishermen in the south-west, that my Department is prepared to become involved in a facilitatory role, where the relevant interests consider that this would be of assistance.</P>

      <P>In regard to petroleum exploration there are important developments taking place in relation to two hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the Corrib field is that Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited drilled an appraisal well last year and produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. A second appraisal well flowed gas at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day and was successfully completed in August. The data acquired by the operator, which has been made available to my Department, is being evaluated by the licensees. However, I understand that additional appraisal work is required and that a further appraisal well may be necessary before it can be determined whether the field is commercial.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the size of the field, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, flow rate of the well, the market price and the cost of development of the field. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage and this will not be possible until the accumulation has been fully appraised. The Deputy will appreciate that all data from the well must remain confidential</P>
      <P>Should the results of their appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for Enterprise Oil to apply to me for a petroleum lease and, as part of that application, submit a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Helvick oil field Providence has declared the field commercial and I have granted a lease to allow the company to bring the <Col N="1281" /> field into production. A detailed plan of development for the field is due to be submitted to me for approval by end April next year.</P>
    <P>A plan of development for the southwest lobe of the Kinsale Head gasfield was recently approved by me and as the Deputy may be aware, Marathon brought the gas into production on schedule earlier this month</P>
    <P>As regards minerals, the normal authorisation required for exploration for minerals is a Prospecting Licence (PL) under the Minerals Development Acts. At present there are some 452 current PLs and turnover is between 60 and 80 per annum. They are normally of six years duration but may be surrendered early or renewed depending on circumstances. Competitions are held four times per annum for available PL areas. It is also open to interested parties to apply for a particular area at any time. State mining facilities are applied for only after successful exploration has identified an orebody. There are 16 SMFs currently extant.</P>
    <P>Full details of all PLs and SMFs are contained in the six monthly reports which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas under the Minerals Development Acts. The most recent report, relating to the period to end of June 1999, was laid before the Houses on 31 August 1999.</P>

      <P>The detentions in two years arose from suspected fisheries offences which included log book infringements, retention on board of undersize fish and failure to make mandatory entry-exit reports. Fines and forfeitures ranging from £100 to £137,365 were imposed by the courts in 30 cases, two vessels were released without charge and formal written warnings were issued to four others.</P>

      <P>EU Regulation 1239/98 lays down technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources. The regulation envisages the phasing out of the driftnet fishery by 1 January 2002. The regulation sets limits on the number of vessels that may participate in the driftnet fishery based on 60 per cent of the number of fishing vessels which used drift nets during the period 1995-1997.</P>
      <P>To meet this requirement, the allocation of drift net licences for the 1999 season under the relevant EU regulation was carried out on the basis of objective criteria related to track record in the fishery. Applications were grouped in accordance with criteria advised to applicants, in descending order of priority on the basis of track record of owner-licensee in the fishery as follows: owners-licensees of vessels which fished the driftnet fishery in either 1995, 1996 or 1997 and in 1998; owners-licensees of vessels which fished the driftnet fishery in either 1995, 1996 or 1997, but not in 1998; owners-licensees of vessels which fished the driftnet fishery in 1998 but not in either 1995, 1996 or 1997; owners-licensees of vessels which fished the driftnet fishery pre 1995; and owners-licensees of vessels which never previously fished in the driftnet fishery.</P>
      <P>Following assessment of information supplied by applicants in the context of the scheme notified to them, the Department approved the issue of 18 applications. All authorised participants had a track record of participation over the period 1995 &ndash; 1997 and had also participated in 1998.</P>
      <P>As was the case last year, BIM was again involved this year in conducting assisted fishing trials on alternative methods of fishing for tuna. In total, some 20 vessels were contracted by BIM to carry out tuna diversification trials. In addition, vessel owners were eligible to engage in unassisted exploratory-trial fishing for tuna with methods other than driftnets.</P>
      <P>French tuna fishermen from the Ile deY'eau have challenged the Council decision to ban drift net fishing for tuna. The Irish and French Governments have supported this challenge and have submitted their case to the European Court. No dates have yet been notified for the hearing of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of licences for the tuna fishery in 2000 will again be the subject of discussion with the industry and will not be decided until early <Col N="1283" /> next year in the context of the international obligations applicable at that time.</P>

      <P>As I have outlined to Deputy Sheehan in an earlier reply today, the position is that the global market situation for herring is continuing to be weak. The difficulty is due mainly to the collapse of the Russian economy.</P>
      <P>My Department and BIM are working closely with the Irish fish processors and exporters to maximise all possible market openings for Irish herring, notably in eastern Europe. In this regard, of particular advantage has been the recent appointment of a Pelagic Market Co-ordinator who is now working with the industry on the ground to further develop market co-ordination and co-operative strategies for the herring industry.</P>
      <P>The task force on the management and marketing of herring recommended a series of measures, including the appointment of the Pelagic Market Co-ordinator, to maintain and enhance the Irish herring exports in the very difficult global environment. All of these recommendations have already been implemented or are in progress including quality development programmes for the fleet and herring processors, an industry marketing group, market research and new product development. These initiatives will help the industry through the present difficult market situation and position it well for development in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present scenario the Department is also working with the industry to ensure use is made as appropriate of the existing EU market support schemes. The schemes allow for withdrawal from the market of herring when the minimum withdrawal price for sale is not reached and the payment of a subsidy where product is held over with <Col N="1284" /> a view to reintroducing it to the market at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On the European level, I have raised the difficulties being experienced in the Irish herring market at my recent meeting with the Commissioner and the EU Presidency. I emphasised the need to have the market experience taken fully into account in the determination of tariff rates for the import of herring into the Community.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the herring market situation remains difficult, this is due primarily to external factors over which we have no control. In that difficult scenario the focus will continue to be on developing new market opportunities and maximising quality and competitiveness in order to deliver best possible prices for Irish product.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>To date in 1999, two petroleum exploration licences have been granted in the Irish offshore, one to Agip Ireland BV over six blocks and the other to Elf Petroleum Ireland BV over five blocks. Both were frontier exploration licences awarded under the South Porcupine Round.</P>
      <P>Under these licences, comprehensive licence-specific work programmes will be undertaken which will include the acquisition and processing of 2-D seismic data. The licensees will also carry out special geophysical and geological studies where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have granted three licensing options this year, one to Marathon International <Col N="1285" /> Petroleum Hibernia Limited over six blocks in the Slyne Trough and one to Enterprise Oil over one full block and four part blocks in the Donegal Basin. The third one was granted to a four company group, with Ramco Oil as operator. This authorisation covers the Seven Heads oil and gas accumulation in the North Celtic Sea Basin. I have also approved this month a one year extension to a licensing option granted last year to Providence Resources over one block in the North Celtic Sea Basin. An application for a lease undertaking over an area in the North Celtic Sea Basin is under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>To date in 1999, two wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore &ndash; an appraisal well and an exploration well. Both were drilled by Enterprise Oil in the Slyne Trough. The appraisal well was the second such well drilled in the Corrib gas accumulation and this was successfully completed in August. The results were quite satisfactory with the gas flowing at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day through a 1.25 inch choke. The data acquired by the operator, which has been made available to my Department, is being evaluated by the licensees. However, I understand that additional appraisal work is required and that a further appraisal well may be necessary before it can be determined whether the field is commercial.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the Corrib well, Enterprise drilled an exploration well in the Shannon prospect, also in the Slyne Trough. The well was completed about two weeks ago with disappointing results. The company was given permission by my Department to plug and abandon the well and the rig has now left the location.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to draft amendments to joint FAO-WHO food standards, elaborated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. At the twenty-third session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, held in Rome on 28 June to 3 July 1999, and at which the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Health and Children were represented, I am informed that the draft amendments to the general standard were adopted at step eight as follows: the Draft Recommendations &ndash; List of Food and Ingredients &ndash; with the addition of the footnote to the effect that future additions to and-or deletions from the list will be considered by the Committee on Food Labelling, taking into account advice received from the relevant scientific advisory body; and the draft amendment on composite ingredients  &ndash; 25 per cent Rule amended to 5 per cent &ndash; as proposed by the Committee on Food Labelling.</P>
      <P>I understand that when a codex standard is adopted at step eight, it does not become automatically applicable in the member countries of the codex. There is an acceptance procedure, in accordance with which members voluntarily change their legislation to meet the newly adopted codex standard. I further understand that, where the EU is concerned, in cases where a codex standard differs from that in EU legislation, the decision on whether that legislation should be amended in order to accept the codex standard is taken at EU level.</P>
      <P>In the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, there are already detailed rules at EU level on the labelling of pre-packaged foods, including those pertaining to designation of ingredients, which are set out in European Communities Directive 79/112/EEC (as amended). My Department was responsible for transposing this directive into national law, by virtue of the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982, as amended. No doubt the European Commission will be examining the implications of the new codex standards for this existing EU legislation, all the more so since the Commission is currently preparing a White Paper on food safety, including a review of food labelling provisions.</P>

      <P>The suggestion, as I understand it, is that where a publisher is required to deliver a copy of a book to certain libraries, including the National Library of Ireland and certain university libraries, that publisher should be required to supply an electronic copy of that book in addition to a non-electronic copy &ndash; where the library requires that its demand copy be supplied in non-electronic format &ndash; to facilitate the libraries concerned in the preparation of copies modified for use by persons with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I will give consideration to this suggestion. I would point out that the intention of the book delivery scheme, as it is currently constituted, is to allow certain libraries to construct reference and educational-reference collections of books in the format in which they are published. The current basis for the scheme rests in national heritage and educational considerations, and its connection with copyright is now purely historical and coincidental. There are a number of possible disadvantages attaching to the suggestion in this case, notably in the fact that since only a small number of academic and reference libraries benefit from the book delivery scheme, only a limited proportion of people with disabilities would be likely to benefit directly from extending the scheme in this way. Furthermore, the making of downstream copies of an electronic copy supplied in this way would have to be strictly limited in order to guard against unreasonable infringement of the rights of publishers and authors.</P>
      <P>There may be better ways of helping people with disabilities to access copyright works through the medium of copyright law. For example, I accepted an amendment to section 99 of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, at Seanad Report Stage which will facilitate designated non-profit organisations in making and supplying modified copies of works for people with disabilities, in controlled circumstances, without the risk of committing a copyright infringement. As regards the present suggestion, I believe it would be appropriate to consider it in the context of a review of the book delivery scheme which I will be asking my Department to undertake, in consultation with the Department of Arts, Culture, Heritage and the Islands and the Department of Education and Science, following the passage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999.</P>

      <P>In relation to electricity, the ESB currently has responsibility for ensuring that electricity demand is met. The company has approximately 4,300 megawatts of installed capacity located in various stations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The EU Electricity Directive 96/92/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition by February 2000. This will allow independent electricity suppliers to contract directly with eligible customers for the supply of electricity. Eligible customers are those who will be free to choose their electricity supplier in the competitive market. Customers who remain on the public franchise tariff will continue to be supplied by ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> Continuing growth in the economy has led to an unprecedented demand for electricity. This increase in demand means that new generation capacity will be required by 2001. While a number of projects are in the pipeline for the provision of this capacity, the ESB is successfully managing the increased demand for electricity. In addition, I announced recently in the Green Paper on sustainable energy an increased target of 500 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to be achieved by 2005.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation of the electricity market will necessitate new arrangements to ensure security of supply for consumers. As a result of the changing role of the ESB, the transmission system operator will have the ultimate duty to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the electricity system to meet customer needs.</P>
    <P>Gas supplies were solely reliant on Kinsale Head until the Ireland-Scotland interconnector commenced the transport of gas in 1993. Since that time, there have been two supply sources and to that extent, an improvement in supply security. Both sources involve both marine and onshore pipelines.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the interconnector is 10 million standard cubic metres per day, and is planned to increase to 14 million standard cubic metres by October 2000 with compression at Moffat, and to 17 million standard cubic metres by October 2001 with compression at Brighouse Bay.</P>
    <P>Once the Kinsale Head field depletes, it will have been replaced either by a new interconnector, or by new production from offshore Ireland. The configuration of the supply system will still consist of two sources involving both marine and onshore lines, and this would be true regardless of the route taken by the new Scottish interconnector.</P>
    <P>Under International Energy Agency and European Union requirements, Ireland is obliged to maintain a minimum of 90 days oil stocks and the National Oil Reserves Agency is responsible for ensuring that this objective is achieved. NORA is funded by a levy of 0.375 pence per litre on oil products.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available &ndash; July 1999 &ndash; show that Ireland had 94 days of oil stocks. These consisted of 21 days of crude oil stocks stored in Ireland at the Whitegate oil refinery and Whiddy oil terminal, 54 days of products stored at various locations in Ireland and 19 days of products stored abroad in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark for repatriation in the event of an emergency. These arrangements satisfy the IEA and EU standards for the maintenance of oil reserves.</P>
    <P>In order to provide essential support for the refinery, which the Government considers to be a key element in Ireland's overall strategy for security of oil supply oil companies are required to obtain 20 per cent of their supplies of certain products from Whitegate at prices set by the Minister. The impact of this arrangement, known as the mandatory regime, on the consumer is cur<Col N="1293" /> rently limited to approximately 0.2 pence per litre and the yield to the refinery is subject to a ceiling of £8 million per annum.</P>
    <P>As to the demand for fossil fuels such as oil, coal and peat there is no particular concern about security of supply. Over time, it is envisaged that convenience fuels such as gas and oil will be substituted for coal and peat.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for offshore exploration for, and supplies of, indigenous natural gas.</P>

It has appointed a mobility impaired liaison officer, who co-ordinates the implementation of policy as well as offering assistance to both individuals and groups travelling, and offers assistance on the design of stations and rolling stock. The mobility impaired liaison officer is in regular contact with groups who represent mobility impaired people, for example, National Rehabilitation Board, National Council for the Blind of Ireland, Irish Wheelchair Association, and the Irish Council for People with Disabilities. It has a guide for mobility impaired customers which gives information on accessible facilities in stations and a guide for Iarnrod Éireann staff on how to assist customers who have a mobility impairment &ndash; the latter has been posted out to each individual member of staff. Both guides were written with the assistance of the disability users group.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus has established a three person group, headed by the business development manager, to deal with accessibility issues. A people with disability Dublin Bus consultative group has also been established which includes representatives of a broad range of accessibility interests.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has established a consultative group for people with disabilities, which comprises of representatives of a number of local networks of the Irish Council for People with Disabilities, and senior Bus Éireann management. Since 1990, all new coaches purchased by the company have been specified with a kneeling facility which allows the front of the coach to be lowered to allow for easier access. Developments in relation to coach design and manufacture which would improve Bus Éireann's capacity to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments will continue to be monitored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pigmeat market has been going through a difficult period for some time now, not alone in the EU but worldwide. While the Irish pigmeat market has improved greatly since the beginning of this year it is clear that there is room for further improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> Over the past year or so overproduction in the pig sector was the chief cause of the drop in market prices. The over-production followed a classical swine fever outbreak in Europe. Other factors which contributed to the difficulties were the under-performance of traditional markets in Japan and Russia. All combined to further exacerbate the normal market cycle of pigs in the EU. In Ireland, we had an added problem of a fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland which created a backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter for some farmers in the border regions. However, I took swift action to ensure that this backlog was dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>On the broader front I along with my colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers pressed the EU Commission to take action to assist the difficult pigmeat market. As a result generous increases in export refunds were given; an aid to private storage scheme was introduced. This scheme removed over 420,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market, which was placed in storage; and, a food aid programme for Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat, was also put into operation. To date about 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been sent to Russia.</P>
    <P>The result of all this action is that pig prices have increased since the beginning of the year. The EU Commission has indicated that pig supplies in the last quarter of 1999 are expected to decrease. This means that market prices should improve further. I will however continue to press the EU Commission to ensure that the maximum level of aid is given in order to restore better balance to the pigmeat market and give reasonable returns to all involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to imports of pigmeat into Ireland, of the total of 35,000 tonnes imported in 1998, 34,500 came from other member states. This means that 98 per cent of total pigmeat imports came from intra-Community trade, and under the EU rules of the common market, this trade must be allowed to proceed unhindered. Only 2 per cent of imports come from third countries, which represents 0.2 per cent of total pigmeat production in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, like to see more consumption of domestically produced pigmeat on the home market. The high quality of that product is undisputed. In order to stimulate increased consumption of Irish pigmeat at home, this week An Bord Bia launched a quality assured bacon campaign to encourage sales. The campaign is scheduled to last about three weeks and I am confident that it will play its part in increasing the consumption of home-produced pigmeat.</P>

    <P>Payments under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and the 1999 cattle headage scheme will issue to the person named as soon as his area aid application is fully processed.

    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development </P>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): Abattoirs operating on the domestic market with annual throughput levels up to 1,000 livestock units must be licenced under the Abattoirs Act 1988. This figure may be increased to a maximum of 1,500 livestock units for premises being used to slaughter animals on behalf of a number of butchers provided certain conditions are met in relation to hygiene training. Any premises complying with the regulations made under the Act is granted an abattoir licence. New regulations were introduced in February 1998 to fully implement Council Directives 91/497/EEC and 95/23/EC in relation to issues such as bleeding procedures and refrigeration areas. The interpretation and the practical effects of the regulations were discussed with the operators at the time and additional time was given to comply with the new provisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 301 on 29 September 1999, issues relating to the keeping of exotic or dangerous animals are currently being examined by an interdepartmental group, which includes my Department. The work of this group is at a very early stage. I should mention that Council Directive 1999/22/EC relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos was adopted last March and falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>My Department took the opportunity in the context of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, to effect a major recasting of the penalties for cruelty to animals under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911. As a result of this amendment involving the introduction of conviction on indictment for the first time under this legislation, the penalties now are as follows: a fine of up to £1,500 and/or six months imprisonment on summary conviction; and a fine of up to £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
      <P>These amendments to the 1911 Act allow the courts to impose more severe penalties than hitherto in cases of proven cruelty.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not maintained in a manner which identifies separately audits carried out on plcs or their subsidiaries in each of the past ten years.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that there are many significant companies that are not plcs, or subsidiaries of plcs, and that some plcs, including their subsidiaries, are not significant companies in this context.</P>
      <P>The approach adopted in every audit, small or large business, is determined by the possible tax at risk. Large businesses are, however, subject to more intensive examination. The returns for all large business, including plcs, are examined every year and some audit checks are carried out at least once every two years whereas in small business, the returns are checked less frequently and there is no pre-determined level of audits to be carried out. The duration of audits of large companies, including plcs, is generally longer than those on small business and these audits are dealt with by more experienced staff.</P>

    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): Most cold food sold by retail outlets is liable to VAT at the zero rate. This includes most basic foodstuffs, for example, bread, butter, sugar, meat, vegetables, etc. However, certain items of food are specifically excluded from the zero rate and are liable to VAT at either the 12.5 per cent or 21 per cent rates.</P>
    <P>The items liable at the 12.5 per cent rate are flour or egg-based bakery products which include biscuits and wafers, other than chocolate-covered biscuits and wafers, crackers and cakes.</P>
    <P>The items liable at the 21 per cent rate include sweets; chocolates; confectionery; crisps; ice-cream; frozen desserts, frozen yoghurts and similar frozen products; savoury snack products made form cereal or grain; fried bread segments; pork scratchings and similar products; popcorn and salted or roasted peanuts.</P>
    <P>All supplies of hot food are liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent. Nevertheless, the supply of freshly baked bread which may have retained some heat after baking qualifies for the zero rate of VAT.</P>

      <Quest>the Departments within the Civil Service which have failed to reach the three per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities; the grades of those with disabilities within the Civil Service; the level of disability of those employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20919/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 1 April 1999 there were 743 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.7 per cent of the total staff. The following tabular statement shows the percentage of staff with a disability by Department. My officials are currently in the process of gathering the figures for 1 October, 1999.</P>
      <P>The fact that the numbers of people with disabilities has dropped below the target of 3 per cent continues to be a cause of concern. The heads of each Government Department and office have been made fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3 per cent quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission recently announced an open recruitment competition for clerical officers for people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability. A panel of suitably qualified people will be established through this competition. Applicants will be facilitated by the provision of enlarged scripts, braille and audio test material, interpreters for interviews, and wheelchair access to test and interview locations. As soon as a panel of qualified candidates becomes available for appointment, each head of Department will be <Col N="1307" /> encouraged to draw from that panel when recruiting clerical officers.</P>
    <P>The figure of 3 per cent relates to the Civil Service as a whole. It is not always possible to ensure that each Department individually fulfils the 3 per cent quota at all time. For example, the regular and ongoing movement of staff between Departments may impact on the quota at any given time. In addition, a number of positions across the Civil Service may not be suited to those with certain types of disabilities. For practical reasons, therefore, in monitoring the number of disabled staff, the aim at present is to achieve an overall quota of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Because of the personal, confidential nature of the information regarding the grades in which people with disabilities are serving, such information is not held centrally. Even if it were, I would be reluctant to publish details by grade, in view of the sensitivity of the data, especially where, in the case of grades with a small number of staff, the information would result in the personal identification of staff with a disability.  With regard to the level of disability of those employed, any person to whom the definition used in the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service applies may be employed. This definition is as follows:</P>
    <P>In the context of employment a disabled person is a person with a physical, sensory or psychological impairment which may have a tangible impact on their functional capability to do a particular job or have an impact on their ability to function in a particular physical environment or lead to a discrimination in obtaining or keeping employment of a kind for which they would otherwise be suited.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>
    <P>Since 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has been in place. The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures. The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by a committee representative of staff and management. In addition, in the context of the Strategic Management Initiative in the Civil Service, equality issues, including issues relating to the employment of people with disabilities, are being examined by a committee set up specifically for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, the Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland. The IMB, in its guidelines on the interpretation of the definition of a medicinal product as set out in the Council directive, has revised and updated similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. The policy in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products (including 'natural' medicinal products) has not changed. If products presented on the market include a medicinal claim, the product concerned is a medicinal product and must be the subject of authorisations under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which gives effect to Council Directive 65/65/EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed regarding the possible application of the guidelines but I would <Col N="1311" /> like to assure the Deputy that it is not the intention of the board to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of those medicines that they may wish to use. It is generally accepted, however, that in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of alternative medicines is desirable, and indeed, this is supported, in principle, by the health food and alternative medicines industry. In this respect, the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to health food products and remedies, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of such products.</P>

      <P>Ratification of the convention will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. At present, our inter-country adoption laws deal mainly with the approval of suitable prospective adopters and the recognition of foreign adoptions. Among the items which the convention Bill will have to make provision for are: the designation of a central Authority with overall responsibility for inter-country adoption; the accreditation of competent bodies (e.g. adoption agencies) to undertake certain tasks in relation to arrangements for the inter-country adoption of children; and automatic recognition of adoptions made under the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach to adoptions from non-convention countries is still under consideration in the Department. It is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention. <Col N="1312" /> However, the primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. Therefore, a child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken to the preparation of the legislation.</P>

Authorities have been advised that no particular category of tenant, e.g. those on social welfare payments, should be regarded as being automatically excluded from purchase. A shared ownership option is available to tenants whereby they would be required to make a minimum initial purchase of 50 per cent of the purchase price of the house with an undertaking to acquire the remaining equity within 25 years.

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme, NFS, is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April. In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to winter months but runs for six months of the year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that extending the fuel season to the elderly to make it an all year round scheme would cost an additional £11.6 million per year. This could only be considered in a budgetary context. This or any other improvements in the scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £6 per week if single, £9 per week in the case of couples, were paid to pensioners from the beginning of June 1999.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review his decision not to pay a fuel allowance to tenants of local authority dwellings with subsidised heating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist qualified householders, who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eli<Col N="1317" /> gible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April. Not all recipients of social welfare payments are entitled to a fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Fuel allowance is not normally paid to tenants of communally heated dwellings where subsidised heating is provided. As the local authority tenant is considered to be in a more favourable position than a person providing their own heating needs with the assistance of a free fuel allowance, the local authority tenant does not qualify for the allowance.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation have announced plans for the regeneration of Ballymun. This will involve the demoliton of the existing tower blocks and their replacement with new housing. The new homes being provided will be individually heated by gas central heating and the tenants can then apply for the fuel allowance under the normal qualifying conditions for the scheme.</P>
      <P>This matter was re-examined in the context of the review of the national fuel scheme in 1997 and more recently as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The conclusions reached in both reviews was that the payment of fuel allowances, in this type of case, would create a further inequity in that it would reduce the resources available within the social welfare budget which could be otherwise directed towards more needy cases. I do not propose to make any changes in the existing arrangements.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid invalidity pension to 10 March 1999, when payment was stopped following an examination by a medical assessor of the Department who expressed the view that she was capable of work. She appealed this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office and in the context of her appeal she was examined by another medical assessor on 23 April 1999, who was also of the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>An oral hearing of her appeal was heard on 27 July 1999, to afford her the opportunity to present her case personally. On the basis of all the evidence, the appeals officer disallowed her appeal. The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has written to the Social Welfare Appeals Office regarding her appeal. This has been examined but the chief appeals officer is of the view that there are no grounds for a re-opening of the appeal by way of further oral hearing.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for an invalidity pension on 15 June 1999. She was not regarded as being permanently incapable of work by virtue of the fact that she is working on her own farm holding. Based on the evidence available to the Department she is actively employed in the running of this holding. Accordingly, she was refused invalidity pension. She was notified of this decision and the reasons for it and of her right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. The case has now been referred to that office for a decision.</P>

In respect of the National History Museum division, the policy is to expand the geological and zoological collections to reflect new discoveries and developments both in Ireland and abroad. In respect of the art and industrial division, the policy is to selectively acquire materials to document the economic, social, political, military, industrial and economic history of Ireland and to document what is happening today for future generations. In respect of the Irish folklife division, the poicy is to selectively acquire artefacts which form part of the traditional way of living of Irish people in all its aspects.</P>

      <P>Under the terms  of the European Social Fund-aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees, a trainee may in general receive funding for the approved duration of one ESF aided course. A trainee who has completed a two year middle level technician course is not eligible for a grant in respect of a further two year MLT or three year higher technical/business skills course but may be eligible for a grant in respect of the third &ldquo;add on&rdquo; year of a related diploma, HTBS, course.</P>

      <P>Work on the White Paper on early Childhood Education is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to publish it soon. The White Paper will set out Government policy on early childhood education and will provide a blueprint for the development of the sector. It will set out a range of proposals covering early education for children aged from birth to six years.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the White Paper follows an intensive consultation process which took place in March 1998: the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. A number of organisations representing Irish-medium pre-school education made presentations to the forum and Bord na Gaeilge, like other State agencies, was represented at the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naíonraí, which provide pre-school services through the medium of Irish, make an important contribution both in terms of the development <Col N="1324" /> and early education of children and in supporting the Irish language. The wide range of supports proposed in the White Paper for pre-schools generally will, of course, be available on an equal basis to all pre-schools, regardless of location or language of instruction.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the recommendations and financial arrangements in the White Paper must receive approval by Government before I can publish them.</P>

      <P>High levels of literacy and numeracy are a pre-requisite for participation in our society today, and the Government is committed to increasing investment in this area on a phased basis. In that context, provision for adult literacy has increased from a base of £0.850 million in 1997 when this Government took office, to £5.665 million in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, which was published late last year recommended that investment in this area should increase to at least £10 million per annum on a phased basis, and this will <Col N="1325" /> be further progressed in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives have been progressed as part of the expansion of the service to date in co-operation with the vocational education committees, the National Adult Literacy Agency, and training and employment interests. These include establishment of an adult literacy development fund to support awareness, outreach, referral networks and flexible provision; a doubling of the numbers availing of the service to 10,000; staff development initiatives; piloting of literacy over the radio; development of a quality framework for the service; and initial work in relation to TV literacy and development of an adult guidance service.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee on literacy for the unemployed has also been convened by my Department, which is working with the national adult literacy agency, FÁS, the local employment service, the vocational education committees and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social Community and Family Affairs on the development of an integrated strategy in this area. In that context, a number of joint literacy projects with the FÁS-funded community employment scheme are under way and are now being expanded to all FÁS regions.</P>

      <P>I am aware that scheduling of six days for in-career development programmes and school-based planning associated with the imple<Col N="1326" /> mentation of the revised primary school curriculum in the current school year will require parents to make alternative arrangements for childcare. I believe that this is a necessary step in the interests of improving the quality of educational provision for all pupils at primary level.</P>
      <P>The launch of the revised primary school curriculum marks a very significant event in Irish education. Curriculum change of the scale envisaged requires that schools and teachers review current practice with a view to change and development. This requires a sustained programme of in-career development and planning at school level.</P>
      <P>Planning for the implementation of the revised primary school curriculum has taken place in consultation with the education partners, including parent representative organisations, who are members of an implementation group. A factor in the deliberations of this group was the length and nature of the in-career development programmes required, as well as the implications of such programmes for the closure of schools. In this context, the importance of giving timely notice to parents in regard to in-career development days has been emphasised to boards of management. I am satisfied that the arrangements now in place are required if the revised curriculum is to be implemented in schools.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns that, whereas FÁS trainees were granted an increase of £25 per week in allowances with effect from 19 April 1999, this increase has been paid only to VTOS participants from 6 September 1999; if he will consider retrospective application of the VTOS increase to eliminate this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The extra training allowance of £25 per week has been introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes and has been applied to long-term unemployed participants on VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller training programmes with effect from 1 September 1999. The application of the measure retrospectively would have no impact on participation, and it is not, therefore, proposed to pay arrears of the allowance.</P>
