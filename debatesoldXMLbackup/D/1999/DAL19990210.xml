      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4, Immigration Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 26, Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Second Stage (resumed); and No. 5, Health (Eastern Region Health Authority) Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the legislation which was promised in the House last night on the intimidation of witnesses be introduced? Why was it not introduced before the McCabe trial, given that the IRA has been continuously involved in intimidation of various kinds almost from the day it announced the ceasefire? </P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on claims made on Radio Kerry by Mr. Gerry Adams to the effect that during their meeting in Belfast before the signing of the British-Irish Agreement, the Taoiseach had not completely ruled out the release of the McCabe killers under the prison release programme, but had just said it was very difficult? Will the Taoiseach deal categorically with these allegations by Mr. Adams about the content of their meeting before the Agreement was signed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments will be part of the Criminal Justice Bill before the House and will be brought in on Committee Stage as part of that legislation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes this is the time to do it following his review of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it not done before the trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have continually and unambiguously made clear since Good Friday, 10 April 1998, that any reference by the Sinn Féin negotiators regarding the release of the late Jerry <Col N="270" /> McCabe's murderers could not be considered. It has been brought to my attention what Mr. Adams said on local radio yesterday and I saw the statement he made last night clarifying that matter. At no time was anyone given any comfort about these people and neither will they be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that statement. Can I take it he is also saying that he did not use the words attributed to him by Mr. Adams, namely that he did not completely rule it out but that it would be very difficult? Can I take it that Mr. Adams is telling an untruth in attributing such words to the Taoiseach?</P>
      <P>Is it proposed to recommit the Criminal Justice Bill for a discussion on Committee Stage given that any amendments to be introduced have to be discussed on Committee Stage even though the Bill is now at Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Adams made a statement last night which clarified his position that there was not any agreement on the issue. The position of the Government was made absolutely clear and there it rests, as it has for the past ten months.</P>
      <P>There is not a need to recommit the Bill, the amendments come in the normal way on Committee Stage and can be debated there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear exactly what he said but in terms of what Deputy Bruton has said, there was no doubt or comfort given regarding those who murdered Jerry McCabe. As far as the words Deputy Bruton used this morning, I did not use any such words. It was absolutely clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because these statements were made and clarified outside the House, I was glad to do it here but I will do it in my own way. I will not be dragged into this by Deputy Bruton. If he is having a row with Mr. Adams that is nothing to do with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The office of An Ceann Comhairle is the conveyor of decisions on questions to be taken by various Departments. The office does not decide if questions are to be answered. Following his clear undertaking on 27 January in respect of statements that were made regarding the Gilmartin affair, why did the Taoiseach conclude by saying that if any further questions which need to be answered arose he would answer them? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Chair advise what is orderly in this regard? We had a set of questions and statements last Wednesday. The Taoiseach indicated that he was not closing the matter there, <Col N="272" /> and that if other matters arose and questions were put to him he would by and large respond to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>His office has closed down and refused to answer any of these questions on the basis that the Taoiseach has no responsibility to the House in this matter, yet he answered questions and took statements last Wednesday on precisely the same matter. I am asking the Chair what redress I have if the Department of the Taoiseach simply refuses to answer questions when he has indicated to the House that he previously had responsibility for the same matter.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Taoiseach has indicated that he is prepared to introduce tough new measures to deal with witness intimidation on Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill. We welcome this, though it is a bit late to close the door once the horse has bolted. The Taoiseach has said he intends doing this on Committee Stage, but this is impossible as Committee Stage has passed and we are on Report Stage. As the <Col N="273" /> Taoiseach knows, new material cannot be introduced on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual for substantive amendments to come in late. In relation to the idea of this being done before, there were several Criminal Justice Bills being discussed and ordered when Deputy Higgins's party was in power. A member of the Deputy's party was Minister for Justice when Detective Jerry McCabe was shot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach about legislation relating to heritage and the Irish language in the context of the Irish language. He replied: &ldquo;Tá mé sásta go bhfuil Bille na Gaeilge <Col N="274" /> beagnach réidh.&rdquo;  The Government legislative list shows clearly that this Bill will not be introduced until the end of 1999 or 2000. Maybe the Taoiseach misunderstood me. I was speaking about legislation arising out of the British-Irish Agreement dealing with heritage and Irish language matters. There is great concern among voluntary organisations in this sector that they will be wiped out under proposals for a new executive. Will the Taoiseach indicate what these proposals are?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is still being done on the Bill, though much of the preliminary work is complete. The broad outline of proposals has been discussed by the interdepartmental group, which has come up with some further proposals that may be included in the Bill, but it is still hoped that the Bill will pass this year. Had they stayed with the original draft we would have had it earlier, but the interdepartmental group's proposals are to be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there still no sign of the human rights commission Bill, given that we are just one month away from the deadline for establishing an executive in the Northern Assembly? Does the Taoiseach agree that it gives out the wrong signals when we pull out all the stops for a Bill deporting refugees while dragging our feet on very important human rights legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <b>:</b> Rather than knee-jerk reactions and forced legislation such as this, we need to take a systematic overview of all aspects of asylum, integration, immigration and population balance. The Government, therefore, should commission the National Economic and Social Council to carry out a detailed analysis of our population and skills needs, and asylum and immigration matters should be assimilated into that overview. The NESC has the competence to do this; it is directly responsible to the Taoiseach and has carried out similar studies on population distribution within Ireland. This study should be commissioned as a matter of urgency, with a specific time limit.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how Ireland, Europe's least populated state, can sustain its position as Europe's fastest growing economy without a significant and planned increase in population. We ought to recognise and plan for this reality in a cogent and coherent fashion. In addition, we must put in place proper immigration and asylum programmes to assist these people to integrate, disperse, and make a new beginning in a land where their skills are needed. Unfortunately, the Government's tardiness in dealing with this issue has given rise to racism on an unprecedented level &ndash; we suspected this feeling existed but we never saw it manifested here before. The Government should fulfil its commitment to provide work permits to those whose asylum applications are not processed within a certain period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would do well to look at the Israeli experience. That country has 4 million people and could fit neatly into the combined area of Munster and Connacht, yet between 1992 and 1996 it absorbed 100,000 people <i>per annum</i>, and in the six years prior to that it absorbed 700,000 people. These were mainly Jews from Armenia and Russia. Although they did have a religious affinity with the inhabitants of their new host country, they did not speak the language, had few relatives or roots in Israel and had no place to stay. They brought with them, however, a determination to get on, a will to survive and a considerable reservoir of skills. When this huge influx occurred it was <Col N="279" /> feared that this would destroy the Israeli economy, public spending would increase massively, unemployment would rocket and borrowing would lead to currency devaluation and inflation, but the opposite happened &ndash; the immigrants provided the dynamo to propel the economy to new heights. Not alone did national GDP increase but <i>per capita</i> GDP also increased. Unemployment fell and public overspending did not occur. The positive influence of immigration influx is not unique. The United States is made up of an assimilation of all the cultures of the world. Immigrants bring new skills, have different attitudes and add a capacity to a workforce which it did not have heretofore &ndash; they inject a new dynamism into an economy.</P>
    <P>The need for an EU policy with a common set of criteria to deal with asylum seekers is self-evident. It is extremely difficult to operate the Dublin Convention with any ease of conscience when one is unsure of the policy guidelines that will apply in the country to which an applicant is being deported. The Minister should reread his contribution to the Dáil in October 1995 when he enthused about the unique opportunity to reverse the general perception of Irish refugee policy. He said we should use the unique opportunity by initiating an asylum policy which is sensitive and remarkable. Let us get our act together and introduce the amended 1996 Act and improve it, if necessary. We should use it as the model of best practice which can be advanced and sold to other EU member states rather than having immigration and asylum policy based on a series of conventions and resolutions that are not uniformly applied throughout the European Union and which are outside the control of the European Parliament, European Commission and the European Courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets down certain principles and procedures for deportation to comply with High Court judgments. On Committee Stage we will examine the provisions in detail to ensure that the safeguards are sufficient. We, on this side of the House, cannot support a Bill which, effectively, asks us to support the legalisation of deportation when there is not a fair, independent and transparent system in place to deal with asylum applications. In the absence of a proper, statutory based system, it is extremely difficult to support a Bill of this kind, and we will not do so. This is a case of putting the cart before the horse. We need a legislative base for dealing with asylum applications. We need those procedures dealt with in this House where they can be parsed, analysed and scrutinised and to be assured that we can be absolutely certain that the formula that will be put in place for dealing with asylum and refugee applications will be fair, independent and transparent, but we have an <i>ad hoc</i> system in place that does not comply with any of those basic requirements. Therefore, we, on this side of the House, will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6(2) lists the classes of non-nationals <Col N="280" /> who may be deported. Subsection (1) allows for the deportation of a person if, in the Minister's opinion, this would be conducive to the common good. Such an all embracing power is open to a variety of interpretations and because of that we would find it extremely difficult to support the Bill. The Bill must set out in specific detail the situations where it is envisaged the Minister would exercise the rather dramatic power of deciding what is in the common good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>More than two years ago the Refugee Act was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas with all-party support. The then justice spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Donoghue, said, it must be said that Ireland has remained in the Middle Ages with regard to the granting of asylum and the declaration of refugee status to people exiled from their countries of origin out of fear of persecution or discrimination of one form or another. He said we must also face the fact that the smug idea that the Irish are incapable of racist bias has been shored up by hugely prohibitive red tape in the processing of applications for refugee status here. He also said that persons displaced from their country of origin have often become subjects of an even more obstructive and debilitating syndrome while waiting in a haze of indecision as the powers that be decide whether to grant them refugee status. That was the sort of high sounding and principled verbiage we had come to expect from the Fianna Fáil spokesperson in Opposition. On entry into office no one could accuse the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, of creating a huge haze of indecision. His first decisive act was to announce that the new Refugee Act, which he had described as enlightened and the provisions of which would be of considerable assistance to asylum seekers and refugees, would not be brought into force. His second decisive act was to announce that asylum seekers, whose applications had been turned down in the absence of fair and independent statutory procedures, would be deported from this State. There was no indecision about that. The Refugee Act, which had all-party support in this House and was regarded as necessary legislation for Ireland in the circumstances in which we found ourselves, was not to be implemented; instead the Minister would make the decisions and those, whom he found unworthy to stay in the country for whatever reason and in the absence of any fair and statutory procedures, would be deported forthwith. The stated reason for not bringing the Act into effect was that the number of asylum seekers was so great that the newly created Office of Refugee Commissioner could not cope. His patently absurd solution to that problem was to retain the decision-making process in the very organisation which had created the backlog in the first place, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To implement his deportation policy, the Minister resorted to the Aliens Act, 1935, emergency <Col N="281" /> legislation introduced in the British Parliament immediately prior to the last war. It has long since been repealed and replaced in the United Kingdom, but its stark and draconian provisions have been considered by successive Irish Governments to be a more than adequate substitute for an open and transparent system of Irish law grounded on a thought out and publicly known immigration policy that would be the norm in any other developed state.</P>
    <P>Despite its title, this is not an immigration Bill. The Minister's attitude last night almost conceded that. It would not be recognised as an immigration Bill in any civilised country. Paragraph one of the explanatory memorandum makes crystal clear that its sole purpose is to provide powers, principles and procedures regarding the deportation of non-nationals. We do not have and never have had any clear policy on the entitlement of non-nationals to be admitted to this State.</P>
    <P>We will not have an immigration policy if this legislative measure is enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Should we legitimately or otherwise treat citizens of certain states more favourably than others? That question would normally be asked in any immigration regime. Should we decide what parts of the world should be looked on as favoured nations for their citizens to be afforded a special welcome to this country? Should we introduce an annual quota, as is the norm in many countries, given that Ireland has become prosperous and there is clear evidence that people want to live here? Should we open our borders in a way that can be decided by open debate, establish criteria and a quota system or introduce a points system based on educational criteria? Should we not assess skills shortages in the economy and identify criteria, as many employers are demanding and requiring, to welcome non-nationals with those skills to our country to continue to fuel that economy? What is our attitude to family reunion, the maintenance of extended families or the maintenance by workers of their dependants?</P>
    <P>These are the normal questions that would be posed and the normal criteria that would be included in a civilised immigration policy which could be openly debated by and decided on by the House and then applied, in an open and transparent way, to any non-national who sought to work or reside in this State. What we have instead is what purports to be an Immigration Bill, but which should be properly titled a &ldquo;Deportation Bill&rdquo;. The title of the Bill is a complete misnomer; it is an emergency Bill designed to replace an emergency Act which was struck down by the courts.</P>
    <P>We are often complacent about issues of this nature and close our eyes to need. There are social consequences and international responsibilities which result from a thriving economy. The Government must face those responsibilities, particularly &ndash; I am sorry he is not present &ndash; the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="282" /> who must live up to the high phrases and principles he enunciated when the Refugee Act, which languishes unimplemented, was enacted with the consent of all parties some years ago.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be seen by most people as applying to asylum seekers, largely because there is little proper recognition of the other forms of immigration which take place or the conditions which are imposed on non-nationals who lawfully enter the State. However, it is just as capable of applying to surgeons who work in major hospitals as to non-skilled people who arrive here to seek employment. Nonetheless, it is because of the recent increase in asylum applications that the lack of immigration policy and law has become more apparent as has the inevitability that the woeful inadequacies of the Aliens Act, 1935, would eventually be exposed.</P>
    <P>Everyone has anecdotal evidence relating to this issue. While travelling abroad I met one of our trade representatives &ndash; for his sake I will not name him or the country in which he is based &ndash; who wanted to bring a non-national, an Oriental, to Ireland. The individual in question is one of the richest business people in the Orient and he intended to site a company in Scotland, but he was persuaded by our trade representative to visit Ireland. It took the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform so long to organise the paperwork necessary to allow him to visit the country that he never arrived and the potential job investment he might have brought was never realised. Bluntly put, had he been an American or a Canadian he would have had no difficulty in obtaining access to this country. There are major questions to be asked about our attitude to the admittance of non-nationals even for visits, not to mention our introducing the type of progressive immigration policy which would be the norm required in any civilised society.</P>
    <P>The emergency with which the Bill deals arose from the Laurentiu <i>v</i>. Minister for Justice case which was heard on 22 January 1999. In that case, the High Court struck down section 5(1)(e) of the Aliens Act, 1935, which authorised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by order to make provision for the deportation and exclusion of &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;, either individually or by reference to membership of a particular class. The court held that this bare single sentence contained no statement of principle or policy by the Oireachtas to govern the Minister's power. Effectively, he was being empowered to make it up as he went along and this amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of the State to a member of the Government. We are the legislature, we determine the criteria and we set the law. That is why we have such a responsibility in that regard and why it is depressingly sad to see immigration legislation take the form of the Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The court's decision is not surprising and had been predicted by legal practitioners dealing with asylum applications for some time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> The Bill purports to cure the defect in the Aliens Act by ostensibly setting out the principles according to which a deportation order could be exercised. However, it fails to do so and retains some of the most offensive features of the 1935 Act. It sets out in section 3 a list of those capable of being deported; convicted criminals, persons to whom certain EU regulations apply and those who have their asylum applications transferred to another country under the Dublin Convention. Also included, under section 3(2)(g), are persons who have been refused by the Minister &ldquo;leave to land&rdquo;. This provision fails to recognise that there is not, in the Aliens Act or the Bill, any statement of principle or policy governing the Minister's power to refuse leave to land. It is clear from the criteria set out in the High Court judgment that this section is vulnerable to the same legal attack as happened in the January case.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a principle at paragraph (i) of the section that it should apply to any non-national whose deportation would, in the Minister's opinion, be &ldquo;conducive to the common good&rdquo;. Does the Minister really believe this is a sufficient statement of principle of policy or that it will satisfy the constitutional criteria that policy is determined by the Oireachtas? Does he believe he has the right to decide that an individual's exclusion from the State would be conducive to the common good? There are a number of people, some of them former Ministers, who, under those criteria, would be excluded permanently from the State. The Minister is the sole arbiter of the common good and not only asylum seekers but all immigrants in the State, whether lawfully or unlawfully present, remain here at his sole discretion.</P>
    <P>There are a number of glaring and fundamental gaps and defects in the Bill. It does not specify that a deportation order should not be made against an asylum seeker whose case has not yet been completed or considered. There is no reference to legal advice being made available to those seeking to make representations to the Minister against deportation within the 14 days available to them. If legal advice was given to an asylum seeker for the purpose of presenting his or her case for refugee status, would that also extend to the giving of advice on a proposed deportation order which might have been served in the interim?</P>
    <P>Under section 3, notice of a deportation order, once the Minister has made his decision on any representations, is to be served on an individual and, under subsection (9)(a), shall require him to present himself at such date, time and place as is specified for the purpose of being deported from the State. A minimum period is not specified between the time the notice is served and the time the deportee must present himself for deportation. It appears that notice could be served in the evening requiring the deportee to present himself for deportation the following morning. This is important given that section 5 <Col N="284" /> empowers an immigration officer or a garda who reasonably suspects that a person against whom a deportation has been made has failed to comply with the provision of an order or requirement of a notice of an order, to arrest that person without warrant. The person so arrested may then be placed immediately on a ship, train or aircraft about to leave the State and shall be deemed to be in lawful custody until that mode of transport has left.</P>
    <P>It could happen, therefore, that a person may be served with a notice to present himself for deportation in an evening. If he is not at the specified location he could be arrested, lawfully taken into custody and lawfully put on an aircraft and transported out of the State. Such a procedure would effectively deprive the deportee of the possibility of resorting to the courts to challenge the legality of what has been done. A similar provision relating to extradition was struck down by the Supreme Court in The State (Quinn) <i>v.</i> Ryan (1965) IR 70. To save this provision from, at the very least, constitutional challenge it must be amended to provide that a person shall not be deported following service of a deportation order without affording him a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right of access to the courts.</P>
    <P>The proposal to validate orders which are invalid in law is unacceptable to the Labour Party. The content of all aliens' orders which implement policy must be incorporated into the substantive provisions of the Bill. Section 2 is an unacceptable whitewash of illegality and deprives this House of the power to amend or review those provisions.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise with the Minister a very serious allegation made in an issue of <i>Magill</i> magazine under the heading &ldquo;A Spin too Far&rdquo;. The article referred to a statement issued on the Minister's behalf on 5 December claiming that the existing refugee application process had been endorsed by the UNHCR who had described it as a model. The article goes on to claim that this was a misquotation of what had been said by the High Commissioner's officials before the Dáil committee and that what in fact had been said was that if certain other matters were introduced and if certain promised measures were implemented then the Irish process could be a model for other countries. The article claims that the Minister's statement had almost led to a full blown row between the Minister and the UNHCR and that its spokeswoman in London remarked that its statements are often taken out of context and a formal retraction of the Minister's incorrect quotation may have been requested. I call on the Minister to tell the House if there is any substance in the <i>Magill </i>article and whether he will retract those reported remarks.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which goes to the heart of the State's seriousness in implementing international law. The State is obliged by Article 13 of the UN International Convention on Civil and Political Rights to afford certain basic procedural guarantees against deportation. We are fully <Col N="285" /> bound by this provision in international law. The same duty is imposed by Protocol 7 to the European Convention which we signed and which the White Paper on Foreign Policy committed us to ratifying. I demand that the Minister states unequivocally whether the Attorney General has confirmed that the Bill complies with this Article and Protocol. He should also indicate when the Protocol will be ratified. If he fails to provide that information the House will draw the necessary conclusions, which could have serious consequences for our international obligations.</P>
    <P>It is right and necessary to repeat some basic facts relating to the supposed refugee crisis in Ireland and the need for prompt and decisive action. We are not facing a tidal wave of asylum seekers as some have suggested. Some have fed on this, indeed one Government backbencher makes it a platform on which to develop his own political career. It is a dangerous strategy.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat the figures detailing the numbers coming into the country which Deputy Jim Higgins presented to the House last night. It is clear that the notion of a great tide of immigrants is not sustainable. Figures published in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday show that even at the record levels reached in 1998 the number of 4,500 asylum seekers is modest. It compares with the 60,000 applicants in the UK and almost 100,000 in Germany. Even on a <i>per capita</i> basis Ireland ranks only about eighth in the EU. It is a new phenomenon for us and we do not have a great base on which it is built.</P>
    <P>Given our troubled history in terms of emigration and the millions of Irish people who have fled this country largely for economic reasons to better themselves and look after their families, surely we especially should be expected to show some humanity to those who now seek refuge here? It is worth reminding the House that as recently as the turn of the decade there were approximately 100,000 illegals in the US. At that time repeated calls were made across party lines to the US authorities to treat our citizens in the US as sympathetically as possible. We exhorted special visas and lobbied consistently to ensure they would not be deported and be subject to exclusion from the US. Knowing County Kerry as I do there was probably more than one call from the office of the Minister dealing with constituents who were undocumented there. In general the US responded positively and well. Consider the social and economic problems that would have been created for this country had the US authorities applied the same hardline approach to Irish illegals as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is now applying to illegals in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Department appears to be mechanistic. It appears that asylum seekers are to be treated as figures in a ledger and not as human beings. They are fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters. The most poignant demonstration of that were the television pictures shown across the world of queues of people out<Col N="286" /> side the Department seeking interviews with officials. There would have been an outcry if Irish citizens in any part of the world were treated in that fashion. One could imagine the high dudgeon which would have been a feature of this House and how we would have regarded the authorities which treated Irish men and women in that way.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers are assessed only in terms of their potential cost to the country; their potential contribution is not put on the weighing scales. The newspapers are full of the social welfare and housing costs. We have taken deliberate measures to ensure that such costs are maximised by refusing to allow asylum seekers to have employment here while their situation is evaluated and their right of permanent residence is determined.</P>
    <P>The Minister has departed totally from the humane and considerate approach he advocated in Opposition. High principles were spouted and recorded in his contribution to the Refugee Act but, unfortunately, he has now swallowed the Department's line. It is time to rethink our national policy on asylum seekers, which seems to involve the deportation of the maximum numbers possible, regardless of the human consequences of those decisions. As a country with exceptional levels of economic growth and a recognisable and significant labour shortage in some sectors, it should be possible to have a sympathetic and humane policy for dealing with the numbers of people from abroad who, for whatever reason, seek asylum on our shores.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not an immigration Bill. It behoves the Minister to acknowledge the fact that a statement of immigration policy will be made by the Government, debated by this House and enshrined in a civilised law that properly mirrors a civilised people who want to facilitate non-nationals to reside among us in a structured and ordered way and who are willing to assimilate people from other countries into our society. It is time we moved beyond the closed door and closed eye attitude which has been the hallmark of official Irish policy to immigration and refugee issues and to, once and for all, bring ourselves into the realm of a civilised modern democracy.</P>

      <P>Bhí an eisimirce agus an inimirce mar chuid de stair na tíre seo le blianta. Leis na céadta bliana bhí an eisimirce againn mar nós &ndash; daoine ag dul thar lear ar son misinéireachta nó oideachais nó fiú amháin ar bhonn eacnamúil. Ach le blianta beaga anuas is í an inimirce a fheiceann muid sa tír seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is cuma an bhfuilimid ag caint faoin eisimirce nó an inimirce ba chóir dúinn dlíthe a chur i bhfeidhm a thabharfadh cosaint do dhaoine &ndash; cosaint chun a gcearta a choimeád &ndash; agus dlíthe <Col N="287" /> a chur i bhfeidhm ar son maitheasa na tíre freisin. Feicim go bhfuil an Bille seo ag dul sa treo sin ach níl sa Bhille ach cuid amháin den pholasaí nó den scéim atá ag teastáil agus sinn ag caint ar an ábhar seo.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to determine the principles and procedures on the deportation of non-nationals. I agree that it deals more with deportation than immigration, but that is just one aspect of the immigration issue. The powers to deport were vested in the Minister under the Aliens Act, 1935, which was introduced by de Valera to dismantle the Treaty and to determine our sovereignty as a nation. The power to deport to protect the interests of the people and the country is important for the sovereignty of the State. This was followed by our introduction of Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>In a judgment in the case of Laurentiu <i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ireland and the Attorney General, Mr. Justice Geoghegan found that a section of the Act was inconsistent with the Constitution. Specifically, it was inconsistent with Article 15.2 of the Constitution which provides that the sole and exclusive power of making laws is vested in the Oireachtas and that no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State. Mr. Justice Geoghegan in his judgment said:</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have a legislative power in relation to deportation unless some policy or principle on foot of which he is to act are set out in the parent Act. In my view the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann did not legislate for deportation. It merely permitted the Minister for Justice to legislate for deportation. There is no inherent reason why an Act of the Oireachtas cannot set out some policy matters at least in relation to deportation.</P>
    <P>This Bill does exactly that. Section 3 gives statutory power to the Minister to deport non-nationals in certain circumstances and it sets out the conditions and procedures under which that power is to operate. The judgment also found that the Minister was not entitled to confer on himself the power to deport. Mr. Justice Geoghegan said that &ldquo;the power to require an alien to leave and to remain thereafter out of the State, if a Minister deems it to be conducive to the public good, is not in any sense a purely regulatory or administrative matter&rdquo;. That power is conferred upon the Minister by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Orders of deportation can now be made in respect of persons, among others, who have served or are serving a term of imprisonment, who have been indicted or charged with any crime or offence, whose applications for asylum have been refused, who have not been allowed to land in the State and whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good. It is important to understand that persons are entitled to constitutional fairness <Col N="288" /> when putting in place procedures. The Constitution guarantees fair procedures.</P>
    <P>The two common law rules of natural justice, <i>audi alterem partem</i> and <i>nemo iudex in causa sua</i>, have been given a constitutional status and protection. Natural justice has been termed as constitutional justice by the Supreme Court. It has been determined that statutory regulations or agreements setting up machinery for taking decisions which may affect rights or impose liabilities should be construed as providing for fair procedures. This Bill affects the rights of non-nationals living in this country. However, section 3(3) ensures that persons against whom it is proposed to make a deportation order can have their case heard, that the <i>audi alterem partem</i> rule is being recognised and that they may make representations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the list of circumstances which the Minister can consider in determining whether to make a deportation order in relation to a person includes a range of personal and humanitarian considerations. As public representatives, we have met non-nationals who are appealing decisions for deportation. While conscious that the Minister has always taken personal circumstances into consideration when dealing with such appeals, I am glad these are specifically listed in the Bill. This means that rather than being the policy of an individual Minister, party or Government, it becomes State policy.</P>
    <P>We can all recall cases of families and children. This Bill will ensure their rights are heard and recognised. The Minister can give due regard to the circumstances when a case is made for families whose children have settled happily into schools in their area. A case can be made for the child who is receiving treatment for cancer as a result of Chernobyl to stay here with her parents. The Minister will have taken account of these considerations but now they are being given legislative status. Representations made by these people on their own behalf or by public representatives on their behalf will be guaranteed a hearing and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>In dealing with deportation, this Bill is focusing on the most negative aspect of our immigration policy and it needs to be seen in the context of other developments and proposed legislation for dealing with immigration in general, asylum seekers and refugees. I welcome the allocation of extra staff and resources to the section dealing with applications for asylum. It was appalling to see people queuing in the rain outside the Department. As a result of the individual attention given to each applicant and the speed with which his application is dealt with there are no further queues.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he would shortly bring forward legislation to enable the Refugee Act, 1996, to become operational, as well as legislation to outlaw the appalling crime of trafficking and a major Bill to replace the Aliens Act, 1935. This will ensure a modern, fair and just system. <Col N="289" /> It is in that overall context that I welcome this Immigration Bill and the fact that it sets out the humanitarian and personal considerations to be taken into account when seeking leave to appeal. We can show we have a recognised policy on immigration. I look forward to the further issues being debated in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Some months ago the world looked in horror at the story unfolding on television of a woman who died in the process of deportation from Belgium. Excessive force had been used against the woman seeking asylum and she died during the process. I hope we will never see such an incident again but it illustrates what can happen when deportation goes wrong, the procedures are not in place and due process and law are not adhered to. My worry about this Bill is that it is definitely putting the cart before the horse. It is not an immigration Bill but a deportation Bill. We should not enact a deportation Bill before we have a proper refugee Bill outlining policy on refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants. That policy must be fully in place before we build into our law a deportation policy.</P>
      <P>Many sections of this Bill are dangerous. The Bill has come about because of an emergency situation in the courts, which surprised no one. It shows all the marks of legislation that has been put together hastily. I am worried that it infringes civil liberties. This Bill should be checked against the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention against Torture. The exclusion orders are extremely dangerous and may be used inappropriately to deport asylum seekers. Section 5 presents a real possibility that detention centres could be established.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Hanafin's contribution where she highlighted the need for clarity on a range of issues, stating that the Bill is only a part of a much bigger story. The contention of the Fine Gael Party is that we should not move on to deal with this issue until we can put it in the proper context of clear Government policy. It is reasonable to ask what is Government policy on this issue, where it is heading, why the ambivalence and why it is afraid to state its policy on immigration and refugees. Why has the Act not been implemented? Why is there resistance to dealing with this issue, which every country has had to deal with and on which we, as a growing economy, can well afford to be generous? Why is there resistance to stating policy and outlining procedures in a clear way? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a piecemeal approach to the issue to introduce this Bill today. There seems to be conflict at Government level on certain issues, for example, the right to work. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, states one view whereas the Minister says something else. There has been no statement of Government policy on the issue and the question of a permit to work has not been dealt with in this legislation. If immigrants were allowed to work it would do much to avoid the stigmatis<Col N="290" /> ation, isolation, welfare dependency and lack of empowerment that many immigrants experience. That is the experience. It is not good enough that people feel so isolated and on the margins when they have been marginalised and put at risk in their own countries. Why do we allow them experience the same difficulties in this country when we have so many resources and should be able to put procedures in place to provide social services, information and legal advice? The Government appears to be completely divided on the question of permits, a matter which if tackled would make quite a difference.</P>
    <P>The lack of a statutory basis is a serious problem. Why not put a statutory instrument in place that would make our approach to this issue transparent? There is a real necessity for asylum applications to be clearly determined. We should put in place fair, independent appeal procedures in accordance with international law. Amnesty International has said that judicial review should be respected and extended to asylum seekers. It also makes the point that persons deported must have the right to re-enter the State to seek asylum should future difficulties occur in their country of origin. That is a reasonable point.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger that deportations could be carried out in a very unfair and even dangerous way. There are not enough effective procedures or safeguards in the Bill. Even when I read it first it struck me that many of the provisions were very loose and anything could be implied by them. If we proceed with this Bill in the absence of a broad policy, the very least we should expect is that it would be detailed and carefully drafted with no room for ambiguity or abuses of power. That is not the case. For example, there is no distinction between a minor offence or a major offence in section 3(2)(a). There is no provision for appeal in section 3(2)(b). The crime in many cases might be resisting arrest out of fear. There is no provision for appeal in section 3(2)(e) while section 3(2)(f) is very broad. It needs to specify that a person has a right to go through the entire process, but does not. This provision could be used to deport an individual before an appeal or application for humanitarian leave to remain has been heard. There is a reference to 14 days but this, at the very least, should be 14 working days. It is a short period when one considers that people may have language difficulties or are already isolated and may not have access to professional or legal help. These examples demonstrate how wide the provisions are.</P>
    <P>There should be a reference in section 3(6)(a) to the specific protection of minors and the conventions on the rights of the child as it is important. Many new offences are introduced in the Bill, including evading capture as a result of fear or trauma. &ldquo;Without reasonable cause&rdquo; should be added because the powers given to the Minister are very broad. We must be extremely careful about responding to an emergency that has arisen in the courts by introducing a Bill that <Col N="291" /> could lead to very serious abuses of human rights or the setting up of a range of procedures that are not the best to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Ireland has serious international obligations which must be met but the Bill does not meet them. I presented a paper on peacekeeping this week. I outlined the 82 conflicts currently raging around the world, which have put many people in untenable situations whereby they must leave their countries or are forced to do so. Given the scale of conflict around the world the number of people who come to Ireland is very small.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred already to our history of emigration and how we would wish our people to have been dealt with when they were in need. We must reflect on that and make efforts to put the right framework in place and introduce legislation which does not jeopardise the human rights of those already in an extremely vulnerable position. We must also put programmes in place to deal with integration and racism in our schools. There is a disturbing level of racism in schools and I am constantly horrified by the lack of information and understanding among young people when I visit them.</P>
    <P>Not long ago the British-Irish Agreement was signed. Respecting diversity was its key element. It applies in this area as much as it does to North-South relations and this Bill is a step in the wrong direction. I wish to share my time with Deputy Mitchell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing her time with me. I wish to raise concerns about the Bill. My primary concern is that it is not being taken in tandem with a co-ordinated effort to deal with the real issues facing immigrants and the racist and xenophobic tendencies of elements of our community. As chairman of the Oireachtas subcommittee on human rights I am very concerned and share the views of Amnesty International, which says that the Bill should be checked against the European Convention on Human Rights and the convention against torture. I want the House to examine the Bill in light of those conventions before these measures are rushed through.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has raised concerns about section 5 which presents a real possibility that detention and detention centres will be introduced. The view was expressed by one person, who received a loud round of applause, that this would be a good idea. I am ashamed to hear somebody make such a point. The role of judicial reviews should also be respected and extended to asylum seekers, as Amnesty International suggests. Ireland has had an almost entirely white population for as long as anyone can remember and our attitude to people of a different colour was to patronise them and pat them on the back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that has changed with the advent of the Celtic tiger. Ireland has become an attractive <Col N="292" /> destination for people. We used to send our people abroad because we could not afford to keep them here and we should remember that 800,000 people of Irish origin live in Great Britain alone. The Secretary-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs gave that statistic to the Committee of Public Accounts; I did not conjure it up. We should be the last to support racist or xenophobic tendencies, but, unfortunately, there is a reactionary element in our society which is somehow prejudiced against people, based on the colour of their skin.</P>
    <P>We have always prided ourselves, particularly in the Republic, on our tolerance of people's religious views and our tolerance generally. It was very easy to be tolerant when there were small Jewish, Protestant and Muslim communities. People do not know the religion of others when they are on the street and, therefore, do not feel challenged. However, suddenly people with different skin colour are on the street and some individuals think this is wrong, is a major challenge to us and must be stopped. That smacks of white supremacist thinking and it must be challenged by all right thinking people. I have tabled a motion calling on the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister or Minister of State who would have a co-ordinating role on immigrant issues.</P>
    <P>I was Minister of State at the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach and I had a co-ordinating role in some of my duties. I called in representatives of various Departments to discuss the preparations for the Irish Presidency of the EU or local development issues, for example. No Minister deals with immigrant issues. They are dealt with simply from what used to be called &ldquo;an alien's point of view&rdquo; or the Department of Justice immigrant visa point of view. I am glad this wording has been dropped in the Bill. Immigrant issues need to be thought of in terms of housing, the needs of the indigenous population and immigrants, social welfare, health, and tackling racism and xenophobia in the community.</P>
    <P>Because racism and xenophobia present a particular problem in the city, I have made a suggestion, which I understand is being acted upon, that the Lord Mayor of Dublin &ndash; the Acting Chairman and I are former holders of that office &ndash; should bring together the various churches and religious bodies, including the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and in particular the Jewish and Muslim communities, with the health board and other State agencies to devise a proactive local plan to cater for the needs of immigrants and integrate them in local communities. I have seen a woman spit on another because of the colour of her skin. I have been asked in the street what is being done to stop coloured people coming into the country. This view, which is based on a fear of the unknown, should be challenged and those who hold it should be educated to think otherwise. This should be done soon because I am fearful of a rise in violence on the part of those who are ignorant of the facts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> There are many jobs available in the city and throughout the country. There are immigrants with the required skills. They should be allowed to retain their dignity and to take up those jobs so that they do not have to sell <i>The Big Issues</i>.</P>
    <P>On Good Friday 1998 I attended a service in St. Patrick's Cathedral. The preacher, whose name I cannot recall, was an Irish citizen and black. She indicated that drunks would pat her on the head as if she was a strange being from outer space. There is a need for proposals to ensure the extremes of racism, xenophobia and patronising attitudes are tackled. They should be discussed with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure of the Government to deal with the issue of immigration, asylum seekers and refugees in a just and humane manner is demonstrated by the circumstances in which the Bill has been rushed before the Dáil. The Government appears more anxious that its proposed deportation of asylum seekers should proceed than that a proper system of assessment, a fair hearing and fair living and working conditions for those seeking asylum be put in place speedily.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced yesterday that the Government intends to introduce three Bills to deal with the issue, the first of which is an amending Bill to allow implementation of the 1996 Refugee Act. The failure to implement the Act compounds the unacceptable situation in which so many asylum seekers find themselves. We learned from the Minister's announcement that this will be allowed to continue while we await the amending Bill, proposals for which will not reach the Government until Easter. The second Bill relates to trafficking in illegal immigrants, while the third and most significant will provide for a fundamental overhaul of existing immigration legislation.</P>
      <P>Why has it taken the Government more than 18 months to begin the task of implementing the Refugee Act, 1996? Why is this Bill being taken prior to its implementation and the introduction of the substantial new legislation on immigration which, in the list of promised legislation, is not due for publication until late this year? The Government has its priorities wrong. The Minister's statement about the vast majority of asylum seekers not being genuine refugees prejudged thousands and added to the public perception, fostered by irresponsible elements in the media, of tides of immigrants threatening the integrity of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is not racist but its harsh attitude to asylum seekers and its refusal to implement the Refugee Act have sent the wrong signals to those in society who are all too eager to foster and exploit xenophobia. It is time the Government put a human face on the issue. The Taoiseach has a personal concern which I witnessed when I accompanied a delegation from the County Monaghan Roma Support Group to meet him on 23 December. The Roma community of <Col N="294" /> 47 living in Castleblayney has been in fear of deportation for several months and could be expelled under the provisions of this Bill. The support group stated in its appeal:</P>
    <P>The Roma people have been well received in County Monaghan. The establishment of the Support Group, with representatives throughout the County, was a manifestation of this. None of our group have worked in any lobbying or organising capacity before. We are simply concerned individuals. Our primary concern is the dignity of the people whom we believe should be granted the right to stay in our country and be welcomed as fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>Most of the men in the Roma community have trades but our current laws prevent them from working. We have found them to be an industrious people and they are frustrated at not being able to earn a living, contrary to the falsehoods about these and other asylum-seekers being only interested in &ldquo;sponging&rdquo; on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The anxiety at the prospect of the failure of appeal and immediate deportation is not confined to the Roma community. Those who have welcomed them here dread the prospect. So also do individual members of the Garda Síochána who have got to know the group and who have spoken to us of their concerns. It would be their task to enforce deportation orders.</P>
    <P>The County Monaghan Roma Support Group appeals to the Taoiseach to take on board the reality of the refugee situation. The Roma children especially deserve a decent future free of the persecution which their parents and grandparents have had to endure. We urge the Taoiseach's humanitarian intervention if the appeals fail.</P>
    <P>We urge also a fundamental change in current refugee policy. A harsh and restrictive policy is being implemented and is causing distress to the relatively small number of refugees in our country. At the very least the Refugee Act should be implemented in full and the ban on work and study by asylum-seekers should be lifted. We need a more open system which welcomes people to our shores, bringing with them skills to add to our workforce and culture to add to our diversity.</P>
    <P>If the Government had acceded to the proposal for an amnesty for those seeking asylum before the full implementation of the Refugee Act, it would have created a new atmosphere. That would have been the correct approach to set the scene for new legislation and a new dispensation for all immigrants seeking asylum. The Government has set its face against calls for the right to work and study to be given to asylum seekers. This is a very reasonable demand which would ease the financial and social burden on asylum seekers. It would allow many, including highly qualified and diligent people, to contribute to our economy and to come off social welfare. The <Col N="295" /> right to work and study would form a key part of a charter of rights for asylum seekers which should be introduced. The right to prompt and fair determination procedures is also vital, as are full language rights for asylum seekers so they can fully understand their position at every stage of the asylum application procedure.</P>
    <P>The body responsible for deciding on asylum claims must be independent and must have expertise in refugee law. There must be a right to appeal to an independent body. There needs to be access to independent and adequately State funded legal advice. There is also a need for the Minister for Education and Science to initiate a comprehensive anti-racism programme in our schools and for the Government to undertake a full examination of measures which can be introduced across a range of Departments to combat racism in our society and to promote support for cultural diversity and human rights.</P>
    <P>Instead of such just and reasonable measures we have this Bill which should more properly be called a deportation Bill rather than an immigration Bill. It does not deal with immigration and asylum issues but lays down the conditions and mechanisms for the expulsion of people from this State.</P>
    <P>There are many concerns about the details of the legislation which reflect the sweeping powers of the Minister. These would be more properly dealt with on Committee Stage. However, even if we were satisfied that this Bill safeguarded rights and was perfect in every detail, I would have to advise that I would not be prepared to support it now in circumstances where the Government is not implementing the Refugee Act and has advanced this deportation Bill before other legislation on immigration and asylum, of which it should properly form a part.</P>

      <P>No, Deputy Higgins feels I should take my time, and I am happy to do so. This morning on the Order of Business I contrasted the unseemly haste with which we are introducing this deportation Bill with the foot dragging as regards the Human Rights' Commission Bill, which is part of the British-Irish Agreement. This says a great deal about our mental attitude. We are placing suppression of human rights above the extension of human rights, which is what a modern society should be about. The Act which we are replacing, the Aliens Act, 1935, was draconian and was based on Acts of 1904 and 1914. The 1935 Act was based on paranoia about Jews. We know from various documentaries, and the Chair knows personally, that there was a harsh attitude towards immigrants, particularly in <Col N="296" /> the Department of Justice. Has that attitude changed?</P>
      <P>As the previous speaker said, we are not referring to direct racism; we are talking about a mental attitude. I know from my dealings with asylum seekers that they are aware of a draconian attitude in the Department and do not feel they are being dealt with as equals. This Bill strips people of dignity, treats them as lesser beings, unequals, as a problem and a burden on the State. We deal with them in a harsh, clinical and bureaucratic manner. That is not the way to deal with human beings.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have also seen a change of attitude in Fianna Fáil, with the famous statements of Deputy O'Donoghue who supported the Refugee Act which were suddenly and conveniently put to one side when in Government. This is Government by focus group where we go out onto the streets and listen to people's views. We know there are racist attitudes. However, do we bow to that or do we stand up and say that is not the way we want to proceed and is not what good Government is about?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gay Mitchell said, we have come across these attitudes, which are often based on ignorance and fear, at our clinics. People ask why refugees get houses while they are on the housing list. It is important we correct those misconceptions immediately. I fear we will see the rise of the right throughout Europe because of the &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; mentality. Last weekend an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> referred to the decline of the Green vote in Hessen, Germany. The reason for this is that the Christian Democrats, a conservative party in Germany, mounted a campaign on the question of citizenship for immigrants, particularly the Turkish community. My party has always said they should be afforded citizenship rights, even dual citizenship. The Greens were punished for what was seen as a far too liberal attitude. I am proud of its stance because it is principled. When we discuss immigration, that is what we ought to talk about.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have dropped the title of the Aliens Act, which is like something out of &ldquo;The X Files&rdquo; where we see these people as from another planet. These people are human beings and deserve to be treated in that way. I agree with Deputy Mitchell that we need a proper immigration Bill to deal with the needs of immigrants and the question of assimilation, not to deal with them in a manner which ghettoises them, which is what is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we embrace the concept of cultural diversity, it will enhance and strengthen our society and not weaken it. There is a short-sighted attitude which does not take account of how much more advanced we would be as a society if we took on a better attitude, as has happened in countries such as Canada, where all the procedures to give people a fair hearing are in place. This was provided for in the Refugee Act, which unfortunately has been rejected. That is why this Immigration Bill is premature. We do not have the proper pro<Col N="297" /> cedures in place and we are introducing legislation to speed up deportation. We must also look at the right to work, although I know this was not part of the Refugee Act. However, if the Refugee Act was implemented, we could then look at the right to work, which has been also called for by the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the Bill. As has been said by previous speakers, there are major flaws in the Bill. Deputy Frances Fitzgerald was right when she said that section 3(1) is far too broad and indefinite. The phrase &ldquo;and to remain thereafter out of the State&rdquo; should be deleted. It does not allow for future views, revocation or a challenge to the order, which is very important. There is no provision in section 3(1)(e) for appeal against <i>refoulement</i>. This needs to be looked at. I hope the Opposition will agree that section 5(4)(b)(iii) should be deleted, given that it could lead to indefinite detention. I am aware of this from experience, having dealt with people who are appealing these orders. I know people who, if they return to their own country, will be tortured. They have been tortured previously. Yet if they appeal here they could be detained and imprisoned. That is untenable from a humanitarian point of view and I hope the Minister will reconsider that section and remove it. I do not wish to labour points already made by previous speakers but there are sections which I hope to amend on Committee Stage and I will be tabling amendments. I hope the Government will see fit to accept some of these amendments which are based on commonsense. Having heard the arguments from the Opposition I ask the Government to look again at the Refugee Act and implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the powers, principles and procedures under which the State can deport non-nationals. The State must have these powers. The necessity for this legislation arises from the recent High Court decision. Were the State to legislate otherwise it would be ridiculous. What is being done is totally justified and correct and is linked to the immigration debate. In his contribution Deputy Higgins talked about the Government's tardiness. The Refugee Act, 1996, was designed for an era when only a few people sought refugee status. Things have moved on since then. There are greater numbers arriving now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government assumed office 20 months ago there was a huge backlog of applications and elaborate procedures but practically no staff to deal with them. It is fine to speak about the Refugee Act but all these matters must be governed and influenced by reality. If there are 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 applications in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, measures have to be taken to deal with the backlog. I congratulate the Minister and the Department officials on making progress with them. While progress may be slow and the procedures are still way behind, nevertheless some <Col N="298" /> progress has been made. During the tenure of the previous Government whether because of a row between two Ministers or between a Minister and a Minister of State, nothing seemed to happen except that new applications continued to arrive and were put in the basket waiting to be dealt with. This created a problem. People have been unfair to the Minister and the Department who are trying to get things back to normal.</P>
    <P>Politicians and people who write letters to newspaper editors have made some fine speeches on this issue. Some fine speeches have been made on this issue today and on other occasions by politicians from rural constituencies or who represent nice middle-class areas in Dublin who have a theoretical ideological view of this matter. The language is beautiful.</P>

      <P>Yes, and other places. I am referring to politicians and letter writers to <i>The Irish Times </i>and so on. I agree with Deputy Gormley that politicians have to give leadership. We have to stand up to those who are wrong and who are trying to drive people against one another. That is our role but as well as having the theoretically correct humanitarian view of issues we have to look at the reality. Often these fine speeches and letters come from people who do not know what they are talking about. They have a purely theoretical view. Perhaps the problem is that we have mishandled the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the refugees and asylum seekers, whether for good or bad, have been put into specific parts of Dublin and certain constituencies. That is wrong and leads to difficulties and to people feeling threatened in regard to houses, jobs and so on. We have created the breeding ground for misinformation and uneducated views. It is our job to avoid that. We should not let everybody in and then have a problem about where to put them, whether on the North Circular Road or the South Circular Road. They are not being sent to Blackrock or Dún Laoghaire. Fancy letters can be written by people who read papers or books about asylum seekers who do not know the reality and are not in touch with those who live in the community who, wrongly, feel threatened by them. As Deputy Gormely said, it is fine that we should give leadership and that we are trying to do. However, it is hard to do that in some parts of the city which have a high proportion of asylum seekers. That is a difficulty we have to face up to. We are supposed to represent the view outside as well as try to preach the right gospel outside. Too often we wake up to issues when it is too late, perhaps when a couple of Deputies have been elected by some extreme group or other. We then wake up and realise there is a problem or a perceived problem in certain constituencies or parts of constituencies in Dublin. To deny that is nonsensical. Some of us know what we are talking about and represent constituencies or parts of <Col N="299" /> constituencies which have a problem. I am not an expert on where Deputy Gormley's votes come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving the Deputy the honour of knowing I was listening to him. Given that I do not have a prepared speech, I am reacting to the remarks of the previous speaker. I have examined this situation over the past couple of years. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been trying to put a procedure in place which would process these cases as they arrive and permit entry to genuine refugees fleeing from persecution. However, it also needs a system which will give it the right to deport people who do not gain entry in accordance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>Various people are becoming involved in this issue, particularly business interests who talk about the Celtic tiger and the need for cheap labour. They say asylum seekers should be allowed to work. That line is spun by different sectors. By all means let them work after six months but, ideally, decisions on their applications should be made long before six months elapse. If the Department were up to date, asylum seekers would not have to wait six months. Other people claim that asylum seekers are allowed to work after six months in Germany, France and other countries. That is because they get a decision on their applications. Only an odd few cases are still being appealed or processed. Generally, the procedures in these countries are much quicker.</P>
      <P>I complimented the Department a few minutes ago but it must be acknowledged that the process for dealing with asylum seekers has a long way to go. It is unfair to everybody, certainly to the applicant, to allow the process to be dragged on for three or four years. It is almost impossible, even ridiculous, to try to deport somebody after that length of time. The system should be capable of giving the applicant a decision within two or three months. If that were the case, asylum seekers could work after six months because in the vast majority of cases they would be legal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am nervous about this issue when I look at it from another perspective. Business people see refugees as a cheap labour resource but there are still 200,000 people on the dole. They are not spread throughout the city. A shortage of employees in certain constituencies on the southside of Dublin does not mean there are not any unemployed people. I am concerned about the unemployed in my constituency who are now <Col N="300" /> being written off by politicians and business groups. They claim the economy has done well, that there is a shortage of labour in Dún Laoghaire or Blackrock where, because it costs £120 to have a child looked after, nobody is available to work at any type of job. Suddenly, according to this argument, there is nobody on the dole, jobs are available and they must be given to anybody and everybody, including asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that some of my constituents are being written off and are not considered suitable for work or retraining. It is true that the more we take off the register of the unemployed, the more training and retraining the remaining unemployed need. They have been unemployed for longer. I am concerned that some lobby groups are not particularly interested in the humanitarian aspects of the refugee issue but are jumping on the bandwagon and supporting refugee lobby groups for quite different reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will introduce changes to the Refugee Act which will reflect the reality of recent years. However, we must be careful. There is a danger of certain people stirring up race hatred. We are feeding that danger and helping to create its breeding ground by directing asylum seekers into certain areas of the city. A Member said earlier that it is necessary to re-think our immigration and asylum policy. That is fine but we must try to allocate or disperse asylum seekers throughout the country. Everybody should share the problem or the experience, whatever one wishes to call it; they might be wiser when speaking in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>I attended a briefing by the health board recently on the number of rent allowance recipients in the different districts in Dublin. The figure for Dún Laoghaire-Blackrock was about 22. The figures for the north and south inner city were over 600 in each case while the figure for Howth was 35. There is no distribution. There are not many Deputies from rural constituencies at this debate but a decision must be made to allocate these cases to areas such as Limerick, Dún Laoghaire and Athlone as well as to Dublin. Perhaps the asylum seekers wish to stay together like the Irish in Boston but there is a danger in that policy.</P>
    <P>Too many people speak about this issue from the theoretical point of view without having encountered this problem or experience &ndash; the choice of word will depend on whether one wishes to speak in positive or negative tones. A new policy is needed. The Department's officials must accelerate the process and give quicker decisions to asylum seekers&mdash;</P>

I referred to the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; or the &ldquo;experience&rdquo;&ndash; positive or negative terms.</P>
      <P>It can be a positive issue if it is dealt with in the proper way by working on multiculturalism and diversity. However, if it is left going in the present direction it could have a negative effect on people who live in specific areas. We are making mistakes in our current policies by creating breeding grounds for people to incite race hatred. We should not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he will introduce the legislation. I am asking officials in the Department to accelerate the processing procedure to ensure that applicants will be given quicker decisions. Those who are allowed to stay should be made welcome and there should be a positive programme to involve them in all aspects of Irish life. It is unfair and wrong to allow anybody to drift aimlessly for a few years waiting for a decision on asylum.</P>
      <P>Members on the other side of the House were in Government when this problem started. They allowed the process to get into the current mess. In recent years officials have been trying to work through the huge backlog. However, we woke up after the row between the then Minister and the then Minister of State, Deputy Owen and Deputy Burton. They could not agree on procedures because of their different ideological points of view.</P>
      <P>The Department is making progress. It is true it is still trying to catch up and that the Refugee Act must be amended. However, these matters must be influenced by reality. Every aspect of the issue must be examined. By all means, make people welcome when they come to the country but we ought to be able to allocate or encourage them to different areas. The experience, or whatever term Deputy Gormley wishes to use, should be dispersed and allocated to different towns and to different parts of Dublin.</P>
      <P>We are making huge mistakes. We are creating a breeding ground for uneducated troublemakers, not represented in this House. Now is the time to take action, not when three or four of them are in here in a few years' time having started a bandwagon by feeding on the fears of others, many of whom we are at present trying to educate properly. I look forward to the Minister's amending legislation to the Refugee Act when there will be another opportunity to talk about this subject in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking people to acquaint themselves with the realities. I am not leading any bandwagon <Col N="302" /> outside this House but I am doing my best to explain the realities of life for the people who come to me with their concerns. All of us should be aware that there is more to this than flowery ideological and theoretical speeches.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b>&mdash;in what I consider to be an incredible contribution to which I will return later.</P>
      <P>This is not an immigration Bill but a deportation Bill. It does not seek to create a society where people with different talents and abilities can be received from various countries, welcomed into Irish society and given an opportunity to contribute in the same way millions of our people over generations contributed to countries throughout the world. If it merited the term &ldquo;immigration Bill&rdquo; that is what it would contain, but the Bill simply provides for provisions to kick people out. That is entirely in keeping with the attitude and actions of this Government since it came into office in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister to do anything he wants in regard to people seeking asylum or seeking to remain in this country. Under section 3(1)(i), an order can be made against a person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good. What does that mean? Who determines the common good in this instance? It is the Minister or his officials. We certainly cannot trust this Administration to have an impartial approach on this question nor can we trust the Minister to make judgments in relation to the common good that we could be confident would not be prejudiced by the attitudes of the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that on more than one occasion in this House both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State have said that most of the few thousand applicants for asylum are not genuine refugees but illegal immigrants. Those statements were made before the cases of these people were heard. If Ministers made statements like that in regard to people who were pleading innocent before the courts in a criminal case it would collapse immediately by virtue of prejudice, yet those statements were made in regard to people seeking asylum from the Irish nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other measures that are indefensible. Section 3(2)(a) states that a deportation order can be made against a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State, as if those serving terms of imprisonment would be guilty of <Col N="303" /> heinous crimes. What about people who fought for democratic or trade union rights in the country from which they fled and who, as members of a movement here, might engage in peaceful civil disobedience? Those people may find themselves in prison for a number of days as part of their protest. The Bill gives an indiscriminate right to the Minister to throw such people out of the country, and that is typical of the way the Bill is phrased.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not even correct the term &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; in the 1935 Aliens Act by amending the entire Act, which is illustrative of how far this Bill is designed to go. The term &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; is offensive in the extreme. It is the term used by the minority in our society, and the minority of politicians who have xenophobic and even racist attitudes in this regard. An atmosphere is conjured up by the term &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; as if these were people from outer space, alien to humanity and to those who already live in this country.</P>
    <P>Some pillars of the establishment in this society have played a shameful role over recent years. Some of the most powerful and widely distributed newspapers have played a shameful role also in the way they have dealt with the whole question of refugees and asylum seekers. If there were proper legislation to protect minorities, the authors of some of the headlines that appeared in sections of the mass circulation press would find themselves in trouble as a result of the hate they sought to incite and the discriminatory way in which they targeted minorities and tarred an entire community with the sins of a few. Shamefully, a minority of politicians of the right have followed suit.</P>
    <P>When we view the history of our own people, going back generations, the attitude being adopted by this Administration is shameful. If any country should feel obliged to treat the people who come here seeking shelter with care and compassion it is this country, when our people found shelter abroad from persecution and harsh economic circumstances at home. The Minister, the Minister of State and leading representatives of the Government have short memories in that regard. It is less than ten years since politicians from the main parties scurried back and forth across the Atlantic to the United States Administration seeking permission for approximately 100,000 young people living illegally in New York, Boston, Chicago and elsewhere to remain in the United States and be given work permits. There was no place for these people at home, not because of political persecution but because of the economic deprivation that drove them abroad in search of a better life. In the present context we are talking about 5,000 applicants for asylum in our society. Any major city in Germany would be home to far more Irish citizens than the entire number of refugee and asylum applicants in this State, but the Government, along with the reactionary newspapers, has <Col N="304" /> allowed this to be termed a crisis which merits appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The past two years have been a sad reflection on the Government's record in dealing with asylum seekers. It is shameful that no independent procedures are in place. The procedures which are in place are part and parcel of the one Department with one Minister in charge. That is neither fair nor transparent. At the very least there should be independent procedures and legal aid separate from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for anyone seeking asylum. That has not been granted and the Government does not intend to grant that.</P>
    <P>People are being issued with deportation orders to send them back to authoritarian regimes from which they fled. The Minister might not listen to me, but he might listen to a prominent member of the Government's coalition partner. I refer to Deputy O'Malley who spoke several months ago about the shameful way people disembarking at Shannon were treated in the past, including under Governments in which he participated. He said that people were bundled back onto aeroplanes from which they sought to flee to seek asylum. Deputy O'Malley had no doubt some of those people faced death in their own countries, yet we have a Minister who attempts to send people back to authoritarian regimes from which they fled. That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>Ten minutes ago Deputy Noel Ahern made what can only be regarded as a shameful intervention. It was outrageous. He stood up and fuelled the fires of prejudice and gave justification to the hatred and racism that emanates from a very small section of our society. It was incredible. The Deputy said he had not prepared a speech. He would be well advised not to come into the Dáil in future without a prepared speech.</P>
    <P>He spoke about distributing people around the country, sending so many to Dublin, so many to Limerick and so many to Galway. If a politician stood up in the British Houses of Parliament and said there are too many Irish concentrated in Camden Town and Cricklewood, and suggested that they should distribute themselves around the country, as far as the Orkney Islands, what would the outrage in this country be like? It would be justifiably huge. Yet a Member of the Government party makes such a statement here.</P>
    <P>He then mentioned unemployment, hinting that somehow jobs for Irish people are put at risk because of those seeking asylum. That is a typical tactic of the bigot. Deputy Ahern represents a constituency with many problems, perhaps the most tragic being the crisis of heroin addiction in the deprived inner city communities. Those problems were not created by asylum seekers. They were created by decades of neglect &ndash; shameful economic and social neglect &ndash; by Governments in which his party played a major role, yet we now see a sly, sneaky attempt to brand them as the responsibility of 5,000 unfortunate people who have no right to work in this country, but who are seeking shelter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> Similarly, there were hints about housing. It was insinuated that houses are being taken from those without homes or on the housing lists by people seeking asylum. That is not just a lie, but a disgracefully prejudiced statement. We have a major housing crisis. Who caused it? It was not those seeking asylum, it was caused by a cabal of the most powerful people in this country &ndash; speculators, land owners, big builders and developers &ndash; who conspired to put a home out of the reach of ordinary people by racketeering and profiteering. Nevertheless, a member of the Government comes in here and trots out the common phrases of racists and bigots. It is shameful. I hope the Minister of State will carpet the Member who said such things.</P>
    <P>We need a humanitarian and compassionate approach to this matter. In my constituency the Costinas family were taken from their beds at the crack of dawn a few months ago, given half an hour to pick up their belongings from their very well kept rented home, a home in which they lived since they came here five years ago, dragged off to the cells in Store Street Garda station and threatened that they would be put on a plane a few hours later. Happily, they were saved by the bungling methods used to notify their counsel of this. Also, there was a revolt among a broad spectrum of Irish society against that type of brutality, which is all it can be called. I hope that matter will be satisfactorily resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect to be urging the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to delay implementation of a Bill, but in this case it would be totally inappropriate to bring in this Immigration Bill in the absence of the implementation of the Refugee Act. There is no indication that that Act will be in place for this Bill, which is moving fairly swiftly and seems to be a priority. This Bill should not be in place in its current form, nor, if amended, should it be used in the absence of a properly implemented Refugee Act that would give people a fair and independent system they do not now have and which they will not have without the proper implementation of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of this Bill which do no justice to us as a caring community and with which I disagree. We do not have a clear, transparent and independent system in place, and many aspects of the current system have been <Col N="306" /> criticised by Members and outside bodies. There is no doubt that many people have been sent out of this country without fair procedure applying in their cases. Figures that Amnesty International has given me suggest that approximately 90 per cent of people are refused asylum in the first instance and do not even have the benefit of procedures available at the moment. Legal representation and translation services have not been properly addressed either, and in that atmosphere people should not be sent out of the State under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I have a problem with section 3, which is unacceptable in its present form. For example it states that people will be ordered to remain thereafter out of the State, with no limit on the length of time they must remain out of the State. Other parts of section 3 have been referred to also, such as the provision that enables the Minister to deport a person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good. Again, such a sweeping phrase could lead to people being deported without a proper hearing or any other opportunity to have their case heard.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we are somehow inundated with asylum seekers is clearly not true. Approximately one in 100 asylum seekers in Europe seek asylum here. It is a situation we should be able to deal with in a fair and equitable way. If properly implemented, the Refugee Act would set out fair and equitable ways of dealing with this. I ask the Minister not to bring in this legislation until we have proper procedures in place to deal with those seeking asylum here.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers said, we have sent people out on the highways and byways of the world from this country to look for work, opportunities and homes. By and large they have been welcomed in various parts of the world where they have thrived. It is not asking very much to adopt a similar attitude here for those who come to Ireland, particularly those who are in danger and who are fearful of returning to their country of origin. We do not need the kind of attitude Deputy Noel Ahern displayed, but a humane attitude that deals with those who come to this country as people and not as numbers to be scattered around the country with no thought given to their contacts and commitment. The suggestion that they can be treated as numbers and that there is a certain quota that the State as a whole and various areas within the State should deal with is unacceptable if we want to call ours a humane society. I reject that completely.</P>
    <P>The right to work should be considered, particularly in light of the indication by members of the Government that there should be a limited right to work for refugees. That could have been looked at in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to bring forward broader legislation dealing with this issue later this year, though I must question whether it will come forward before the end of the year as <Col N="307" /> other legislation has not been issued by that Department in the time intended. The equal status legislation, which we are still awaiting, would clearly have implications for this Bill and for refugees in general. I would welcome a broad debate, however, as indicated by the Minister, with a convention like the education convention held in Dublin Castle. One could have an intelligent, concerned and caring debate on the issue rather than having the scare stories, racist remarks and narrow debate of the recent past. We should have a broad debate on intercultural relationships, integration and other issues. I hope this comes in the timeframe suggested by the Minister, as this debate is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's removal of the word &ldquo;alien&rdquo; from the Bill's title, though it is used in the Bill itself. It is a totally unacceptable concept. The Minister defined it yesterday as &ldquo;elseness&rdquo;, but that is equally unacceptable. It suggests that people who look for refugee status are somehow different from those who live here. We need a proper debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>We must provide proper procedures, and this Bill does not seem to do so, particularly for those who are refused asylum at the beginning of the process. There should at least be a right to appeal for every applicant. Those who are sent back under the Dublin Convention do not appear to have a right to appeal, and the Minister should clarify this. If that is the case, it is unfair that those who apply may be sent back inappropriately without that right. They are not getting a fair hearing, and under human rights conventions people are entitled to have their cases dealt with fairly and properly. Aspects of the Bill are very vague in this regard and need to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Howlin's statement that this Bill does not deal adequately with the problems of those who come to this country seeking asylum, work or a home. This Bill does not give them the kind of fair and impartial hearing to which they are entitled, and I am therefore deeply dissatisfied with the legislation. The first priority must be implementation of the Refugee Act. If it needs to be amended, as has been indicated, let us amend and implement it quickly by all means, but let us do so before legislation such as this is implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the Title of this Bill my heart jumped in anticipation. I thought we were beginning to look at the difficulties and delays in the treatment of people coming here, whether as asylum seekers in fear of their lives, having fled from political or physical dangers in their own countries, or skilled people who should be allowed, having regard to freedom of movement, to settle here, apply for work visas, and contribute to creating a multi-cultural society in this country, which is expanding not only financially but also, we hope, geographically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thought the Bill might begin to give to people who have come or who wish to come here <Col N="308" /> what the Irish &ndash; as huddled masses of sick, desperate people &ndash; sought and later, as our confidence grew, demanded from other countries. We are in a unique position in that no other country has experienced until recently such mass emigration and dispersal of its people, usually in the most appalling conditions. Had the Irish not been given the right to live in other countries, they would have died from poverty and disease. We should have an inbuilt sense of the way our predecessors were received when they went abroad, the discrimination they suffered in most of the countries to which they emigrated. Within living memory in the USA, Australia, and Britain, places of accommodation and work displayed notices like &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Irish or Dogs Allowed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As legislators in a country with growing confidence and a growing economy, I would like to think that we will never forget that. We owe it to the people seeking asylum to live, work, and contribute here, to show them the respect not shown to the Irish when they went abroad. Ireland above all other countries should have a greater recognition of its obligations to these people. We have been there and we should remember what it was like. It would be an acknowledgement of the terrible experience of our ancestors and relatives. If we forget that when dealing with people seeking solace and security here, who may also be able to work, we will be selling out on our people who went abroad and sent back part of their wages to enable the rest of us to become the nation we are today. It is alarming that we should have forgotten this so quickly.</P>
    <P>Emigrants who left in the second half of the 19th century suffered more discrimination and lived in worse conditions than later emigrants. However, things did not get much better and emigrants in the 1980s suffered great insecurities, even in the skilled jobs which our economy was not able to provide at that time. All of us know the fears of our recent illegal emigrants, who worked but could not register for social security, who could not get accommodation under their own names, and who could not get full pay for their work because they could not argue with employers who were exploiting their illegal status and inability to take advantage of employment legislation.</P>
    <P>It is therefore all the more unbelievable and depressing that, in the face of the first indication that we might be able to share responsibility with countries who shouldered it in the past because they were better off, we have closed doors, shut gates, deported people or not allowed them to land on the welcome soil of Ireland without allowing them to make a case, get representation and receive a humane, compassionate hearing which should be theirs regardless of their status. The way we have dealt with this matter has been lamentable and embarrassing &ndash; I was going to call it &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo;, which is the usual term, but it is really crisis mismanagement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I share the disappointment of other Deputies that, in introducing this Bill to close a gap which our courts have made glaringly obvious, time has not been taken to put it into context and into the central position it should occupy. We should not look at it solely from our point of view, in terms of defending our territory and rights &ndash; we must put ourselves in the shoes of those coming here, if they have shoes. Let us look at it from their point of view, particularly with regard to our folk memories of the treatment and experiences of the Irish.</P>
    <P>We also have a great opportunity to look at the experiences of people who have come here and found us wanting at all levels, and to consider the recommendations of Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council. Deputy Noel Ahern depressed everyone who heard him today; he seems to think no one is implicated in this problem and as legislators we have no responsibility to do anything other than answer the needs, problems, fears, and what is sometimes the paranoia of our constituents. However, we must give leadership, we must introduce and abide by legislation which establishes us as a humanitarian country, and we must also remember our pride in signing the European and UN Conventions on Human Rights. We have taken many initiatives in the UN and elsewhere to fight human rights abuses, and have done so loudly where possible. We have gained a reputation for that and our missionaries and lay workers have made a stand for human rights, which in many cases has led to their execution or assassination. This has established the Irish sense of morality and human dignity in countries where human rights are violated. What have we done when citizens of those countries have come here? How do we acknowledge Irish people who fight such abuses in those countries? We do not support or acknowledge them. We must also consider this dimension.</P>
    <P>By introducing this legislation as a single measure, and in such a hurried fashion, we increase the danger of further discrimination being heaped on immigrants without affording them any protection. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and other Members received the practical, but not very demanding, recommendations on the procedures that should be in place before this Bill is enacted.  Those recommendations state that we should address existing problems and not deal with this issue in isolation, a deportation order should be introduced in such a manner that a deportation could not be carried out unless all deportees have access to independent legal advice, the removal of an applicant should be carried in a dignified and humane manner, physical force should not be used in the removal of an applicant from the State, there should be ongoing and adequate training of gardaí and other staff involved in the carrying out of these orders, and there should be gender sensitive guidelines at all stages of the procedure, an issue about which the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, other Members and I are <Col N="310" /> concerned. The Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is examining the area of refugees, particularly the special needs and treatment of women refugees.</P>
    <P>The Bill has opened up the debate on this issue and I hope it will be explored at a deeper level, which we have not had the opportunity to do before now. We should use the opportunity afforded by this Bill to examine positive ways to deal with immigrants rather than focus on one negative way to deal with them. Like other Members on this side, I call for a delay in enacting the Bill until the Minister introduces the Bill he promised during his Second Stage speech. He said the Government hopes to be in a position to introduce a short amending Bill before Easter to make the Refugee Act fully operational.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the removal of the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo;, which can be interpreted in many ways, from this legislation. Given the more racist and condemnatory language used in the House about asylum seekers, it appears some people would welcome aliens and UFOs over refugees and find them easier to deal with. It is important the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo; has been removed from this legislation because of the manner in which it is perceived and understood.</P>
    <P>Above all, we must be concerned about the section which states that the Minister may deport a person whose deportation, in his opinion, would be conducive to the common good because we do not have an interpretation of what is in the common good.  What is stated to be in the common good could be expanded or such power could be abused. I am not suggesting this or any future Minister would do that, but we must be careful about the insertion of such a provision in legislation. From countless other legislation that has been introduced here, particularly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I know it is dangerous to include loose provision or to leave anything to the discretion of a future Minister. What does the phrase &ldquo;the common good&rdquo; mean? Does it mean a Minister could say he or she has confidential information which he or she is not allowed to divulge, but on foot of it has the right to deport an applicant. That would be highly dangerous. This provision is diffuse. It would give a Minister great power, but would not give an applicant being deported or his or her representatives any power. Such a provision creates a major gap in legal terms.</P>
    <P>We must introduce legislation that complies with EU and UN conventions to provide a central system to cover the humane protection, security and registration of non-nationals. We must then inform others about what such legislation covers and who it protects and provide the necessary resources to implement it. The Irish Refugee Council and other groups deal with refugees who encounter difficulties, because of language and cultural difficulties, in understanding our system. It is a matter of grave concern that such groups <Col N="311" /> cannot employ compatriots of those refugees who live here to act as their interpreters.</P>
    <P>Once those people have the right of security and shelter, we deny them the most basic right, the right to work. That does not make sense and the longer this continues to be the position, the fears and paranoia, to which Deputy Ahern referred, will exacerbate and it will be much more difficult to counter them.</P>
    <P>This legislation must include the necessary legal supports, the right to redress, representation and interpretation and the right to support and to be among their own people. We rightly share not just a pride in our history, but in the sacrifices others have made to ensure the survival of many of our people who have gone abroad and strengthened our position as a result. We are also proud that as a small member state of the European Union we have a good deal of moral authority within the United Nations. We have to acknowledge and earn the right to that reputation and authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council appointed in November 1998 has been meeting on a monthly basis since then. At the request of the Government, the main work of the council during 1999 will relate to the preparation of a new strategy report to provide a basis for a national agreement in succession to Partnership 2000. Also, the NESC secretariat will continue to work on a study benchmarking Irish progress in the areas covered by the Partnership 2000 agreement both over time and by comparison with other countries. The subject matter includes work on education, taxation and child care. Some of the material in the benchmarking exercise will be drawn upon for the strategic review. It is intended that the results of the research will be published later in 1999. A short report on profitability in the Irish economy and associated policy issues is also in preparation. The report is due to be considered by the council in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC secretariat is also preparing a study of housing in Ireland. Its objectives are to provide an overview and assessment of the situation in the main housing sectors and to recommend a consistent set of policies designed to address the various problems in housing. The report will be published in the latter half of 1999. Other elements of a work programme may be agreed <Col N="313" /> later by the council subject to the priority task of the strategic review.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach consider commissioning a further report? We now have the happy situation where there is a net inflow of people to the country. For example, in 1997, 44,000 immigrants entered the country &ndash; that represents a net inflow of 15,000 &ndash; of whom 2,883, a mere 9 per cent, were asylum seekers. In view of the patently obvious fact that there is a major skills shortage, that this matter goes far beyond the simple expedient of granting work permits to asylum seekers &ndash; a proposal my party supports &ndash; that we will be unable to sustain our position as Europe's fastest growing economy unless there is a planned approach to increases in population and that we must try to determine the level of population increase required to meet our growing demand, will the Taoiseach consider asking the National Economic and Social Council to undertake a study to see how the skills and abilities of immigrants, in general, and asylum seekers can be utilised to assist the economy and how these people can be integrated into the country's social fabric?</P>

        <b>:</b> With regard to the latter part of the Taoiseach's original reply, namely, the various problems besetting the housing sector, are all aspects of housing being examined in the study? Is it a root and branch examination of the entire housing sector with a view to determining what can be done to rectify a situation where it is impossible for young people to meet the cost of housing, where the price of sites has escalated and where the prices of houses are completely out of kilter with the fact that there has been little, if any, increase in the cost of building materials and supplies?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach made any assessment of the way in which working methods in the public service have changed since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act? Has it resulted in more or less things being put on paper, given that things on paper are now open to inspection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By comparison with other countries the implementation of the Act has been relatively smooth. In the view of those involved in freedom of information legislation and the public servants involved in drafting this legislation it has gone well. The framework set out for processing requests and for defining the extent of the right of access to various records has also worked well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the practice of civil servants has changed. From my extensive experience the note taking, briefs, questions and data has not changed. Speaking for my Department, the structure of keeping the provisions of the legislation at arms length from Ministers is a good idea and is well constructed in the Act because it means that the system, including the appeals system, rolls on without interference. While those <Col N="316" /> unhappy with the decisions made in some Departments can go to the information commissioner, the legislation appears to be working smoothly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to an article that appeared on the front page of the<i> Sunday Tribune</i> of 7 February in which members of the media, which constitutes 60 per cent of requests under the Act, were asked to pay £1,000 in respect of an inquiry. Does he not consider this to be against the spirit of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only answer on behalf of my Department. I do not believe we receive any money because the questions are straightforward. I understand there is a charge only if an enormous amount of information is required which necessitates a huge amount of overtime or additional work. In terms of the matter referred to by the Deputy, I assume an assessment was made of what it would cost to obtain the information requested. That was always envisaged in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the nature of the Act and that it is helping to throw light on areas of the Administration which had been hidden, is it not the case that if it will take time to compile the information requested by those seeking it, they should be told rather than be required to pay a substantial sum up front? In this case £1,000 was sought, albeit £500 in the first instance. Will the Taoiseach examine this aspect to ensure that finance does not become a barrier to getting information that should reasonably be in the public domain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it costs £16 per hour to compile information following a request. If an assessment is made that whatever information is sought will take a certain number of hours to compile, that will be reflected in the cost. The information I have seen requested under the Act is straightforward and there are no costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the media and politicians are the primary users of the Act would the Taoiseach agree that the public is not as well informed about the Act as it ought to be? Is there any measure he would envisage taking to ensure the public is better informed in an effort to ensure that the legislation is more fairly and generally used?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect the number of inquires under the Act to decrease in time? For example, information may be made available more generally as the culture of transparency becomes more established.</P>
      <P>Does the charge for compiling information apply to all members of the public or is there any selectivity&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>These questions relate specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does a charge apply to the public or is it the case, as I have heard, that if a charge is over a certain amount inquirers are informed in advance so they are able to determine if procuring the information they seek is worth the expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are informed. The fact that approximately three quarters of the requests for information are made by the media and Members of the House is in line with the experience in other countries. I am unable to advise the Deputy on what will happen in the future. When the legislation was enacted it was anticipated there would be a high level of demand in the period after enactment which would then level off.</P>
      <P>It appears that some people are operating a business in requesting information which will then be used for some purpose. It should be emphasised to members of the public that they are entitled to use the Act. It is not meant for a select few but for the wider public. People will tire of asking some of the questions that have been submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The current staff in the media monitoring unit within the Government Information Services comprise a manager of the unit, two executive officers, one staff officer and three clerical officers. All of the staff with the exception of the manager and one clerical officer are on secondment from other Departments to work in the unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full year cost of the unit to my Department in 1998 was approximately £72,000. This covers the manager's salary, shift allowances paid to the other staff and other general administrative costs. The salaries of the staff on secondment are paid by their parent Departments and my Department pays the shift allowance, amounting to one sixth of each officer's salary. There are also some overhead costs which are incurred by my Department, such as office maintenance, heating and elec<Col N="319" /> tricity costs. However, these costs cannot be identified separately.</P>
    <P>Staff in the unit operate a flexible rota of three working shifts so that 18 hours per day are available to provide a comprehensive information service to the Government, Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments and alert them to problems which may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that there is a manager, two executive officers and two clerical officers in the unit. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a manager, two executive officers, a staff officer and three clerical officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That totals seven, of whom the manager is the only person to be hired from outside. The rest are transferred. Does the cost of £72,000 cover the total salary cost or just the shift allowance cost paid by the Taoiseach's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the cost was £72,000. However, it is higher than that because the primary salary is paid by other Departments.</P>

If the monitoring unit does not listen to an important radio station, such as Radio Kerry, when an important participant in the peace process is saying things about the Taoiseach which the Taoiseach says are not true, then perhaps the monitoring unit should be monitored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin is of the opinion that there are more staff employed here than at GCHQ. Is the Taoiseach telling the House we get value for money for the work of the director of press clippings and all his staff? How does the Taoiseach believe it is value for money? A reply to an earlier parliamentary question informed us that there are 17 people working in the Taoiseach's public relations unit. That seems excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton and I have been office holders in various Departments, so there is no need for us to try to confuse each other. We all know what we are talking about. It has been my experience in the various Departments in which I have served &ndash; the Taoiseach has been in two of the same Departments &ndash; that the private diaries of the Minister in question, invariably an IPA year book which is excellent, and of the private secretary to the Minister were similar and that before we moved to IT systems the records of ministerial appointments in the Department of Finance or the Department of Labour were held in the Minister's personal diary, which was the personal property of the Minister and the private secretary. Both the Taoiseach and I shared two private secretaries on two separate occasions, so I am talking about a similar practice. Is the Taoiseach saying the practice in the Department of the Taoiseach was such that there was only one ministerial diary belonging to the Taoiseach and that it was in his possession, that the private secretary to the Taoiseach did not have a parallel diary for the Taoiseach's appointments, aside from the private ones, and that when Mr. Haughey left the Department of the Taoiseach he took with him, as he was entitled to, his own private diaries but also the departmental diaries associated with the Department of the Taoiseach? Is that a correct understanding of the current position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn's practice and my practice were not the same. I did not keep a <Col N="323" /> personal diary in my Departments. I let the civil servants keep one diary. When I left the Departments, those diaries were left there. If I had been wiser, I would have done what others did and took the diaries with me and then I would have been able to check them on Sunday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that there was much thanks for checking them on Monday morning. As regards the diaries, a copy of the diary of former Taoisigh, Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Albert Reynolds, are held in a registry. No record of the diaries of Dr. Garrett FitzGerald and Mr. Charles Haughey are retained in the Department. This is also the case with regard to previous Taoisigh. On leaving office, the more recent Taoisigh were given a copy of their own diaries for record purposes, usually a printed copy because the electronic diary is wiped clean. The electronic diary was first used to maintain the Taoiseach's diary in 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the present controversy, these are archival documents. Does the Taoiseach believe, in light of this controversy, that it would be desirable to make the diaries of former Taoisigh, Mr. Haughey and Dr. FitzGerald, available to the Department of the Taoiseach and to put them into the National Archives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked this matter and there are no rules on it. The Cabinet procedure makes reference in paragraph 1.9 to the retention of papers by Ministers and Ministers of State and states that under the Official Secrets Act former Ministers may retain their official documents. They are only asked not to release them. Former Taoisigh held on to their diaries in the past. Even where there was a copy of the record, the electronic record was wiped clean. Because the current diaries of the Taoiseach and Ministers come under the Freedom of Information Act, they are public knowledge since April 1998 and they will remain so in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. In light of what has happened and the difficulties which may transpire for the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the coalition Government, would the Taoiseach consider making a formal request to former Deputies FitzGerald and Haughey to return to the Department of the Taoiseach the diaries which are essentially matters of public record?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Rasmussen on 4 February in Copenhagen and will meet President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin on 15 February in Paris. I will also meet the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Wim Kok on 17 February in The Hague.  These meetings take place in advance of an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government focusing on Agenda 2000 <Col N="326" /> in Bonn on 26 February. The exact scope of the meeting is not yet finalised. However, my understanding is that it will deal exclusively with Agenda 2000. Following that meeting, I will meet Belgian Prime Minister Dahaene and President Santer in Brussels on 3 March.</P>
    <P>I view all these meetings as extremely important opportunities to make clear to our partners Irish interests and concerns and to ensure the best possible final outcome for Ireland in the funding negotiations which are scheduled to conclude at a Special European Council Meeting in Berlin on 24-25 March.</P>
    <P>In relation to my visit to Copenhagen, my meeting with Prime Minister Rasmussen was very useful in identifying areas of common interest in the negotiations. We discussed the current proposals on Structural, Cohesion and agricultural Funding. I stressed the need for an equitable outcome and indicated that the present proposals, particularly in the agricultural area, if implemented would impact proportionately more on Ireland than any other member state.</P>
    <P>I reaffirmed to the Prime Minister my strong support for the ongoing enlargement negotiations with those countries seeking to join the Union. Prime Minister Rasmussen is a strong advocate of the enlargement process and indicated that Denmark would be prepared to increase its contributions to the Union to ensure the success of the process.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the launch of the euro and EMU. Denmark is one of four EU countries which did not participate in the launch of the euro and I briefed the Prime Minister on Ireland's experience so far.</P>
    <P>Apart from Agenda 2000 related matters, I discussed issues of a bilateral nature and took the opportunity to brief the Prime Minister on the Northern Ireland peace process. We also discussed external issues, such as the crisis in Kosovo, which are of concern to the Union. I also briefed Prime Minister Rasmussen on my visit to the Middle-East and sought his support for Ireland's candidature for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2001-2.</P>
    <P>I met briefly Commissioner Fischler on 5 February. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who had detailed discussions with Commissioner Fischler the previous evening also attended. We discussed the current proposals on CAP reform and their potential impact on our agriculture industry and the wider economy. We had a frank exchange of views and I made clear our position on the key issues arising such as milk quotas, extensification and co-financing.</P>
    <P>I expect my meetings with President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin will also focus largely on the Agenda 2000 negotiations. I intend to discuss in detail the current proposals on CAP reform. Our French counterparts, like ourselves, recognise the vital importance of the agriculture industry to our economies. As I indicated to the House previously, while we accept the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals, the pro<Col N="327" /> posals as they stand would damage our agriculture industry and the Irish economy as a whole. We also oppose the suggested co-financing of the CAP. I will also set out our concerns in relation to the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    <P>I intend discussing the retention of duty free during the course of my visits. As the House will be aware, the French President and Prime Minister have been strong advocates for the retention of duty free beyond end-June. I would also expect to discuss issues of a bilateral nature and to take the opportunity to brief each of the leaders on the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>In each of my meetings I will raise Ireland's candidature for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the term 2001-2.</P>
    <P>In preparation for these meetings the Cabinet Sub-Committee and Expert Technical Group on Agenda 2000, which I chair, will continue to meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions. Did the Taoiseach indicate a shift in the Irish position on Agenda 2000 with regard to the Government's attitude to the funding of agriculture and the desire that the available reduced sums of money be concentrated on poorer farmers rather than across the entire spectrum of the agricultural community?</P>
      <P>On the question of duty free, did Prime Minister Rasmussen indicate the current position of the Danish Government? Did the Taoiseach in the course of his recent discussions with the Heads of State and Government obtain an impression from them that the European Commission will bring forward a proposal to defer the abolition of duty free sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advocating for some time that we have to move our line on CAP to a negotiated position. We have made our position very clear on co-financing and on the 1984 position on the milk quotas. We are conscious that there will be a reduction in resources because of the way the negotiations are being dealt with, but at the same time we have to protect the interests of small and medium sized farmers. I am committed to finding a system that can do that. In European terms, between 95 and 96 per cent of Irish farmers would be considered to be in the category of small farmers. Any resolution of that would assist in finding a solution. The French, in particular, are trying the system of regressivity which focuses on smaller farmers. That would certainly help. It would certainly help if we could achieve that in the negotiations. Not everyone, however, is of that view. There will be a five day session of the Agricultural Council the week after next and hopefully they will be able to move to a position. At this stage there are probably 20 obstacles in the discussion on agriculture.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of the 1997 document was welcomed by agriculture leaders, but that position changed fundamentally in the document of 18 March 1998 because our position on milk quotas was substantially disimproved. It stated we would have an extra 2 per cent, 1 per cent going to a number of countries and the other 1 per cent divided proportionately, even though we had a commitment in 1984 that Ireland would get a priority position. We were doing worse than anybody else. This meant that even though we had a commitment in 1984 that Ireland would get a priority position, we did worse than any other country. That dramatically changed from the Agenda 2000 proposals in summer 1997.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton knows well, milk and beef provide 80 per cent of our output. Since last March, in the proposals that have been put forward, the situation has worsened in terms of how it will affect us. We have continually put down markers to that end and I do not accept those proposals. The document last March involved better negotiating proposals. They are drifting all the time into a position which is just not acceptable to us.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate further on his favourable approach to the French proposals in regard to regressivity of age in respect of size? How does that sit with an ambition to have commercial agriculture in Europe, which is to be capable of competing internationally, given that economies of scale play a part in agriculture just as they do in other economic activities?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing this with the French. I have just read some of the papers and proposals so I would rather wait. However, as Deputy Quinn stated, the French are trying to look at small farmers and are debating the definition of a &ldquo;small farmer&rdquo;. They are endeavouring to leave the position unchanged for small farmers, to take them out of the equation and not to have them in a negative position between 2000 and 2006. That would affect 96 per cent of our farmers and, naturally, that is a position to which we would link.</P>
      <P>With regard to the argument about intensive and extensive farming I argued with Commissioner Fischler recently that because Ireland is pasture based, environmentally friendly and dairying is traditional, there are many merits in our position rather than that which the Commission and others are pressing. That is something we will continue to argue at the Agriculture Council and everywhere else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see that if one adopts a policy of regressivity there is a difficulty in that potentially viable commercial units are penalised as their unit costs are increased relative to units that may not be potentially viable? While that may be socially acceptable from a rural development point of view, or at least a population maintenance point of view, it is not necessarily conducive towards competitive international commercial efficiency in Irish agriculture and, ultimately, that must be an objective as well. We should have an agriculture industry that can stand on its own two feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is true and is an argument. However, Deputy Bruton will accept, given our social and rural background and our agriculture industry traditionally, that when one looks at present resources and the breakdown of the £1.065 billion allocated to the industry last year relatively small amounts were given to the majority of farmers. One does not have to be a statistician looking into the future at the age profile of farmers to see that one way or the other their profile will change dramatically over the coming years. If these farmers are not given a soft landing in the next round it will create mayhem in the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the representatives of larger farmers see that point. At the same time they do not want to be in an agreement that will exclude their interests, but that is what we must fight for. The ongoing debate and some of the proposals put forward, which have dealt with this very closely, would devastate Irish agriculture and many arguments put and presentations made by continental farmers are really designed to look at big farmers and what some of them call &ldquo;factory farms&rdquo;. We cannot get caught up in those types of negotiations and the French are the nearest to our position on that. I am not saying we can totally agree with them but they are adopting a policy of regressivity and they have been the hottest <Col N="330" /> opponents of co-financing, similar to ourselves. It makes sense for me to support that line.</P>

Does he further accept that there is a need to create some perspective for young people entering the industry in terms of a medium-term commercial future and that the structure should support that as well as the short-term social objectives, which, of course, are right from both a human and rural development point of view? However, we must also have that other element of the objectives of commerciality.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that. Dairying is the one aspect of agriculture which has been good and that is the argument about the milk quota. If we were to agree to the present milk quota arrangements, we would get 1 per cent and Austria would get 9 per cent, while other countries would get 6, 7 or 8 per cent, and that would be an entirely negative feature for young farmers who want a career in this area. The strongest case has been put by our farm leaders in dairying as to why that would be devastating for them. I have no difficulty with that argument, but I am doing it in addition to the other case.</P>
      <P>Of course, the income of more than half our farmers does not come entirely from the land, they have other sources of income, professionally or working in industry and services. That position has changed even from a decade ago and while that is not necessarily a good position it is a reality. What certainly is not a good position is that 57 per cent of farm income is made up of direct payments and that is not giving much of a future to those who are trying to build up a viable&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the overall level of information available to my Department on children with special needs within the school system. While significant information is available on children attending special schools and special classes, there is a particular need to develop more comprehensive data on children with special needs attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis. Arrangements are being made to address this matter in the context of my recent announcement of a major new development in special education services.</P>
      <P>Under this new development, all pupils who have been assessed as having a special need arising from a disability are entitled to an automatic response to that need. The response may take the form of extra teaching support or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of each child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is finalising a detailed circular and information note which is expected to issue to all primary schools before the end of February. <Col N="332" /> The purpose of this exercise is to alert all schools to recent developments in support services for special needs children and to advise schools on how to apply for support under this initiative. Details of each of the disability categories identified by the special education review committee plus autism will be included in the information package. Schools catering for such children will be required to provide detailed information on the number of children involved; their ages; the nature of their disabilities; and the support required. Information provided by schools under this initiative will be of significant assistance to my Department in identifying the overall number of special needs children within the system and the nature and level of special needs involved.</P>
    <P>Following analysis of the data received, such additional information as is required will be sought by way of further research. This is an area I intend to keep under review and I have asked my officials to prepare proposals to ensure my Department will on an ongoing basis have comprehensive information on the nature and level of special educational needs. The information gathered in the recent survey of second level special needs conducted by AHEAD will play an important role in this review. This data is being analysed.</P>

      <P>The special education review committee, which reported in 1993, carried out a comprehensive review of educational services for children with special needs. The report presented by the committee has been published. It provides a detailed description of each special needs category. It also provides a detailed breakdown of the number of children in the education system within each such category, as determined by surveys carried out on behalf of the committee. In respect of each distinct group identified, the committee put forward detailed recommendations for the development of special education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's approach to special education services is much based on the recommendations of the special education review committee. The categories of special need recognised by my Department include those identified by the committee as follows: remedial need; borderline, mild, moderate and severe or profound mental handicap; general learning disabilities; visual or hearing impairment; emotional disturbance; spec<Col N="334" /> ific learning disability; specific speech and language disorder; physical disability; autism-autistic spectrum disorders; multiple disabilities.</P>
    <P>Definitions relating to each of the above categories will be included in a circular being finalised in my Department and expected to issue to all primary schools by the end of February. The purpose of this circular is to alert schools to important recent developments in support services for special needs children. Under these developments, all pupils who have been assessed as having a special need arising from a disability are entitled to an automatic response to such needs. The response may take the form of extra teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of each child.</P>
    <P>Schools catering for such pupils will be required to provide detailed information on the numbers of pupils involved; their ages; the nature of their disabilities within the defined categories; and the support required.</P>
    <P>Information provided by schools under this initiative will be of significant value in assisting my Department to develop more up-to-date information on the overall number of special needs children in the school system and within each special needs group. This is an area I intend to keep under review and I have asked my officials to prepare proposals on how my Department can, on an ongoing basis, assess the nature and level of special educational needs. I welcome Deputy Higgins to this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's good wishes. My question is linked to the answer given to Deputy Bruton's last question and concerns the methodology involved. I am grateful for the reply and the list supplied. However, how is a child defined in terms of that list? If the child, as a citizen, becomes entitled to special services on foot of an assessment by the Department, the Department is then effectively screening the need and defining the total demand. Will the total volume of need be decided by a definition which is widely surveyed among the population of children or will the need be defined by those assessed by the Department? I am leaving aside the question about the number of learning disorders that might or might not be included. Will a universal coverage of children be used to discern the extent of learning difficulties and will provision be then made, or is the Minister saying that a child with specific learning difficulties who has been so assessed, as the Minister puts it, professionally, within the Department then becomes entitled to a service?</P>
      <P>My second supplementary specifically relates to research. I wonder about the adequacy of an estimate of the number of children in each of what are conventionally regarded as the learning disability categories. I would question whether sending a questionnaire to schools and asking how many children are attending school would satisfy such a research requirement as a basis for policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Every child who is assessed as having a special need will be provided for, which is a Government decision; that was not the case up to last November. Many children who were assessed as having special needs were not provided with their entitlement. From now on, every child with a special need will be entitled to a response which will vary according to the needs of the individual child; every case is different. In the SERC review, there are different pupil-teacher ratios for the different categories.</P>
      <P>As regards research, the survey conducted by the SERC group gave certain figures in terms of the categories. We are not just sending out a simple questionnaire, as it is not just about quantifying but about following up with provisions so there is an incentive for schools to send back information, not only on the children but also on the categories. We have already received some very detailed responses from schools. However, I accept we have more research to carry out, not just in the areas covered by SERC but also in the area of learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>For many years there has been a dearth of research in this country on certain areas, for example, autism. To a large extent we are relying on international experience and research in other countries to inform methodologies. This does not apply in all cases as a number of people have been pioneering in their approach. However, we do not have as much indigenous research as we should have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply. This matter is so important, we must make progress on it. I take it the Minister is giving an undertaking for further research to be carried out, other than the survey to which he referred. If, for example, a system had missed the conditions of many children in the past, how could it be relied upon to find out the new conditions, for example, dyspraxia, dysgraphia and dyscalcula? How does a teacher know a child suffers from any of these conditions if they have never been trained to recognise them? So many children have already been lost to dyslexia. Will all these categories be investigated in the survey or, if that is deficient in their recognition, will there be supplementary research to enable a quantification, which in turn will enable a universal policy response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the disabilities outlined by the Deputy, SERC concentrated on what we call the traditional special needs area. As regards the areas mentioned by the Deputy, such as dyspraxia, attention deficit disorder, dyslexia etc., one of the terms of reference of the primary teacher training review body which I put in place to review the entire teacher training programme is the special needs and learning difficulties area. Whatever proposals emerge from that group should include comprehensive modules on the conditions outlined by the Deputy so that all new primary school teachers entering the system <Col N="336" /> would immediately recognise them and have greater exposure to them.</P>
      <P>In terms of the existing teaching force, we need to provide more in-service programmes, which we intend to do. The Department of Health and Children has a full intellectual disability database, which contains a large amount of data which is available to our planning department. However, we still have more research to do into the areas outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce changes in the third level student support grant scheme for the 1999-2000 academic year in view of the growing evidence of student maintenance costs exploding, widely acknowledged differences in current levels of support and significant anomalies in the current scheme.</Quest>

      <P>Some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants under the three student support grant schemes in operation for third level students. As such, the grants schemes cannot be described as a targeted measure aimed at helping the poorest of students. We should aim to increase the income available to students in need, but we must have priorities and we must target those most in need. In this regard I would point out to the Deputy that expenditure on these schemes in the current year will be in the region of £80 million. This is in addition to the cost of meeting third level tuition fees which will be some £140 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>Each year the student support grant schemes are reviewed and improved as resources permit and such a review will be undertaken for all the schemes for the coming academic year. In 1997 and 1998 grant levels were increased in line with inflation. I am particularly concerned about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years. This cost will be met from the additional funding which is being allocated over the next two years to tackle educational disadvantage at third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative also includes £3 million specifically to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. I will announce details of the allocation of the additional resources in due course when I have fully considered how best to proceed in this area. I would also remind the Deputy that I have removed the greatest anomaly in student support by the intro<Col N="337" /> duction of grants for post-leaving certificate students.</P>
    <P>I very much accept that students in many parts of the country are experiencing particular difficulties in finding good affordable accommodation. I do not believe that an across the board major increase in grants is the appropriate response. Rather I believe that the core issue is a need to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and the resultant release of pressure from the rented sector. The Government is addressing this issue in the context of tax relief provisions for student accommodation which will be provided for in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I have previously indicated that my priority at third level is the creation of additional places and to this end I have already increased by 8,000 the number of student places available. I have also established the Scientific and Technological (Investment) Fund with a provision of £280 million which is additional to the normal Estimates provisions. At third level the fund will address in particular a serious shortfall in accommodation and will provide additional capacity.</P>

      <P>An anomaly I have been pursuing by way of written question with no success concerns Irish students who have been out of the country for more than three years and who expect on their return, as citizens of the State, to take up third level education, obtain grants and not have to pay fees in the same way as every other Irish citizen. They are being turned away under the present scheme. Will the Minister change that? We are making it a virtue to say we cannot get access to the many migrants, a mobile young workforce willing to return and deliver part of the Celtic tiger. Yet, when those young people come back to study we slam the door on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy for what the Deputy is saying although that anomaly has existed in previous schemes for a number of years. That measure emerged in the context of fair treatment for all EU citizens but I will look at it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to be blinded by the briefing he will receive from his officials that the notion of allowing other EU nationals access to our colleges would open the floodgates. We already permit access to any EU national who has been three years in college in his own country. Access would be further opened only to EU nationals who had been three years in colleges in other states. While only a narrow range of people would be included, a significant injustice would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the availability of housing, is it not the case that even where student accommodation is provided it costs in the order of £75 per week for custom built student accommodation? People in that accommodation will still have an annual maintenance cost of about £4,000 against the Minister's provision of £1,600. Even if the tax-<Col N="338" /> based schemes are successful he will not address the huge gap between maintenance support and the cost of accommodation and maintenance for students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Maintenance grants never met the full cost to students of attending college. That grant is of assistance to the student. It is interesting to note that students no longer want to stay in lodgings. This was much more popular ten or 15 years ago. Students are opting for flat accommodation, even allowing for the cost. Some 44 per cent of the student cohort live at home, 29 per cent are in flats, about 10 per cent are in lodgings, 6 per cent are not in specified housing and there are a few other smaller percentages. The response from the colleges indicates the real problem is in Dublin. Many of the colleges throughout the country have provided reasonable campus accommodation.</P>

      <P>The advice being received is that there is a crisis in the Dublin area. The way to deal with that is to improve the supply side and to develop measures whereby we can produce more accommodation. The grant scheme on its own will not cover all aspects of attending a third level college.</P>

      <P>Since the Bacon report, house prices in Dublin have increased by 50 per cent and rents have increased by even more. This type of response will not put bread on the table for students who are put to the pin of their collars to survive. There are reports of students dropping out because they cannot afford to stay on. That is the reality. There is a need for either a premium for accommodation or much higher grants for people on particularly low incomes. I ask the Minister not to mention tax-based building schemes as we have heard about them for too long.</P>

      <P>If the grants were increased by £100 across the board, that would cost a great deal of money but would have little impact on the issues raised. I have told the Union of Students in Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the area partnerships that I want to meet or be made aware of students who are dropping out because of income related issues. A specific sum was provided in the budgetary package to deal with students in that category, particularly those from a social welfare background who are finding it extremely difficult, for financial reasons, to survive in colleges. We will try to assist those. We <Col N="339" /> are working with the Higher Education Authority to develop a scheme in institutions because part of the disadvantage access programme will have to deal with a number of schemes which are up and running and part of it will be to give financial support to students in college from low income backgrounds who are finding it difficult to survive. I have asked the Union of Students in Ireland to do its own checking with students who attend individual colleges and to report to me. I am willing to respond positively to those situations. We hear much anecdotal evidence about this matter. It is time there was concrete evidence from those who are arguing and lobbying and for a report on a range of students in difficulty. I am willing to provide funding.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, including those with dyslexia, should generally be capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The level and quality of this training is one of the important issues to be addressed by the review group on primary teacher training. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a mod<Col N="340" /> ule on specific learning disability. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teachers in the primary system. I recently announced my intention to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second-level schools with effect from September 1999.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning difficulty are normally integrated into ordinary classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.</P>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>In 1998 my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities (ACLD) to assist in its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities.</P>
    <P>The submission referred to by Deputy Higgins claims that at least one in every ten of our population is dyslexic. The special education review committee, which examined this area, indicated that estimates of specific learning disability are usually within the range 1 to 4 per cent, depending on the definition adopted. There is a conflict of opinion.</P>
    <P>The recent package for special needs children announced in November is available to children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia.</P>
    <P>I have asked my officials to review current supports, including in-service teacher training, for children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties. This review will be open to considering the full range of possible supports for the pupils involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, since we may run out of time, and also to be economical I ask the Minister what answer he was preparing for Question No. 54 which asks what is to happen, in the absence of another premises, to the dyslexia support centre in Limerick which is due to vacate its premises in March 1999? Given the gap between the estimate of the two percentages, will the Minister agree a different approach is adopted to remedial teaching in the case of dyslexia? The argument is that people with special needs can be dealt with through remedial teachers. However, in other departmental publications it is acknowledged that remedial teachers need in-service training for recognising conditions such as dyslexia, a learning disorder. It is acknowledged that only new teachers coming out of teacher training will be at an early level of awareness. Given that we do not dispute that, why not make special provision for the centres? Why take refuge in an argument about the percentages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> My second question relates to how this issue progresses to testing. I am aware of a case submitted to the Department regarding a child being considered for doing the leaving certificate who has been offered either a scribe or a word processor that, effectively, has been degraded in vocabulary. I do not understand this type of crazy thinking. The Minister appears to acknowledge a need but at the same time he is using the dispute on the percentages as a refuge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking refuge in the conflict between the percentages. People need to knock heads together and sort out that, in terms of getting an estimate. The real issue is what approach to take. I said in my reply that the SERC report, which was the last major review of this area with all the partners involved, made it clear that children with dyslexia should be dealt with by the remedial service, visiting teaching service and the resource teaching service.</P>
      <P>I used the phrase &ldquo;should be capable of being met&rdquo; in my reply. There are 1,300 remedial teachers in the service and it should be making a significant contribution in this area. That is a matter of debate, but what is not open to debate is whether it should. In my view, it should.</P>
      <P>I indicated that my officials and I are reviewing this area with a view to examining in-school and out-of-school provision. There are difficulties with the Limerick centre in that it is considered by the Department to be a private operation. A once-off grant of £14,000 was approved by my predecessor and it was paid in autumn 1998.</P>
      <P>I am open minded about how we should approach this issue. I am extremely interested in the work of ACLD, for example, which organised workshops throughout the country. I gave it additional support and I would like to do more. We must agree on the models. This matter has been in limbo in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen in the meantime? We await more acutely aware teachers emerging from the training colleges and hope for the best possible performance from the remedial service. I, too, pay tribute to the remedial service. In the interim, while these needs and provisions are adjusting, is the Minister willing to indicate that he will give financial support to services that are increasing due to the existence of need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has given financial support to ACLD, for example, particularly for its services for disadvantaged areas. A number of Deputies have made representations about the situation in Limerick and I met a group of parents last week. I have asked my officials to meet representatives of the centre involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a private centre which charges fees from the students. I do not know the full background of the centre; I met the individual concerned about a year ago. I am concerned, but I will not <Col N="342" /> make a specific commitment today in relation to a centre.</P>
    <P>The question put down by the Deputy raises the issues that emerge from the document prepared by the group. I am trying to deal with those issues. The recently announced package deals with children with dyslexia. Resource teachers will have a role to play in this area and there are ongoing in-service programmes. We are reviewing the situation and the provision. Up to now the Department held the view that the provision would have to be in-school, but I am open to the in-school and out-of-school options.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues raised in the document is the difference between the Department's estimate of 1 per cent to 4 per cent and the submission's estimate of one in ten children with dyslexia or associated disorders. Politicians come out in a cold sweat when parents come to them to discuss the problem of dyslexia because they know how difficult it is to get the necessary facilities. Does the Minister agree the assessment procedure used by the Department is seriously flawed for assessing assistance for examinations? Getting basic facilities, whether scribes, computers or tapes, is similar to banging one's head against a brick wall. Does the Minister agree the difference between the two estimates is the root cause of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the root cause of the problem in terms of State examinations. The issue there is the balance between preservation of the integrity of the examination for every student who sits it and&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a question and I am answering it. The 1 per cent versus 10 per cent does not matter. What does matter is how a child is treated in the examination process when that child presents with dyslexia or any other difficulty. We are reviewing that and I hope the outcome of the review will be ready for the State examinations this summer. The issue is the examination system that applies to all students and to ensure the integrity of that system is not undermined. That has been a matter of concern with regard to concessions, which are made on an ongoing basis and we hope to improve them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the decision about examinations has caused consternation for parents of dyslexic children? Previously, an examiner was informed that a child had a problem with dyslexia or had a similar communication difficulty. The new procedure is to refer script an examiner finds difficult to read. Is that not a far more blunt instrument than giving a clear indication to an examiner that the child has an identified communication difficulty? If a teacher in a classroom finds it difficult to recognise dyslexia, how can the Minister expect an <Col N="343" /> examiner to do so when he or she has only a single script by which to judge? Surely the old system was fairer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sense of justifying the indefensible by the use of language such as &ldquo;defending the integrity&rdquo; of the examination system. If a child is faced with a choice of a scribe or a word processor and chooses the latter and if the parents of that child are told that should a spell check facility be available it would have to be in a debilitated form, how could that be required by the integrity of any examination system? If that is the case, should the scribe not be disabled as well? This is manifestly crazy. It represents a Dostoyevskian lack of sensitivity to suggest to a child and parents that they can have permission to use a word processor but cannot use the spell check facility. As one parent said, it is similar to asking a child who wears glasses to remove them during the examination. It borders on cruel insensitivity.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the partnerships are currently funded as part of the EU aided Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 co-ordinated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The continued operation of the partnerships after the current round of EU Structural Fund negotiations and their scope and function will be influenced by emerging developments regarding both the negotiations for the new round of EU funding and a greater integration between the local government and the local development systems.</P>
      <P>I assure the House of my commitment to the promotion of an integrated area-based approach to addressing educational disadvantage and to the enhancement of links between education providers and community, youth, welfare, employer and training interests. My Department will continue to work closely with local development interests in the future to achieve the objective of integrated area planning and a strengthening of home, school and community links.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Many of these youth projects deal with children at risk who have behavioural problems or who come from broken homes. Will the Minister of State ensure that funding will be provided after 1999 for these projects? I am aware this is not currently within the remit of his Department but we are talking about young people who are under his remit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that neither I nor anybody else knows the shape the area based partnerships will take after 31 December next when the funding runs out. The area based partnerships spend a certain amount &ndash; approximately £500,000 per annum &ndash; on youth services, and I accept that funding goes to particularly disadvantaged youth. It is the Government's objective that the area based partnerships continue to operate in their current form. I am particularly concerned, as is the Minister, that the funding for disadvantaged youth be continued by the area based partnerships after 31 December of this year. In the unlikely event that it does not, the Deputy and the House can rest assured I will ensure that is reflected in the amount of funding we give to the youth services overall.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by the Deputy, I would like to see these specific projects continue to be funded, even if we have to provide the resources ourselves. As Deputy Naughten is aware, however, the funding for youth services from the area based partnerships forms part of an integrated area based approach in each case. I do not know whether it will be possible to fund those projects on a stand alone basis as a type of adjunct to what we are currently funding to youth services but we are keeping a close eye on this matter and the Deputy can be assured I will leave no stone unturned to ensure these people, who are from particularly disadvantaged areas, will not be disadvantaged if the area partnerships do not continue to operate as they currently do after the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State ensure that these type of projects currently being funded will continue after 1999? It is difficult to get funding in the Department of Education and Science, unlike in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation where more than £20 million was made available to organisations under the drugs task force; some of them do not know what to do with the money. This is the type of project that needs to be continued and developed rather than the top down approach being taken in the Minister's sister Department.</P>

I reject the suggestion implicit in the Deputy's question that funding is difficult to find. The Deputy will be aware that we got a substantial increase in provision for youth services this year which will enable me to take a number of initiatives one of which will have particular relevance to disadvantaged youth and which I will announce shortly. If the area based partnership funding to the youth service is discontinued after 31 December next, I will ensure that the people cur<Col N="346" /> rently benefiting from that funding do not suffer any disadvantage as a result.</P>

      <P>The Minister is taking an extremely narrow view of youth services from the partnership companies. Approximately £10.5 million worth of services for young people is funded for educational purposes through the Minister's Department. Is the Minister of State saying he is willing to allow the partnership companies be dismantled and that he will at some future date reconstitute area based approaches? The Minister is not giving a clear commitment that he will maintain the partnerships in the educational work they are doing. I want a clear reply from the Minister of State. Will he accept it would be ludicrous to dismantle community based schemes that have great commitment from parents, co-ordinators, students, principals and teachers and substitute it at some time in the future when he is framing the 2001 Estimates? Will the Minister not agree that we are already seeing the education co-ordinators seconded by his own Department giving up their posts because of the uncertainty and the lack of decision from his Department? I am aware of several people who have surrendered their positions. Will he agree we are already seeing the process of dismantling and he must arrest that now with a clear statement of policy in this area?</P>

As to whether I will allow the area based partnerships continue or be dismantled, I thank the Deputy for the vote of confidence in my power and influence. The future operation of the area based partnership depends on the outcome of the EU Structural Fund negotiations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance misuse prevention education programme for primary schools, Walk Tall, is being introduced to all primary schools on a phased basis during the two years 1999 and 2000. The programme, including detailed educational resource materials for each class level, is <Col N="348" /> being introduced to schools as staff seminars are held for the teachers.</P>
      <P>Dissemination of information has already begun. Up to Easter, it is planned to target the main urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Dundalk. Three information days have already been held for school representatives in the Dublin area to explain the programme and to facilitate the arrangements for the staff seminars. Further such meetings are planned for other areas over the next few weeks. In addition, since the beginning of this year, 29 staff seminars for teachers have already been held &ndash; 19 in Dublin and ten in Cork. The programme is being introduced in the main urban areas in the earlier part of the year but will be extended to other areas as the year progresses and as the process of dissemination accelerates.</P>
      <P>A support team has been put in place. This includes a national project officer and five teacher trainers. One further teacher trainer will be seconded to the team in the near future. There is a project management group within my Department, including one senior psychologist who is the project leader.</P>
      <P>The target number of schools in 1999 for introducing the programme is approximately 1,500 &ndash; 50 per cent of all primary schools, bearing in mind that 150 schools have already introduced the programme during the pilot development phase.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that about 550 staff seminars are required in 1999 to achieve the target of having the programme in 1,500 schools. This takes account of combining staff from small and medium sized schools for individual seminars. The support team will be available for some follow up support visits to education centres and some schools and this will assist in reviewing progress.</P>
      <P>Provision of £1 million for the dissemination over the two year period has been included within the social inclusion funding for the Department of Education and Science announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement. The provision in 1999 is £500,000. In addition, the educational resource materials mentioned are being provided free to schools as the programme is introduced. The overall cost of preparation, designing and printing these materials in the quantities required was £142,000 in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess an interest in this since I was a sociologist in a previous life. Given the manner in which the dissemination of information concerning the drug culture has happened in Europe, is there not a basis for a sociological component to the design of phase one or phase two? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the sum which the Minister gave as the total cost for phase one and the envisaged cost for phase two not very small in relation to the need which exists? Has he planned to significantly increase the support available at the end of phase one should the evidence come back from the first projects? How is this linked to such designed in-<Col N="349" /> service training as is necessary for accurate drug information?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding is more than adequate. The pilot project was carried out over a number of years but it was lying around to an extent. It needed a clear commitment to implement it in all schools and to mainstream it. The project team is adequately funded, but if more funding is required it will be provided. The allocated fund, however, is more than adequate for both the in-service training and the dissemination of materials to all classes.</P>
      <P>This is a substance abuse prevention programme aimed at the primary level. The emphasis is on the building of self esteem among the children. It is not an issue of bringing drugs into the classroom and urging children not to take them.</P>
      <P>I take on board what the Deputy has said and will refer the suggestions made to the project team. This is not an area where we will stand still. We are anxious to learn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as the 17th century, when the Huguenots were fleeing France because of civil and religious persecution, Ireland was active in providing facilities for them here. Since we signed the UN Convention in 1956 successive Governments have accepted people as &ldquo;programme refugees&rdquo;. These are people brought in by the Government in organised numbers, and State facilities were provided for them. The impression created by many Opposition speakers was that we were remiss in this regard, that we did not have due consideration for people suffering civil or ethnic difficulties in their countries and that we had been neglecting this area somehow.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have operated a number of schemes whereby Hungarian, Chilean, Iranian, Vietnamese and Bosnian refugees were brought to Ireland. The Bosnians brought here in 1996 were the latest; originally 180 Bosnians were brought here and facilities were provided by both Government and non-Government agencies in Cherry Orchard. At the end of 1998 that population was 868, 61 of whom were born in Ireland. It is to the credit of the volunteers and organisations that they were able to make the Bosnians' transition at a very difficult time reasonably successful.</P>
      <P>Not only have individuals and their families been catered for, some of their relatives are looked after also. It is now normal to have two or three relatives here per refugee. Originally 212 Vietnamese refugees were brought here in 1979, and now there are more than 600 of them, 200 of whom have been born in Ireland. That was a very successful operation. I do not have the figures, but between 1994 and 1997 approximately 400 others were allowed to stay and work here. Some of them are in Shannon in my constituency, as are people from the former Yugoslavia, Cuba, Romania, Algeria, Somalia, Angola, Iraq, Libya and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unfair impression was given that we were doing nothing in this area, that it was neglected and that we were not fully complying with the commitments we signed up for under the UN convention. I pay tribute to the Refugee Agency established in 1991 for the work it has done. Mr. John O'Neill is its chief executive, and Mr. Paddy Dillon-Malone is its chairperson. The agency's work is twofold. It works with individuals and families to ensure they have proper facilities, education, training and language skills available to them. It also works with Government Depart<Col N="352" /> ments and non-governmental agencies on repatriation programmes. I dealt with this problem in Shannon when many people came off planes at a time when there was a lot of traffic between the former Soviet Union and Cuba, and in my experience they were anxious to get back to their own countries as soon as possible. Part of the Refugee Agency's work has been to try to put repatriation schemes in place which would help to repatriate these people, as has happened in many cases. One finds that even when dealing with regions which have experienced killings and ethnic cleansing, most people prefer to stay in their country of origin when it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>With the resources at our disposal we have undertaken some schemes, and I pay tribute to FÁS, the Irish Red Cross and other bodies who have been helping the Refugee Agency in its work. This agency operates on a very small budget of approximately £300,000. Given the amount of positive work it does, I would like more resources devoted to this area.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development aid, I had a lot of contact with the Irish Refugee Council, which has given this legislation a limited welcome. The lack of clarity in the Aliens Act, 1935, meant legislation was necessary, and I compliment the Minster on the speed with which he has brought this Bill forward. However, some of the Irish Refugee Council's concerns could be dealt with on Committee Stage. I do not propose to go into detailed discussion of those now, but the council is concerned by some of the provisions in section 3 whereby a deported person may not come back to Ireland. The council would like to see an amendment which would perhaps enable people to re-enter Ireland and to have their cases re-examined.</P>
    <P>The legislation refers to instances where persons are convicted of offences and counsel feels the gravity of the offences should be taken into account in matters like this. One might find a sentence imposed for an offence that is not too grievous, but these matters can be examined on Committee Stage. I am almost certain that the Minister has received details of the council's concerns, and these should be taken into account on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The council is also concerned about the removal of people before their appeals are heard. It is only fair that if appeals procedures and mechanisms are being applied people should not be deported until the final appeal is determined. The council is concerned about notification and other minor problems that could be dealt with on Committee Stage. It is also concerned about children, many of whom may be separated from their families. Great care should be taken to ensure that people's anxieties in this matter are adequately catered for, and the council has put forward several technical amendments it sees as necessary. The provision of translation facilities is one such matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> The Irish Refugee Council has been doing very detailed work with no State funding. Last year it dealt with approximately 3,500 people, many of whom are seeking basic information and help with their applications. To do this work the Refugee Council has four legal advisers, four research personnel, a couple of FÁS workers and a few volunteers. For whatever reason, the funding provided to the council, as distinct from the agency, was not continued. I understand the council has made a submission for additional funding and that funding should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sits on an interdepartmental committee on this matter. I was always confused about the responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to which the Refugee Agency reports, and that of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to which the Irish Refugee Council reports. Perhaps that committee could devise a mechanism for rationalising the area and putting in place a more streamlined administrative arrangement for dealing with these issues. That would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Apart from the programme refugees, concern has been expressed about other asylum applicants. There is a genuine feeling abroad that they have not come here because of well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality or politics, but because they were involved in criminal activities. At Shannon Airport papers were flushed down toilets or burned before immigration personnel could see them. The small minority from a criminal background have given a bad name to refugees generally and asylum seekers in particular. It is important that the agencies dealing with refugees work closely with the Departments to combat people who try to undermine the system or who come here because our social welfare payments are more generous than those in the UK or because of changes to the UK system whereby payments were substituted for credits and the mechanism was tightened up &ndash; there is some evidence of that. That was believed to be the case for some 60 people in the Shannon area &ndash; they were not here because of a fear of persecution in their countries but because they were making money.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, some immigrants have made a big contribution in various area. Mr. Diaz, a refugee from Chile who now lives in Shannon, has made a big contribution to social and cultural life in the area. Many people who had genuine reasons for seeking asylum have now made Ireland their home. They freely admit they still think of their homeland and would like to be repatriated, but that is not possible. It would be a shame if these people were to be deprived because of a small minority who are undermining the system and have come here for ulterior motives.</P>
    <P>I compliment the immigration authorities in Shannon Airport for the humanitarian and caring way in which they have dealt with these cases for many years. It was a sensitive and difficult job at <Col N="354" /> times but the immigration personnel always handled cases delicately. Great credit is due to them, the Irish Red Cross in Ennis, and the many volunteers who have been helpful in providing much needed facilities, advice, and income to a section of the international community which has had bad experiences.</P>
    <P>The number of refugees and asylum seekers in the world will continue to increase. Ethnic conflict in central Europe may lead to a large eruption &ndash; one need only look at Kosovo to see that. Conflict is also continuing in Zaire, Somalia, and Nigeria. It is therefore imperative that we bring our refugee and asylum legislation up to date. We had several debates about this in the past few years and it is a cause of regret that the legislation passed by the Houses has not been fully implemented, for various reasons which have been explained on numerous occasions by the Minister. Nevertheless, the speed with which he has acted in this regard is welcome and I hope he will ensure the legislation is expedited. Perhaps we can use this Bill to meet the genuine concerns expressed by the Refugee Council, which has been in the forefront of the campaign to provide better facilities, humanitarian aid, assistance, and guidance to people who have had a traumatic time.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill. I urge him to look at the amendments put forward by the council and to speed up the work of the interdepartmental committee so that a new formula can be put in place to avoid overlapping and duplication which is a waste of human and financial resources. With this legislation and new administrative arrangements, I hope Ireland can continue to show the same caring attitude as we have since we signed the UN convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>A staggering 86,000 jobs could be created in 1999 but the lack of available skills is a huge barrier to growth. Some 57 per cent of small companies are recruiting, yet 88 per cent of those cannot get staff. There are 10,000 vacancies at present, while £1 billion is paid annually &ndash; £20 million per week &ndash; in unemployment assistance. We urgently need a plan to deal with immigration. The Small Firms Association has called for an end to the impediments which stop women, the long-term unemployed and immigrants from gaining legitimate employment. A soon to be published survey carried out by the association shows that many small companies are experiencing severe difficulties in their recruitment plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater links must be forged between all agencies and Departments dealing with unemployment supports, with a view to tackling the difficulties faced by skilled, highly capable women in re-entering the workforce. The primary issue in this regard is the cost of child care provision. Our system should support rather than hinder these people, for whom employers are crying out. The recent budget introduced no tax breaks or financial support for child care provision, so many women who wish to take up work cannot do so. <Col N="355" /> This is confirmed by Ireland's low female employment participation rate of 41 per cent, as against the European average of 45 per cent and the UK level of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is time to take a broader perspective on immigration. For many years, when the Irish economy was not doing well, Ministers lobbied extensively to ensure other countries welcomed our emigrants. We have now come full circle and Ireland is seen by many non-nationals as an attractive country to live in. While we cannot lose sight of the major challenge of assisting the long-term unemployed to regain work, we may find immigration offers potential solutions for employers who cannot fill jobs. Helpful measures to address this issue would include the granting of temporary work permits to qualified non-EU nationals, the establishment of an advisory group with strong business representation to examine the issues involved, the establishment of a quota system, as applies in Australia, Canada and Switzerland, based on the skills need of the Irish economy, and the sending of information on the skills of non-nationals to employers as part of a matching process. These issues must be resolved at this stage of our economic development. We must ensure that every available resource is used if we are to maintain the growth and competitiveness of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that unemployment continues to be a major problem, yet the greatest problem faced by small businesses is a lack of candidates for jobs. If the recommendations of a review of these aspects of our unemployment problem were implemented, it would be of major benefit to our 160,000 small businesses. There is major potential to create employment in that sector. We cannot accept that an unemployment rate of 7 per cent represents full employment in a modern economy where there is a demand for workers. The opportunity cost of this position poses the single greatest challenge to our economy. We need to forge links with that sector.  A hotelier in Sligo told me last week that he cannot get people to work for him. Employers in the service sector, including the distribution and retail service sectors with which I am familiar, find it extremely difficult to recruit staff, although the problem is not quite as bad in the manufacturing sector. Approximately 57 per cent of small companies are recruiting staff, but it is disappointing that 98 per cent of them find it difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the Bill would give the impression it is a deportation Bill. Section 3(1) deals with deportation orders and states the Minister may by order require any non-national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter out of the State. The indefinite applicability of a deportation order is a matter of grave concern to the Irish Refugee Council. Procedures for appeal and revocation of a deportation order should be provided in cases where persons may need to re-enter the State owing to <Col N="356" /> a renewed need for State protection. Therefore, the council recommends that the phrase &ldquo;remain thereafter out of the State&rdquo; should be deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2)(a) refers to a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in this State. This paragraph does not contain any specification about the nature or gravity of an offence committed by a person who would fall within the remit of this section. It does not state details of the minimum term of imprisonment to be served. A distinction is not drawn between minor offences and those carrying a heavy penalty. This provision requires clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2)(b) refers to a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in this State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence. That paragraph does not contain any consideration of the established principle of the presumption of innocence. It does not mention the prospect of an appeal or the possibility that the person could be cleared of the charge. These concerns need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2)(g) refers to a person to whom leave to land in the State has been refused. The Irish Refugee Council recommends that a safeguard should be added to this paragraph to the effect that all reasonable measures have been pursued to ensure that it is not the individual's intention to seek asylum in this State and to ensure this there should be a guarantee that adequate interpretation facilities will be available at ports of entry. The council also makes the important recommendation that no person under the age of 18 should be refused permission to land in this State without consultation with the relevant agencies. NGOs and social services should be consulted in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 3(3)(b) refers to a person who has been notified of a proposal under paragraph (a) who may, within 14 days of the sending of the notification, make representations in writing to the Minister. It is recommended that this provision be amended to state &ldquo;within 14 days of receipt of the notification&rdquo; to ensure adequate time and access to the appeal procedure. This amendment should also be applied to section 3(4) because it is essential that representations should be made to an independent court or an appeal authority and that this should include the option of an oral hearing. This is an important recommendation. Irish emigrants have been welcomed abroad. The concerns of people who are dealing daily with those who are seeking asylum in this country must be addressed. It is important this should be viewed as an immigration Bill, not a deportation Bill.</P>
    <P>Section (3)(4)(c) states that &ldquo;. the Minister shall thereupon arrange for the removal of a person from the State as soon as may be, .&rdquo;  It is recommended that this paragraph be amended to take into consideration the needs and circumstances of each individual and that it should include the phrase &ldquo;within a reasonable period of <Col N="357" /> time&rdquo;. The provision allows for the possibility of the detention of families for up to eight weeks or the detention of persons suffering from medical or psychiatric conditions. This is also a matter of major concern. I hope that the Minister will take on board amendments that will be tabled to this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3(6) states that in determining whether to make a deportation order in relation to a person, the Minister shall have regard to the age of the person. I recommend this should include special reference to persons under the age of 18, taking into consideration domestic, European and international legislation and relevant guidelines governing the rights of the child. I recommend that this section should include a provision that there should be no deportation of separated children from this State.</P>
    <P>Section 3(6)(j) refers to the provisions of section 5 (prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996. This paragraph should also include reference to the provisions of other international and European human rights bodies and the European Convention on Human Rights, the convention against torture and the international covenant of civil and political rights.</P>
    <P>Section 3(10) states that a person who contravenes a provision of a deportation order or a requirement in a notice under subsection (3)(b)(ii) shall be guilty of an offence. This paragraph should also contain a safeguard to the effect that the contravention should be without reasonable cause.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with exclusion orders. There must be an opportunity for full appeal representations against exclusion orders to be made to an independent authority owing to the permanent and serious nature of the order.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the arrest, detention and removal of non-nationals. It is recommended that there should be confirmation of the existence of a deportation order within a reasonable time to avoid any period of unnecessary detention. That is an important recommendation. There must also be due regard to the age and particular circumstances of the individual. For example, women, children and mentally disturbed persons should not be removed until such time as there is full confirmation of the existence of a deportation order.</P>
    <P>Section 5(4)(b) refers to the detention of persons who have instituted legal proceedings challenging the validity of a deportation order. I recommend the removal of this paragraph on the basis that it amounts to the detention of persons legally in this State. It also has the potential to permit lengthy periods of detention, given the possibility of lengthy court proceedings. This provision acts as a deterrent to the legitimate means of challenging possible breaches of procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 7 refers to the right of the Minister to request payments for costs incurred in relation to the applicant's deportation. It must be recommended that this provision be amended to include consideration of the income and financial <Col N="358" /> status of the individual concerned. How can asylum seekers afford the cost of proceedings, given that they do not have the right to work and are dependent on social welfare payments? I recommend that section should state &ldquo;having due regard to the income and financial status of the person&rdquo;. It is important the Minister should accept this recommendation.  Red tape and bureaucracy are a feature of business. From my business experience, to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy it is necessary to match the needs of employers with the skills of employees. Asylum seekers are intelligent, highly skilled and, in many cases, highly motivated. Many of them do not wish to be on unemployment assistance and if they were granted work permits they would obtain employment. The Minister must give serious consideration to this issue.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 217,000 people on the live register but employers cannot encourage them to take up employment. I am not sure of the reasons for this but there is something wrong. People who enter the country should be put in contact with hoteliers, retailers, taxi owners and others in the services sector and given the opportunity to take up employment. These people could prove an asset to the State, not a liability. By establishing a representative body of all business and development institutions we could develop an innovative plan that would invite people to enter the country which would benefit the economy. The country is losing out because employers are refusing to develop their businesses as a result of the difficulties involved in recruiting staff.</P>
    <P>People do not want to work at weekends, they want to work Monday to Friday, nine to five. However, as everyone knows, people in the services sector can work up to 100 hours in a seven day week. We must, therefore, look to those who have a burning desire to be successful. Like those who left Ireland in the past and travelled to the UK and America to achieve success &ndash; many of them did so, proved a credit to the country and returned here with the money they earned &ndash; people who enter Ireland are ambitious and have a perception of the country as a place to work and live. They should be given every possible opportunity to do so, on an equal and fair basis, because they will be of benefit to the economy. If there are jobs available, these people should be given temporary work permits to allow them to enter the workforce where a huge need exists.</P>
    <P>If businesses in the services sector cannot attract employees, the people to whom I refer should be allowed to take up employment. I accept that we must ensure unemployment figures are reduced but that debate is proper to another Department. There is something dramatically wrong &ndash; perhaps this relates to training &ndash; when there are more than 200,000 people unemployed and employers cannot get people to work. Last week I spoke to an hotelier in Sligo who cannot get people to work for him and he has been obliged to employ staff from <Col N="359" /> France, the UK and Germany. That sends out a serious message.</P>
    <P>We should consider how to educate the people who want to come to live in Ireland and put them in contact with employers. We should give employers the choice of whether to give immigrants the opportunity to work. However, there is something dramatically wrong when we refuse them work permits and oblige them to claim social welfare. These people should be given an opportunity to see how successful they can be at integrating themselves into the economy. Employers are quite willing to give them an opportunity to come to live in Ireland, which could be done at no expense to the State.</P>
    <P>It is sad, when one considers the number of people seeking employment, that we are paying £20 million per week, £1 billion per year, in unemployment assistance. I appeal to the Minister to establish a special fund for refugees which would help to integrate them into society and deal with their many problems. As previous speakers stated, Ireland has a booming economy, with low interest rates and a highly motivated workforce which help to attract employers from abroad. We must be charitable to those who are in need of help.</P>
    <P>As already stated, in the past Government Ministers travelled to America in search of green cards which would allow people living in Border counties to go to America to find work. People also travelled to the UK and, everywhere they went, Irish people were well received. I accept that employers in America and elsewhere were delighted to gain the talents offered by Irish people, which have benefited the American economy since its foundation. However, we have entered a period when the country has a hugely successful economy and a very astute business community. We are now in a position to help those in need.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the resources perhaps not to open the flood gates entirely but to put in place a definite policy which indicates that Ireland is thankful to the nations which welcomed Irish emigrants in the past and that, as a result of our booming economy, we are now in a position to return the favour in a businesslike manner. Two weeks ago a refugee was interviewed on television. The person in question is highly skilled, highly motivated and possesses a degree but he cannot obtain a work permit. It is shocking that he is classified as being only able to claim social welfare payments when there are jobs available for which he would be suitable. The Minister must consider this issue.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the small business sector I am aware that a staggering 86,000 jobs could be created by small firms but lack of available skills is proving a huge barrier. I understand that 57 per cent of small companies are recruiting but 98 per cent of them cannot attract staff. There are 10,000 employment vacancies on offer at a time when £1 billion is being paid annually in unem<Col N="360" /> ployment supports. We must provide a framework to fill those vacancies and reduce the dole queues. More must be done for those who want to become part of the legitimate workforce.</P>
    <P> I appeal to the Minister to take on board the grave concerns of the Irish Refugee Council. We need an Immigration Bill, not a deportation Bill. On that note, I ask the Minister to invite the representatives of the business community, the private sector and those who are prepared to invest their money and take the risk of employing many of the people to whom I refer. I am sure these people will not be a cost or a burden to the State, but will be of benefit to the economy. We will then be able to hold our heads high and state that in a time of need we were here to help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Immigration Bill, 1999. Like my colleague, Deputy Daly, I will refer to our record.</P>
      <P>As a small island nation on the periphery of Europe with a relatively small population, Ireland's influence on world affairs has been immense. Having the tremendous advantage of the role our emigrants and missionaries played in the development of emerging nations, we have earned world respect for our values, caring and accommodating; our generosity, particularly in respect of development aid; our culture; our determination; and for the positions we have taken as a nation as international questions arose.</P>
      <P>Ireland has long enjoyed a natural understanding with countries in the developing world. Our understanding owes much to our past &ndash; our Famine history and the large number of Irish descendants around the world. As a result of the contribution of thousands of Irish people who emigrated and worked abroad in addition to that of the thousands involved in development projects and humanitarian relief operations across the globe, we have truly earned our reputation. I am proud of that reputation, particularly of the part played, while in Government, by Fianna Fáil in its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's future in world affairs will be even better. We must go beyond the call of duty in terms of humanitarian aid and support. Ireland's role in the European Union, the part it plays in peacekeeping efforts under the United Nations, its NGOs and its input into many other fora, clearly provides it with an active role in humanitarian and other such issues. I have been disappointed by the lack of success achieved by the EU and the UN in countries where blatant abuses of human rights have occurred. It could be said that little has been achieved in terms of stopping those abuses. Little has been done to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice or to prevent a recurrence of those crimes. We are all too aware of our failures in countries such as El Salvador, East Timor, Bosnia, China and Cambodia. While I acknowledge that resolutions, principles and proposals have been adopted by the EU and the UN and that many worthwhile and laudable <Col N="361" /> documents have been issued, what has been their success in these areas?</P>
    <P>Action that can achieve the greater integration and co-operation of the many agencies, together with a structure to ensure enforcement, is required. I appreciate the role of the many agencies and I acknowledge the communication I received from Amnesty International on the Bill. I understand others received its letter of 9 February where it outlined its concerns about the legislation. These include the request that the provisions of the Bill be checked against the European Convention on Human Rights, concern about the exclusion orders under section 4, that section 5 presents the possibility that detention centres could be introduced, that there is a necessity for applications to be properly processed and determined, that judicial review should be respected and extended to asylum seekers and that those who are deported must have the right to re-enter the State and seek asylum should future difficulties occur in their country of origin. These are valid concerns and the Minister should address them at the appropriate opportunity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the Refugee Act, 1996, should be fully operational. The number of applications for refugee status totalled 91 in 1993, 362 in 1994, 424 in 1995, 1,179 in 1996, 3,883 in 1997 and over 4,000 in 1998. This gives an aggregated figure of over 10,000 during this five year period. It demonstrates the need for the implementation of a legally defined position and structure.</P>
    <P>I have spoken openly and honestly on this subject in the past and have been misrepresented on occasion. I wholeheartedly support our EU and UN obligations towards asylum seekers. I was closely involved with some of the first programme refugees to Ireland and am pleased to say that project proved very successful. In response to a question in my name the Minister confirmed that programme refugees and support projects have been very successful.</P>
    <P>In response to another question in my name the Minister indicated the number of refugees to Ireland, their country of origin, the status and success of their applications for citizenship and, most importantly, their success in being fully integrated into the communities in which they were placed. Such information is to be welcomed because it indicates that it is easy to integrate refugees with their communities on a structured basis.</P>
    <P>I understand the purpose of the Bill is to establish procedures to enable those liable to be deported to make representations and to have them heard before decisions on deportation are made. The power to deport is a necessary part of the sovereignty of the State.</P>
    <P>While the immediate background to the Bill is the High Court judgment of 22 January, the fundamental issue it seeks to address is the backlog of several applications by asylum seekers and illegal immigrants who arrived here in the preced<Col N="362" /> ing five years and whose numbers were allowed to accumulate under the rainbow coalition Government. In this context I was amused to hear some refer Deputies to the Bill as a deportation Bill. It was wrong to allow into the country those who, in the first instance, had no right to be here. It was also wrong to allow their numbers accumulate under false pretences to the extent that they became dependent on social welfare because they were forbidden to work. Why has this arisen? Was it because a Government failed in its duties to adequately address and process the number of people claiming refugee status? I understand that is what happened and I have yet to be proved wrong on this.</P>
    <P>In response to another question in my name I received information on the number of applications that were processed, withdrawn, approved and those that went to first stage and appeal stage. The facts speak for themselves and reflect the sad neglect of previous years. In 1994, 362 people came to the country seeking asylum. This increased to 424 in 1995, 1,179 in 1996 and 3,883 in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I only have a few minutes left. Over half of the total number currently awaiting processing of their applications arrived here during the period of office of the rainbow coalition Government. The then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs encouraged people to come, reflecting the views of the vast majority of Irish people that those fleeing persecution under the terms of the Geneva Convention should receive a warm welcome on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, illegal immigrants who had no right to travel here were equally encouraged to come. They sometimes travelled at great risk to themselves and their families, yet there was no mechanism to indicate to them that if they arrived and had no right to be here they would be deported, whereas if they had the right to be here as refugees they would be offered accommodation, their applications would be processed and considered favourably and they would obtain the necessary documentation to allow them enjoy the full rights of any Irish citizen, to seek work and secure a home for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly that did not happen, rather there was an <Col N="363" /> accumulation of people clogging up the process. Regrettably, the genuine refugee is part of that process and cannot be considered ahead of the others. He must take his place in the queue of 10,000 and God knows how long it will take the Department to adequately address the number of applicants before them.</P>
    <P>We spent approximately £50 million in 1998 on illegal immigrants and asylum seekers. I would support such expenditure if I were satisfied we were spending it on people who had a right to be here and who would participate in Irish society. I have no doubt they would have a lot to offer our economy and culture. However, I regret that the figures to date show that a large number of people who apply for refugee status have no right to be here.</P>
    <P>I am proud that in 1998 we spent £137 million on official development assistance. That is a substantial amount of money and represents a substantial percentage increase in recent years. It reflects the Government's continuing commitment to assist those in need.</P>
    <P>We should spend £50 million on ensuring that the applications of genuine refugees are processed as quickly as possible and that they are integrated into society. A number of people have put their own lives and those of their families at risk by travelling to this country knowing they had no right to come here, but hoping it would take the system three, four or five years to process their applications.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the skills shortage in Ireland and the fact that many of these people have skills and should be given temporary work permits. I am not sure we should give them false hope. If they were fleeing persecution under the terms of the 1951 Geneva Convention and claiming refugee status in this country, everyone would want their applications to be processed as quickly as possible and a favourable decision made. They would also want accommodation to be provided for them so that they could be integrated into our community and workforce. We would cherish the value they would add to our economy and culture. However, it is wrong to say they could drive taxis or work in the service industry.</P>

Some of these people, whether they are genuine or illegal immigrants, may not know a lot about our country or our language. It is wrong to suggest that we can use them as a stopgap in our service industry.</P>

      <P>It is wrong that illegal immigrants travel to this country in the hope that they can get social welfare benefits and good housing. It would be wrong to give such people a temporary work permit and to raise their hopes of remaining here. This compounds the problems faced by genuine refugees who have lost their families, friends and home bases. They are living in limbo and depending on the social welfare system of this State while their applications are being considered with those who do not have a right to be here. This is bunging up the system and preventing genuine refugees, who have a lot to offer the State, from having their applications processed rapidly so that they can participate in the workforce and put down their roots if that is their desire. The refugee programme, in which I was involved, was a success because the proper structure was in place.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to deport people because of what happened during 1996 and 1997 when the largest number of asylum seekers came to this country seeking refugee status.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callely's contribution was extraordinary. It was cloaked in innuendo and he used the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; 15 times. I am amazed that a Member of this House should question the right of people to move throughout the world, given that Irish people have done so in the past. There are 42 million people of Irish descent in the United States, seven million in Australia, at least ten million in Britain and another 15 to 20 million scattered throughout the world. We would not take it kindly if our ancestors had been told they did not have the right to remain on those foreign shores. Perhaps they did not, but they may not have had many other options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should show charity towards those who are not as well off as we are. We should remember our history and the reasons people left their native shore. Our people did not leave of their own free will, but because they did not have a choice. There were serious economic reasons for doing so and many of them did well when they emigrated. What is most worrying about the previous speaker's remarks is the repetition of the word &ldquo;right&rdquo;. Why do we believe we are right? What gives us the right to pre-determine anybody <Col N="365" /> else's rights if we are supposed to be a free society? I agree we should not advertise, inviting people here from all over the world. It is fair to say that we do not want criminals or those who organise and transport others on the back of a truck charging them £1,000 before dumping them in this country, but we should be broadminded enough to consider what drives people to this and treat them in a humane fashion when they arrive. If it transpires that they are genuine refugees they should be speedily assessed and treated sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure they do not want to remain away from their native land anymore than our ancestors who left their native shore. We should not cod ourselves into believing that people will move elsewhere to get some of the gravy to which Deputy Callelly referred. We should look at the plight of the people presenting and determine whether we have it in our heart to look after them. We are known as Ireland of the welcomes, a warm charitable nation, and we should display those characteristics. Let us remember that our people had to wander over the face of the earth for a long time. We tend to become self-righteous, but who are we to say that others do not have a right to live here? </P>
    <P>Economic refugees are not a new phenomenon. The principles of the Dublin Convention need to be applied. The European Union and Ireland as a member state have to live up to their responsibilities. The previous speaker was very critical of the previous Government which held office up to 18 months ago. Apparently a new Administration has to be in office for two or three years before accepting responsibility. The Government has been in office since June 1997. If the problem were as bad as Deputy Callelly made it out to be I would have thought the incoming Administration would have moved with alacrity. Perhaps it takes 18 months to activate it.</P>
    <P>I am not encouraging people to come here regardless of their circumstances, but that does not mean that we should become authoritarian in our approach to them. Members have referred to the services for immigrants such as subsidised housing. I am quite sure they would be more anxious to get a work permit, even a temporary work permit which is available in many other countries. I do not understand why we cannot readily adopt that practice here. Instead we make immigrants wait for a period of two to three years before their files are processed. Why? It is not unreasonable that those who are willing to work should do so. I do not understand why we prohibit them from working. Deputy Callelly fears that some of these people may become taxi drivers. If they do a job they are fulfilling a role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being fair but I found the tirade from the other side embarrassing.</P>
      <P>We need to address this issue as a society. We know what it is like to be unemployed and feel unsafe in our own country. We should not be so ready to presume the worst about everybody else. We need to learn a little bit of Christian charity. We do not wish to attract people involved in organised crime as we have enough problems ourselves, but the person who genuinely finds himself homeless in his own country for political, economic or other reasons has the right to have his case heard. As a member of the European Union we have to look at their case otherwise our people have no case to go throughout the world. Thousands of Irish people have emigrated across the globe. We are on thin ice when we adopt a superior attitude to political refugees or immigrants. We have always lived up to our duty to political refugees but there appears to be some resistance to them in recent times. Now people are asking what right they have to be here. That is not a fair point.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International and human rights organisations have reservations about this Bill and I share their concerns. In my experience, the time it takes to process applications is not acceptable. I am not satisfied that every individual can be assured his or her case will be dealt with fairly and equitably. I am not casting aspersions on the people who deal with them, but some people, by virtue of their lack of language proficiency, might not be able to explain their case as well as others or have an opportunity to tell the officials concerned what their circumstances are. They might make a mistake, which is easily done when one is not familiar with the language. They could find themselves facing a deportation order when they are genuinely entitled to be here. I have considerable reservations about the manner in which the Bill proposes to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Perry says he is not sure whether this is an immigration or a deportation Bill. I am not happy with the number of references to deportation. His point relating to availability for employment is generally accepted. Employment is available for the person who wishes to work and it should be possible for that person at least to get a temporary work permit so that he or she can become self-supporting. All of us understand how resentment is generated if people see others benefiting from the system to a greater extent than themselves. Obviously, these people should <Col N="367" /> be allowed to seek employment and this would eliminate the prejudice generated by precluding these people from entering the workforce.</P>
    <P>If immigrants or refugees are excluded from the workforce they are also excluded from housing. How can they be housed other than through the current system with subsidies from health boards, etc.? Of course, it would be better if they were able to house themselves having obtained employment. Employment is the key factor. They cannot help themselves because they are excluded from employment and, as a result, they appear to be a burden on the system. It is not their fault, but ours. We created the system and should not cod ourselves by assuming that they came here specifically to be a burden. I deal with cases involving people who have qualifications and are willing to work for six months or one year while awaiting processing of their applications, but that does not happen generally.</P>
    <P>It is always easier for the person with the better education, flair for language or higher IQ to deal with the system than the unfortunate who is poor, has no resources or back up and low self-esteem. If everybody is entitled to equal treatment under the law, then the person who is poor and dependent on the system should be able to avail of the services available in a similar manner to the professional who applies for a work permit, etc.. Despite the proposals in the Bill, that does not apply and some unfortunate people when they are asked questions in a language not entirely familiar to them are fearful of the outcome.</P>
    <P>All of us know better than anybody else. When we meet constituents who must send questionnaires back to various Departments, we know the answers and the response that must be given to certain questions. What happens to the unfortunate person who is not familiar with the language, does not know about bureaucracy and administration and is faced with it for the first time? What chance have they unless they are well versed? Again, the better educated come off best and that is not the way it should be. We need to look at ourselves carefully.</P>

I also hope that we will look at the situation of refugees and immigrants in a different light from heretofore. We can afford to be charitable and broad minded in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all other speakers with regard to organised crime and criminals. We do not want such people and they need to be screened at an early stage. There should not be a difficulty with that. We have enough problems without importing them. However, the other side of the coin is that everybody should not be treated as a <Col N="368" /> potential criminal and there is a danger that by keeping them under review for long periods they will become cynical about our system. We cannot and should not allow that to happen.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I agree that the word &ldquo;deportation&rdquo; is mentioned frequently in it. Obviously, this legislation has been introduced as a consequence of the High Court case. The Bill refers to confirming existing alien orders with certain exceptions and gives the impression that it is very negative, especially section 32, which states that the Bill has no significant financial implications. One might get the impression that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not spending money in this area, but he has been successful in obtaining funding for increased staffing in his Department to deal with genuine refugees who apply for citizenship.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what has been said in the media, Ireland is still the island of the welcomes. The Taoiseach stated that more than £100 million was spent last year on economic refugees and those fleeing from conflict. The money was spent on health services and housing. Criticism of refugees comes primarily from people who are on housing lists and are concerned about whether there is enough housing for our own people. The other area that has been mentioned is job creation.</P>
      <P>The Governments and people of the United States, Great Britain and other European countries and Australia have been very generous to Irish immigrants. The Ceann Comhairle led a delegation to New York, Washington and Boston last May and the Irish immigrant groups we met spoke about the tightening of regulations relating to Irish people seeking employment in the United States. It was suggested that the United States Congress and Senate should consider introducing a temporary visa for Irish citizens. Within two months the US Administration introduced a five year visa. That was a welcome development. The Government should consider introducing a temporary visa for citizens of Third World countries. It appears such a policy will be adopted by many European countries. I understand Irish missionaries have been seeking employment opportunities for Jamaican citizens in the hotel and catering industry in which there is a skills shortage.</P>
      <P>On housing, refugees tend to congregate in our cities and major towns. They should be assisted to relocate in other areas. Rural Resettlement Ireland and other organisations have been successful in securing accommodation in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On social welfare, persons with no fixed abode or in temporary accommodation have no option but to live in a town in which an employment exchange is located. This creates problems and will create problems for refugees.  For many <Col N="369" /> years members of the traveller community encountered problems in obtaining their entitlements. I am aware that in Galway the address of &ldquo;c/o Eyre Square&rdquo; has been given. Individuals should be assisted to find permanent accommodation and allowed to sign on at their local Garda station. The origins of the problem can be traced back to 1981 when an attempt was made to tackle fraud.</P>
    <P>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has made clear what is required of the Government, which is complying with the regulations. The Minister will always receive bad publicity whenever there is a delay in processing an application or a refugee is deported but the policies laid down by the United Nations are sound. Legislation is in train and changes have been made to deal with applications speedily.</P>
    <P>Attention has been drawn at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the many conflicts throughout the world which have a bearing on the number of refugees arriving here. Shannon Airport is one of the main points of entry for those fleeing persecution as well as for economic refugees. I commend organisations such as the Irish Red Cross Society in the Clare and Limerick region on the assistance it provides. Many have come here in lorries and trucks, organised by the godfathers of crime, in appalling and dangerous conditions and over long distances.</P>
    <P>There is an exchange programme between Kilkerrin in County Galway and a town in Bosnia. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has the wrong title. It deals solely with deportation and results from a court case. There is not a state in the world which does not have the right to deport individuals if they do not meet certain criteria.</P>
      <P>We cannot forget our history. Millions of Irish people have emigrated to all corners of the globe. They have been welcomed in almost every country and done extremely well. Some 40 million Americans claim an Irish family connection. We must be conscious of this when discussing refugees and we must remember we have a responsibility to take care of those who come here looking for help, whether they are fleeing persecution or have serious economic or other problems.</P>
      <P>Many people say this Government is not doing enough or that the last Government is at fault. It is not the fault of either. The economy changed for the better and suddenly a great deal of old legislation which had not been touched in years became completely useless in our new circumstances. This hit the previous Government first and it was caught off guard by the rapidly changing situation. One could criticise it and the current Minister for not moving quickly enough &ndash; I would not. It is a changing situation and we are all guilty of being slow in our response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister has done his best to try to resolve a serious problem with which he had to deal when he took up office. He has dramatically increased the number of staff working in this area and acted <Col N="370" /> quickly on this legislation. I am delighted that he gave us a commitment that he will implement the Refugee Act, 1996, in the near future. He is also going to introduce anti-trafficking legislation which is very necessary. People are being loaded on to trucks which are arriving in England and Ireland. It has become a huge problem in England; I watched a documentary about it recently. The trucks are coming from France and people are making huge amounts of money from transporting these unfortunate people to England.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also given a commitment that he intends to change the Aliens Act, 1935. The first thing I would ask him to do is to change the awful title; aliens are from space and we are dealing with people. The idea of asking people to go to the Aliens Office is an embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I presume we will all defend our own side on this matter. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, which I chair, invited the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to address it. I expected it to be critical of us, but it was not. It was very positive about what the Government has done, what it is doing and what it intends to do. It believes that if we introduce the Refugee Act and other legislation, Ireland could be a model for other countries.</P>
    <P>This problem is not unique to Ireland but is huge right across Europe. Many countries are handling it a great deal worse than we are. However, that does not let us off the hook or mean that we should not handle this in the fairest and best way possible. We should be more aware of people in difficulty than most countries because of our history. It is essential that we think of our emigrants when discussing this matter.</P>
    <P>The regulations regarding the right to work should be changed. People should be allowed the dignity to work. Many refugees live in my constituency and they are frustrated because they are not allowed to work. They feel this adds to the difficulties with, and pressure from, the local community. We must be careful we do not make the mistake made in England, where refugees were pushed into certain areas. This leads to enormous pressures as many living in these areas are frightened because they see their area changing. They need to be brought along with this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends to fund an anti-racism campaign. This is long overdue and is a problem which must be nipped in the bud before it gets out of hand, as it has done in many other countries. It is important that people should be allowed to work as it gives them dignity and self-esteem. If others see they are looking after themselves they cannot complain about them being in the country. As Deputy Durkan said, we have no right to complain. We can be very sanctimonious in asking why they should be here. Why should we be in Australia, America, England and other countries?</P>
    <P>I will not look at this Bill in isolation as it is part of a package. I welcome the commitments given by the Minister on other legislation. I hope <Col N="371" /> that by the end of this year the full package will be in place so that people who come to Ireland will receive a fair hearing and that if they are under pressure for any reason, whether political or economic, they can live here and hopefully thrive in our community. I have no doubt that this country will benefit from people coming from other places. Our people have benefited other countries by living there. I have no doubt that immigrants will help us develop our economy and culture.</P>
    <P>A number of groups have written to us in the past few days about amendments. I hope the Minister will examine a number of amendments which Amnesty International and other groups have suggested. I have not looked at them in detail as one amendment only arrived today. Certain areas need to be addressed. The Minister has shown in the past that he is willing to consider amendments to legislation, and I hope he will do so on this Bill. I welcome the Bill as part of an overall package which will hopefully make it a great deal easier for people to come to this country and stay if they wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill as it is an issue on which there should be a common understanding across all parties. There is an underlying tension on this issue which relates to racism. I read Deputy Noel Ahern's speech and I listened to Deputy Ivor Callely's contribution. I do not believe that either Deputy is a racist. I do not believe they adhere to the philosophy of racism which believes that people who are not white, western or Christian are in some way lesser human beings than those of us who are.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Ahern is certainly a conservative politician, and he is, if I am to place him on the political spectrum, right of centre. That does not make him a racist. At least Deputy Ahern has the good quality of being consistent in his conservatism and he applies it across the board to a range of issues. He is entitled to his views on these matters. He did a valuable service in this House by drawing attention to the fears in the community about refugees coming to Ireland. We will not deal with that issue by ignoring it. I do not happen to agree with the solutions he offers, some of which verge on the infringement of human rights. He is conscious of the risks he runs in terms of expressing these fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ivor Callely is a different kettle of fish. I do not regard him as a racist but as a political opportunist. He is driven by competition for political support in his constituency. When he sees an issue where he can lead the band he milks it for all it is worth. When he commenced his script I thought he had a conversion because the opening was reasonable and rational and good in terms of tackling the previous Government. Once he went off script he tended, like an elastic band, to revert to his normal approach to politics. That <Col N="372" /> is unfortunate because if we address this issue in a party political opportunist way we will set up a conflict in society which is unnecessary because the numbers here and the numbers likely to be here will be relatively small and, as Deputy Eoin Ryan has said, will be beneficial to society in general, our culture and to the economy in a whole range of ways. That people coming from other cultures into Ireland can only be to our long-term benefit. Happily there are few Deputy Ivor Callelys in the House.</P>
    <P>It is important to maintain a consensus that we do not want racism in the House or in society and that we will do everything possible in educational and legislative terms to ensure it does not take root in any significant way. Racism derives from fear, generally the fear of those who are least well off in society that people are not getting things which they would get if the immigrant or refugee did not claim it. That is how it expresses itself. It is important that as public representatives we constantly disabuse people of that thought.</P>
    <P>In Irish culture no less than western culture generally, there is a sense that people not from Europe are different. In past centuries those who made the so-called discovery of America and other parts of the world &ndash; I say so-called because people lived in these places long before either the Spanish, the English or anybody else sailed out in search of new resources and places to expand &ndash;  and took control of these places regarded the indigenous people as barbarians. That notion continues to run through much of the culture of western Europe. It will take a conscious effort on the part of the educational authorities here to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the European Parliament produced a report on the issue of racism and xenophobia which made various proposals. It carried out a country by country analysis, including Ireland, of the situation in relation to discrimination in the European Union. Paragraph 38.1 of the report states that Ireland has a non-EC population of only about 18,000. According to Patrick Cooney, the country has been remarkably free &ldquo;of such problems as there is not a large presence of foreigners&rdquo;. It may be a matter of historical interest that one of the reasons the Refugee Act, 1996, has not been implemented is that it has been challenged by the same Patrick Cooney on the basis of ageism, as I understand it. That report made a range of recommendations for the European Parliament, the European Council and member states from education to putting in place mechanisms to ensure people would be protected against racism but also to ensure people knew their rights in regard to discrimination on the basis of race.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people who have approached me in relation to their concerns about refugees and so on invariably preface their remarks by saying, &ldquo;I am not a racist&rdquo;. I have no doubt that is their genuine belief. Occasionally I have had calls from people who blatantly acknowledge they are racist. I had a call from a <Col N="373" /> man one night in my office who proceeded to berate Deputy Liz McManus and me because we proposed an amnesty for refugees. He said they were all criminals, that he had worked in England and knew how these kinds of people destroyed the place and that these blacks would destroy the country. I pointed out there were significant numbers of people born in Ireland who are black and were as Irish as himself. I asked if he was a Christian. He said: &ldquo;Yes, I am. I know what you will say next &ndash; that God made all people equal&rdquo;. However, they do not all turn out equal. That is the fundamental root of racism. It will take an effort on our part to ensure that kind of attitude does not take root in any significant way. It would be well worthwhile for the Minister to revert to the European Parliament's 1991 recommendations on what ought to be done to deal with the issue of racism and xenophobia.</P>
    <P>The Bill is styled the Immigration Bill, 1999. It is clear from the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's speech that this is a deportation Bill, not an immigration Bill. In fairness the Minister should amend the title to describe it as such. His opening statement to the Dáil was:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to bring before this House my proposals for putting on a statutory footing the principles governing the power to deport and the procedures to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected when deportation is being contemplated in any case.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense to use the style Immigration Bill on what is admitted by the Minister to be a deportation Bill. We need an immigration policy and to ensure that the Refugee Act, 1996 is implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he will shortly introduce an amendment to the 1996 Act which will render it implementable. When the Bill was drafted the number of refugees seeking asylum in Ireland was in the low hundreds. Now there are thousands of such refugees and some change in the legislation is necessary. Nevertheless, I cannot understand why it has taken since June 1997 to introduce what are essentially simple and straightforward amendments to ensure the commissioner will not be required to hear all cases and that all appeals do not have to go before a five person appeals board. Other mechanisms should have been put in place much sooner.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's proposal to update the Aliens Act, 1935. He spoke about his intention to modernise the legislation to suit the current circumstances. It would be helpful and useful if the Minister produced a discussion document on immigration. We have entered a different phase in the development of our society and economy and it is important that immigration policy is not driven solely by the demands of IBEC for cheap labour for low skilled work.</P>
    <P>Immigration policy should ensure that we assist those who need to find another place to live, regardless of their country of origin, either <Col N="374" /> because they have political difficulties or because they simply cannot survive in terms of their capacity to earn a living in their country of origin. It should also seek to enhance the culture and diversity of our society which will, in itself, inevitably bring about a re-examination of how we view ourselves, our structures and our practices.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a small point that has been at the back of my mind for some time. I do not do so in a contentious way. The House opens its business every day with a prayer to the Christian God. There are atheists and Jews in this House and, until the last general election, one of its Members was a Muslim. Small things such as that need to be addressed. It will not change the world or end our sense of who and what we are if we acknowledge that this House reflects the diversity in Irish society.</P>
    <P>An immigration Bill is important but it should be preceded by a policy document which outlines the Government's thinking on how immigration will impact on our society and can be enabled to have a positive impact. It should be open, transparent and welcoming. The Minister said current Government policy on immigration is simple. That is true. At present it merely consists of the application of the Aliens Act. If all that is envisaged for the new Bill is to tweak that Act a little in order to fill labour shortages, the Minister will miss an ideal opportunity to address the real changes that are taking place under our eyes.</P>
    <P>It is important that this Bill is renamed. It is also important that the fears about this Bill being expressed by organisations which are dealing with refugees each day are addressed. It shocked me to discover that the Minister will have the power to deport somebody in the interests of the common good. Who will define &ldquo;common good&ldquo;? The phrase is open to all types of definition depending on the Minister's view or the view of the official who will make the decision. The phrase should be defined more precisely.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that the State must be enabled to deport people under certain circumstances. However, that law should not be used simply as a shortcut to denying refugees or asylum seekers the right to arrive in this country and apply for asylum. It is obnoxious to define people who come to this country through the back or front door as &ldquo;illegal immigrants&rdquo;. It implies that they are criminals and I do not accept that the vast majority of the people who come to this country are criminals. I appeal to people to be careful in their use of language and to be aware of the impact it will have outside the House.</P>
    <P>Other Members pointed out that Ireland has sent millions of its people abroad. Approximately one million people living in the United Kingdom are Irish born. It is estimated that 40 million people around the world are of Irish extraction. In the 1980s, about 100,000 Irish born young people were in the United States without papers. They were referred to as the undocumented. However, the reverse case can be made. Back in the mists of time Ireland was an empty island. <Col N="375" /> Irish people are migrants; our ancestors came to this island from somewhere else at some point in history &ndash; in the last 100, 500, 1,000 or 5,000 years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to people to cop on and exercise common sense. I also appeal to Deputy Callely and anybody else who is tempted to be opportunistic on this issue to resist. They will do more harm than good to Irish society.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome this Bill. It gives the House an opportunity to debate an issue which has been of concern for some time. The majority of Members have debated this matter in a calm manner and put forward excellent suggestions and ideas to which I hope the Minister will give a good deal of consideration.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that we now live in a different Ireland. When we grew up emigration was rampant. Young people were leaving Ireland in their thousands for the UK and America. When I was first elected to this House in 1982 the queues outside the passport office stretched down Molesworth Street to the gates of the Dáil. All Members were concerned and annoyed about it and we are relieved that the trend has been reversed. Immigration is now the issue on our minds. In the past 18 months fruit growers in Wexford have told me they are looking to Poland and to Russia for workers to pick their fruit because of the difficulties in getting local pickers. I spoke to a person today who told me that some companies are considering bringing in skilled Russian IT workers. There is obviously a major change in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Wexford last summer we had a major influx of Romanians and other nationalities who came into the county through Rosslare. At one stage there were approximately 500 of these people in the county. There was concern about this, particularly among those on housing waiting lists, those applying for supplementary welfare and others living in substandard flats or apartments. They felt that once these people had arrived in Wexford they would get a better deal than the locals. Rumours circulated last week to the effect that ten people had been housed by Wexford Corporation, but when the facts were checked out that was found not to be the case. Certain people, for their own reasons, were trying to create fear among the locals. In fact, the local housing officer and community welfare officers dealt with the problem in a calm and considered manner. They housed people in what could be called upmarket apartments but they were in the urban renewal areas and were vacant at the time. Rather than allow these people live on the streets in substandard conditions, they were housed in these apartments. They were given social welfare benefits, clothing allowances and were generally well looked after. A number of weeks later some of these people were relocated to Cork, Cavan and Monaghan and there are now approximately 120 families currently in Wexford being cared for by <Col N="376" /> the local community welfare officer on a weekly income basis.</P>
    <P>The 120 families currently living in Wexford will not go away and it is time that the Minister consulted with the people on the ground, be it in Wexford or other areas of the country, and devised a long-term solution to this problem. I see able-bodied men and women standing in Redmond Square in Wexford and the Market Square in Enniscorthy who could be allowed into the work environment and given recognition. If somebody has a criminal record I would not like to see them remain here but from talking to the gardaí and people in the local community it would appear these people are not involved in any irregular activities, they do not get involved in rows or attack old people and are generally well behaved.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of these people are living in the country as a whole but in Wexford we are only talking about 100 or 120 families. They have been living for most of the past year in County Wexford and are well behaved. They are entitled to some kind of recognition, to go on the housing waiting list and to apply for social welfare benefit. They should be considered for employment because many people in the tourism industry, and in some of the more skilled industries, have contacted me to know if these people will be allowed to work under a proper system. Some of these people are working illegally but they are being exploited. In some cases they are paid £1 or £1.50 per hour and we should not allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would introduce amending legislation to make the 1996 Act fully operational but in doing that we should not bring in legislation that gives the impression that these people will be deported. We should make them feel welcome because it is important that we are seen to be a caring nation.</P>
    <P>Once the people of Wexford overcame their initial fears that they would be overrun by asylum seekers or refugees, they made these people feel welcome. We had a problem in that Rosslare is the main port of entry from the UK and France and people were coming into Wexford in droves in the backs of trucks. The local authorities and social welfare officers had the task of dealing with the issue. If one travels to the UK or to Le Havre it is difficult to get through customs without some kind of check, yet 50 or 60 people could get into the port of Rosslare undetected in the back of a truck. I question the bona fides of the French, Italian, German and UK Governments who appeared to turn a blind eye to what was happening. According to EU law, the country of first entry shall look after these people but many of these countries ensured the immigrants would only be detected in Rosslare, Dublin or Shannon. As a result, Ireland was faced with a major difficulty.</P>
    <P>I agree with the speaker who stated earlier that this problem should not be left to two or three counties. We are playing our part in Wexford and <Col N="377" /> I hope other counties will do the same. The Minister referred to 5,000 people per year now seeking some type of status here and I hope they will be located evenly throughout the country. The Minister is going about this matter the right way and is showing a caring attitude in dealing with it. He has increased the staff in his Department, which has resulted in applications being dealt with more quickly. I hope that will continue in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have the people currently living in various parts of the country assessed and if some are known to be criminals or associated with criminals I would not object to their being deported. However, the majority of the families living in the south-east are decent people. They merely want to settle down here, be given the right to work and become part of Irish society. I hope the Minister will consider doing that.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies stated today and yesterday that we are an uncaring country. I do not accept that. We have been very tolerant. I would like to see the situation dealt with fairly so that people who come to this country, for political or economic reasons, are given a fair hearing and are integrated into society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made that this Bill should be called a deportation Bill because of the use of that word in the explanatory memorandum and in the Bill itself. The Minister gives the impression that we want to deport people rather than welcome them.</P>
      <P>Immigration is an emotive issue. A genuine fear exists among those who do not know better that there are difficulties with the number of refugees entering the State. This Bill is negative in that it gives the wrong impression to those people. The deportation aspect is dealt with first, not the processes being put in place to deal with those seeking residence.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ryan when he makes the point that no Government is to blame. I certainly do not blame civil servants in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The economic situation in Ireland has improved. Before that improvement the only form of migration we knew was the departure of people. Now Ireland is known throughout the world as an economic success which has accrued major benefits. When we were emigrating we did not go to countries which were in severe economic difficulties but to countries where it was possible to find work. That is why people are coming to Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have to deal with the consequences of our economic success and we must do so quickly. We did not have the resources in place previously. I assume this is the first of a number of pieces of legislation being brought to the House to deal with immigration. If that is the case I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is becoming more multiracial by the day. Anyone walking down any major street will see people of different colours and creeds. That is a good thing for Ireland. The role we <Col N="378" /> played as immigrants was of great benefit to other countries.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that we need to educate people about what will happen. Refugees seeking entry will be a matter of everyday life. We must allay the fears of the public that these people will come into their areas and take their jobs. There are fears that if they are put into one section of a city or town, it will become ghettoised and property prices will fall. You cannot blame people for such fears &ndash; this was not an issue we had to deal with as a society in the past. We should put in place an education programme which will encourage people to be positive about people coming into the country who can play an important role in our economic and cultural development.</P>
    <P>Scenes which occurred outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because immigrants felt their rights were not being recognised created an image that the country was being taken over. The media hyped that image because it was a good news story. The number of people applying for residency is not huge, although it is certainly larger than before. The Minister and the Government must put in place a process to deal with applications as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of being an illegal immigrant in the United States. It is not a nice situation in which to find oneself. You cannot participate in society, you cannot have a bank account, you work and hope that you are not caught by the immigration authorities. You live in fear that some day you will be found out and deported. That would have serious consequences for you and your family. I can understand the fear felt by refugees in this country when they find themselves in a state of limbo. There are Irish people who feel these people are living off the State. They have no choice unless they work for unscrupulous employers who pay them £2 an hour. If they are caught they are immediately deported.</P>
    <P>Refugees can play a positive role. The Government, in the short-term, should allow refugees or immigrants to work, especially those who have applied for legal status. If their application takes longer than two months to process, they should be allowed to work. There are obvious labour shortages in the service industries, although we should be careful that we are not seen to suggest that the only work an immigrant can get is in the low paid service sector.</P>
    <P>Going back to my experience in America, those of us there were delighted to work in the service industry for a start. It gave a sense of working for one's keep and paying one's way. With such an outcry from employers in the service sector about the lack of workers, this would be a way of filling genuine job vacancies and would give refugees or immigrants a sense that they belonged and that there is a future here for them. The Government should look at implementing legislation on this for the short-term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> A Russian constituent of mine who is a qualified engineer living in Sligo came to me some time ago. He works for a reputable firm in the Sligo area but he received a letter from a Government Department &ndash; I am not sure whether it was the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Enterprise, Trade or Employment &ndash; stating that he would be deported and had 14 days to appeal. Based on the information I was given, he already had a work permit, which his firm had applied for, and he was in a very steady relationship with a local girl. That situation created a great amount of difficulty for him and the families of those who knew him, and I felt that I was unable, as a public representative, to give them any confidence that the matter would be dealt with or to get information from the Department. Eventually everything worked out, but procedures should be better. I know the Minister has allocated more staff to the immigration section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the people there are trying their best, but we still have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being paid for housing as a fire brigade action sticks in my craw. A lot of these people have to stay in bed and breakfast accommodation. I put down a parliamentary question on this matter and cannot remember the exact cost, but it was quite high. If we had a plan in place, that money could be spent in a better way. We are throwing good money after bad and not solving the problem. We are housing people on a temporary basis and then putting them into local authority houses without solving the issue.</P>
    <P>Immigration is a major issue for Irish society, and I ask the Government to deal with this urgently, as money is not being spent well in fire brigade actions on this issue. If we had a plan in place to deal with the people coming into the country, the money would be better spent. Refugees would feel much more involved, that they had a role to play in the development of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel strongly about this legislation. It is a great tragedy that we are considering legislation which is effectively the housekeeping of deportation rather than discussing the principles of a policy on refugees or migrants. What is happening to the Refugee Act, 1996, is little less than constitutionally outrageous. It is not open to any Government to announce that an Act passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas will not be implemented, yet this is what has been said. I continue to have the greatest admiration for the public service, but I doubt they would provide the Minister of State with the opinion that the 1996 Act &ndash; a law passed by the Oireachtas &ndash; should not be implemented because they have decided that it would place too much of an administrative demand. If that were the case, it would be little less than administrative subversion of the constitutional division of powers between the Oireachtas and the Administration. It would <Col N="380" /> be and is a matter of the most serious kind, and it is unacceptable that any Government should decide on such a flimsy basis not to implement legislation. The moral imperative faced in the history of Parliaments &ndash; not only here but abroad &ndash; was that if one found oneself in such a position one would revoke the legislation and replace it. Is this happening here? Thankfully not. However, the 1996 Act is on the Statute Book, and let us see it implemented. Let those who do not believe in that Act have the courage to say they do not believe in it. It is the law of the land, and we are being asked to pass on the nod a knee-jerk reaction to a decision of the courts on deportation as a substitute for what I have stated is the law of the land and what I suggest is a necessary policy.</P>
      <P>When I think of how rapidly we can move backwards on matters like this, I feel that insufficient tribute is paid to Dr. Paddy Hillery. When European Commissioner he worked very hard at introducing a charter for migrants and migrant workers. For good or ill, part of my training as far back as 1968 involved graduate study of the sociology of migration. When I came back to Ireland I taught the only course in the sociology of migration on the island of Ireland. I often thought at that time that courses were being taught in everything but that we were turning our faces away from one of the most traumatic experiences in our own lives. I refer not just to the Famine losses of 1 million people in a year, or 3 million if one added the deaths of the whole period, but also the great seasonal migrations that occurred before the Famine and other migrations. I am interested to this day in the moral content of the response to the position of migrants.</P>
      <P>In the last few years, including my time as Minister, I supplied the Garda with letters I received that were racist and threatening. Those letters were directed against specific communities in Ireland. I was filled with disgust by what was in those letters. It means that one cannot take anything for granted, even in a country that has scattered its population across the world in different levels of despair and desperation. We are very proud of putting up statues of little Annie and others arriving, suitcase in hand, wondering if they will get a reception. We are very interested in hearing of celebrations in Grosse Ile in Canada and coffin ships lying off the harbour with people afraid to board.</P>
      <P>Outstanding work has been done by Dr. Frances Finnegan on the Irish who flooded into York through Liverpool at the time of the Famine. It is interesting to read of the opposition directed against them at that time &ndash; it was asked whether Britain could afford to take them in. In Dr. Finnegan's book, <i>Poverty and Prejudice</i>, published by Cork University Press in the 1970s, there is a description of the death of Teddy McAndrew from Sligo, a young father with children who was not allowed into the poor house and died on the side of the road, and the interest taken in that and other cases by the Tooge family from York, who were Quakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> What is so predominant in the Irish psyche that suggests the issue is responding to the court's discomfort, which put an inhibition on sending people away, while the law of the land is not implemented because it would put too much strain on the system to do what the House has democratically decided? I challenge the Government, if it thinks the 1996 Act is defective, to come into the House and say so. It should not behave unconstitutionally and subversively by offering reasons of administrative resources or unanticipated demand &ndash;&ldquo;the problem was bigger than we thought&rdquo;&ndash; to frustrate the law of the land. What kind of a laughing stock is this? How derisory it is to say that this is the country which rushed to get its deportation procedures right but could not implement its Refugee Act or give the guarantees it is required to give under international agreements as to the safety of those seeking asylum. The rhetoric it used to dress up this nonsense of a shabby policy was regularly to misquote the opinion of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and her office &ndash; that applied not just to this Government but to the one of which I was a member.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly on this issue. We have a moral responsibility to get our asylum obligations right, to debate publicly and in these Houses our policy on migration, the rights and otherwise which are attendant on it, and the conditions under which we embrace other people, as we should, and then to debate the appropriate powers of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One cannot, however, place instrumental actions on a status above one's moral obligations or the law of the land.</P>
    <P>How strange it is to hear people with Irish names running campaigns which say &ldquo;we have enough of them here&rdquo;. In the 1950s half of my family emigrated before they reached 17 years of age. My father was the youngest member of his family; the elder members had emigrated before he was born. During my time as a Member of the Oireachtas, I heard it said that in so far as we had an immigration policy, it was to keep Ireland white. This matter is not only about skin colour; the organisation of opposition to immigrants has much to do with economics &ndash; those who have crawled up must not be asked to share anything with those who are arriving and looking for some economic crumbs from what we have managed to create.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if what I am saying is amusing because I am not speaking for amusement. Neither am I speaking about my training in the sociology of migration or quoting the experiences of my father, my immediate family or myself for amusement. Nor am I quoting, except with disgust, what I have heard said about the immigration policy, if there was one, being based on colour. That is not true now and I am not attributing that policy to this Government. I know it is anxious, as any Government would be, to resolve the matter of massive movements internationally but relatively moderate movements into Ireland. <Col N="382" /> No one could describe the figures we have seen as an invasion &ndash; we are not being swamped or overwhelmed, and the native Irish psyche will not be damaged by the people who want to come here. Do any of the people saying those things have relatives who left Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s and saw lovely, neat messages in windows reading, &ldquo;No Irish, blacks or dogs need apply&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Let us consider what is involved. Asylum policy concerns agreements which Ireland has entered into as a sovereign country. It is not only about administrative arrangements and working overtly or covertly for the British policy, as we did for years. We were afraid that if we relaxed our measures there would be abuse and this would upset Britain terribly. We have also taken on obligations concerning the movement of people. Those are dealt with substantially &ndash; not fully &ndash; in the 1996 Act which is the law of the land and should be resourced and implemented.</P>
    <P>The other issue is the international movement of labour. It is extraordinary to hear the hallelujah which goes up about the globalisation of world markets, the speed of movement of capital and services, and how speculative money can be sent flying from one side of the planet to the other. This is rather different to the speed of movement of those who have nothing to sell but their labour in this amnesiac country which can only remember the few years of being rich and decides to forget the generations of people who poured out because of poverty. In that wonderful period, the late Éamon de Valera's contribution was that 55,000 left Ireland in 1955 &ndash; the figure was the same in English and Irish &ndash; ar bhád na himirce. People with cardboard suitcases left via Galway railway station, at a time when the country was stirring its psychic sensibilities to become not only Catholic but Irish speaking, and anything else one could say in a tremulous voice. Now, an Act is not being implemented because it is not liked. I repeat my challenge to the Government to have the courage to repeal it.</P>
    <P>Honourable Deputies from various parties have said it is right to consider the contribution people can make based on their skill level and backgrounds, and the shortage of skills here. Something which has not been mentioned is cultural diversity, which is odd, considering how we go leaping internationally, displaying our culture, ankle length and full length. Years ago we joined UNESCO; the Department of Education and Science attends a meeting every couple of years to remind itself that we belong to it. What happened to the agreements we signed about cultural diversity, respecting other people's stories, being able to mix with others and gaining from it all? We do not want to talk about that, but about deportation procedures arising from a court decision.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Tuesday, 9 February 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann, notwithstanding the ongoing work of the Flood Tribunal established by Dáil Éireann, is of the opinion that EU Commissioner Pádraig Flynn should give a full and immediate response to the allegation that he received a donation of £50,000 from Mr. Tom Gilmartin in 1989, and, failing receipt of such a full and satisfactory account from the Commissioner within the next two weeks, Dáil Éireann shall, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, consider whether it is of the opinion that Mr. Flynn should continue in office in those circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before the House. The substantive issue behind it is an important one that has convulsed the Government parties and further debased the practice of politics in Ireland. I know this suits the purposes of some who want to create smokescreens and diversions and give impressions that all politicians are the same when plainly they are not. Many Fianna Fáil Deputies, feeding the &ldquo;they are all the same&rdquo; chorus, are underselling themselves and their supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the matter of three pensions, three homes, three housekeepers, two cars, one cheque and no answers. The man who was so eager to answer all the questions from Gay Byrne thumbs his nose at the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government. The man who has talked himself and the Government into another fine mess has suddenly donned the mantle of a Trappist monk. For the man who has played so many parts, more parts than an <Col N="384" /> Abbey actor, his latest reticence does not become him. Why will this man who has successively presented himself as the &ldquo;Messiah of the West&rdquo;, the &ldquo;King of Mayo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Ireland Incorporated&rdquo; not make a statement that would get the Government off the hook at least until his appearance before the tribunal? Perhaps it is because a frank statement from him would provoke even greater difficulties for the Government.</P>
    <P>If the letter of 6 October from the General Secretary of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Martin Mackin, to the Commissioner is any yardstick, the major Government party does not want an answer. Short of including a memo with the letter urging Mr. Flynn not to reply, the formal text could scarcely have been more explicit. The Mackin letter has all the appearance of an insurance policy calculated to divert the Progressive Democrats. It is remarkable that although the missing £50,000 was known to Mr. Sean Sherwin since 1989, the letter was dispatched only in 1998 when the tribunal got down to work and the Progressive Democrats became restless. We are asked to believe that Mr. Sherwin bore this dark secret alone. This is not to suggest that it takes very much nowadays to divert the Progressive Democrats. At least under Deputy O'Malley's thorny leadership, when the PD dog barked, Fianna Fáil backbenchers ordered the posters. Nowadays when the PD dog whimpers, the Fianna Fáil backbenchers snigger behind their hands. If the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was so adamant on 26 January that Mr. Flynn's position was impossible, how can she now find last night's bizarre speech from the semi-detached Minister for Foreign Affairs tolerable?</P>
    <P>The always amusing Minister, Deputy Andrews, considers the motion before the House to be &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;, that it concerns &ldquo;an exemplary Commissioner&rdquo; in whom the Government has &ldquo;full confidence in the exercise of his European function&rdquo;. We should note that Commissioner Flynn, whose position, according to the Tánaiste, was impossible on 26 January, now has the full confidence of the Government, and not only its dominant element. Why have the Progressive Democrats changed their position? Have we now reached the stage that it is more important for the Government to accommodate Deputy Cooper-Flynn than the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, or is it easier to mollify the Tánaiste than it is to unruffle the feathers of the Flynn dynasty?</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's legendary conciliatory skills, I do not envy his task in assuaging the younger Flynn. Usually, the Taoiseach asks no questions and Beverly usually answers no questions. She would seem to have won the day today, if rumours around the House are correct that the Government has been forced to swallow the Fine Gael amendment to avoid a vote. I look forward to the next edition of the diary of a northside Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It appears the Taoiseach can do for Deputy Cooper-Flynn what he could not do for the Progressive Democrats, accept the original Fine Gael <Col N="385" /> motion &ndash; anything to stave off defeat. The Government may be fragmenting, but its approach is to get another three weeks out of it and something may turn up in the meantime. The fragmentation is not just between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, but also between different splinters in Fianna Fáil. If, on the other hand, the Taoiseach has temporarily succeeded in beating back Beverly, then the role of the Independents is again critical in tonight's vote. The three wise monkeys who see no evil or hear no evil have now become four. Does any single member of the Healy-Rea troupe care about standards in Irish politics? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it if it gives offence, but I am merely giving them respect in direct proportion to the interest they pay to issues of standards in Irish politics. The Government seems to be experiencing more difficulties from its backbenchers than it does from Deputies Fox, Healy-Rea, Blaney or Gildea. The unexplained acceptance of £50,000 by serving Ministers seems to be a standard of behaviour that is acceptable to the Independent Deputies. I do not mean them any disrespect, but that comment is warranted by their disinterest in anything other than headage payments and masts.</P>
      <P>The truth according to some who should know is that, with the exception of Deputy Albert Reynolds, Mr. Tom Gilmartin met virtually every Minister in the Haughey Cabinet. One does not have to be a member of Fianna Fáil to know that Mr. Haughey was in the habit of hosting such visitors in the Fianna Fáil corridors, without minute takers, rather than in Government Buildings. The claim that there is no record of the meeting of 1 February 1989 between Mr. Gilmartin and the cream of the Haughey Cabinet is hardly conclusive. Today's comment at Question Time in reply to a question by the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, by a Haughey loyalist, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, that the former Taoiseach's diary may have been taken by him from Government Buildings because, perhaps, he is writing a book at least has the merit of being funny. It is not clear that Ministers O'Rourke, Woods, Brennan and Walsh and the Taoiseach can anticipate Mr. Haughey's memoirs with much mirth.</P>

      <P>There seems to be little doubt in the popular mind that Mr. Flynn received a cheque for £50,000 intended for Fianna Fáil headquarters. It appears to be a fact that the Fianna Fáil headquarters made no effort to recover this large amount of money. It is by no means clear that Mr. Flynn used any or all of that money for <Col N="386" /> his own purposes. However, I am not sure that the surviving Haughey loyalists can take much comfort from the proposition that Mr. Flynn may have been operating a debt collecting agency for Mr. Haughey. Surely if a Minister in membership of the party for only a wet week, the former Deputy John O'Connell, was asked to come to the rescue of a national monument, longer serving, genuine pedigree, acquiescent Ministers, if excluded, would feel unappreciated and unwanted?</P>
      <P>It is no more than the duty of this House to require the Commissioner, who was so forthcoming on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, to comply with the terms of this motion.  Perhaps in receding into the Brussels lift, pursued by Tommie Gorman, he decided to turn his back on Ireland. He certainly has given new meaning to Paul Durcan's poem, <i>Backside to the Wind. </i>In the process, if the Tánaiste is as good as her word, it puts the Government in an impossible position. A party that feigns indignation at Deputy Bruton's telephone call to Mr. Gilmartin must be really incensed at Mr. Gilmartin's version of Mr. Flynn's attempts to nobble him before he gets to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>All we know is that great wasted talent by the Lee, Deputy Noel O'Flynn, is certainly incensed and, with Deputy Michael Moynihan, believes Mr. Flynn should go. I am not saying Mr. Flynn should resign, nor is that requested in this motion, but I am saying he must make a frank and comprehensive statement concerning the circumstances surrounding the £50,000 Gilmartin cheque, the purposes to which it was put, whether these purposes were known to Mount Street, to which Councillor McGrath refers as Aras de Valera, and the tenor of his recent exchanges with Mr. Gilmartin.</P>

      <P>I am speaking on behalf of myself and my three colleagues in the Progressive Democrats Party. A little surprisingly, I find myself supporting the amendment proposed by my friend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, last night. I was somewhat taken aback by some of the content of his speech and I propose to take a different approach.</P>
      <P>Charles J. Haughey casts a long and dark shadow over Irish political life. It is nearly 20 years since he became Taoiseach, and seven since he left public life, but our political system is still struggling to come to terms with his legacy. In this debate we are addressing ourselves to one aspect of that legacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charles Haughey took over the leadership of Fianna Fáil in 1979. He immediately set about stamping his particular style of leadership on that party and on the country. Both suffered as a result. Life in Fianna Fáil under Haughey was not <Col N="387" /> exactly pleasant. If you disagreed with the leader's views you could be intimidated, threatened, even assaulted within the precincts of this House by his more thuggish supporters. Haughey sought to establish a close identification between the party and his own personality. At times even the nation, the party and himself became confused with one another in his own mind. His leadership was based on a type of unquestioning personal loyalty &ndash; demeaning to those who offered it, shallow to him who received it. Debate and discussion were discouraged, dissenting views were silenced, we were into the era of <i>&ldquo;uno duce, una voce&rdquo;.</i>Charles Haughey created a new climate within Fianna Fáil, one very different from that which prevailed under his predecessors &ndash; Lynch, Lemass and de Valera. He created a climate of fear, a climate of greed, a climate of secrecy and conspiracy. The damage which Haughey was doing to the party and the country was becoming increasingly apparent as the years passed. Many of us fought it. I was thrown out and others left, Deputy Molloy among them. Also among those who left was someone from the next political generation to ours, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. As a young person she had the courage and guts to stand up to Haughey, qualities which were sadly lacking in many of her more senior colleagues. Having said that, I am sure that if what is known now was known then there would have been many more who would have left with us. However, there were many who did not leave, many who felt totally comfortable in the kind of party which Charles Haughey had created. Among them was Mr. Pádraig Flynn.</P>
    <P>It might not be widely appreciated that Mr. Flynn and myself have something in common &ndash;  we have both been dumped upon from a height by Fianna Fáil. It happened to me 15 years ago. In 1984 I was expelled from the parliamentary party for my heretical views on Northern Ireland. The following year I was expelled from the party itself for my even more heretical views, as an Independent, on the subject of family planning. On that occasion, Pádraig Flynn was one of those doing the dumping. From the steps of party headquarters in Upper Mount Street he addressed the nation through an RTE camera and pronounced that my conduct was &ldquo;unbecoming a member of Fianna Fáil&rdquo;. Now it is Mr. Flynn's turn to be dumped upon.</P>
    <P>It seems that quite a number of Mr. Flynn's party colleagues throughout the country are baying for his blood. Apparently they regard his failure to explain what actually happened between Mr. Tom Gilmartin and himself as &ldquo;conduct unbecoming&rdquo;. At this stage we do not know what exactly happened nearly ten years ago. The only version of events put forward so far, however, presents a pretty appalling vista of the workings of Government in the late 1980s. Imagine a Minister for the Environment sitting in his office in the Custom House. Imagine a leading property <Col N="388" /> developer coming to visit him. Imagine the property developer handing him a cheque for £50,000. Imagine the Minister telling him to leave the &ldquo;payee&rdquo; line blank. That could indeed be conduct unbecoming, could it not? Did such an event actually occur in 1989? Mr. Tom Gilmartin says it did, Mr. Pádraig Flynn is saying nothing. As I said, I do not know what happened but like everyone else in this country I would like to know. That, in essence, is what this motion and these amendments are about.</P>
    <P>This Parliament, elected by and representing the people, is making a simple and straightforward request to Mr. Flynn &ndash; make a clear statement and tell us what did or did not happen in 1989. Did you get £50,000 from Tom Gilmartin? Did you give the money to Fianna Fáil or did you pocket it yourself? Did you do anything for Mr. Gilmartin in return for his largesse? Did you pass on any of this money, either directly or indirectly, to Charles Haughey?</P>
    <P>Mr. Flynn should also clarify whether he made contact with Mr. Gilmartin last year and whether he tried to influence Mr. Gilmartin's evidence to the planning tribunal. Attempting to get a witness to change his testimony before a tribunal of inquiry established by resolution of this House would be a serious matter. Anybody attempting that would render himself automatically unfit for the position of town commissioner, let alone European Commissioner. The questions being posed for Mr. Flynn are not complicated; they are simple, straightforward and easy to answer. Yet he declines to do so. He informs us that he will say his piece to the planning tribunal. Is he hoping that he will have been able to complete his term in Brussels before he is called to give evidence in Dublin Castle? Why else would he refuse to explain himself and what does he have to fear from telling the truth?</P>
    <P>Mr. Flynn is a public servant working for the people of Europe and the people of Ireland. The people of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Opposition and the national media have asked Mr. Flynn to account for himself and to do so now. If he has any respect for the position he occupies he should do so immediately.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of hindsight, I can see more clearly than before why certain leading figures in Fianna Fáil, Mr. Flynn being notable among them, were so opposed to the notion of coalition with the Progressive Democrats in 1989. Could it be they were afraid that we would cramp their style of doing business?</P>
    <P>The next few months could be crucial in the political life of this country. We as a nation will be asked serious questions as to what kind of society, what kind of values and what kind of country we want. There may be further revelations made by tribunals, inquiries or the media, of wrongdoing at the highest levels in Irish society. If there are, they may be shocking and disturbing to most members of the voting public. For example, today's newspapers report a tri<Col N="389" /> bunal yesterday as having discovered that one of the providers of money &ndash; £100,000 &ndash; to a Haughey family company was Mr. Michael Murphy, who has been a close associate of, and long time insurance broker, to Mr. Larry Goodman. He helped to negotiate Mr. Goodman's earliest export credit insurance cover for Iraq and he was also insurance broker to the Department of Agriculture and Food until it sued him last December in respect of huge losses it sustained in a major fire at a beef intervention store at Ballaghaderreen in 1992.</P>
    <P>Politicians will have a clear choice in how they respond to any such revelations. They can choose to respond with courage, integrity and determination to eradicate the cancer of corruption that has poisoned the political and commercial affairs of this country in recent years or they may choose to shirk their responsibility. They may choose to act the &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; yet again. They may choose to turn a blind eye, look the other way and indicate their tacit toleration and acceptance of a culture of crookedness and corruption. The people will then have a choice.</P>
    <P>We may not have a general election for two or three years but events may dictate otherwise. Whenever the next election is held the question of standards in public life is likely to be one of the main items on the political agenda, if not the main item. What kind of standards do people want? What kind of parties do they want? What kind of politicians do they want? Will they believe those who say that all these tribunals are only barrister-fattening exercises, a waste of time and money and that we do not want to be digging into all that class of thing in any event? Would they vote for the brown envelope brigade if these gentlemen presented themselves for election again or are they prepared to make a genuine break with the past and embrace a new political order, one that gives precedence to decency over expediency, to honesty over dishonesty and to the public interest over the vested interest?</P>
    <P>This Government has been surprisingly successful. It has made enormous progress in creating jobs, reducing unemployment and improving the lot of pensioners. The recent budget, for example, was a radical and reforming initiative by any standard. I take my hat off to Deputy Mary Harney for succeeding where others failed in introducing tax credits. It is a successful Government and we in the Progressive Democrats would like to see it continue in office.</P>
    <P>However, it can continue in office only while there is trust and confidence between the two coalition partners. The position of the Progressive Democrats is straightforward. We do not expect people in public life to be saints or paragons of virtue. All we ask is that those in public life, especially those in high political office, abide by normal and reasonable standards of honesty and decency in dealing with the affairs of State.</P>
    <P>If we are to be criticised for holding that position then this democracy is in more trouble than any of us realise. It is a well worn cliché that poli<Col N="390" /> tics is on trial in this country, but that cliché has never been truer than it is now. The public is interested to see revealed what the politicians of the 1980s got up to. They are also interested to see how those revelations will be dealt with by the politicians of the 1990s. All of us in this House can help to restore public confidence in the Irish political system or we can abandon our responsibility. If we abandon our responsibility to deal decisively with sleaze and corruption we run the risk of abandoning democracy itself.</P>
    <P>There is a political movement out there now, watching current developments very closely. That movement has recently put itself forward as the real anti-sleaze party in Irish politics. I refer to the so-called republican movement, the people who murdered Jerry McCabe. Increasingly, public cynicism about politics is creating political space which these people are glad to occupy. The last time I made a speech in this House about my vision of a republic I got into a lot of trouble about it. However, my idea of a republic is very different from that of those who murder gardaí and mutilate for life those with whom they disagree.</P>
    <P>We have a chance to restore the public's faith in politics over the next few months and an opportunity to show that this Republic is run by decent people according to decent standards. Let us embrace that opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government's amendment to the motion. The Government asks for a public statement from the EU Commissioner while we allow the Flood tribunal to complete its deliberations. That accords with my stated view that such a statement must be made. It is owed to the public and it will clear the air.</P>
      <P>We all don the mantle of accountability on the day we ask people we represent to place their trust in us. We do this when we ask them to elect us to speak on their behalf. We are their spokespersons and their champions on urban councils, city corporations, county councils, in the Dáil or abroad in the European Parliament. We bear a heavy burden and we must honour the trust the electorate has bestowed upon us. We owe it to them and ourselves to do so. It is our moral obligation. Not to do so is to cause the public to have a deeper distrust of politicians than that which has been generated by the events in recent years.</P>
      <P>We are now paying for the past transgressions of a few politicians. The Government party to which I belong has pledged itself to the implementation of a code of high standards in public life. I am proud to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. I reserve the right to hold views on any matter. The onus is on us to restore the faith of the people in our political system which has served this country well.</P>
      <P>However, I am surprised at the political posturing of the Fine Gael Party and of some of its members.</P>

      <P>It is in line with the party's past behaviour and cynical utterances. I must at least give members of that party credit for consistency of approach. They have always believed in selective democracy and still do. They believe in bringing the full pressure of the system to bear on individuals in other parties whom they perceive to have sinned against the system. When a member of Government or a person associated with my party is under pressure they hold the high ground of moral integrity so that they may pontificate and pronounce judgment.</P>
      <P>However, when one of their own is exposed they have no problem in looking the other way. There are none so blind as those who will not see. It is a convenient and easy philosophy to adopt. They can speak of the sanctity of tribunals but are not above making telephone calls to key figures involved in them. Is there any possibility that the party of rectitude might introduce a Private Members' motion on contacts between politicians in high places and witnesses to the Flood tribunal while that body is still hearing evidence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the special circumstances surrounding this debate for me personally. The motion is focused on the man who is my father, who preceded me as a Teachta Dála for the people of Mayo in these same benches and whose record of public service to his constituency, his party and his country exceeds 33 years. I address the House with the emotional involvement of a daughter whose family loyalty is on the table but who yet feels qualified to comment on issues in an objective and impartial manner. I would like to think that if the person named in this motion was not Pádraig Flynn, I would be equally opposed to what is before us tonight for reasons which I believe to be valid in truth and conscience. Every man or woman is entitled to his or her good name unless the facts prove otherwise, and I vigorously defend the right of every citizen in any circumstance.</P>
      <P>What we are seeing tonight is political expediency at its most cynical. If the House believes the objectives of the Flood Tribunal are being served by this debate, I do not. If Pádraig Flynn is a victim of a travesty, he is not alone because his fellow casualties include integrity, fair play and basic justice. I consider it a demeaning abuse of Dáil privilege that the character of a private citizen can be impugned in the pursuit of narrow political point scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that people listening will be saying to themselves that I have to put in a word for my father. However, that is not the case. I want to address the issues which are more important than one man, such as justice, democracy and sanctimonious opportunism. This motion, which should be called the &ldquo;notwithstanding motion&rdquo;, is a shoddy example of opportunism. It is amazing that a party led by a lawyer would sweep aside the importance, prestige and function of the Flood Tribunal with one word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;. We are fortunate it is not in Government <Col N="393" /> because if it was, this new &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; principle might be applied to other aspects of the judicial system.</P>
    <P>Because this motion starts with the word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;, it is without meaning, point or efficacy. Fine Gael knew this when it constructed it and knew that notwithstanding the possibility that this House might acquiesce in this motion, this House has no competence in relation to the European Commissioner. The European Commissioner finishing out his term cannot be affected by the passing of this motion. It will not be worth the hot air it has generated. Fine Gael knew that when it started this ludicrous process and knew it even more clearly when a few days ago the EU President, Jacques Santer, dismissed the entire issue as having no relevance to him, the EU or the Commissioner's performance of his job. Santer said it was a purely domestic matter for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has knowingly wasted the time of this House on something which can and will have no effect on the man it is setting out to damage. Although it will have no effect on the Commissioner, it will have a negative effect elsewhere. If there is anything calculated to increase public cynicism about politics, it is watching the second largest party in Dáil Éireann knowingly wasting parliamentary time on something pointless. It sends an interesting message about how Fine Gael views the business of Opposition &ndash; never mind the reality, feel the headlines. It is bad enough to engage in a pointless and fruitless form of games playing, but it is much worse to do it in such a tacky way.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael recipe is as follows: throw together a motion, lash in a couple of &ldquo;notwithstandings&rdquo;, stir in a bit of guilt by association and maybe it will look as if it benefits somebody. This motion will not benefit anybody. It is filled with the pretence that it is all straightforward and that if one has nothing to hide, one can make an immediate statement. However, it is not straightforward. If it was, we would not have had all the argument in the Flood Tribunal about who gives what evidence first, who gets to cross-examine whom and who might lose out by not having vital information other people have.</P>
    <P>The people who crafted this motion are asking the European Commissioner not only to bypass a tribunal set up by this House and to risk condemnation by Mr. Justice Flood, but to behave as only a naive fool would behave. If two people's accounts of an event differ, then to ask one of those people to sacrifice due process, to lay all his evidence on the table and to present his entire case before he gets near the tribunal is to effectively sacrifice one party in an argument to the interests of the other. That is not justice.</P>
    <P>Man's capacity for justice, it has been said, makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary. We, for all our faults and failings, are the trusted guardians of democracy. By setting up the Flood Tribunal, this House, by unanimous consent, hon<Col N="394" /> oured its duty to the principles of democracy. Tonight we are attempting to subvert the structure we set up and to pre-empt the findings and deliberations of that body. If this was a rush to judgment, it would be reprehensible enough but it is a blatant attempt to sacrifice the good name and reputation of someone who is outside this House and whose only sin is to offer to abide by the procedures we have set up and demanded obedience to, namely the Flood Tribunal.</P>
    <P>This motion is a fake in every way. It pretends to be concerned about an allegation that appeared in print five months ago. It was made public almost half a year ago. What is new to justify the hysterical tone of this motion? What is different? Did new information emerge? All we have is a restatement of an untried allegation. The man making this untried allegation has restated that he did not ask the former Minister for the Environment for a favour nor did he receive one. That is precisely the position we were at five months ago. Hence we have the extraordinary frenzy of a fortnight ago when the Tánaiste announced that the Commissioner's position was now &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;. That is clearly not true. Jacques Santer does not think his position is impossible and the Government knows his position is not impossible.</P>
    <P>People tend to keep doing things for which they are rewarded. Fianna Fáil should not collude in its own destruction or in the continuing portrayal of our party as intrinsically, essentially and eternally flawed by seeming to reward others who claim to be our moral guardians. Every time we do it, we are buying today's survival at the cost of tomorrow's existence. We are eroding our faith in ourselves and we are betraying our supporters.</P>
    <P>When today's proceedings are over, I urge that all Members of the House stand back and reflect on what has been happening over the past three months. We have seen the work of the Oireachtas trivialised and we have nobody to blame but ourselves. We set up tribunals and then we run scared, unwilling and unable to wait on the due process they entail. We are the elected representatives of the people, yet we allow ourselves to become putty in the hands of influences around and outside us.</P>
    <P>That is why, until I see the votes counted, I will not bring myself to believe that the party I know would collaborate with the Opposition parties on this tacky motion. The Fianna Fáil Party which I believe has a future, would not collaborate with the Opposition in its attempt to damage a man Fianna Fáil knows is committed to Ireland in Europe in a powerfully effective way. The Fianna Fáil Party which should lead this country in the next century would not abandon leadership on this issue and it would not act as if it was helpless in the face of an unstoppable process. Above all, it would not ask its members to put their names to something which, as individuals, they neither believe in nor approve. In loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party, its ideals, leadership and members who have shown me such friendship and support, <Col N="395" /> not least in the past few days, I will not put my name to a motion which is empty except for the seeds of the long-term damage to my party.</P>

      <P>I move amendment to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1. To add the following words at the end of the amendment:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and resolves notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, to consider the issue again within the next three weeks&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This House has just listened to two very interesting speeches from Deputies O'Malley and Beverley Cooper-Flynn. I admire Deputy O'Malley's rhetoric but the Progressive Democrats' position in this debate is impossible. On 25 January the Tánaiste said the position of Commissioner Flynn was impossible. She stated on 28 January: &ldquo;It is impossible to have credibility in a public officeholder, whether it is a Commissioner or member of a Government, when these type of allegations hang over them and they don't respond.&rdquo;  The current defence of the Commissioner by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night and the circling of the wagons, as we have just heard, is totally at variance with the Tánaiste's stated position. Unfortunately, the lack of credibility of the Progressive Democrats has again been exposed in the handling of this debate &ndash; this PD watchdog has neither barked nor bitten when it mattered.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate Deputy Cooper-Flynn's emotional involvement in this, she seems to be clouded from reality. The most recent opinion poll showed that 86 per cent of respondents believed that Commissioner Flynn should respond to the allegations made by Mr. Gilmartin. A further 48 per cent said he should resign as against 34 per cent who said he should not. Let us be frank about this, Mr. Gilmartin's dual allegations, if true, make Commissioner Flynn's position impossible.</P>
      <P>The first allegation is that he personally received £50,000 which was not forwarded to Fianna Fáil but which was meant to be paid to the Fianna Fáil Party. The second is that when Mr. Flynn was in the process of responding to questions from <i>The Sunday Independent</i> he contacted a critical witness of the tribunal, Mr. Gilmartin, to try to agree a line at the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot equate that with Deputy Bruton's phone call which was to check a matter of fact. To agree a line, if true, in my view makes his position clearly untenable. Commissioner Flynn's position is to ignore Irish public opinion, to show disdain with a hand gesture of one or two fingers to the Irish people who have demanded answers. The <Col N="396" /> purpose of this motion is not to trivialise or waste the time of the Dáil but to show that he cannot give the same gesture to the National Parliament of this country and to put him on the spot. His defence and that articulated by his daughter, Deputy Cooper-Flynn is not credible. His defence is to hide behind the Flood tribunal.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked, if Commissioner Flynn was to give his version of accounts, how would it in any way inhibit the work of the tribunal? The purpose of the tribunal set up by this House is to establish the truth. For Commissioner Flynn to give his version of the truth can only assist in that process. Therefore, I do not believe the tribunal's working will be inhibited or hindered in any way by such a statement. In fact, the opposite is the case. The basic argument put forward by Commissioner Flynn, is in my view, a blatant sham. The Commissioner has wasted every opportunity to clear the air. The Dáil must now send him a clear message that he is not beyond reproach in his lofty perch in Brussels. The most incredible aspect of this debate is that the Taoiseach, and the trustees of the Fianna Fáil Party, seem to care so little about moneys missing from their party they have failed directly to informally or formally ask what happened to the moneys or why the party has never received them.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues Deputy Cooper-Flynn spoke about was that of justice. A key kernel of justice is free speech. We are inviting the Commissioner to have free and open speech.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we have been exposed and because we established this tribunal the House has never had an opportunity to say it. Let us call a spade a spade. What has happened at the Flood and particularly the Moriarity tribunal in terms of evidence is nothing less than the exposure of two sewage pipes spewing out episodes of the Haughey culture in Government. That would be unacceptable or even outlandish to the wildest allegation made by the most vociferous opponents of the then Deputy Haughey during that era. The Dáil and the Government must preserve the good reputation of Ireland in Europe by taking decisive action against the Commissioner. In my view it is clear either way that his credibility is terminally damaged. It is clear that he is a lame duck Commissioner anyway because the Government spin doctors have made it clear he will not be renominated.</P>
    <P>If the Commissioner fails to respond to this motion within the time required, the Dáil should not hesitate to take further steps directly against the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>A core value in parliamentary democracy is the accountability to this House of Members and Ministers for their actions as Ministers. That is central to the issue in this debate. It is not the fact that the former Deputy and Minister, Commissioner Flynn, is now a Commissioner of the European Parliament that makes him accountable to this House but the fact that he <Col N="397" /> is a former Deputy and Minister. Accountability means that you are accountable to this House for the manner in which you conduct your business as Minister and a member of Government.</P>
      <P>This House is visiting this issue because Commissioner Flynn sought in his words to set the record straight on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;. He is not known for his reticence on issues and he talked volubly that evening about his work and he engaged in a great deal of self-praise. In doing so he sought to do down an individual who had made an allegation with regard to his conduct as Minister. That allegation is a matter of great concern to Members. It was well articulated earlier by Deputy O'Malley but it bears repetition. We have been told that we had in Government a Minister for the Environment who sat behind his desk and had handed across his desk, as is alleged, a cheque for £50,000 allegedly for the benefit of the election of the Fianna Fáil Party. We have been told by the Fianna Fáil Party and by the Taoiseach that the cheque was never received. The person to whom it was handed, now a European Commissioner and a man not known for his reticence, confronted with that allegation has now gone strangely silent. I fully understand, as does every Member, that tonight must be emotionally fraught for Deputy Cooper-Flynn and anything she says must in charity be put in that context. In so far as she is suggesting that this motion is in some scurrilous way trying to destroy the name of a good man, she is wrong. This motion asks that the former Minister explain the background to what occurred in 1989, as is alleged.</P>
      <P>This motion is not about trying to subvert the Flood tribunal because in setting up the Flood tribunal this House did not end and cannot constitutionally end the accountability of Ministers to this House for their actions. Commissioner Flynn, as a former Deputy and Minister, is still accountable to this House for the manner in which he conducted business in 1989. It is regrettable that there is a need for this motion. It is reasonable that this motion asks him to explain fully what he did with the money that he is alleged to have received, to confirm that he received it and asks him to explain the circumstances surrounding the receipt of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as someone is at fault for this motion, two individuals take the blame. The first is Commissioner Flynn for failing to be immediately forthcoming to explain his position. In no other European parliamentary democracy confronted by an allegation of this nature would a former Minister stay silent and not explain himself. The second person at fault is the Taoiseach through his failure over a number of months to get to the root of this story during numerous meetings with the Commissioner, not just in a European context by in a social context, and after the sending of a formal letter by the general secretary of his party. He failed on a single occasion to ask the Commissioner if he would tell him whether he <Col N="398" /> received that cheque and, if he did, what he did with it.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that someone who told this House he is committed to cleaning up politics and a new ethos in politics is unwilling to confront the past of his party. The litmus test of the commitment of the Fianna Fáil party to a new political ethos is the manner, as Deputy O'Malley rightly said, in which the leader of the party confronts the old ethos. I find it difficult to disagree with the vast substance of what Deputy O'Malley said except for one aspect. The real test in this House is whether one's actions match one's rhetoric. Hopefully, the motion will be passed and we will get a comprehensive explanation from the Commissioner, but if we do not, we, as elected representatives of the people, have a constitutional duty to then further consider the view the House holds of the Commissioner retaining his position in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and the Progressive Democrats Party are apparently in favour of calling on the Commissioner to explain himself, but are not prepared to agree to the House revisiting this issue in three weeks if he fails to do so in a satisfactory and comprehensive manner. In other words, it seems that the Progressive Democrats Party rhetoric will not be matched by action and that is the litmus test of the new ethos not just of the Fianna Fáil Party but the practised ethos of the Progressive Democrats Party because Deputy O'Malley spoke most eloquently about the tyranny of the Haughey years and the difficulties experienced by those who sought to express views that were at variance with Mr. Haughey. Part of the tyranny of the Haughey years was compliant backbench members of the Fianna Fáil Party and, indeed, Ministers voting in a particular manner on issues about which they fundamentally disagreed with the line the party was taking.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Progressive Democrats Party from the Tánaiste's previous comments, not only believes that the Commissioner should provide an explanation, but, as my colleague, Deputy Yates, pointed out, if he fails to do so in a satisfactory and comprehensive way his position is untenable. If it is the view of this House in three weeks that such is the case there should be support from the Progressive Democrats Party for the House revisiting this issue. However, it appears that the rhetoric is not matched by action.</P>
    <P>Last night we listened with some confusion to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who proposed the amendment to the motion. He produced an extraordinary analogy between Commissioner Flynn, the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. In so far as the Commissioner might be a prisoner in Brussels, he is a prisoner of his own making. In so far as the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about the importance of the Commissioner remaining in his position during the forthcoming difficult negotiations in Brussels, he failed to explain how the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or himself could conduct business with Mr. Flynn <Col N="399" /> in the weeks ahead if the position pertains that they are of the belief that he received money and he fails to explain the circumstances surrounding it and what he did with it.</P>
    <P>The case made by the Minister last night is entirely untenable. It is in the interests of democracy, restoring faith in politics and the reputation of both Government parties that they extend full support to the Fine Gael amendment to ensure this House can revisit the issue. Any claim to integrity that any of the Independents who currently support the Government may have will fall by the wayside if they fail to support us. They will be seen as a group committed to political expediency, interested in their self-preservation and with no concern for the democratic institutions of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not asked to contribute to this debate to bring up incidents of the past, which have brought shame to the profession of politics in Ireland. My interest is not in trying to embarrass the Government or to drag up a period in the recent past, which I am sure haunts Fianna Fáil, in particular, but also other parties. I do not want to talk about the past as I am concerned about the present and, more importantly, the future for the political system.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this House goes home and talks to their constituents at weekends. When they chat about politics they talk about the most recent development in a tribunal or a scandal, bribe or lie. We read about the same stuff in the political pages of the Sunday newspapers, which blackens the reputation of those in public life. We, as politicians, are losing credibility in the eyes of the public and, as the newest Member of this House, I am sick of being told that politicians cannot be trusted and it is a career full of deception and dishonesty. That is not the career I chose to enter four months ago.</P>
      <P>The tribunals are necessary and we must go through this process to clear the air and start again from a clean slate if we are to begin to rebuild faith between the public and public representatives. The recent allegation involving our EU Commissioner regarding a payment of £50,000 is just another in a long line of incidents that people want to hear the truth about and have explained. However, there is a difference between this allegation and many of the other corruption charges in recent times. There is a massive public interest in it largely because of the infamous television interview with Mr. Flynn but also because of the vast media coverage it received and the friction it has caused between Government parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the main reason for the interest is that people just cannot understand why Mr. Flynn will not respond to the allegations made against him. It is surely in his interest to tell the truth and come clean because by his silence the public will assume the worst anyway. I have no idea whether he is guilty of any wrongdoing but it is crystal <Col N="400" /> clear that in his silence he is fuelling the cynicism and disillusionment that has developed in the public's attitude towards politicians. He is doing everyone in this House a disservice.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that he should wait until the tribunal to give his evidence. Mr. Flynn knows the truth about what happened in regard to the £50,000 and he should stop delaying and make a statement so that we can move on from this negative incident and concentrate on what we were elected to do. I regret that the Opposition felt it necessary to spend three hours of Private Members' time on this subject. Many other pressing issues need to be debated but I hope this three hours will not be wasted and this debate will result in a full and satisfactory statement from our EU Commissioner. If it fails to receive such a statement, the Dáil will be forced to consider whether in present circumstances Mr. Flynn is suitable to remain in office as EU Commissioner representing Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Pádraig Flynn's performance on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; has been mentioned. I was not one of the many people who turned off their television sets when he appeared even though his performance was nauseating it made for compelling viewing. In response to a question from the young man from Finglas, he indicated that he earns £140,000, but only £100,000 after tax. In mentioning that he has three houses to run he said, &ldquo;you should try it some time&rdquo;. I am sure that man would like to try it some time, as would those on hospital and housing waiting lists and those who get stuck in traffic jams each morning but they will never have that opportunity.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil should adopt a new slogan which should read, &ldquo;You should try it some time&rdquo;, not &ldquo;People before Politics&rdquo;. What I am hearing from the Fianna Fáil benches is that one can receive £30,000, £50,000 or £1.3 million, put it in one's back pocket and get away with it. It is a mealy-mouthed response.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, compared Commissioner Flynn with the Birmingham Six while Deputy Lenihan, in a theological excursion, compared him with Adam and Eve. Apparently, God applied the laws of natural justice. The only similarity between Commissioner Flynn and Adam and Eve that I can see is that he must feel exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner Flynn said he would comment at the appropriate time. When I suggested that he should resign under Article 160 of the Treaty of Rome I was informed that it could not be done because the events in question happened prior to his appointment. Let us suppose that ten dead bodies were discovered under the foundations of a house, that a witness came forward and said that he saw a Commissioner dispose of the bodies, that the Commissioner stated that the events happened prior to his appointment and that he would comment at the appropriate time &ndash; that is the worst case scenario &ndash; are we to believe that he should continue in office? It is alleged by a <Col N="401" /> witness that Commissioner Flynn received £50,000 but the Commissioner will not comment and is allowed to continue in office because the events happened prior to his appointment. The only difference is that this is seen as a misdemeanour, small beer and trivial. We have been told by Fianna Fáil not to get on our high horse, that it is only £50,000 and that it happened in 1989. That is trying to put it to one side and dismiss it but that will not do.</P>

      <P>I am happy to clarify the matter. Politicians no longer enjoy a good reputation. I would hate to think what the turnout at the next election will be. We are all tarnished. I hope the newly found ethical approach of Fianna Fáil will pay dividends but it will have to prove itself. The <Col N="402" /> Taoiseach should go to Padraig Flynn and ask him a direct question.</P>
      <P>There is a credibility gap here. We have been informed that Seán Fleming, Des Richardson and Pat Farrell knew about the Rennicks donation but, apparently, the Taoiseach who knows everything about everything did not. Is that not straining credibility? We have also been informed that the only person in Fianna Fáil who knew about the 1989 donation was Mr. Sherwin and that he kept it to himself. Is that not straining credibility? It is extremely difficult to believe. It is time there was an internal tribunal in Fianna Fáil and action was taken. If that was done, there could be a purge and the slate could be wiped clean. If it is not done, allegations will continue to be made and politics will continue to be brought into the mire.</P>
      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion. I called for clarification and the removal of Commissioner Flynn under Article 160 if he failed to clarify the matter. He has not done so. His position is untenable. I hope others in the House will support the motion.</P>

      <P>Through the Chair, people on all sides of the House are, and the majority of them down through the years have been, decent and honourable and have done no wrong. It should be remembered that wide and sweeping generalisations about my party or the Members of any other party do not do politics any good. It may seem like a good idea to have a swipe at everyone in Fianna Fáil. I have been a Member of this House since 1987 and I lived through the era in Fianna Fáil about which Deputy O'Malley spoke. I stayed in Fianna Fáil and played a role in doing something about it. I am proud of the party, the Leader and the standards we have now. I am also proud that we will allow tribunals, inquiries and other bodies set up by this House to comprehensively deal with any wrongdoing in the late 1980s. That is important for everyone in this House. I am not aware of anyone on this side who has any problem with that. That is the true position of Fianna Fáil and I would not like it to be misrepresented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Government and the Opposition have a great deal in common on this matter. Deputies from all sides have called for clarification, and the sooner the better. I again call for <Col N="403" /> that clarification tonight on behalf of the Government, the Fianna Fáil party and on a personal basis. The original motion put before the House was flawed. I realise there are eminent lawyers present who might disagree with me, but it could have represented, as it was worded, interference in the Flood Tribunal. It also attempted to establish, in a very roundabout way, jurisdiction over a strictly independent European public official which I do not think we can do.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Gay Mitchell addressed the House yesterday, he set out what he wanted and what, I believe, all of us want when he said &ldquo;Tonight we ask for an explanation from Commissioner Flynn, no more, no less.&rdquo;  This is fully in accordance with the amendment put down by the Government.</P>
      <P>Many statements about natural justice have been made by Members on both sides of the House. Unlike the original motion, the Government amendment preserves natural justice for Commissioner Flynn, irrespective of whether one agrees with him. We call for an explanation at this stage. We believe clarification would be in the interest of all, including the Commissioner. In doing that, we should acknowledge that Commissioner Flynn indicated his wish to have the matter dealt with by the Flood tribunal and that he would make no comment on the allegations.</P>
      <P>I say to some Members who seem to have missed this point, that if the Commissioner had maintained that stance, there would be no reason for the motion before the House. However, he chose to make a statement in a very public arena, on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, and because of that he should give an explanation outside the tribunal.</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion that Commissioner Flynn should not have the right to have the allegations made against him heard by the tribunal. He has every right to make a full statement, to give a full explanation and to deal with any allegations there. We all wish that matter could be resolved quickly. As Deputy Gormley and others said, that would be in all our interests. A statement from Commissioner Flynn at this time would not only be in his interest but also in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The Government has tabled an amendment which calls on the Commissioner to make a statement clarifying his position. We are asking him to respond positively to this call for his own sake, for the sake of the body politic and for the sake of the country. We ask him to do that urgently.</P>

      <P>There are two simple issues before the House, first, whether this House should demand a full statement from Commissioner Flynn and, second, whether we should revisit this issue in the event that he fails to make such a statement.</P>
      <P>In considering these issues, one must look at the position of the different parties in the House. The position of the Progressive Democrats is intriguing. We heard a strong statement from the Tánaiste and Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, that as far as she is concerned, the position of the Commissioner is impossible. The Opposition did not say that, we did not jump to judgment. We felt it would be fairer to ask the Commissioner to make a statement. Be that as it may, that was the opening position of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>We then heard a powerful speech tonight from Deputy O'Malley which raises the issue of the follow-through. What will the Progressive Democrats do? Is this motion a toothless tiger in that we will demand a statement from the Commissioner without any follow-up in the event that he disdains the moral voice of the House? That is the issue facing the Progressive Democrats. It is a defining issue for them and a matter for them as to how they respond.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say much about the position of Deputy Cooper-Flynn. Her speech was a little intriguing which is understandable under the circumstances. She spoke manfully, or more correctly, womanfully, in defence of her father, which is as one would expect. However, she predicated her defence of her father on the basis that he was a private citizen. I cannot accept that. He has been involved in politics for as long as I have and he is still involved as far as I am concerned. He is answerable to this House and accountable for his actions when he was a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of Fianna Fáil is more than interesting. Its reaction to this debate has been unsure and indecisive. It indicated a lack of confidence in the facts, which I presume it fears will emerge, and a lack of confidence in dealing with Dáil procedure. It makes a virtue of necessity in demanding, as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, did, a full clarification and statement at this stage. This is the first time there has been any follow-up to the letter from the general secretary of the party <Col N="405" /> to Commissioner Flynn which dates back to 6 October last.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, made the main speech on the part of Fianna Fáil last night. He did his best, as a former senior counsel. He put up a spurious defence against the acceptance of the Fine Gael motion. He spoke about the possibility of political interference and said it was a roundabout way to establish jurisdiction over the Commissioner. Yet he proposed an amendment demanding a full statement from the Commissioner. He evaded the main issue. In trying to discern its true position, Fianna Fáil has no option but to join Fine Gael, the other parties in the House and the public in accepting the demand for a full statement from the Commissioner. It does it only because the rest of the country is similarly demanding such a statement. There was no such demand publicly, so far as I am aware, up to this time.</P>

      <P>The real issue so far as Fianna Fáil is concerned is its position in the event that Commissioner Flynn refuses to respond. Where does it stand on that issue? With all due respect, speaking about his wisdom and experience and the necessity to keep him in place as a Commissioner in the crucial negotiations ahead is bunkum. I do not denigrate what Commissioner Flynn has done as a Commissioner in Europe. Most people will accept &ndash; and I accept &ndash; he has done his job well but I am satisfied there are many other people who could do the job equally well. If his position is found to be untenable, it is a question of putting in an alternative as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choice for Fianna Fáil is simple. It has to accept that this House demands a full statement <Col N="406" /> from the Commissioner. What is its position in the event of his refusal to respond to the moral voice of this House? Does it want this House to be a toothless tiger? Does it want a situation where that demand is made and left in the air and that he can ignore it with impunity? This is an unacceptable position and the only honourable course for Fianna Fáil to adopt is to support the Fine Gael position on this motion.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go over any of the ground I dealt with last night but to respond to some of the points made. There is a school of thought that we should be ashamed of our profession and clean up our act. I do not share that view. It is the culprits who need to have their act cleaned up. It is they who need to have the verdict delivered upon them. Those of us who are doing our job have nothing to be ashamed of. Swift, Shakespeare and our current satirists have said, the nature of politics is that people will say things about politicians. We should not fall in with the &ldquo;free Barabbas&rdquo; crowd who think that because they have the majority voice they have got it right. Most politicians are doing an honest job. I dealt with that issue last night and will not deal with it any further. We do not need a machine gun to mow everybody down but a sniper's bullet to pick off the culprits and ensure they get their due rewards.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with Deputy O'Malley's speech, a man for whom I have great regard. It is time they &ldquo;walked the talk&rdquo;. When we walk up to vote they should be with us. If they are not walking with us they are not &ldquo;walking the talk&rdquo;. It is not good enough to have a bob each way on an issue of this kind as the Progressive Democrats did.</P>
      <P>An examination of my opening comments in this debate will show they were fair, reasonable, balanced and to the point. I wish to draw attention to the following extract from my opening comments: &ldquo;This motion does not prejudge Mr. Flynn. It merely asks him for an explanation. In natural justice we are giving Mr. Flynn an opportunity to make that explanation within two weeks. For all we know there may well be an explanation unrelated to the tribunal. This cannot be determined until we hear from Mr. Flynn.&rdquo;  I repeat that statement for the reason that this is the way we proceeded in the case of Ray Burke, who would never have appeared at any tribunal had we not heard his story, and because the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, sought to imply that members of the Opposition were unwilling to extend to Commissioner Flynn the same basic right to be heard by the tribunal at the appropriate time. That is technically incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What strikes me as extraordinary is the Minister for Foreign Affairs' clear belief that Mr. Flynn has a case to answer at the tribunal and it is beyond any doubt he must appear. Who is prejudging Mr. Flynn? Could not Fianna Fáil have given Mr. Flynn the same benefit of the doubt that the Opposition is prepared to apply, <Col N="407" /> until we hear the Commissioner's side of the story within a reasonable two to three week period? </P>
    <P>At first glance the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared to be a self-defence of the Commissioner, were it not for the fact that he was speaking to a Fianna Fáil amendment calling on the Commissioner to make a statement. It seems Fianna Fáil came to bury the Commissioner, not to praise him. Why the reference to the autobiography <i>Man of No Property</i>, written by the Minister's father? Was this a cruel and gratuitous kick at a man who has homes in Dublin, Brussels and Castlebar as mentioned in his now infamous &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; performance? The Minister, Deputy Andrews, was speaking from script. What other construction was meant to be put on this comment? </P>
    <P>Our rather tall Commissioner is something of a political Goliath. The Minister's comments may have gone some way to slaying him. To make matters worse, the Minister went over the top in comparing Mr. Flynn to the Birmingham Six, the Maguire family and Guiseppi Conlon. He has inadvertently knocked him by representing him as the Brussels one, thereby ensuring the evaporation of any residual sympathy for him.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Andrews, a man for whom I have high regard, is inclined to get carried away in situations such as this. When the Dáil considered the need for an explanation from the then Minister, Ray Burke, Deputy Andrews admonished the Opposition and walked out of the House. A couple of days later Ray Burke's job in Iveagh House was taken by Deputy Andrews. One wonders whether the Minister is on his way to Brussels. Who needs enemies when you have friends like that? </P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is happy to sacrifice the Com<Col N="408" /> missioner. In its view, he should lay down his political life for his friends. Has it learned nothing from the practised Haughey tradition &ndash; out went Deputies Harney and O'Malley and even Brian Lenihan was pushed to preserve the Fianna Fáil regime. Amid all the disguised comments by Fianna Fáil, the real agenda is to bury Mr. Flynn and bury the questions with him. It should be careful as Mr. Flynn was treasurer and knows where some of the bodies are interred. Is this the reason Fianna Fáil does not want due process to apply, by giving the Commissioner two to three weeks to make an explanation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most convoluted reasoning I have ever heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to have good reason to prevent the Commissioner from speaking. So far its efforts to get the Commissioner to speak have been little more than cosmetic. Last night I set out four questions which need to be answered by Mr. Flynn. We are prepared to give him the time to answer those questions. We do not prejudge him. We call on Fianna Fáil to do likewise by supporting Fine Gael's motion and amendment. I note few Members, and only two Ministers on the Fianna Fáil side, have come in to defend their colleague. It is clear there is a willingness to revisit this matter in two to three weeks time. If the Commissioner does not give that explanation we have no choice. We will have no more subterfuge, vagueness or hiding from accountability. If the Fine Gael proposals are accepted &ndash; and I expect they will &ndash; we will be back here within the next three weeks if no explanation has been given. This is the minimum requirement for accountability in a parliamentary democracy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Young Persons Employment Act, 1996.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Young people working late at night, trying to juggle studies with paid employment, have featured prominently in the media in recent days. On many visits to schools in my constituency, teachers and principals have raised this issue with me and their concerns are well founded. The practice of young people turning up for class an hour or two late, or sometimes not at all, because they were working the previous night is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>We know all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and that is particularly pertinent for young people who are developing, growing, and trying to achieve exam results which will ensure them decent employment prospects as adults. On the &ldquo;Marian Finucane&rdquo; radio show last Monday, there was an interview with a young exam student who was in class from 9 a.m., rushed to work at 4 p.m., and returned home at 10 p.m. to eat dinner and do some homework. This hectic regime is not only extremely damaging to his education prospects but has health implications.</P>
      <P>Some students cannot get up in time for school because of the late hours worked the previous evening, and countless others may as well not be there because they are so worn out from late night work that they cannot learn. Work experience can be extremely beneficial but it should not interfere with their studies. Work experience in transition year, weekend work, and summer jobs are all important in developing a work ethic among young people, preparing second level students for adult life, and giving them a measure of financial independence. Limited suitable employment, carried out during these times when it will not interfere with their schooling, should be encouraged and supported. In 1996 the House introduced important legislation which set down clear guidelines on the number of hours a young person can work. That Act, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, restricts night work to a time limit for young people. Those aged 14 to 15 cannot work beyond 8 p.m. and those aged 16 to 17 cannot work beyond 10 p.m. The Act also provides for regular rest periods for workers under 18 years of age. Each employer who employs young people must display a summary of the Act in the workplace and furnish young employees with a copy of it, but I wonder how many do that? </P>
      <P>While these provisions are worthwhile, a large number of employers do not comply with them. Inspections under the Act take place only during regular office hours and only 11 inspectors are responsible for enforcing this and a host of other legislation. The figures prove the problem. In the first ten months of last year 667 inspections took place under the Act compared to 1,194 in the previous year. More inspections are urgently required. This means more inspectors are required and it is up to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to see they are appointed.</P>
      <P>As our workforce expands, there is an urgent need to ensure this area is properly regulated. We owe it to our young people to remove the pressures on them to work long hours, which would be detrimental to their health and education. There is a responsibility on schools to ensure their pupils are made aware of the Act and are encouraged to report any transgressions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this important matter on the Adjournment. I recall the debate on this matter. It took place when my party was in Opposition and during it many of the issues raised by the Deputy were discussed.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 came into operation on 2 January 1997. The Act was designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school year does not put a young person's education at risk.</P>
      <P>When the Act came into operation, details of the legislation were sent to all post primary schools, the relevant trade unions and employer bodies, the main supermarket chains, petrol stations, hotels, restaurants and vintners associations, fast-food chains and youth organisations. Those details were also sent to third level institutions as well as education officers in the relevant student unions last year.</P>
      <P>The Act sets minimum age limits for the employment of &ldquo;children&rdquo;, persons under the age of 16, and &ldquo;young persons&rdquo;, 16 and 17 year olds. It also sets rest intervals and maximum working hours, and prohibits the employment of under 18s on late night work. Employers must keep specified records of their workers who are under 18 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breaches of the Act may come to the attention of my Department by way of complaint by an <Col N="417" /> individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate. Inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records. Since the Act came into operation in 1997 more than 2,000 such inspections have been carried out, and I note what the Deputy said about inspections.</P>
    <P>Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the legislation, the matter is referred to my legal advisers to consider whether legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer concerned in respect of the alleged breach of the Act. Certain offences may be prosecuted by the trade union of which the employee is a member. A person found guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £1,500 and a further £250 a day for a continuing offence.</P>
    <P>It is also open to the parent or guardian of a child or a young person to present a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer has contravened section 13, which relates to the preservation of existing rates of pay and conditions, or section 17, which relates to the refusal to co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act. For example, if an employee refuses to work after the time set down in the Act and is penalised by the employer for doing so, the case may be presented to a rights commissioner. An employer or employee may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal from a recommendation of a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Children under 16 may be employed by licence in cultural, artistic, sports or advertising work, which is not harmful to the safety, health or development of the child and does not interfere with the child's attendance at school. The licence sets out conditions about parental consent, supervision and education arrangements and the maximum working times and minimum breaks appropriate to different age groups.</P>
    <P>There is a moral and legal obligation on employers to see that the law is upheld. There is also a responsibility on parents because before employing a young person or child an employer must see a copy of the birth certificate or other evidence of age and before employing under 16 year olds an employer must get the written permission of a parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>At my initiative, a monitoring group was established to appraise the effectiveness of the legislation and to monitor its enforcement. The terms of reference of the group are to review the operation of the Act and to advise on how it might be better implemented. Following a suggestion by the group that the provisions of the legislation be better publicised, as a specific initiative, my officials contacted publicans in the Dublin area to remind them of their responsibilities as regards the employment of young people.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the recent reports in the media of schoolgoing students working beyond the permitted hours and I urge parents and <Col N="418" /> teachers who are aware of any breaches of the legislation to contact the employment rights section of my Department.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Water and Sewerage Schemes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter for the Adjournment. This is an important issue for Westport and the surrounding areas. Westport is the fastest growing town in the west. The last two censuses revealed that Galway city and Westport were the only two areas where there had been an increase in population. Westport is a major tourist attraction centre and work will be completed in the next few weeks on a further three swimming pools in the town. Three hotels there have been upgraded to international standard. Thousands of visitors come to stay in Westport every summer, but it is disappointing to see raw sewage flowing into Clew Bay.</P>
      <P>When my party was in Government there was a water problem and a sewerage problem in the town. I was able to put pressure on the then Minister for the Environment and the Taoiseach to resolve the water problem by securing the allocation of £2.25 million for the necessary work. Before my party left office the proposed sewerage scheme was almost up and running but I was disappointed that Westport was not included in the list of water schemes and sewerage schemes recently announced.</P>
      <P>I was annoyed with the response I got to a question I tabled to the Minister last week. He said he could not identify where he could get the funding for this scheme. Why is funding for this scheme not allocated from the Cohesion Funds? Will all those funds be allocated to schemes in Dublin and other areas along the east coast, as happened in the past few years? </P>
      <P>Westport has a mix of industry and tourism. It faces the problem faced by every other town in that it does not have serviced land on which to build houses. Without a sewerage scheme, the development of Westport will come to a standstill. I appeal to the Minister, the Department and the Government to put the contract for this scheme out to tender. That will ensure that, while no money will be spent on that scheme this year, at least a contractor will be appointed and the necessary money will be found next year. I ask the Minister of State to put the contract for this work out to tender and that will save a year in terms of the completion of work on this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is outrage about the lack of a sewerage scheme in Westport. The chamber of commerce, the urban district council, other interested groups and members of the public are calling for this scheme. There are forthcoming local and European elections. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who has just left the Chamber, will be seeking votes in Westport in the European elections, but he will be ambushed like every Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Member and councillor. This scheme was almost up and running, but I do not <Col N="419" /> know why it was taken out of the programme. I want the Minister of State to tell me the reason. I hope he will announce that the contract for this scheme will be put out to tender. Perhaps the Minister will find the money to do so in the coming weeks. With the local elections, European elections, Údarás elections and a general election perhaps taking place on 11 June, it is likely that many announcements will be made in coming weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I intend to respond by dealing comprehensively with the question of funding for the Westport sewerage scheme. I will also comment briefly on the extent of the Government's commitment to the water services area generally, a commitment that has again been firmly underlined by the unprecedented level of investment set out in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme which has just been published.</P>
      <P>The 1999 programme is by far the largest ever. At £275 million, investment in water and sewerage services this year will be 50 per cent greater than last year, and no less than double the size of the 1996 spend. Funding of this order will impact very positively and substantially on our environmental infrastructure and the ability of that infrastructure to meet current and projected development needs from residential, industrial and other forms of economic activity.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy's county is a significant beneficiary under the 1999 programme, which includes Mayo schemes worth almost £84 million. Listed to start construction are the Ballina regional water supply, Crossmolina sewerage and an advance section of the Westport sewerage scheme. The Achill, phase IV water, Claremorris sewerage, Castlebar environs &ndash; Newport Road &ndash; sewerage and Ballyhaunis sewerage are included to continue construction. Provision has also been made for a significant number of schemes to advance through planning. These include the Lough Mask regional water supply &ndash; Knock to Ballyhaunis &ndash; scheme, Ballyhaunis town water, Erris regional water supply &ndash; extension to Mullet Peninsula &ndash; the Knock, Killala and Achill Sound sewerage schemes, the Ballina main drainage scheme and the main elements of the Castlebar environs and Westport sewerage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has also been approved under the serviced land initiative for schemes worth more than £3.2 million at Ballina, Ballinrobe, Newport and Mulranny, designed to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to ease pressures on the housing market. It is clear that Mayo is getting a fair share of available funding and that the schemes that have been <Col N="420" /> approved will greatly contribute to removing development constraints and to creating the infrastructure needed to support and expand tourism and other important economic activities in the county.</P>
    <P>The Westport sewerage scheme is a substantial project with an estimated cost of more than £20 million. An advance section relating to sewer rehabilitation works has been included in this year's water and sewerage services investment programme to start construction, the rest of the scheme is included in the 1999 programme to be advanced through planning. I understand that Mayo County Council will shortly be in a position to submit tender recommendations for the advance section which should allow it to get under way quickly. The planning and design stages of the main part of the scheme have been approved for funding under the EU Cohesion Fund, but I am afraid that source of funding for the construction works has not yet been identified. While I am anxious to see this section advance as quickly as possible, the available funding and the already high level of commitments under the investment programme must be considered. The Deputy can be assured that I have listened carefully, and with interest, to what he has said and that it will be kept in mind when the question of releasing further new schemes is being considered.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cobh (Cork) Landslides.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here on behalf of the citizens of Cobh, County Cork. As the Minister of State is aware, Cobh is unique. It is a town of great beauty and fascinating history. In the past it experienced great sadness but today there is vibrancy and hope among its population. However, Cobh has been neglected. It is the largest town in the largest county but it has no swimming pool or community centre and major renovations to its only approach road, which were begun several years ago, have been abandoned.</P>
      <P>My purpose in raising this matter is to highlight the fact that Cobh is experiencing even greater difficulties, namely, a long-standing problem with land slippage. I expect the Minister of State has checked the records and is aware that approximately 18 years ago a major landslide took place in Cobh. At that time, houses were demolished, people had to be reaccommodated and other consequences arose. We do not want that to happen again. However, approximately 18 months ago, another major landslide occurred in Fort Villas in Cobh. This resulted in some families losing the entrance road to their houses. The road, which is situated high above the town, collapsed in a number of places. It was fortunate that people travelling on the main road, which is situated below the entrance road, were not killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will be aware that Cobh is built like a stack of cards and there remains a danger to people's lives from falling boulders and other such material. In Connolly St., rocks are falling <Col N="421" /> into people's back gardens. A dangerous situation also exists in Harbour View Slope, Harbour Row Slope, Harbour View East Hill, High Road &ndash; west of the museum &ndash; Fort Villas and Fr. Corbett Terrace, where senior citizens live in fear of further landslides. This is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I am aware the urban district council commissioned engineers to carry out repair works and they have determined that stabilisation works are urgently required. I understand that a report on this matter has been with the Department for a long period. The problem has been ongoing for 18 years. Will the Minister ensure that funding is made available before a fatality or a disaster occurs in Cobh? This must be done quickly and the ball is in the Minister's court. The UDC and the council have done everything possible and have carried out major investigations into the matter. Last week the Minister replied to a question I tabled by stating that the Department expects to respond to the UDC in the near future. I implore the Minister to ensure that that promise is kept because this is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I visited Cobh and I invite the Minister to do so to see the cracks in the ground where another slippage could occur because the area is composed largely of shale. I am confident the Minister of State will do his utmost to provide funding and I expect his reply will be favourable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who is unable to be present in the House to respond to this matter.</P>
      <P>The urban area of Cobh is unique in terms of its geological and structural problems. The geology of the area is limestone shale, which following excavation and weathering, has become unstable in certain areas. This instability has been exacerbated by the manner in which Cobh has developed, especially in the last century. As a result of the construction of the naval dockyard and supply port at Haulbowline, the population of the town grew from a few hundred at the beginning of the 1800s to 7,000 by 1837. Demand for accommodation meant that hillsides were excavated to create building space and access roads. This activity resulted in very steep slope faces, and rock faces of up to 90 degrees behind houses. The excavated stone was used to construct the houses, roads and retaining walls. Those retaining walls were generally substandard.</P>
      <P>Following a fatality caused by a landslide in 1980, the Department has given considerable financial assistance towards remedial works undertaken by Cobh UDC to strengthen areas susceptible to landslides. The assistance takes the form of 100 per cent grants, subject to prior approval of the remedial works by the Department. Since 1980, grants of almost £1.5 million have been paid to the UDC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 1996 Cobh UDC had identified the following projects as requiring remedial works: Harbour View Slope-Connolly Street, Harbour Row Slope and Harbour View. In January 1997 the Depart<Col N="422" /> ment of Finance, at the request of my Department, sanctioned an increased overall limit of expenditure of some £2.3 million to cover the Harbour View Slope-Connolly Street, Harbour Row Slope and Harbour View projects. Approval of contract documents in respect of one project, Harbour View Slope and Connolly Street, were issued to Cobh UDC in February 1998. Subsequently, when the urban council submitted a tender to the Department for approval it became clear that the cost of the works had increased to £378,000, an increase of approximately £210,000 or 125 per cent on the original estimate cost of £167,500.</P>
    <P>The Department asked the UDC why costs had escalated to this extent, not simply because of the specific project put to tender but because of the implications for the other cost estimates in respect of the remaining projects. Information received from Cobh UDC late last year suggests that the package of projects to be put in place from within the overall programme of £2.3 million approved by the Department of Finance cannot now be accommodated within this figure. In addition, a number of additional projects have been identified by the UDC as requiring attention. The Department is in correspondence with the Department of Finance on these developments.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the situation in Cobh, but I must be satisfied that the work to be undertaken from public funds is cost effective and properly prioritised. Bearing this in mind, I will arrange for the Department to convey an early decision to Cobh UDC on the tender before the Department for approval. I anticipate that the UDC will be asked to prioritise the remaining projects before the Department to establish the order in which they should be dealt with. When this is to hand I will arrange for the requests for funding from Cobh to be considered further in the light of the overall funding available following our discussions with the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the urgent need for funding for two extra classrooms at Ransboro national school, County Sligo. Ransboro national school was built as a six teacher school in 1979-80. In 1985 increased numbers warranted the appointment of a seventh permanent teacher who has been accommodated since then in what was built as a library-medical room and which the divisional school inspector readily acknowledges is unsuitable and inadequate as a classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 the school was granted the services of a remedial teacher on a 50 per cent shared basis. To facilitate the remedial teacher, teachers were obliged to sacrifice the staffroom, which measures 12 feet by 12 feet, has two entrance doors and houses all the remedial teacher's furniture and teaching aids, including a computer. The Minister <Col N="423" /> will appreciate that a room of that size cannot accommodate a remedial teacher nor meet the needs of a staffroom which are 50 per cent greater than that for which it was designed.</P>
    <P>In May 1998 the school secured the services of a part-time secretary for whom no office accommodation is available. At present the school has 195 pupils on the roll. It expects this number to increase dramatically in the next few years. Of seven permanent full-time teachers, four are young and newly appointed and feel aggrieved at not having access to a staffroom, which they believe is rightfully theirs.</P>
    <P>The school does not have a principal's office nor a room where the principal or any other teacher can talk in private with a parent. In addition, the school has an acute storage problem and costly teaching aids, not financed by the Department of Education and Science such as televisions, videos and computers, must remain in the classroom at all times, even during the holidays. Unfortunately, the school has been broken into twice in the last six weeks.</P>
    <P>These problems would be solved by the immediate construction of two additional classrooms, one to facilitate the teacher who has been confined to the library-medical room since 1985 and the other to accommodate the remedial teacher. I understand the Department's divisional inspector supports that proposal.</P>
    <P>The Department has been very negative regarding the school's development. In the 1970s, prior to sanctioning the present school, it vigorously opposed the provision of a new school and the maintenance of the existing school on the basis that there was no justification or need for a school in the parish. There was a similar negative attitude to the appointment of a seventh permanent teacher, a remedial teacher and to the request for the appointment of a secretary.</P>
    <P>The position in Ransboro national school is <Col N="424" /> very serious. The teachers and the pupils do not have the facilities to which they are entitled and I ask the Minister to ensure the necessary funding is provided in the Department's budget for 1999 so that construction of two classrooms can start as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter since it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of additional accommodation for Ransboro national school. This six classroom school was built in 1980 following the amalgamation of two smaller schools in the Ransboro area. The school caters for part of the Strandhill parish and is located five miles from Sligo town. In 1985 a seventh teacher was appointed to the school and in 1993 the school secured the services of a shared remedial teacher. The current enrolment is 195.</P>
      <P>The school management applied recently to the Department of Education and Science for additional classroom accommodation. This application is currently under examination in the planning and building unit of the Department. In the course of the examination factors such as the current accommodation level at the school, the demographic trends, including possible housing developments in the immediate area, and the proximity of the school to Sligo town, will be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>As is normal in such cases also, an inspector's report and recommendation has been sought and obtained in the matter. On completion of this examination, the Department will be in a position to advise the board of management of the outcome. I appreciate the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure the provision of adequate accommodation for the present and future needs of the school.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 February 1999.</P>

This event was attended by the local MP and Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon, church leaders and representatives of the partnership board, including political representatives from the various parties and representatives of local businesses, trades unions, and the community sector.</P>
    <P>In the afternoon, accompanied by Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon, I visited Newry. My visit there included a site visit to see the progress being made on the new Roches Stores outlet being built there, a further example of the opportunities for investment and employment that can be reaped in an island economy operating in conditions of peace.</P>
    <P>A walkabout in Newry town gave me an opportunity to meet the people of Newry and see for myself the impressive revitalisation which is taking place there, much of it with the assistance of the International Fund for Ireland. I also attended a special meeting of the Newry and Mourne District Council. At this meeting, I commended the council for their proactive approach to cross-Border initiatives, including their involvement in the East Border Region Committee, their links with Dundalk Urban District Council and their involvement with organisations such as the IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council.</P>
    <P>Following on my meeting with the council, I met with the Newry and Mourne District Partnership Board, who briefed me on their activities in the area. I also attended a civic reception hosted by the district council, at which I met a wide range of individuals and representatives from across the spectrum including local community groups. During my visit to Armagh and Newry I also had very useful private meetings with Seamus Mallon and the UUP Assembly member, Danny Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss or report in detail on all the meetings I had in the past week relating to Northern Ireland other than to say that I met the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, and the SDLP leader Mr. John Hume in Dublin and our discussions focused, in the main, on how best to ensure the successful implementation of the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement, in particular, the issues surrounding the formation of the Executive. It is clear that we have to continue our efforts to achieve progress and that is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the consultative forum envisaged under strand two of the British-Irish Agreement, our efforts to date have, in the main, been focused on the implementation of the North-South aspects of the Agreement. The consultative <Col N="427" /> forum is a matter to be considered, between the administrations North and South and in due course, when the Northern Administration is in place, I could see a role for the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council in advising on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee, which I chair, is supported by a small millennium office located in the Department of the Taoiseach. This office was set up in the latter half of 1998 and currently consists of the secretary to the committee, who is a full-time assistant principal in the Department of the Taoiseach; a projects development officer and a millennium press officer.</P>
      <P>The position of the projects development officer was advertised within the civil service at executive officer level. Seven candidates were shortlisted and interviewed. The successful candidate is on the salary scale level of £17,172. In addition, this officer receives an allowance of £3,000 per year which pertains to the position of projects development officer and will exist for the duration of the millennium commemoration period. The officer's salary and allowance are paid from the millennium subhead in the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tom Rowley was appointed as the millennium press officer with the support of the National Millennium Committee. Mr. Rowley's position is on a contract basis for a period of two years commencing 15 January 1999. His annual salary is £50,000. An additional performance bonus not exceeding £5,000 per annum is also payable. The amount will be decided by the committee on 1 December 1999 and paid retrospectively. Vouched pension expenses not exceeding £5,000 per annum are also payable. Mr. Rowley's salary and expenses are also paid from the Millennium subhead.</P>
      <P>Before the position of millennium press officer was filled, I discussed the matter with about a half a dozen different journalists, including the person whose name was supplied by the Deputy and also public relations people whom I felt might be available for such a short-term assignment or indeed might know of a colleague whom they could recommend. I was satisfied that this was the best approach to take in the circumstances especially in the short timescale involved.</P>
      <P>As regards the offer made to the individual named by the Deputy, we discussed a range of possible salaries. However, matters did not develop to the stage where a formal offer was made.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides quarterly and annual divorce statistics as classified by the Circuit Court Office to the Central Statistics Office. These statistics are a count of divorce applications and divorces granted. They do not, however, provide information on the social aspects of divorce sought by the CSO. The compilation of court statistics must have due regard for the confidentiality of family law cases and any arrangements to extend the scope of such statistics will have to fully respect such confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I have noted carefully the concerns of the National Statistics Board and I am in contact with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the improvement of divorce statistics in the context of the modernisation of the General Register Office and in the context of the establishment of the new Courts Service Board. Further consultation is envisaged in the near future.</P>
      <P>An amendment of the Statistics Act 1993, would only be warranted in the context of a comprehensive solution involving the full consideration of all of the issues involved including the implications for the court statistics and the registration of vital statistics systems.</P>

      <P>There has been no appreciable change as yet in the projected enrolment in primary school for the years 1998-99 to 2003-04 from that which I outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 841 of 30 September last. In the 1997-98 school year the total number of pupils enrolled in primary schools was  460,830 pupils. The most recent enrolment projections at primary level for the years 1998-99 to 2003-04, made by my Department, are as follows: 1998-99, 448,000; 1999-00, 436,000; 2000-01,  429,000; 2001-02, 425,000; 2002-03, 424,000; 2003-04, 424,000.</P>
      <P>Projections are produced by the Department on an annual basis. The projections above will, obviously, be updated and revised on that basis to reflect emerging trends in fertility, migration, and progression. The number of births in Ireland fell from approximately 59,000 in 1987 to a low of 48,000 in 1994 but has increased since then to some 52,000 in 1997. If births continue to increase, as assumed in my Department's projections, primary level, enrolment should start to increase again from 2004/05 onwards.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office will be producing its population and labour force projections, for the period 2001-31 before the end of March 1998. This publication will include projections of births which the Department will use in its future projections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is an important matter I hope Deputies will not mind if I give a detailed answer to Deputy Bruton's question. The cases referred to by the Deputy have been taken by parents on behalf of children with significant special needs and, in particular, children with autism. There are at present 57 such cases, of which 38 relate to children with autism.</P>
      <P>Last year I announced that the Government had agreed a major new initiative under which all children assessed as having special educational needs arising from disabilities are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of full or part-time teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the level of their special needs. Already, as a result of this initiative, my Department has allocated an additional 33 resource teachers and 156 child care assistants to cater specifically for children with special needs. The process of deploying the necessary resources to meet the needs of all such children is continuing.</P>
      <P>I have also announced my Department's formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this development, my Department has already established an additional 28 special classes dedicated to the needs of such children. These classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of a child care assistant. Further classes will be established where the need arises. On the day this initiative was announced the Irish Society for Autism referred to it as representing the end of a 25 year campaign.</P>
      <P>The essential point of this initiative has been to remove the necessity for parents to seek to vindicate their childrens constitutional rights by taking court cases. Since the launch of the initiative there has been a dramatic fall in the number of new cases arising and I expect this trend to continue. I am also pleased to be able to inform Deputies that the High Court has expressed its appreciation of the actions of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current status of these cases is that the provision which has been put in place for each child is being reviewed in order to ensure that it is working to the satisfaction of all concerned and, in particular, that details such as transport and outreach provision are finalised. In none of the cases concerned is the State seeking to deny provision to the children, it is simply a matter of the cases being brought to their conclusion in such a manner as to ensure that the plaintiffs are satisfied. I draw the House's attention to the report <Col N="433" /> of Mrs. Justice McGuinness on 12 January, where she noted that the provision put in place was welcomed by the parents. She granted a further adjournment until April to allow details to be finalised and for the tidying up of any difficulties that might arise.</P>
    <P>As I said, my policy has been to remove the cause of these cases. In his question the Deputy refers to the State defending the cases. We have sought to resolve each case in a constructive fashion, to the satisfaction of both the court and the plaintiff. It is a matter of fact that the conclusion of cases is, as the Deputy will know, a matter for the courts and the plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>This is an important area and I know Deputies will agree that the State's response in previous years was at best inadequate. The indications are that the major developments put in place by this Government will, once and for all, have made sure that we have available to these children a level and quality of education appropriate to their needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has already reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in both primary and second level schools. While the pupil-teacher ratio serves a useful function in indicating the relationship at national level between pupil numbers and teacher numbers, it does not accurately reflect the position in many classrooms. While I accept some schools have a pupil-teacher ratio higher than the national average, equally there are schools with a ratio below the national average.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools now stands at 21.2 to one. The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has improved due to the allocation of additional ex-quota and concessionary posts and the application of a reduced ratio in respect of a range of new programmes which have been introduced in second level schools. The Deputy will also be aware of my recent significant initiative which introduced a retention ratio of 18:1 in relation to schools with over quota full-time teachers who might otherwise be redeployed. This, coupled with the provision of a remedial entitlement to all second level and the extension of the home school liaison scheme, will have a considerable and sustained impact on the pupil-teacher ratio at second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the start of the 1999-2000 school year, in addition to retaining the demographic dividend in primary schools and introducing a retention ratio at second level for over quota full-time teachers, the Government has sanctioned the creation of a further 450 new posts across both sectors. These <Col N="434" /> measures will result in a further substantial reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. This is the first significant increase in teacher staffing for many years.</P>
    <P>I believe these moves clearly indicate the importance which this Government attributes to education, and demonstrate its commitment to address seriously the issue of teaching resources available in our schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Breaking the Cycle is a five-year pilot project that was introduced in autumn 1996 in 33 urban schools and 123 rural schools. The schools involved have undertaken to engage in in-career development and to co-operate with testing procedures and with the evaluation of the pilot project. The evaluation of Breaking the Cycle is being carried out by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra. The evaluation began in January 1997 and encompasses preliminary, interim and final reports and a longitudinal study. It is wide-ranging in focus in order to identify and measure the outcomes in all their complexity.</P>
      <P>Preliminary reports on each dimension of the project, urban and rural, are under consideration in my Department and a decision will be made in due course regarding their publication. These reports establish base-line data against which developments in the project schools will be assessed through the five-year project period and longitudinally thereafter.</P>
      <P>I stress to Deputies that the advice given to me is that the preliminary reports on the two dimensions of Breaking the Cycle are not evaluations. As I said, they were produced in the first year of the project and the work in that period and its effects could not be measured that early. The proposed interim reports will contain data collected to the end of the current school year and the reports will be available early in 2000.</P>

      <P>Individual schools test their own pupils' progress in literacy and numeracy using a variety of tests, including standardised tests. Information on pupils' progress, including those with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties, is kept at school level.</P>
      <P>There is an estimate from the National Survey of English Reading (1993), which tested a random sample of pupils in fifth class, that about 6 per cent to 9 per cent of pupils have serious literacy difficulties. International surveys would indicate reading literacy levels for Irish nine and 14 year olds of just above average.</P>
      <P>In relation to numeracy the results of surveys conducted by my Department during the 1980s on the primary curriculum mathematics programme were expressed in the form of the percentage of pupils who had attained mastery of particular mathematics objectives. In general, the findings of the surveys indicated that the great majority of pupils in the classes tested, second, fourth and sixth, attained mastery on those objectives involving basic computational skills. The main deficiencies indicated by the surveys were in relation to conceptual understanding and the solving of word problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study involved Irish pupils in third and fourth classes. The results showed that the mean mathematics scores of Irish pupils in both class <Col N="436" /> grades were higher than the corresponding international mean mathematics scores. Among countries involved which satisfied various sampling criteria, Irish pupils were placed seventh of 16 countries in the third class survey and sixth of 17 countries in the fourth class survey.</P>
    <P>The Government is strongly committed to improving literacy and numeracy and, for this reason, has increased significantly the resources made available to schools to achieve this objective. These include the extension of a remedial service to every school as of this September and the allocation of £6.5 million for school library books. I intend taking further steps in this area in the coming months.</P>
    <P>While I believe that all students entering second level should have solid skills in literacy and numeracy, and I am committed to ensuring this becomes a reality, a set prohibition on progress is believed to have had harmful consequences when it was in practice previously. As such, I do not propose to reintroduce it.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, including those with dyslexia, should generally be capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The level and quality of this training is one of the important issues to be addressed by the Review Group on Primary Teacher Training. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teachers in the primary system. I recently announced my intention to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning difficulty are normally integrated into ordinary classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsel<Col N="438" /> lor and subject teachers. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>In 1998 my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, ACLD to assist in its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
    <P>In addition, as an exceptional matter my Department made a payment of £14,000 to the Dyslexia Support Centre, Barrington, Georges Quay, Limerick last year. My Department is not however in a position to make further assistance available.</P>
    <P>The recent package for special needs children announced by the Minister is available to children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia. In addition, I have asked my officials to review current supports, including inservice teacher training, for children with dyslexia. This review will be open to considering the full range of possible supports for the pupils involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The integrated delivery of services to children and families at risk is one of the most important concepts in addressing the challenge of educational disadvantage. Fundamental to the concept is the understanding that disadvantage is a multifaceted issue and can be addressed effectively only in a multifaceted way.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that I am fully committed to the concept of integrated service initiatives which are designed to address the needs of local communities in their totality. As the Deputy is aware, this approach is currently being developed in four designated areas under the integrated services project and is being monitored by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion of which I am a member. A committee of senior officials from various Departments, including those mentioned by the Deputy, supports the Cabinet committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative is intended to address a hierarchy of needs including housing and environment, <Col N="439" /> social order, community development, health, childcare, education, recreation, youth initiatives, training and employment. In my view, co-ordination of all State services and agencies in addressing needs is crucial in order to optimise the benefits of services to families and individuals in these communities and to break the traditional intergenerational cycle of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The way in which resources are deployed is as important as the level of resources available to State agencies. Research has shown that those most at risk of not benefiting from the system are the children of the unemployed or the children of early school leavers. Therefore, educational achievement, both initial and second chance, is a key issue to be addressed within the overall strategy.</P>
    <P>My officials have had initial discussions with the Departments identified by the Deputy on optimising the participation by my Department and, in particular, with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation which has responsibility for local development. Area Development Management, which has a full-time co-ordinator assigned to the initiative, has also been consulted. I have also recently nominated four officials within my Department to act as co-ordinator of the project in the four designated areas who will pursue resource and other issues for their areas with the relevant divisions. I am aware that the local vocational education committees have done likewise. I understand that a seminar has been arranged later this month to brief all Government and State agency personnel assigned to work on this initiative.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House of the commitment of my Department to this initiative, which will act as a model for our approach to service delivery in other disadvantaged areas, and to working with all Departments and agencies in a concerted effort to reduce exclusion, marginalisation and poverty and establish an inclusive society where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a policy of positive discrimination in favour of all disadvantaged students and schools. Total provision in support of the disadvantaged includes the core funding of these schools, special staffing arrangements, increased capitation grants, favourable arrangements in regard to capital provision, <Col N="440" /> including local contributions, alleviation of examination fees and transport costs, the provision of special curricular programmes, a schools psychological service and number of student support schemes. As support for the disadvantaged permeates virtually all aspects of education expenditure, it is not feasible to indicate precisely the percentage of budgets devoted to it.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record the fact that I am very conscious of the vital role that education can play in ensuring greater social inclusion. Education is a key ingredient in ensuring that each individual has the opportunity to maximise his or her potential. Education is also crucial in breaking the cycle of inter-generational disadvantage and re-integrating into society and the workforce those at risk of becoming marginalised.</P>
      <P>For these reasons my Department has, as I have stated earlier, a wide range of measures in place, including early intervention measures, to help alleviate the negative impact of socio-economic disadvantage across the education spectrum.</P>
      <P>The primary mechanism for addressing the effects of socio-economic deprivation is the disadvantaged areas schemes which provide special teaching assistance and extra funding to schools in designated areas of disadvantage. At present under these schemes, a total of 318 primary schools and 211 second level schools are in receipt of special support packages. The schools in question serve a total of 75,508 primary pupils and 99,000 second level pupils in disadvantaged areas. There are 294 additional over quota teaching posts at primary level and 209 additional teaching posts at second level.</P>
      <P>Schools in the disadvantaged areas schemes may also benefit from other initiatives targeted to combat educational disadvantage. These include the home-school-community liaison scheme; the Breaking the Cycle scheme; the Early Start pre-school pilot project; and the support teacher pilot scheme, all of which are targeted at primary schools in areas of particular disadvantage. In addition, the recently introduced early school leavers initiative focuses on children in the eight to 15 year age group and involves schools at first and second level.</P>
      <P>Other significant initiatives to aid the disadvantaged include the vocational training opportunities scheme for unemployed people over 21 years of age, Youthreach for young people who have left the education system without any qualifications, support for junior and senior traveller training centres and the provision of teaching services to FÁS funded community training workshops. My Department provides significant funding in support of disadvantaged youth outside of the formal education system and contributes also to the alleviation of educational disadvantage among adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will also be aware that I recently announced details of a major new initiative to tackle educational disadvantage. This plan commits the Government to targeted expenditure of £57 million over the next two years aimed at <Col N="441" /> addressing educational disadvantage at all levels in the education sector.</P>
    <P>I believe that the measures I have outlined in summary here indicate the clear commitment of this Government to tackling disadvantage in all areas of education and I am confident that the significant range of measures already in place, coupled with the additional £57 million package which I recently announced, will be of major assistance in addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The problem of underage drinking is a challenge for a wide range of agencies and persons, including the drinks industry and vintners and, very especially, parents. Schools, teachers and youth services have an important role to play in co-operation with parents and with personnel and agencies engaged in the prevention of the misuse of alcohol.</P>
      <P>In order to support schools in fulfilling their role my Department has developed a programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools. As I announced at the end of 1998, this programme, which is called Walk Tall is being disseminated to all primary schools over the two years, 1999 and 2000. This has involved the employment of a support team of seven teachers, on secondment, to organise and provide staff training seminars for teachers on the programme.</P>
      <P>My Department has also prepared a substance misuse prevention education programme, On My Own Two Feet for post-primary schools. This programme was introduced in early 1995 when a support programme of in-career development for teachers commenced. The programme has been introduced to approximately 70 per cent of post-primary schools and to Youthreach centres. The supporting in-career programme continues during the present school year at 12 locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My Department co-operates with the Department of Health and Children in the preparation and introduction of the programmes mentioned; both Departments are now engaged in preparing to begin the dissemination later this year of the experiences and outcomes of the Health Promoting School Network, which has involved primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the non-formal education area, voluntary youth organisations are supported in the prevention of substance misuse through the national youth health programme. This programme is a partnership between my Department, the National Youth Council and the Department of <Col N="442" /> Health and Children. The issue of underage drinking is addressed in the programme.</P>
    <P>One of the resources produced by the youth health programme is the Drink Awareness for Youth resource package. This provides comprehensive information for young people and guidance on dealing with the problem of excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>Individual youth organisations also run alcohol awareness programmes at local level. The No Name Club, for example, which receives support from my Department is dedicated specifically to providing alternative social outlets to those involving the use of alcohol.</P>

      <P>The demographic dividend arising at primary level in the current school year has not yet been finally determined, but I anticipate that it <Col N="443" /> will be roughly of the order of that for 1998. I can however assure the Deputy that, consistent with the Government's commitments the entire dividend arising will be retained within the primary school system.</P>
      <P>On the post-primary side, subject specialisation, retirement patterns and limited redeployment capacity effectively ensure that there is no demographic dividend at this level in the current year. In the case of secondary schools which have on their staff over-quota permanent teachers, a ratio of 18:1 will be applied. The impact of this is that schools will be allowed to retain teachers who might have been placed on the redeployment panel.</P>
      <P>Retention of the primary dividend, when combined with the 450 posts which this Government has already sanctioned for the education sector from the start of the 1999-2000 school year, will represent a very substantial investment in education. This is the largest increase in teacher numbers for many years.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group on the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags outlines a number of recommendations which have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations relates to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post primary levels, is in the process of initiating an awareness raising campaign by arranging for the dissemination of the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters will also be distributed to all schools which will highlight the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outline the range of local measures that can be adopted in order to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>In addition, the building unit of my Department has amended its documentation for the provision of furniture to include an optional specification for sloped desks. Schools which are entitled to grant assistance for desks as a result of a new school or extension being provided may choose the specification for sloped desks. It is a matter for the school to decide whether or not they wish to avail of this option.</P>

      <P>My Department's long standing policy in the matter of promoting pupils has been clearly set out in three circulars, the earliest of which dates back to 1967. I have not issued any instructions amending this policy. The policy specifies that the primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course which provides for an infant programme of two years followed by six years in standards from first to sixth. The syllabus for each component of the curriculum is designed to give the greatest possible degree of flexibility in selecting programmes best suited to the individual needs of individual pupils and schools.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pupils should progress from one standard to a higher standard at the end of each school year. In this way, pupils who have completed sixth standard at the minimum age of 12 years should transfer to post primary education and have the opportunity to complete three years of post primary education before reaching the minimum school leaving age.</P>
      <P>Since the retention of pupils is a serious intervention in a child's educational progress, the managerial authorities of schools should examine and exploit the deployment of staff resources, the use of more flexible class management and teaching methodologies and the involvement of parental and home supports before considering retention as an option. This policy applies to all pupils and to all schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Early Start pre-school pilot project was introduced in eight primary schools in 1994. An educational programme was designed for young children which would enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage. The project was extended in 1995 to a further 32 schools. Three <Col N="445" /> year old children in the schools catchment areas who were deemed most at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system are enrolled in the Early Start centres.</P>
    <P>The project was evaluated by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra over the period from September 1994 until June 1997 and the evaluation report was submitted to the Department in 1998.</P>
    <P>The evaluation report indicates that, on a range of objective tests which involved childrens cognitive, language and motor behaviour, no significant differences were found between the performance of the first two cohorts of Early Start pupils when they reached junior infants class and that of junior infant pupils who had not experience Early Start. Teachers perceptions, however, of the effects of Early Start were more positive than the test results.</P>
    <P>The evaluation report on early start, and any possible extension of the pilot project, is being considered in the context of the report of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, on which work has already commenced.</P>

      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examination for students, who have either specific learning difficulties or difficulties which arise from a physical or medical condition, is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability, while at the same time not conferring an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination. The use of a word processor is granted in a very small number of cases, to students who would otherwise have extreme difficulty presenting legible material for examination. This can arise where there is a physical impairment or in some instances a specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>For examinations in language subjects granting access to a spell check or thesaurus facility would be the same as granting access to a dictionary. I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system it would be inappropriate to allow some candidates a facility that is not available to all candidates in subjects where spelling skills are under assessment and where the certification implies that the candidate has those skills.</P>

I have asked my officials to raise this issue in the context of those discussions and in particular to consider permitting the use of spell check software in subjects where its use would not conflict with the assessment objectives.</P>

      <P>Second level schools are free to address the issue of road safety as part of the programme in civic, social and political education. This subject is part of the junior certificate core curriculum for second-level schools. It is a course in citizenship based on human rights and social responsibilities. The syllabus specifies a number of concepts which must be addressed, but schools have a good deal of flexibility with regard to how this is done. A number of these concepts can accommodate the study of issues relating to road safety, for example: rights and responsibilities and law.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> In civic, social and political education, emphasis is placed on active learning methodologies with a view to the development by pupils of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values which will enable them to act responsibly as citizens.

      <P>Projected enrolment figures are frequently taken into account when determining staffing levels applicable to primary schools in any one school year. In general, as the Deputy is aware, the staffing of primary schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. Historically, however, a school which is due to lose a post may seek the retention of that post if the school can demonstrate that its projected enrolment cannot be managed within the recommended maximum class size guidelines. Likewise, a school which projects substantial enrolment growth in any one school year relative to another may also seek the retention of a post.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the situation where a school is due to lose a teaching post, schools which project substantial enrolment growth or which project enrolments which are incapable of being managed within maximum class size guidelines can also seek the immediate allocation of additional teaching resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the total number of days that untrained personnel worked within primary schools amounted to 109,000. The corresponding figure for 1998 was 139,858. The information requested in relation to second level is not available in my Department. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department's policy is that, as far as practicable, second level teachers should be qualified in the subjects which they are teaching.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary school system. For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures which are designated to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. Specifically, I have ensured that the intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education in 1998-9 was increased to over 1,000. This includes 748 students who will pursue the three year B. Ed degree programme, while 280 degree holders have been admitted to an 18 month full-time post-graduate training course. Additionally, B. Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conver<Col N="449" /> sion course for degree holders, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent. I have further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education shall be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Education Awards, shall from 1 September 1998 also be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement in the area of pre-school education is currently confined to its support for the Early Start pre-school pilot programme; the Rutland Street pre-school project; and traveller pre-schools. The number of places provided in these projects has not increased since September 1995. In addition a new child care measure has been introduced to support access of unemployed adults and early school leavers on to VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller programmes. The measure allows for direct provision of cre±che facilities, purchase of places on existing cre±ches and payment of child minders subject to tax compliance and registration under the Child Care Act.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I held a national forum for early childhood education.

The report on the outcome of the forum has now been received in my Department. It is currently being considered as part of the preparation of a White Paper on early childhood education which will set out my proposals for future development of services in this area. In advance of completion of the White Paper, I recently announced an allocation of £1.2 million for special initiatives on early education.

      <P>At post-primary level, the extent of the facilities available at any given school will largely depend on the curricular range being offered and this can vary considerably from school to school. In drawing up the schedules of accommodation for new buildings, provision is made for specialist areas such as science laboratories, language laboratories, libraries, metalwork rooms, construction studies areas, home economics rooms, computer rooms, etc. It is also the policy of my Department to provide PE halls at all new schools and at schools which are undergoing a major extension. Where schools wish to offer a particular curricular option but do not have the physical facilities to cater for it, they may apply to the post primary building unit of my Department for capital funding. Such applications will be assessed on the basis of need and the availability of funding.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the infrastructure facilities are geared towards meeting the needs of the curriculum and the scale of such facilities varies with the size of a school.

The purpose of this exercise is to alert all schools to recent developments in support services for special needs children and to advise schools on how to apply for support under this initiative.</P>
      <P>Details of each of the disability categories identified by the special education review committee will be included in the information package. Schools catering for any such children will be required to provide detailed information on the number of children involved; their ages; the nature of their disabilities; and the support required. Information provided by schools under this initiative will be of significant assistance to my Department in identifying the overall number of special needs children within the system and the nature and level of special needs involved. If, following an analysis of the data received, it is considered that additional information is required, the necessary surveys will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available from all the institutes of technology and universities on the numbers of students who fail to complete third level courses. The reasons for drop out are complex. There is no simple explanation and no one simple initiative that will address the issue. Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also, of course, be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards. The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Education Awards.</P>
      <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report should be available by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The annual returns submitted by the institutes of technology to my Department do not provide specific data in relation to the drop out rates. However, a number of initiatives have been taken in the sector to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition/drop out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The council of directors of the institutes of technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on maximising success rates for institutes' students. The committee is currently assembling a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. This profile will be made available to all institutes of technology. The Committee is preparing recommendations in relation to the funding of action projects/programmes both short and long-term based on best practice.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology have introduced a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction/orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students.</P>
      <P>Three institutes &ndash; Dundalk, Carlow and Tralee &ndash; have recently completed a pilot study on retention rates for first year students. These findings will inform the national working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the Department, the council of directors has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the Institutes, which will consist of a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students <Col N="454" /> over a four year period and a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
    <P>The research project team is currently undertaking a visit to each of the institutes of technology and is developing a standard format to which institutes of technology can respond to the variables that influence progression/retention for each course.</P>
    <P>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at third level, I recently announced that I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>
    <P>It is also of note that in its consultative process background document which was published in September 1998, the Commission on the Points System included the results of a sample study on the relationship between performance in the leaving certificate and performance in higher education. The outcome of the research indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that non-completion of courses, either due to drop out or failure, is especially acute among those with lowest leaving certificate scores at entry. In particular, 2 per cent of the sample failed final year, 3 per cent were still attending higher education, 7 per cent passed first year and withdrew, 7 per cent failed first year and withdrew and a further 7 per cent did not sit first year examinations. The research team engaged by the commission is now undertaking a more detailed analysis of the sample of students and the commission aims to publish the outcome of this analysis in the next few months.</P>

To the extent that teacher posts become available for allocation, they are primarily <Col N="455" /> focused on addressing needs in the in-school situation. Such allocations can take the form of remedial teachers, resource teachers, concessionary teachers and home/school/community liaison posts.</P>
      <P>I understand that schools in the partnership area in question are already in receipt of a significant range of special support teachers. However, many other schools are in need of such services and it is necessary that their needs be addressed as a priority. I assure the Deputy that the project to which he refers will be fully considered if co-ordinator posts become available for allocation in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> The adjudication of the <i>ad hoc</i> Public Service Arbitration Board in respect of the Youthreach claim recommends that Youthreach co-ordinators and resource staff be offered fixed purpose contracts or a minimum of two year contracts, whichever is the longer; the application of the seven point scales used for managers and trainers in community training workshops, backdated to 1 January 1997, with assimilation onto the new scales on the same basis as applied in the workshops; the payment of qualification allowances of £1500 per annum, backdated to 1 January 1997 for co-ordinators and resource staff with degrees or other qualifications which are reckonable for payment of incremental teaching salary, and of allowances of two thirds and one third respectively to holders of university diploma and certificate qualifications in education and training, youth or community work or counselling; payment of the part-time teaching rate to hourly paid staff; and that eligible part-time teaching contracts be continued for staff in respect of Youthreach work. In addition, full-time instruction staff in Youthreach will be pensionable under the conditions set out in the local government superannuation scheme. A ballot completed on 4 February has resulted in acceptance of the recommendations of the adjudication board, and arrangements are now being made to put the changes into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement and Partnership 2000. In order to calculate how much is due under Partnership 2000, it is first necessary to complete the calculation of how much is due under the PCW agreement.</P>
      <P>The PCW agreement is a complex one and its final elements, those concerning in-school management, were agreed only in January 1998. In order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.</P>
      <P>The pace of the work of payment has, however, been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &ndash; 50 per cent higher than in 1996. The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at this stage is that all retired teachers have received, at minimum, an increase <Col N="457" /> of 3 per cent in pension, backdated to 1 July 1998. With regard to outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making outstanding payments to the retired teachers involved as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should add that, with a view to reducing the number of queries received and thereby enabling staff to concentrate on payments, my Department has recently supplied secondary teachers with a comprehensive information booklet, in a question-and-answer format, on the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme. Similar booklets are being prepared for issue to primary teachers and vocational teachers.</P>

      <P>Each psychologist employed by my Department is assigned a list of named schools. An important part of the psychologist's work is to assist the principals, guidance counsellors, remedial and other teachers of those schools to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. In this way, the psychologist is able to <Col N="458" /> estimate the numbers of students who may need psychological intervention and consequently the amount of time that needs to be spent in each school.</P>
      <P>In deciding on overall priorities, the psychologist also takes into account referrals which are made in respect of applications for special arrangements in certificate examinations or of students who are out of school, for one reason or another. In many cases, the psychologist discusses individual students in the light of the schools assessment results with teachers and parents and advises on appropriate remedial strategies. This means that many students are able to benefit from the psychologists advice without the need for an individual psychological assessment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> The enrolment policy of each special school is a matter for each board of management. From time to time, pupils can encounter delays in gaining admission to special schools. Such situations can result from accommodation problems; delays in securing necessary assessment reports; or delays in recruiting necessary teaching staff. My Department makes every effort to ensure that any such delays as kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the overall capacity of the special school system. My Department will sanction additional teacher posts where requested by special schools to accommodate increased pupil numbers. Special schools are established in central locations in response to the level of need presenting in the general area. There are a number of other special facilities in the Dublin area catering for children with special needs, including hearing impairment; autism; and specific learning disability. It is necessary to view each pupil's special need on an individual basis. For some children, the nature of the special need may be such that the child can perform quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial or resource teacher. As indicated in my recent announcement of a major development in special education services, both the remedial and resource teacher services are undergoing major expansion.</P>

      <P>No change has been made in relation to how examiners mark the papers of candidates with a specific learning difficulty. The position is that the work of all candidates in any one subject is marked in accordance with a common marking scheme. This is to ensure that uniform and objective criteria are universally applied in the interest of fairness and equity and to ensure the validity of the certificate examinations as national instruments of assessment.</P>
      <P>A change of an operational nature has been made which does not involve any change in how an examiner applies a marking scheme when marking examination material submitted by students with specific learning difficulties. Traditionally where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner. However in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit in accordance with the marking scheme for all work done at the examination.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. The intention is to ensure that problems with readability whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged. Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>
      <P>Approximately 70 representations were addressed directly to me that related to the entire range of special arrangements for the 1999 examinations. My Department estimates that about 45 of those representations referred to the operational change that I have described. The representations appear to be based on the false premise that a change in the actual marking of work was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the special arrangement scheme is reviewed from time to time in order to ensure that we do all we can for students who may encounter a difficulty in relation to the examinations and in that regard officials from my Department met with the Association for Children with Learning Difficulties, ACLD, in December last. A further meeting is scheduled for later this month at which the range and scope <Col N="461" /> of arrangements for students with specific learning difficulties will be explored again.</P>

      <P>The report of the special education review committee recommended in 1993 that remedial teaching should be made available on a phased basis to all pupils with reading difficulties, irrespective of age, ability or size or geographical location of the schools in which they are enrolled. At present 1,302 remedial teachers provide access to a remedial teaching service for some 91 per cent of children in national schools. There are still, however, 704 small national schools without a remedial service.</P>
      <P>I have recently given a commitment that by September 1999 these remaining schools, other than those with PTR of less than 10:1, will have access to a remedial teaching service. Arrangements are now being put in place to enable this to be done. Schools with PTR of less than 10:1 may apply directly to my Department for a remedial teaching service giving details of their level of need. In addition, my Department provides in-career development courses for remedial teachers at six venues throughout the country. These courses are attended by some 150 remedial teachers each year.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the House of this Government's ongoing commitment to tackling educational disadvantage during its term of office. In this context, I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 3 December detailing a two-year £57 million plan for a wide range of initiatives at all levels of education to tackle educational disadvantage. It is a comprehensive package, which represents the largest ever programme of its type in this country. I stress that this package builds on existing provision incorporating a range of programmes and initiatives specifically targeting disadvantaged schools and communities.</P>
      <P>The package covers key areas such as early education, remedial services, home-school-community liaison, traveller education, children with disabilities, the establishment of the national psychological service, school planning, substance misuse prevention, early school leaving, adult literacy and third level access and retention. Our most important goal is to broaden and deepen participation at all levels of education as I am very conscious of the vital role that education can play in ensuring that every individual maximises his or her potential and helps to break the cycle of inter-generational disadvantage so evident in some of our communities.</P>
      <P>As I stated in December it is my intention to build further on the initiatives launched and to continue to address educational disadvantage as part of a broader social inclusion programme during my term of office. I might add that in order to give a central co-ordinated focus to this work I have recently established a social inclusion unit in my Department the role of which is to co-ordinate policy and initiatives aimed at combating social exclusion and disadvantage. In only a brief period in office this Government has already demonstrated an unmatched commitment to giving real priority and substantial resources to this important area.</P>

      <P>I refer Deputy Moynihan-Cronin to my <Col N="463" /> response of 2 December 1998 in which I indicated that the preliminary results of the first 1,062 questionnaires returned from a national survey of primary schools showed that 74 per cent of schools have taken the first step in implementing an RSE programme by setting up an RSE policy committee. I also outlined that some 54 per cent of primary schools indicated their intention to teach the RSE programme in some or all classes in the current school year. The preliminary results of 88 of the first 250 responses received at post-primary level showed that 83 per cent of schools have set up RSE policy committees and 81 per cent indicated their intention to teach the RSE programme in some or all classes in the current school year.</P>
      <P>Since December 1998, further replies have been received from schools and a full analysis of the responses is currently being carried out. When the final figures are available I will communicate them to the Deputy. I assure the Deputy that I and my Department intend to continue to build on this high level of implementation of this important programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The proposal referred to by Deputy O'Shea is to take £100 from the maintenance grant entitlement which would then be paid as a registration grant to maintenance grant recipients at the beginning of the academic year. The proposal has been made in the context of the ESF maintenance grants scheme where maintenance grants are paid monthly in arrears and where grant holders are subject to normal industrial disciplines regarding time-keeping and absenteeism and college authorities are required to reflect these factors in the payments of grants. Accordingly, it would not be feasible to accept the proposal in the absence of a review of the regulations governing the scheme.</P>
      <P>These payment arrangements differ from those applying under the other two maintenance grants schemes for third level students namely, the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarships scheme where maintenance grants are paid in three equal instalments as early as possible in each term.</P>
      <P>One of my priorities regarding third level grants is to ensure that students receive their first maintenance payment as early as possible in the academic year. With this in mind I brought the recoupment arrangements for the local authorities to a current year basis in 1997, which has improved the timeliness of payments to students. I believe that a focus on early payments is more appropriate than an approach which would further segment the payment of maintenance grants, with a consequential increase in the administrative burden on the local authorities and vocational education committees, without any benefit being derived by the students.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I have already indicated that the method of payment of grants under the various student support schemes is one of the issues which will be addressed in the context of the review of the administration of the third level student support schemes which is being undertaken by officials of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>The development of parents so that they can become directly involved in their children's <Col N="467" /> education is a central part of the home-school-community liaison scheme which targets areas of disadvantage. It is a feature of this development that parents are trained to work with and support other parents in developing relevant skills. In this context, a programme which was designed to build the skills and capacities of parents who would become home visitors has been developed in one liaison area and disseminated to the other areas. This outreach dimension of the scheme is deemed to be an important and timely development in the provision of service in disadvantaged communities. I would add that it is my intention that the home-school-community liaison scheme will be extended to all disadvantaged schools from next September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the media reports regarding the Provost's comments to the effect that the low level of student grants was the greatest disincentive to all young people from disadvantaged backgrounds wanting to go to college.</P>
      <P>I agree that the question of financial support is a critical one facing students from disadvantaged backgrounds in considering third level education; however, the factors underlying the low participation at third level of students from disadvantaged backgrounds go far beyond this question. Indeed, the need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third-level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established. In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to target resources on the issue of broadening and deepening participation in further and higher education. In particular, I am committed to targeting the most disadvan<Col N="468" /> taged groups with the keys being summed up as access, diversity and progression.</P>
    <P>The promotion of access must deal with tackling disincentives of tradition and support. In particular, colleges must outreach and additional support should be available where it is needed. Between direct funding from my Department, and funding through the HEA, almost £900,000 is spent on this area in the current academic year and I have recently announced details of a £6.9 million two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. A further £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in institutes of technology. Details of the allocation of these additional resources will be announced in due course when I have fully considered how best to proceed in these areas.</P>
    <P>A diversity of provision is also essential to expanding access. It is not good enough to concentrate on the supposed high-status degree level courses. A system which is to have any credibility must have a balance and the opportunities provided by high quality sub-degree courses are a critical part to any effective plan to promote participation. As I have mentioned before, I see this sector expanding and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine it.</P>
    <P>Ensuring progression between levels is also key to expanding participation. The low level of progression at the moment is simply unacceptable and I have said on many occasions that I expect institutions to join the effort to expand its operation. The qualifications Bill which I will be publishing will be an important part of guaranteeing routes of progression through further and higher education.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of the value of the maintenance grants, with some 50 per cent of the third level population qualifying for maintenance grants, the schemes cannot be described as a targeted measure aimed at helping the poorest of students. I believe that we should aim to increase the income available to students in need, but because of finite resources, we must have priorities and we must target those most in need. In this regard, I would point out to the Deputy that expenditure on these schemes in the current year will be in the region of £80 million. This is in addition to the cost of meeting third level tuition fees which will be some £140 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated my intention is to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants scheme before dealing with the more general issue of grant levels. In this regard, I have announced that the anomalous situation of independent mature students will be addressed with effect from the coming academic year, when all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> For the record, I advise the Deputy that my officials have been in contact with the Provost regarding his comments and the Provost has confirmed that his comments were in relation to the grants available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds rather than grant levels generally. Indeed, the Provost has welcomed the approach I have taken to tackling disadvantage in education and strongly supports the need to target resources at those students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

      <P>An application for the provision of a PE hall at Loreto secondary school, Bray, County Wicklow was received in the planning and building unit of my Department in April 1998.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools. A PE hall is also provided when a major extension to a school, which does not have such a facility is being built. In addition my Department has a programme for providing PE halls as stand-alone projects at post-primary schools which do not already have this facility. A number of such projects are in architectural planning and some have proceeded to construction in the past year.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at Loreto secondary school, Bray can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes. Because of the huge demand for accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when funding will be made available for this project.</P>
      <P>However, I assure the Deputy that this project will continue to be reviewed in the light of available finances and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The transition year curriculum is designed by the individual school in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department. These guidelines include sections on personal and social development and health education. Under the <Col N="470" /> latter heading, relationships and sex education is mentioned as a suggested theme.</P>
      <P>A relationships and sexuality programme has been developed in my Department for use in primary and post-primary schools. The part of this programme designed for senior cycle students at post-primary level contains a section entitled &ldquo;responsible parenthood&rdquo;. Preliminary results of a survey of schools indicate that a significant number of schools are already teaching the RSE programme within the overall framework of SPHE &ndash; social, personal and health education. The RSE programme is available to teachers of transition year classes.</P>
      <P>One of the broad aims of the transition year programme is to help pupils to grow in maturity. Areas of development such as decision-making and problem-solving are fostered both by the content and teaching methodologies of transition year programmes. A specific module on the family was designed jointly by the transition year support team and the Commission on the Family in 1997. This module is used in a number of transition year classes. It looks at the family from a variety of angles, including parenting.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of preparation for adult and working life, transition year pupils do a work experience module. Many pupils do their work experience in cre±ches. The most important aspect of work experience is the reflection on that experience which takes place when pupils return to their schools. In the case of pupils that gained their work experience in cre±ches, subsequent discussion would focus on issues of child care and child rearing.</P>

      <P>Under the EU Common Fisheries Policy, member states' fishing fleets are constrained by capacity limits set in the context of multi-annual guidance programmes. Against this background, Irish sea-fishing boat licensing policy is designed to maintain strict control on proposed introductions into the fleet. Licences are only granted, therefore, where an applicant proposes to remove capacity from the sea-fishing boat register equal to that of the proposed new vessel. This policy has been in place since May 1990.</P>
      <P>Vessels licensed under the special licensing scheme may not, as a general rule, be removed from the sea-fishing boat register or used as replacement capacity to facilitate the introduction of a new vessel into the fleet until 12 months after the date of their registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concerns of Deputies about fishermen whose fishing activities have been seriously hampered over recent weeks. I heard at first hand the real hardship which some fishermen were enduring during a two day series of meetings with fishermen's representatives from around the country. I was particularly concerned about those fishermen who operate out of smaller inshore boats, dependent on catches of whitefish for their regular income. These are the most vulnerable people in the fishing communities as they are most affected by weather conditions. My priority was to devise a structured response that will protect the livelihoods of fishermen during periods when they are unable to fish and have very low incomes. The Deputy will be aware that EU state aid rules for the fishing industry rule out aid packages for income loss due to periods of bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to meeting fishermen's organisations I met my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Following detailed discussions with the Minister, the agreement of Government was secured to the introduction of a new scheme to be known as &lsquo;fishing assist' which will benefit low income self-employed fishermen. The legislative <Col N="475" /> basis for the scheme is provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, which was published last week.</P>
    <P>The new scheme includes changes to the income support arrangements for fishermen as follows: 80 per cent of all income from self-employment will be assessed, rather than 100 per cent as has been the case heretofore; child related income disregards of £100 per annum for the first two qualified children and £200 per annum for the third and subsequent children, and relaxation of &lsquo;signing on' arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is expected that over 500 low income self-employed fishermen will benefit from the fishing assist measure which will cost up to £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>This scheme provides a structured response to a long-term problem and tackles the situation of low income fishermen in the whitefish and inshore fleets who are particularly vulnerable to prolonged periods of bad weather which interfere with fishing activities.</P>
    <P>The overall situation in relation to the ongoing impact of weather conditions on the fishing industry will remain under review at future meetings of the sea fisheries liaison group.</P>

      <P>The costs of providing this service are primarily general staff costs and it is not possible to attribute any specific proportion of this to the promotion of the Irish language as such.

      <P>In a statement issued on 1 February I expressed the hope that the people of East Timor would soon be in a position to realise their long-held desire for self-determination. On that occasion I added my full support to the call by the jailed resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, for a ceasefire to be agreed by all sides in East Timor and for a phased withdrawal of Indonesian troops from the territory. I am hopeful in this regard that the current round of talks in New York between Portugal and Indonesia &ndash; under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General &ndash; which are aimed at finding a negotiated solution to the Timorese question, will prove to be successful.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks I have had detailed discussions on the question of East Timor with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Jaime Gama. I have exchanged views with both on the political future of East Timor. I have also been closely involved in further developing EU policy on the issue. At the European Council in Vienna on 11-12 December, the EU called for a real and substantial reduction in the Indonesian military presence in the territory, the liberation of Xanana Gusmao and of all political prisoners and the establishment in East Timor of a permanent United Nations presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that a UN presence in East Timor would be of immense benefit in stabilising the situation on the ground. I have made it clear that Ireland stands ready to offer assistance to the United Nations should it decided to dispatch <Col N="477" /> observers or monitors to East Timor to oversee a ceasefire and any subsequent military withdrawal which may be agreed. Unfortunately, the establishment of such a UN presence can only be brought about at present with the consent of the Indonesian authorities. This has not yet been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Government has always been opposed to the supply from any source of arms or equipment to the Indonesian authorities which may be used against the civilian population of East Timor. No licences are issued for the export of such equipment from Ireland, and we will seek to ensure that the provisions of the EU code of conduct for arms transfers are strictly implemented by our EU partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that increased levels of technetium-99 have been found in the north-eastern Irish Sea. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, undertakes a regular and comprehensive environmental radioactivity monitoring programme of Irish coastal waters. The RPII publishes its results annually in its annual report and also releases bi-annual detailed reports, the most recent of which deals with the 1996-7 period.</P>
      <P>The RPII data indicates significant increases since 1994 in concentrations of technetium-99 in seaweed sampled along the north-east Irish coastline as a result of increased discharges from Sellafield. However the highest measurements made by the RPII for the north-eastern Irish coast are more than 100 times lower than the level detected on the Sellafield coastline.</P>
      <P>The RPII is aware that very high levels of technetium-99 were found in lobsters collected near Sellafield. However, levels of this radionuclide detected in Irish marine produce remains very low. The RPII emphasises that the levels detected by the RPII in fish and shellfish from Irish coastal waters are below EU safety limits.</P>
      <P>Despite the occurrence of certain concentrations of radioactivity in parts of the Irish Sea, it is the considered judgment of the RPII, based on the results of its detailed monitoring programme, that doses arising from radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea are very small and that the situation does not give grounds for any reservations by the Irish public about eating fish, or in any other way enjoying the amenities of the Irish Sea. Nevertheless, it is clearly objectionable from an Irish viewpoint that any contamination of the Irish Sea should result from the operations of nuclear installations in other countries.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective is, of course, the cessation of all radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. I have availed of every opportunity to highlight Ireland's opposition to the radioactive contamination of the environment, particularly the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The most immediate issue relating to marine discharges from Sellafield is the decision to be made by UK Ministers on BNFL's revised discharge authorisation limit following the referral by the UK Environment Agency to the UK Ministers of the agency's draft decision in the matter. I have written to the UK Ministers objecting to the Environment Agency's draft decisions on the grounds that the proposed reductions in technetium-99 are totally inadequate and at variance with the positive commitment given by the UK Ministers at the OSPAR ministerial meeting in July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> I am determined that the commitments made by UK Ministers at OSPAR last July are fully and speedily achieved. I will be meeting Minister Meacher shortly to reinforce the Government's view that there should be substantial early reductions in technetium discharges.</P>

      <P>I set out a revised timetable in my previous reply of 3 November 1998. The timetable for development remains as stated.

The area aid unit contacted the person named with a view to resolving the difficulties. The person named was unable to satisfy the area aid unit that the commonage area claimed was correct. It appears that the plot claimed as commonage is no longer classified as commonage and that the Land Commission divided this commonage into individual parts and assigned it to the herdowners who previously had shares of this commonage. The area aid unit is in contact with the Land Commission to resolve the difficulty and to ascertain the area of land that has been assigned to the person named.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an area aid application for 1998 with a declared forage area of 13.2 hectares. Maps issued to him to resolve an overlap problem on his application. His reply has been processed and the application has been finalised with an adjusted forage area of 11.79 hectares. The person named was paid his full entitlement of £600.72 under the 1998 cattle headage scheme on 4 February 1999 based on this area. He submitted two applications under the 1998 ten month special beef premium scheme, one on 14 January in respect of five animals and one on 18 March in respect of four animals. Payment of 80 per cent has issued for both applications.</P>
      <P>He submitted three applications under the 1998 22 month special beef premium scheme. The first application in respect of 11 animals was lodged on 14 January 1998. Two of the animals were rejected because of age inconsistencies with earlier declarations for ten month premium and were, accordingly, deleted from the application with a consequent reduction penalty on the remaining nine eligible animals. An 80 per cent payment at a reduced rate has issued on the nine animals. The second application was in respect of four animals and was lodged on 18 March 1998. An 80 per cent payment has issued in respect of these four animals. The third application was in respect of two animals and was lodged on 26 May 1998. An 80 per cent payment issued in respect of one of these animals. A stocking density restriction prevented any payment issuing on the second animal. However, the area aid application of the person named was amended recently and, consequently, a manual payment for £72.13, representing 80 per cent of payment due has been prepared in respect of this animal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced yesterday, the Government has decided to establish two new group regional authorities whose functional areas will correspond to <Col N="487" /> the two NUTS II regions which the Government has proposed to EUROSTAT. The new group regional authorities will be based on the existing regional authority structure. They will be called the Border, Midlands and Western Group Regional Authority and the Southern and Eastern Group Regional Authority. They will cover respectively (a) the current regional authority areas of the Border, midlands and west, to include Counties Clare and Kerry, and (b) the regional authority areas of Dublin, the mid-east, the mid-west, excluding Clare, south-west, which with the exclusion of Kerry will be known as the Cork region, and the south-east.</P>
      <P>The two new group regional authorities will have the following responsibilities: promoting co-ordination of the provision of public services in their areas; advising the Government on the regional dimension of the National Development Plan (NDP); monitoring the general impact of all EU programmes of assistance under the community support framework, CSF, in their areas, and managing regional programmes in the next CSF.</P>
      <P>While the Government will retain the final decision on the content of the NDP, the two regional authorities will have a major consultative role in this regard. The existing regional authorities which comprise the new group regions have already been given financial assistance to enable them to produce regional strategies for the new NUTS II regions for input into the NDP.</P>
      <P>The assignment to the new group regional authorities of responsibility for managing regional programmes in the next CSF represents a significant devolution of responsibility to regional authorities by providing for the first time for regional programmes in the National Development Plan and for regional authority management of such programmes. Management of the regional programmes means that the new group regional authorities will be involved in drafting the regional programme for their area in conjunction with the Department of Finance. They will also chair the regional programme monitoring committee and act as secretariat to the committee.</P>
      <P>The membership of the new group regional authorities will be drawn from elected representatives from the eight existing regional authorities. The existing regional authorities will remain in existence and will retain their existing functions at sub-regional or NUTS III level.</P>
      <P>Since the Government's application was lodged in November last there has been extensive contact and clarification of it at official level with EUROSTAT. EUROSTAT were appraised of the draft proposals in regard to new regional structures prior to their consideration by Government. They are being formally notified of the Government's approval for the new structures and an early decision is now expected from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing the proposals on new regional structures for Government, both I and officials of my <Col N="488" /> Department held discussions with representatives of the Irish assembly of regional authorities. My Department will continue to work with the regional authorities and other regional interests to ensure the smooth setting up of the new group regional authorities. The draft proposals for regional structures were also outlined to the social partners in discussions held with them on 20 and 21 January to discuss the national development plan and related matters.</P>
    <P>The group regional authorities will be established by order made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under the Local Government Act, 1991. My Department has liaised closely with the Department of the Environment and Local Government about both the legal and practical aspects of the new group regional authorities and will continue to do so as primary responsibility for drafting the establishment order rests with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

In addition, the local authorities also paid interest of £14.9 million to Ulysses plc, a special purpose vehicle company established in the context of the securitisation of local authority mortgages in 1995 and 1996, in fulfilment of contractual obligations to that company. While the bulk of the interest paid would relate to borrowings by the local authorities from the local loans fund which were used by the authorities to fund mortgages advances, some 10 per cent of local loans fund advances were used for other purposes.</P>

      <Col N="491" /> In some instances, this additional funding reflects the phased development of services. Particularly in the acute hospital sector the funding also reflects the location of national specialities and the planned development of regional services. Funding of £2.948 million is provided in 1999 for the national breast screening programme and this funding was channelled through the North Eastern Health Board. Services will be funded by this programme on a national basis. In relation to the Midland Health Board the £0.400 million provided under clinicians in management includes funding of £0.300 million for the office for health management based in Harcourt Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>At present the scheme does not cover children under the age of two years, since all children in that age group are regarded as requiring constant care and attention. Having received a number of inquires in relation to the qualifying age for this allowance, I arranged for this matter to be examined and would be sympathetic towards the principle of extending coverage of the scheme to that age group.</P>
      <P>I am keeping matters under review in relation to the possible extension of this allowance to children under two years of age in the future.</P>

      <P>In previous years the recruitment and selection processes for places on both the general nursing and psychiatric nursing registration-diploma programmes was administered by the nursing appli<Col N="492" /> cations centre. An Bord Altranais has assumed responsibility for the overall management of the nursing applications centre from this year onwards and has renamed it the nursing careers centre in order to give it a broader focus in relation to nursing as a career generally. This transfer of responsibility is in accordance with the strengthened role of An Bord Altranais in the area of pre-registration nursing education and training recommended by the Commission on Nursing .</P>
      <P>As part of the preparations for this year's competitions, An Bord Altranais, with my approval, amended its own rules to revise the minimum educational requirements for entry to nursing training. Broadly speaking, the requirements have been brought into line with those of the third level institutions. The effect of this rule change is to expand the range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programmes. In particular, it removes the requirement for a foreign language in the case of the non-NUI third level institutions involved in the operation of the programmes. A decision was subsequently taken by the NUI to drop the requirement for a foreign language for entry to the programmes. These changes will introduce greater flexibility in the entry criteria for nursing training, without reducing standards, and will increase the pool of school leavers and others who will be eligible for places on the nursing diploma programmes.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the changes which I have outlined, together with the national and local recruitment campaigns which I have funded, will result in a successful outcome to the competitions and a full uptake of all the available training places on the 1999 nursing diploma programmes.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Nursing has recommended the establishment of a representative nursing education forum to prepare a strategy for moving pre-registration nursing from the present three year programme to a four year degree programme in time for the intake of nursing students in the year 2002. I have established this forum, which is chaired by Dr. Laraine Joyce, the deputy director of the office for health management. Its membership includes representatives of schools of nursing, third level institutions, health service providers, An Bord Altranais and relevant government departments. The forum is holding its first meeting today and it is expected to complete its work and report by the end of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first tasks that the forum has been asked to undertake is an examination of the respective weightings that should be given to the academic achievement and general suitability of applicants for entry to student nursing programmes. At present, the application system for places on the nursing diploma programmes operates outside the Central Applications Office. It is <Col N="493" /> intended that, in line with what has been recommended by the Commission on Nursing, the application process would be transferred to the CAO in advance of the introduction of a four year degree programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, which came into operation on 1 July 1997, provides the necessary legislative framework to deal with the problem of litter and graffiti. Under the Act, the primary management and enforcement response must come from the local authorities. Information on the implementation of the Act is set out in the reply to Question No. 151 of 3 December 1998.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office, I have pursued the following programme of action to combat litter pollution. In the second half of 1997, I undertook, through my Department, a factual information campaign to inform the general public of their duties and responsibilities under the 1997 Act. This included the printing and circulation to local authorities and the general public of an information leaflet about the new litter laws, the supply of generic advertising material to local authorities and an information campaign on local radio. In September 1997, my colleague, Minister Dempsey commissioned a second national litter survey which was presented to my Department in December, 1997. This survey was a follow-up to the initial survey carried out in October 1995, and it has been used by me in targeting action against litter. I have allocated almost £650,000 in grants to local authorities between 1997 and 1998 to co-fund selected public education and awareness initiatives on litter.</P>
      <P>I am developing a national litter pollution monitoring system to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action, which will become operational in the first half of 1999. The system will also help to identify and eliminate litter blackspots. Local authorities will be able to use the data produced to review needs and priorities at local level to prevent and control litter, and to target appropriate action to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am providing financial support for An Taisce led project, National Spring Clean 1999 in April 1999, a broad based partnership approach, co-sponsored by national and local government, an NGO and major private sector companies, to <Col N="496" /> raise public awareness and participation in anti-litter initiatives at local level to clean up the local environment. The project includes a central role for local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am stepping up the promotion of anti-litter awareness among young people, in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and through an anti-litter campaign for primary schools for the 1998/1999 school year developed by ENFO. I met all local authority managers in June-July 1998 to reinforce the need for strong action to tackle the litter pollution problem.</P>
    <P>I take every possible opportunity to urge local authorities to make full use of their powers under the 1997 Act to combat litter. My Department's provision for litter awareness activities for 1999 has increased to £526,000 and we will be working with local authorities, businesses and the educational sector to secure effective implementation of the range of ongoing measures and to develop new initiatives. Since 1 January this year, local authorities can also deploy some of the additional resources now available under the local government fund to bolster their anti-litter operations.</P>

      <P>My Department oversees and funds the operation of a steering group &ndash; An Grúpa Stiúrtha faoin Ghaeilge sa tSeirbhís Rialtais Áitiúil &ndash; to promote the use of Irish in the local government service. The only other readily identifiable expenditure is on Irish-language training for Department staff, although it should be noted that the bulk of the cost in this regard is borne by Gaeleagras na Státseirbhíse, Department of Finance. The table below sets out the total amount of money spent on these two items in each of the past five years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department provides funding to local authorities to carry out a wide range of functions and this expenditure indirectly supports the use of Irish, for example, bilingual signalisation, publications, etc. It would not, however, be feasible to isolate the amount spent on the use or promotion of the Irish language from these funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, my Department incurs substantial ongoing translation, advertising, and publishing costs due to its policy of publishing documents bilingually, where possible, and of advertising in the Irish language media. However, a total for the amount of money spent on this per year is not readily available and its compilation would <Col N="497" /> involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</P>

      <Quest>if he will extend the free travel pass facility to recipients of a retirement pension in view of the fact that they will receive it at aged 66 when they reach old age pension age and many of them are suffering from medical conditions.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. The objective of the scheme is to assist older people and people with disabilities to remain active in the community.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1998, over 530,000 free travel passes had been issued at an annual cost of £32.6 million. The full year cost of extending the free travel scheme to recipients of retirement pension under age 66 is estimated at £400,000. However, it is likely that such an extension would have to be considered in respect of all people aged 65 and not just this specific group, which would cost an estimated £1.75 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>My Department recognises the rights of customers to have services provided through Irish and will ensure that the services given will be of high quality.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the amount of money spent in any given year specifically on the use and promotion of the Irish language. Expenditure on such items as, for example, design, printing and advertising, does not show amounts incurred specifically in relation to Irish. In addition, a significant amount of translation work is carried out by staff of the Department, fluent in the language, as part of their normal work and separate figures in relation to this are not readily available.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing services to those who wish to do business through Irish and the Department's Customer Action Plan 1998-1999 outlines the policy in this regard. It is the Department's policy to respond using the Irish language to any correspondence received in Irish. Forms are available in Irish, on request, and the headed paper used to correspond with customers is bilingual. It is also the policy to have bilingual office signage.</P>
      <P>My Department has staff who are proficient in the Irish language and who provide a service on a regular basis, through Irish, to customers. Irish language training is provided on an on-going basis for staff throughout the Department and some staff members have undergone Irish language media skills training to prepare them for radio etc. appearances.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present examining how we can further improve and extend the service through Irish and, in particular, how we can ensure that staff receive the necessary training and supports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. Total expenditure on the scheme in 1997 amounted to some £5 million. A sum of £2 million was initially allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. This is on top of another £5 million paid on this scheme in 1997.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government. A provision of £2 million has been made available for the scheme in 1999.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how it is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>Further to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 3 February 1999, it has been policy over the years to permit retired lockkeepers who have held lockhouses as an emolument of their employment to remain in occupation of these dwellings after retirement until such time as they can make alternative arrangements. This is the situation of the former lockkeeper at Carlow Lock.</P>
      <P>As I previously stated, the private development overlooking the lockhouse is not on canal property and it was granted full planning permission by the planning authority. The lockhouse has been affected by flooding for many years and the Office of Public Works is considering a number of options for flood alleviation in the Carlow area. The impact of any proposed flood relief scheme on canal property will be assessed in due course.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the waterways official who recently visited the lockhouse has dealt with the situation in a sympathetic and sensitive manner. I understand the former lockkeeper and his wife have expressed a wish to remain in the lockhouse and I do not intend to frustrate their wishes. However, should they apply to the local authority for alternative accommodation, my Department will support their application.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I assure the Deputy that my Department adheres to its responsibilities in the use and promotion of the Irish language by, <i>inter alia,</i> the inclusion of Irish in published booklets and information leaflets concerning the Department, the placing of advertisements in Irish language publications and the bilingual printing of all the Department's letter headings. Signage in my Department complies with Government policy <Col N="505" /> and is displayed in both Irish and English, and scholarship grants are paid to members of the Department's staff who attend Gaeleagras courses.</P>
    <P>The Garda ochána, in accordance with Government policy to improve bilingualism in the State sector, has recently launched a five year strategy for the Irish language in the force for the years 1998 to 2002. This is the third in a series of action programmes for the development of a quality service through the Irish language for members of the public coming into contact with the Garda ochána. These programmes have been developed in consultation with Bord na Gaeilge and are in line with Government guidelines and directives.</P>

      <P>As set out in my Department's quality customer service action plan issued in December 1997, &ldquo;tá seirb ar fáil dóibh siúd ar mian leo a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh t Ghaeilge.&rdquo;  In this regard, the staff of my Department are encouraged to and facilitated in attending courses in Irish. In addition, the Department's stationery is in bilingual form. It would not be possible to estimate the additional cost of this work since the establishment of my Department with any degree of accuracy as it is treated as an integral part of services provided by my Department to the public.</P>

      <P>At present there is only one visiting teacher providing tuition for non-national pupils in the Dublin area. There were five such teachers working on a temporary scheme which was set up in 1992 to cater for the language needs of programme refugees. Four of these were on secondment and one was a temporary appointment. Of these, two teachers returned to their <Col N="506" /> schools in January of this year, one had already gone to live outside the jurisdiction and one has accepted a permanent teaching appointment. Only one continues to visit schools.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position in the near future to announce details of a new scheme to help the authorities of national schools which have enrolled substantial numbers of non-national pupils with English language deficits. The posts which were available on the former scheme will be redeployed and a substantial number of new posts will be created for the new scheme.</P>
      <P>The appointees to this new scheme will be attached to specific schools and will not operate on a visiting teacher service basis.</P>

      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary school system. For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. Specifically, I have ensured that the intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education in 1998/99 was increased to over 1,000. This includes 748 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed degree programme, while 280 degree holders have been admitted to an 18 month full-time post-graduate training course. Additionally, B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I have further decided that from 1 September, 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education shall be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, shall from 1 September, 1998, also be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes.</P>

      <Col N="507" /> In relation to second level schools there had been some difficulties in finding trained teachers in a number of key subjects. A working group composed of representatives of the universities, my Department and the Higher Education Authority, under the aegis of the authority, was reconvened to undertake an in depth review of future needs for second level teachers. This review focused both on total needs and on needs by subject grouping, where feasible and examined all relevant factors such as pupil numbers, pupil teacher ratios, teacher retirements and career breaks. In light of the recommendations of the working group, I agreed to an increase in the number of places, from 800 to 940, on the Higher Diploma in Education courses for the current academic year. One hundred of the additional places are specifically for teachers of Irish, religion, Italian, Spanish and key sciences. The further 40 places are for the Higher Diploma in Education course through Irish which has been introduced at National University of Ireland, Galway.</P>

      <P>Physical education facilities encompass indoor PE halls and outdoor hard play areas, such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields. Virtually all schools have at least one element of these facilities.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post primary schools. PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have such a facility is being built. In addition, my Department has a programme for providing PE halls as stand alone projects and a number of these have proceeded to construction in recent months. In all cases, the appropriate range of physical education equipment is provided as part of the project.</P>
      <P>Schools which require repairs or refurbishment to be carried out to existing PE facilities are eligible to apply for grant-aid under my Department's scheme of capital grants and are allocated funding as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure in relation to the appointment of teachers for a new &ldquo;greenfield&rdquo; second level school is that my Department authorises the board of management to advertise for a principal who may be appointed with effect from a date up to six months in advance of the scheduled opening date of the school. When the principal is appointed, the post-primary teachers section of my Department discusses and agrees the staffing requirements with him or her, having regard to the projected enrolment on the opening date. The board is then authorised to make the necessary arrangements for the recruitment of the appropriate teaching staff.</P>
      <P>In connection with the building project, the building unit's technical staff are currently examining the Stage 2 submission, that is, the outline sketch scheme which has a floor area of 4,550mf7&gt;2. At this stage of architectural planning, it is too early to say when tenders will be invited for the project or when construction will commence but it is hoped that the accommodation will be open for operation by September 2000. The school is being planned to accommodate 650 pupils.</P>

      <P>The legislative programme of my Department at present encompasses six Bills which I intend to publish and have enacted as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to publish the qualifications (education and Training) Bill, 1999 in the next few weeks. The Bill provides for a national framework of qualifications and for mobility and linkages within that framework. I hope that, with the co-operation of my colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas, it will be possible to enact the Bill before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>A Bill with the working title Education (Welfare) Bill is at present being drafted by the parliamentary draftsman's office following approval of the general scheme by Government on 16 September 1998. This Bill will establish a comprehensive legislative and administrative system for dealing with school attendance issues and issues relating to the educational welfare of children generally. It is my intention to publish the Bill before the summer with a view to its enactment later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> On 26 January 1999, the Government authorised the drafting of the Teaching Council Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a regulatory authority for the teaching profession. It is intended that it will be published in the summer and it is my intention that enactment should take place before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) (Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown), Bill is currently being drafted by my Department. The purpose of the legislation is to establish the Institute of Technology at Blanchardstown on a statutory basis and bring it within the general Regional Technical College Acts &ndash; it is established under company law at present. It is my intention to publish the Bill and have it enacted before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of the Youth Work (Amendment) Bill has been approved by Government and has been referred to the office of the Attorney General for drafting. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Youth Work Act, 1997, given that its provisions were to a large extent dependent on the establishment of education boards. The Bill will enhance provision for youth work and, in particular, will provide for the development of co-ordinated plans at local and national level. It is intended to publish the Bill by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of an amendment to the Vocational Education Acts is currently being prepared by my Department. The legislation is intended to update aspects of the law relating to the vocational education committees. I hope to publish the Bill in the autumn. It is not possible at this time to anticipate a likely date of enactment.</P>

    <P>I recently announced a major new package to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. As part of this initiative, arrangements are being made to extend the home/school/community liaison service to all primary schools with disadvantaged status. This development, which will come into effect from September next, will mean that every disadvantaged primary school will have the support of a locally based co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>The operation of the support teacher pilot project and the breaking the cycle pilot project is being closely monitored by my Department's Inspectorate. The question of further expansion of these projects will be considered following an evaluation of the operation of their current phase.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering an evaluation report on early start, together with the report of the forum on early childhood education, as part of the process of preparing a White Paper on early childhood education. The White Paper will set out my proposals for the future development of services in this area.</P>

      <P>There are fifty-seven fee charging second level schools recognised by my Department. Information concerning the location of fee-<Col N="514" /> paying schools is set out in the attached tabular statement.</P>
      <P>My Department meets the salary cost of sanctioned teachers in fee charging schools and this amounted to approximately £30 million in 1998. Fee charging schools do not receive the <i>per capita </i>grant in respect of their students nor do they receive other supports to which schools in the free education scheme are entitled.</P>
      <P>In the case of Protestant schools, all of which are fee charging, a block grant of £3.1 million was paid in 1998 to the Secondary Education Committee for distribution among needier Protestant children to enable them to attend a Protestant school. In addition, these schools are eligible for all grants payable under the free education scheme with the exception of the per capita grant. The amount paid in 1998 amounted to £150,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>Capital resources paid to these schools amounted to approximately £300,000 in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being made in my Department to extend the remedial teacher service to all primary schools from September next. As part of this development, primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of below 10:1, may apply for a service where they can demonstrate the particular needs of their pupils. The remedial needs of Killala national school will be addressed in this context.</P>
      <P>I understand that a remedial teacher is currently based in Scoil Naomh Pádraig, Corracrin and providing a service to that school and adjacent schools.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, post-graduate training courses to enable degree holders qualify as primary teachers are provided from time to time by the colleges of education for primary teachers. At present there are 280 students attending such a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be pleased to note that I am examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who hold the higher <Col N="516" /> diploma in education and who have Irish as part of their degree, or, alternatively, Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>Additionally, I have further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education shall be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the initiatives which I have outlined above are merely a small part of a broad range of initiatives which I have implemented since coming into office in order to substantially boost the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will provide a specific financial allocation to all post primary schools for the purpose of providing secretarial and caretaker services.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing funding arrangements for post primary schools includes provision for the purpose of providing secretarial and caretaker services in schools. The way in which this provision is made reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools and is consistent with the manner in which resources generally are allocated to these schools.</P>
      <P>The allocation of caretaking and secretarial posts in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis and it is a matter for each committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit. Most schools in this sector have the services of a full-time caretaker and a secretary. Community and comprehensive schools have a full-time secretary and caretaker and schools with an enrolment in excess of 500 pupils have two full-time secretaries. Voluntary secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more are in receipt of additional <i>per capita </i>grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services, subject to a maximum of £8,750 for caretaking and £10,500 in the case of secretarial services. The manner in which these services are provided is a matter for individual schools.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, fuarthas iarratas i mo Roinn ón bhFochoiste Meánoideachais, i dtaca le Coiste Ghairmoideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, ag iarraidh scoil lán-Ghaeilge dara leibhéal a chur ar fáil chun freastal ar riachtanais an cheantair seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glacann mo Roinn leis, go bhfuil méadú ar an éileamh ar oideachas dara leibhéal tré Ghaeilge i dtuaisceart na Cathrach, toisc an fás atá tagtha le blianta anuas ar uimhir na ngaelscoileanna sa cheantar. Is an cheist is mó atá le réiteach ná <Col N="520" /> conas is fearr freastal a dhéanamh ar an éileamh seo.</P>
    <P>D'aimsigh an Fochoiste somh taobh le Scoil Neasáin agus rinne ball d'Fhoireann Teicniúil mo Roinne an somh sin a mheas. Léirigh an scrúdú sin nach mbeadh an somh, atá 1.2 acra ar fhairsinge, oiriúnach ar chor ar bith le h-aghaidh buan-fhoirgneamh scoile.</P>
    <P>Is féidir liom a dhearbhú, áfach, go bhfuil oifigigh mo Roinne i dteagmháil leis an bhFochoiste agus le Coiste Ghairmoideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, d'fhonn réiteach sásúil a aimsiú a luaithe agus is féidir.</P>
