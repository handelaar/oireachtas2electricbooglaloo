      <P>I welcome the initiatives announced by the Government in regard to child care and, in particular, the abuse of children in the distant and recent past. It must be recognised that the Government is dealing with horrors which have affected children, now adults, and their families and which at the time our society did not equip itself with a vocabulary to describe adequately. Is it proposed to introduce legislation to deal with any of the initiatives announced? Why has the appointment of an ombudsman for children to deal with problems which may arise in the future not been included in the package?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for responding to the proposal on the Order of Business a fortnight ago that an apology be offered in this House. That matter will be taken tomorrow. I also compliment the Government on the way it has responded so far. When will the measures outlined in the package be brought forward? Can some definitive progress be made at last on the juvenile justice Bill, otherwise known as the Children Bill, which has been languishing for over two years? With the forbearance of the Chair, I remind the Taoiseach that it is still not clear from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whether we are talking about a set of amendments to the existing Bill or a new Bill. Can that matter be resolved once and for all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Government for responding. Will it be proactive and place the commission on a statutory basis? Will the Taoiseach do what he can to speed up publication of the mental health Bill given that there are still severe problems of neglect and under-resourcing in a number of institutions which may land us in a similar situation in the future? We are in a position to take action now to prevent problems occurring in the future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> It would have been useful if the Government had circulated to Deputies yesterday a comprehensive report on the proposals made. As it is, we are relying on media reports. I strongly welcome the establish<Col N="847" /> ment of a commission to inquire into institutional child abuse. I understand it is to begin work in September. In view of the fact that the Dáil will not meet in part of July and August, is it proposed to introduce legislation to give the commission powers which will make its work of inquiry effective? I understand it is part of a process of healing. This is important as is the apology from the State. There are matters which have to be inquired into, including the reasons these nightmares happened and were allowed to continue for so long. Powers will be needed.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what legislation will be introduced? Will the sections of the report on Madonna House, which were wrongly suppressed when it was published, be published as part of the healing process and the process of coming to terms with the more recent as well as the distant past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation on this matter, I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Government that it intends to amend the statute of limitations so victims of child sexual abuse will be able to take court action despite the fact they have gone beyond the age of 18. I published a Bill in this regard and suggest the Government take it in Government time because given the queue in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as regards legislation, I do not know how long we will have to wait for the Government Bill to be published.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is justification for excluding victims of physical abuse from the legislation which, according to yesterday's Government announcement, includes only sexual abuse. Will the Taoiseach clarify that matter? There is no reason victims of gross physical abuse, such as the breaking of legs about which we heard in the programme last night, should not be included in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the leaders and Deputies for their support for these initiatives. A number of Bills are affected by this. I have had a report on the dates for all the legislation, most of which has already received priority. I will circulate a note on the times as soon as they are definite. I am trying to introduce all the legislation this year, but I would like to get a proper report from all the Departments. I will then circulate a note to the spokespersons and the leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton asked about the ombudsman. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges Ireland, as a party to the convention, to establish a mechanism to vindicate the rights of children. The convention does not describe any particular mechanism but, as I said before, the children's ombudsman is the most common model adopted by countries which have ratified the convention. Recently the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, outlined his intentions in that regard in the House. At present he is with the <Col N="848" /> ombudsman from Norway, which has been identified as having a satisfactory and suitable system. The Norwegian ombudsman has agreed to spend some time here as soon as he can, although he has already given advice. It will probably be late June before he can do so. He can give us advice on how the system operates in Norway and consult with the people here. That is the intention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned the children Bill, and I will try to resolve this matter once and for all. Work on amending and expanding the children Bill, which deals primarily with juvenile justice, is complete. A large part of it has been forwarded to the parliamentary draftsman for drafting. There has been an enormous amount of change, as I said here a number of times. It is well nigh impossible to process the Bill to Committee Stage in its present form. I will ask the draftsman if he can proceed on the basis of a new Bill and if he will complete it as soon as possible. The relevant Minister will ask the Government to publish the new Bill. I have looked at this matter in the past week or so and it is a far better way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went to New Zealand last year because the relevant groups here had said we should look at the juvenile system there which has the reputation of being the best, most innovative and successful. He is particularly interested in their system of holding family-group conferences both for children who have committed an offence and children who may be in need of care and protection. It has generally been accepted by those who I have met in the preparation of the committee's work that the New Zealand system cannot be transported to other countries, but that it is considered worth undertaking an examination of our system in light of its experience and to identify the extent to which the ideas which underpin its system can be adopted here. That is under way at present and will be incorporated in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent asked about the mental health Bill. It is intended that it will be before the House in this session. The Government accepts the principle of Deputy O'Sullivan's and her party's Bill, although we also have a Bill. We can work through it to ensure we reach a successful outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take a long time for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publish the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the House that this issue will be the subject of statements tomorrow. It would not be appropriate to have a debate on the matter at this stage. I have allowed some latitude on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that my Bill be taken rather than wait for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publish its Bill because it has about 30 Bills with which to deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan. When the Government was in Opposition, it occasionally proposed Private Members' Bills which the then Government accepted. It is a fairly net point as regards the statute of limitations, and the point we are pressing is that if the Government accepts Second Stage of the Bill, it can amend it as it chooses. It will enable citizens to commence their own cases of litigation against people who abused them and against whom they can initiate a civil case. They cannot do so at the moment because no legislation has been introduced. If the Government gave an indication that it would take Second Stage in Government time, the Bill could go to Committee Stage when amendments, if required, could be made. It is not very substantial legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I got my signals wrong, that is the intention. The Bill will be taken as it has been accepted in principle. We have prepared amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a related matter &ndash; I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle for giving us some latitude &ndash; many of the victims of abuse ended up in our prisons and are currently there. Will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that the commission, in its investigations, will give ample opportunity to people currently in prison to tell their story and to have a free hand to have their pain ventilated in a complete and open way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is yes. We discussed that matter yesterday and it had been raised with us previously. It is an important matter which should be part of the commission's work.</P>

        <b>:</b> On promised legislation, the Taoiseach did not respond to my questions on legislation necessary to give powers to the commission beginning in September and on the publication of the full Madonna House report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Attorney General is considering the matters raised in connection with the Madonna House report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not make the mistake of assuming neglect is a thing of the dim and distant past. If we look at the record in recent years, <Col N="850" /> it is not particularly good. It is important we remind ourselves that Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child seven years ago, but we have yet to provide for it in our Constitution. On promised legislation &ndash; this was an omission from yesterday's statement &ndash; does the Government plan to bring forward a proposal for a constitutional referendum to incorporate the UN convention in our Constitution and to amend Article 41?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional matters are being looked at by a committee of the House but, if necessary, that will be done. The other issue is mandatory reporting and I agree with Deputy Shortall that we must be vigilant now and in the future. We are conscious of the need to ensure abuse cannot occur today as we are talking not only of the dim and distant past. We have approved a number of measures to deal with issues. Proposals on mandatory reporting of instances of sexual abuse of children will be published by the Department of Health and Children in a White Paper as soon as possible and will be acted on without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to and welcome the announcements made yesterday by the Government which are overdue. Arising from the announcement victims of abuse will be preparing their cases in terms of appearance before a commission. Can the Taoiseach give an assurance regarding the integrity of the records of any letters or documents they submitted by way of complaint to Departments, including the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, and that transmission of documents from Departments to the National Archives will be respected and assured so that victims will know that anything they need in advancing their case by way of legal means or through appearance before the commission can be provided? Is there a need to amend the archives legislation in this regard?</P>
      <P>Who has responsibility when a statement is made that files are missing in relation to a matter in a Department? Is the Taoiseach not concerned that many of those who in the new atmosphere will want to vindicate themselves and give an account of their experience may have no record other than that which they sent to a Department? Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that he will immediately issue such instructions as are necessary to ensure the integrity&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is required in order to ensure the proposed amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution can proceed if the deadline is not met by the prescribed date, something which seems likely. To avoid a rush at the last minute, will the Taoiseach undertake to consult formally with the Opposition parties and publish in advance the proposed legislation so our good intentions in this respect can be clearly signalled to the parties in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Given the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday, I think the question of compensation is likely to feature more and more in relation to many of the cases. Is it not time to bring forward the State claims legislation and attach more priority to it than is currently the case to ensure these cases are dealt with more effectively and comprehensively than the deafness compensation cases relating to the Defence Forces? Surely this legislation is critical if the State is to begin to manage these cases in a more effective way.</P>

      <P>The Government is proposing that the amendment to the Constitution should appear in the Constitution as a new Article 28A. I stated in my Second Stage speech yesterday that this is the first time an article will appear in the Constitution enumerated as an &ldquo;A&rdquo;. It is untidy and suggests it was an afterthought, but there is a way to avoid it. Article 32 relates to the exercise and performance of functions by the President and could be renumbered as a section of Article 31 which deals in detail with the functions of the Council of State. Article 32 also relates to the functions of the Council of State. The proposed new Article could then appear as a distinct Article 32 in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to renumber the proposed Article 28A set out in the Schedule to the Bill as Article 32. Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are related to this amendment. There is no reason for the renumbering beyond some historical connotations which some may attach to Article 2A of the Saorstát Éireann Constitution under which special military tribunals were established.</P>
      <P>The use of this formulation of the letter A to denote a new section inserted by later legislation has been standard drafting practice for decades across almost all legislative codes. It has been used at European level in different amendments of the treaties establishing the European Union. I am advised this approach to numbering in the Bill is satisfactory. Future amendments inserting new concepts in the Constitution, such as a constitutional provision for the Ombudsman as recommended by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, would be likely to generate more A-denoted Articles as there is no obvious Article in existence to which they can be attached.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's solution in the case of local government is to combine the text of Articles 31 and 32 and to then assign Article 32 to local government. Were we to follow this course, more Articles would be merged to free up numbers to cater for new insertions in the Constitution. This is not satisfactory and it is better to follow accepted drafting practice. I accept there are some difficulties in adopting a Constitution which is 60 years old to cater for concepts which have developed in recent years. Perhaps the solution lies in a new Constitution where, in the overall framework, the various matters can be dealt with in a more logical sequence and with a proper numbering system. However, for the present, the numbering of the new Article as Article 28A follows established drafting practice. This formulation may well be needed again. It has been used by all Governments in amending various Bills and at European level. In the circumstances, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>During the Second Stage debate yesterday I stated that the wording of the proposed amendment is weak and could undermine rather than enhance the principle of local democracy and government. The Government proposes the State will recognise in the Constitution:</P>
      <P>. . . the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities, in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiatives the interests of such communities.</P>
      <P>As I stated yesterday, it is a curious way of expressing recognition for local government because it is an organ of the State and part of its governance. It seems nonsensical that the State recognises this in the manner stated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought it preferable to recognise in the Constitution the principle of local democracy and to make it clear that the system of local government has the main role in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. I draw the distinction between local government providing the main role and it providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities because, in the Government's proposed wording, local government is only recognised as providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. A number of parallel systems have developed in recent years, such as the partnership system and various types of partnership bodies developed at local level, which arguably parallel the work of local government to some extent. There is a <Col N="856" /> strong argument for bringing all that under the umbrella of local government.</P>
    <P>To express the recognition of local government in the Constitution as providing a forum suggests that there may be fora other than the system of local government for the democratic representation of local communities. If it were to state, for example, that local government was the forum for the democratic representation of local communities, then it would afford to the system of local government a formal status, but the wording is loose and does not give to local government the type of recognition it should have. I propose in the amendment that the Constitution should recognise the principle of local democracy and the role of local government should be clearly expressed as providing the main role in the democratic representation of local communities.</P>
    <P>The other two amendments being discussed with this amendment and which relate to it concern the inclusion of regional government in the Constitution. There is no constitutional recognition of any type of regional authority. We know from discussions we have had that the Government is supposed to be committed to the concept of regionalisation and that regional authorities and the development of regional bodies will be increasingly important. What passes for regional authorities and regionalisation at present is a joke. There are different regional authorities for different functions, such as regional health boards, regional tourism boards and regional fishery boards. FÁS and IDA Ireland also have regional boards. On top of that are regional authorities to which local authorities contribute and the Government now proposes to add another layer in the form of group regions. This is how they were described in the Government's press statement when it announced the initial formula which included counties Kerry and Clare in the western region. That was subsequently revised at the behest of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>If we are to go to the trouble of giving local government formal recognition in the Constitution, we should do it in a way which is meaningful and not in the watered down, half-hearted, meaningless way which is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 5. The text proposed by the Deputy is far clearer in its scope and intent than the Government's text. It is important, as Deputy Gilmore stated, that we should emphasise that there is a principle involved here, that is, the principle of local democracy. Although I am not sure that the principle of local democracy is a term of arts which is found in any of the academic texts, nevertheless it has a clear meaning in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useful also to assign the main role in certain areas to local government, as Deputy Gilmore stated. In fact, although one recognises the value of partnership and other structures which have developed, my fear is that what has developed in recent years is not so much a set of parallel functions between local government and <Col N="857" /> other bodies but the replacement of some of the functions of local government by other more <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, which is what has led me to table an amendment to which we will come later. From that point of view, I support amendment No. 5.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 6, unless I am mistaken in reading the text, I would have preferred it had Deputy Gilmore located his reference to &ldquo;regional&rdquo; in another point because, as I understand it, he proposes that the text should state that the State recognises the principle of local democracy and, therefore, local government shall have the main role in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local and regional communities. The present form of local government does not recognise regional communities and I am not sure there is a way in which regional communities may be recognised. The Government stated that it believes legislation is not required to set up the regional structures which will be needed following decisions of the European Union. That is a mistake. I am sad to see that is happening, but that is a matter which need not be dealt with within the ambit of the Bill. Without reservation, I support amendment No. 5. I am not sure that I see in quite the same way the urgency of amendment No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were considered but it has been decided not to accept them. With regard to amendment No. 5, it was felt that reference to local government having the main role in providing a forum for democratic representation could be open to interpretation perhaps at odds with the intention of the amendment. For instance, the use of the word &ldquo;main&rdquo; implies that some other system-structure also has a role in providing such a local forum for democratic representation and this constitutional implication could perhaps be a recipe for possible tensions or conflicts. Also non-elected groups might legitimately argue that they also have a role in providing such a forum and that this is implied by the constitutional provision, albeit by default. The reference to the principle of local democracy could also be problematic as to its actual meaning.</P>
      <P>Article 28A is aimed at recognising the principle of local government. It specifically refers to a democratic forum, directly elected local authorities exercising a range of functions promoting the local community by their initiatives with elections held at least every five years. The suffrage for local elections reflects the role and ambit of local government and Deputy Gilmore's amendment does not add to the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 8 relate to the insertion of the word &ldquo;regional&rdquo; in relation to communities and the exercise of functions. However, this constitutional provision clearly relates to local authorities, the members of which will be elected on 11 June by direct vote of the people. Regional authorities are not so elected. Regional authorities are in a different position to local <Col N="858" /> authorities. The current regional authorities have been in existence for about five years whereas local authorities have existed for 100 years. Regional authorities, unlike local authorities, were not established by primary legislation but by an order of the Minister under the Local Government Act, 1991. Their members are appointed not by direct vote of the people but by the members of the constituent county and city councils from among themselves. Also the reference to regional in the Article could perhaps have unforeseen implications for other non-directly elected regional bodies, that is health, tourism and fisheries bodies. The question of constitutional recognition for regional authorities would not, therefore, be appropriate at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is at the heart of the criticism of the wording of the Bill. The Constitution should deal with the regional issue. I take Deputy Dukes's point about the manner in which I propose to do it in my amendment, but it is something which needs to be dealt with in the Constitution. As we proceed, particularly in the context of the way in which the EU clearly requires regional policy, regional structures and regional systems of consultation with the public and the economic partners, the Constitution will need to set down some principles and guidelines which underpin the way in which regionalisation is developed. It may well be something to which we must return again. For that reason, I do not propose to press that issue today other than to state that we need to deal with it.</P>
      <P>However, I intend to press amendment No. 5 because the argument the Minister made against it in a way is an argument for it. First, he questions my inclusion of the term &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo;. The Constitution refers to a number of similar terms. The Constitution, for example, recognises the principles of social justice, the family and freedom of conscience. The Constitution contains terms about the concepts of freedom and democracy and the concept of local democracy fits into that framework. In the society in which we live it is certainly as clear and unambiguous a term as, for example, the family, which arguably has a different and more wider meaning now than it did in 1937 when the Constitution was framed. The principle of local democracy should be enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's argument against the reference to local government having the main role, in which he stated that this would create an ambiguity and would suggest that there are other bodies or system which have a role in providing democratic representation of people at a local level, is the very point I make in the amendment. The wording proposed by the Government clearly suggests that. If one recognises the role of local government as providing a forum for democratic representation, one is clearly indicating that there are other such forums at local level. That will create confusion. Embryonic systems such as the strategic policy committees are expected to <Col N="859" /> grow and develop and their membership will be wider than the elected members of local authorities. If they develop to a point where they begin to assert that they are providing a forum in a particular area of activity, a constitutional ambiguity will arise.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the Committee on the Environment and Local Government, a delegation from the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland made a very good submission. They seemed to be moving towards the idea that some kind of local authority finance committees would be set up which would have a role in determining local authorities' annual estimates, setting of rates and so on and on which chambers of commerce would be represented.</P>
    <P>Unless the Constitution makes it clear that it is the elected members of local government who have the main role, the possibility will be created that, at some stage in the future, a parallel or subsidiary body under the local government umbrella may claim it is also a forum of equal status. The Constitution will not distinguish as to which body has the main role in providing the forum for democratic representation at local level. It is important that such a distinction be made; it should be specified that at local level it is the democratically elected local council which has the main role in providing a forum for representation. I am disappointed that the Minister has not been more flexible on this but given the limited time available for the debate, it is probably understandable that we are getting a series of &ldquo;nos&rdquo; from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's comments. I cannot see a basis for the Minister's hesitation. We are about to embark on city council, county council, urban district council and town commission elections throughout the country in multi-seat, transferable vote constituencies. We have an entire body of legislation, procedure and practice designed to translate electors' votes into a preference dictated result giving us elected members of local authorities. If that is not an expression of the principle of local democracy, I do not know what is. This amendment merely seeks to recognise that explicitly in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I also support Deputy Gilmore's use of the term &ldquo;the main role&rdquo;. It must be made clear that a system based on the principle of local democracy has primacy in democratic representation at local level. It is equally important to emphasise that at local as well as national level. I do not believe the Minister's hesitations are in any way founded on a real fear. The proposed amendment sets out clearly and explicitly to give local government a role which is beyond dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government wrote to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on 14 October 1998 enclosing a draft text to the <Col N="860" /> effect that, for the purposes of local government, there shall be county councils, city councils and such other bodies as may be provided by law. I accept that the committee's considerations are not binding on the various parties represented in this House in any sense. That is clear from the committee's terms of reference and I am not making a political point to the spokespersons of the other parties.</P>
      <P>The text was examined by the committee at a meeting at which the various political interests in this House were represented. The committee expressed concern about the wisdom of too much detail in the specification of local authorities. In its letter of 26 January 1999 to the Minister, the committee stated it was clear from the number of official studies carried out on local government that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the existing structures, their financing, their relationship with central Government and their relationship with the community. Further, the committee stated that from such unstable conditions, new units might come into being. In regard to the original text submitted by the Minister, Members were of the view that a structure based primarily on county and city councils should not be carved in constitutional stone. As a result of that suggestion made by the committee on an all-party basis, the Minister amended the text to provide for a broader recognition of the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the anxiety to include a reference to county and city councils in the original text related to the fact that the nomination procedures for the Office of President rest with those authorities. The draftsperson understandably thought it might be desirable to ensure consistency in the constitutional text between the various references to local authorities. The committee correctly expressed the view that this is a time of change in local government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore, in amendment No. 6, refers to the regional aspect of this issue. In my view, the current wording is sufficiently broad to include regional structures. In the context of our Constitution, regional structures are essentially local ones. No strict distinction exists. As it stands, local government encompasses town commissions, urban district councils, boroughs, county boroughs and county councils. There is no reason one cannot add to the list of that type of local structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the reasoning behind the Minister's wording of the text before the House. He has decided on a broad recognition of the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. That is the core value the Minister proposes to insert into the Constitution. Amendment No. 5 seeks to amend the wording by referring to the &ldquo;principle of local democracy and therefore local government shall have the main role&rdquo;. The reference to the principle of local democracy does not differ greatly from recognising the role of local <Col N="861" /> government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. In one sense, we could argue that the proposed wording of the constitutional amendment is simply a more extensive way of encapsulating the principle of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Without being disrespectful to Deputy Gilmore, there is an element of ambiguity in the phrase &ldquo;local government shall have the main role&rdquo;. The main role in relation to whom or what? Is it the main role in relation to central Government or in relation to other authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and admire the work which the committee is doing on the Constitution and I value the Deputy's contribution today. The House must decide, however, the wording which is to be put to the people. We must address that today.</P>
      <P>There are already a number of ambiguities in the wording. What is local government? We have a system in which the powers and functions of local government are divided between those exercised on an executive basis by city and county managers and, by delegation from them, by their officials, and reserved functions which are exercised by elected members. The recognition of the &ldquo;role of local government&rdquo; is an ambiguous term because it is not clear which role is recognised. For example, there was a row in my county council concerning who had the power to sign the motorway order for the south-eastern motorway. Was it the county manager exercising an executive function or the elected members of the council who would grant authority for that? The manager and the council took different views. The council ultimately took a vote which coincided with the manager's view. I could envisage a situation developing from a row of that nature where an issue might have to be tested in court as to whether the elected authority or the manager was the authority in that case.</P>
      <P>Does the constitutional amendment help the situation? I do not believe it does. Local government is being recognised as providing a forum. All kinds of fora exist at local level. Within the formal structures partnership bodies, county enterprise boards, area task forces and strategic policy committees have developed. All these will say they are providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. What happens when they come into conflict? Does the Constitution make it clear which has the principal role? It does not and the Constitution should make it clear that within the overall umbrella of local government structures, which are not confined to the elected councils, the body elected by the people has the principal role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An informal system of fora is developing at local and community level for democratic representation. There is a concept of the community. Bodies are now emerging which say that they represent the community. It is an undefined concept and the contribution which those bodies make is extremely positive and is part now of the democratic fabric of our society. The potential for conflict, however, between the fora which are <Col N="863" /> developing for democratic representation at community level and the formal structure of local government is enormous.</P>
    <P>The Constitution should make clear which is tje principal body at local level, which body determines what should happen because this has practical ramifications. There are areas where this is becoming an issue &ndash; housing policy, estate management and housing allocation &ndash; and local communities, through estate management committees and community bodies, are insisting that they be involved. In some cases it is a veto on the allocation of dwellings in places of anti-social activity.</P>
    <P>There are areas where fora other than the democratically elected councils are now asserting that they are the fora for democratic local representation. In the two years since they came into being, tension has developed between area partnership boards and the formal system of local government. The Constitution should demarcate that the body which is democratically elected is the principal forum which has the main role. Other fora have a role to play but, when issues have to be decided, the democratically elected body should make the decision.</P>
    <P>This is a key issue in this amendment. An amendment to the Constitution which gives a watery recognition to local government is of little value. The text as presented ties up ambiguities which may end up before the courts. Decisions based on this wording could stand local government as we understand and want to develop it on its head.</P>

      <P>Democratic representation can be interpreted as relating to direct elections. This is the meaning we intend. The points raised, therefore, about the bodies which are not directly elected are valid but this constitutional amend<Col N="864" /> ment was always intended to relate to directly elected local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the work being done by local development bodies but that is a separate issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment is loose in its wording. What is the &ldquo;principle of local democracy&rdquo;? What is &ldquo;the main role&rdquo;? These are a recipe for future difficulties and I am advised that the present wording is satisfactory. Deputy Dukes indicated that it might be difficult to find a legal definition of these terms.</P>
      <P>Local government is separate from central government. It is not a sub-unit of Government but operates independently within its own remit. It is the only institution apart from central government with its own revenue raising powers by way of rates and charges. It is the only public institution to which members are elected by direct vote of the people; it draws legitimacy from its local community  It is appropriate, therefore, that local government is recognised in the Constitution. I am advised that the wording in section 1 reflects essential features of local government, democratic representation, the carrying out of a range of functions conferred by law on its own initiative and promoting the interests of local communities. The wording of this section, therefore, is sound. It is appropriate, too, that the State recognises the role of local government as set out in section 1. The all-party committee on which Deputy Gilmore's party was represented recommended a simple formulation for local government recognition and we are following that approach.</P>

      <P>and</P>
      <P>In Part II, page 6, line 23, after &ldquo;law&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on the elected members&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in keeping with the spirit of the last amendment debated. It seeks to amend paragraph 1 of Article 28A and amendment No. 10 seeks to insert a similar amendment in section 2. The purpose of these amendments is to unambiguously assert the primacy of local government elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to make it clear that the powers and functions conferred by law are those conferred on elected members of local authorities who are, in effect, the local authority. Elected members are those voted for by the electorate and entrusted with the duty of making rep<Col N="867" /> resentative democracy work for the people. If we amend our Constitution accordingly, we will be stating that the power conferred is a power which is proper to elected members of local authorities. Arrangements are made in law and elected members may subsequently make arrangements for the execution of those powers to be carried out by other people. However, such a move would always have to be based on the principle that the power of local authorities derives, in the first instance, from the elected members.</P>
    <P>The Constitution makes it clear that power derives from the people &ndash; it is an expression of the will of the people. In a system of representative democracy the people elect representatives to exercise that power on their behalf according to their likes. If the people do not like the way in which the power is being exercised they can change the people to whom they entrust this task. If they approve of the way in which it is being exercised they can re-elect those people. However, the power derives from the people and, by the exercise of representative democracy, it is handed over to those elected.</P>
    <P>I want it made clear in the amendment to the Constitution that the powers of local authorities come from the people to the elected members through the process of election. After that, acting in accordance with their mandate, the elected members can confer, delegate or entrust part of those powers to the executive servants of the local authority on conditions laid down by law.</P>
    <P>It is important to state this point because, although it may not formally be the case, the presumption in the running of local authorities is that, apart from exceptional circumstances, power is exercised by the Executive. One finds this even in the manner in which we describe these powers. We talked in this context, and in a different context yesterday at the committee, of reserved functions. Most of us heard about reserved sins when we were growing up, and they were very serious. Reserved functions are, in a sense, kept away from the main stream of things. They are exceptional. Reserved functions should not be in any way exceptional in a system of representative democracy. It is certainly the presumption among the general public that power in local authorities resides with the officials in local authorities, that in increasingly important matters such as planning the real power lies in the hands of the planning staff. It has become part of the folklore of a part of our media that if elected members of local authorities exercise powers in relation to planning which are properly theirs, but which are only exceptionally exercised, there is at least the possibility that something funny is going on. One has only to mention section 4 or material contravention and people start thinking of corruption. The exercise of those powers by members of local authorities has been so increasingly corralled into a small number of areas that it has become a kind of nine day wonder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> I have made cases here and elsewhere for a new way of looking at local authorities, and I am glad that I have got support from the Labour Party and have even got an increasingly kind ear from the Minister and his colleagues for many of the principles I have enunciated and for many of the wishes I have expressed. In speaking about these issues in various places, I have got substantial support from members of local authorities who represent all the parties in the House. That is a very healthy trend, and I hope, as we proceed with various important Bills later this year &ndash; a planning Bill and a local government Bill &ndash; we will again and again assert the primacy of the elected members and their right to have the principal and determining say in the policies of the authorities of which they are the elected members.</P>
    <P>The amendment I put down sets out to state that explicitly in the constitutional provision that recognises local authorities, because that is the first place to say it. In our Constitution power comes from the people to their elected representatives. I want to have that derivation of power made very clear in the section of our Constitution which we now propose to formally recognise the role of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Dukes in this amendment which is very necessary, particularly given the decision of the House on the earlier amendment which I proposed. If one looks at the text of what is proposed in this constitutional amendment, there are two separate terms used. There is the term &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;local government&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; is used in sections 2 and 3, where it refers to the directly elected local authorities and the election of members of local authorities. It is clear from the text of sections 2 and 3 that &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; means the elected members, the councils as we know them. The term &ldquo;local government&rdquo;, however, is the term used in section 1, and it is local government which is being given formal State recognition in the Constitution. The term &ldquo;local government&rdquo; is clearly intended in section 1 to be wider than &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; which is referred to separately in sections 2 and 3. The term &ldquo;local government&rdquo; which is getting State recognition is not just the elected members of the local authorities but the system of local government which clearly includes the management, administrative and technical system of local government.</P>
      <P>We need to reflect on what exactly we are giving recognition to here. Deputy Dukes's amendment would make it clear that the State is giving recognition to the elected tier of local government. Without Deputy Dukes's amendment, the Constitution will give constitutional recognition not only to the elected tier of local government but also to the managerial and administrative tier of local government, and that tier of local government has not always acted in a people friendly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts have been full of cases at different times taken by people against their local auth<Col N="869" /> orities who felt the local authorities acted in an oppressive manner. I will give a couple of examples where this might arise. Individual planning decisions are, for the most part, made by county managers, by the administrative system, the professional planners up through to the county manager who signs off on a planning decision. Many planning decisions are highly controversial and end up being tested in the courts. Compulsory purchase of land is initiated by the managerial side of the local authority, and there have been quite a number of cases where landowners have challenged local authorities for seeking compulsory purchase of their lands.</P>
    <P>The construction of roads and motorways where, for example, the council management, engineers and so on make decisions about land take, the line of a road, where it goes and so on can give rise to huge controversy which often ends up in the courts. Whatever we may think of the guys in the trees in the Glen of the Downs, that is probably the most recent case to end up in the courts, but it is not the only one. There have been many others. There was a case in Cork recently where the council proposed to grant planning permission for the construction of pylons across Cork Harbour and the elected council reversed the decision. That was a controversial decision. The management of Dublin Corporation sought to construct the new city offices at Wood Quay and there was huge controversy over the decision which, incidentally, was led by one of the country's most distinguished constitutional lawyers, the former President Robinson.</P>
    <P>Up and down the country community groups are campaigning against the location of super-dumps. Some of those cases will end up in court, but what will happen when they get there? We will now have a constitutional provision which underpins and gives constitutional recognition and constitutional strength not just to the elected part of local government but to local government in its totality, including the management system.</P>
    <P>Unwittingly, without Deputy Dukes's amendment, this constitutional amendment as it is worded will confer a constitutional authority on city and county managers and on their apparatus which I do not think is intended by the Government. I do not believe that is the intention of the Oireachtas or the people if they vote for it, but that is what it will do because a distinction is drawn in the text of the amendment between local government and local authorities which means &ndash; and the text is clear in this context &ndash; the elected members. Deputy Dukes's amendment will be essential if there is to be clarity in the Constitution and if we are to avoid a situation where the Constitution will be used to give added strength to the apparatus of local government using its might against the wishes of either individual citizens or of local communities in the case of controversial developments and cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes's amendment is crucial to the debate. It is essential that it be <Col N="870" /> given every consideration and I hope it will be accepted by the Minister of State. Over the years the rights of elected members have been slowly eroded due to a lack of proper protection. The only benefit open to elected members now is to avoid opposing management at many levels because of the fear of upsetting them and forgoing favours they may be able to curry from management or other council officials. Members are paralysed into accepting everything that is proposed by management because the members' own powers have been so seriously eroded.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy Dukes and Deputy Gilmore have spoken about the planning aspects which constitute a major part of any local authority. If there is abuse and if planning irregularities are occurring, most councillors will not take on the management or planners over such issues at either public or private meetings because they are afraid that representations they may make later on might be affected or ignored. This is misguided.</P>
      <P>I was listening to the debate on the radio this morning concerning the abuse of children in institutions. It is now becoming clearer that people in those institutions who were aware that abuse or some wrongdoing might be happening, are as guilty as those who committed wrongdoing. To take that argument to its logical conclusion, councillors or public representatives who are aware of or believe that abuse might be taking place, yet who do not make the effort, as their duty demands them, to expose, highlight or take on that abuse, are as guilty of the abuse as the person who is allegedly committing it. If, for example, somebody in a council's executive planning section or at managerial level on the council is aware of abuse taking place and does not take on the responsibility of challenging it because the public representatives are beaten into silence, then they are as guilty as the person carrying out the abuse.</P>
      <P>Let us not sweep the matter under the carpet and say abuse does not take place at that level. Recent tribunals have exposed such abuse in one glaring incident which I will not elaborate upon now. Allegations are often brought to the notice of elected representatives. If we cannot protect elected representatives in this legislation, our discussions are not rendering them any service. That is why Deputy Dukes's amendment is so important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with planning and the attitude of managers towards public representatives. I would like the Minister of State to deal with this mater in his reply. In some councils, councillors have a constitutional right to put down section 4 applications and direct a county or city manager to do something. The section 4 measure is generally used in planning. However, there are inconsistencies between counties, including my own, whereby the manager might refuse to implement section 4 applications. In other counties, however, the section 4 procedure is accepted. I would like clarification on that point. Why should a different law apply in one local authority compared to <Col N="871" /> another? In some local authorities elected members have the right of prior notice of matters relating to council decisions, including planning matters. Yet, in other local authorities, members do not have that right. What is the position under the Local Government Managerial Act as to the rights of councillors?</P>
    <P>The Department, the Minister and everyone else dealing with this reform, are only fooling themselves if they do not face up to the responsibility of giving more powers to elected members. I will soon leave a local authority having served 25 years on it and I will not take any redundancy package because I consider it was my duty to serve the people. I will contest an election for a borough council of which I am currently a member. I am the only councillor in the country who has been a member both of a county council and a borough council for the past 14 years. I am, therefore, speaking with the widest experience of local government. In my experience as an elected member of both types of local authority, the more the powers of elected members are eroded the more such members will curry favour with management. Members will simply become a rubber stamp to approve whatever is put before them. Elected members will be frozen into the belief that if they do not go along with the city or county manager they will lose the remaining powers they imagine they have, or that the public believes elected local authority members have. In such a situation, managerial control of local authorities will slip away from the people and will be wielded totally by council management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much sympathy with what all speakers have said so far on the amendment moved by Deputy Dukes. I am not convinced however that the amendment would introduce clarity into the area. We have to distinguish a debate on the merits of the management system, which has been an established feature of the administrative scene in local government since the 1920s, and the question of what provision one puts into the Constitution about it. By inserting the phrase &ldquo;on the elected members&rdquo;, Article 28A.1 would read</P>
      <P>The State recognises the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities, in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law on the elected members. . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plainly, that would mean the city and county management system which has been an established feature of local government since the 1920s, would not be included under the Constitution. The risk would be created of more constitutional litigation and adjudication on that issue. The text before the House permits our local government system to be developed either along existing lines with a city and county management system, or on any other lines the Oireachtas may <Col N="872" /> wish. I have grave reservations about the city and county management system as it has operated. It has led to a devaluation of the very idea of democracy in local communities because councillors are not accountable for many of the most important decisions which councils must arrive at. That has created disillusionment with politics and politicians in local communities. Whether that should be addressed through the direct election of a chief executive, or some other form of local government is a question that should be addressed by this House. However, in the context of a constitutional amendment it is important to leave the framework broad enough to allow the House to devise appropriate structures in local government.</P>
    <P>The predecessor of Deputy Dukes's party took the first initiatives in the city and county management scheme. That was built upon by my own party in the 1930s and 1940s. It was done because there was a perception under the original 1898 Act that there was a great deal of corruption associated with the elected members in local government. We have now had a trial period of the alternative management system, which has gone on for a very long time. We can see the difficulties that system has created and it is time to review it. However, I am not convinced that putting that particular phrase into the Constitution would assist that. It might only lead to difficult constitutional litigation about the city and county management system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 7 would be to amend section 1 of Article 28A to recognise the role of local government in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law on the elected members. Amendment No. 10 would make a similar change to section 2 of Article 28.</P>
      <P>All local authority functions are exercised on behalf of the local authority, which is the corporate entity. The important policy functions &ndash; determination of estimates, land use development plans, water quality plans, schemes of letting priorities, etc. &ndash; are exercisable by the elected council. Day to day functions are vested in the executive with a range of powers available to members to oversee the executive for intervention in specified circumstances and to adopt policy as required. That has been the theory on which our current system is based.</P>
      <P>Functions are performable by both the policy arm and the executive arm of the local authority, in much the same way as by the board of directors and by the chief executive of a company. All functions, however, are functions of the local authority. Amendment No. 7 would have the effect that not only the policy arm of local government is encompassed in the Constitution when it is the totality of all local government operations which affect the citizens, whether exercised by the policy arm or the executive arm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the theory on which our system is based, that of policy and executive, it is proper <Col N="873" /> and widely accepted that some functions are not vested in the policy arm, such as the allocation of individual benefits such as staff appointments and house allocations. However, this system has developed in a specific way where, by virtue of the fact that elected members have been part time, poorly resourced and supported, they are at a distinct disadvantage in exercising their policy role as compared with a full time executive.</P>
    <P>By default, therefore, their role has often fallen to the executive. It is fair to say that overall balance within the system has tended to tilt towards the executive. The reform programme now under way aims to redress this balance in a variety of ways &ndash; better support and backup for members via the SPC system, supported by directors of service, as well as improved information training for members. An appropriate programme is currently being drawn up by the representative working group. For the first time a proper induction programme will be available to all new members this year. Ongoing training information measures will also be put in place. The local government Bill currently being prepared will provide a key role for the corporate policy group in the work of the local authority and extend the term of office of the Cathaoirleach as well as allowing for the introduction of direct election at a future date. A new statutory framework will enable the elected council to oversee the executive.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that, taken together, these and other measures have the potential to redress the democratic deficit which has emerged in the system. Practical measures, such as those I have outlined, will tilt the balance and I remain unconvinced that the Deputy's amendment would effect any worthwhile change. On the contrary, it could have the effect of limiting the extent to which the role of the local government system as a whole, comprising functions exercised by local members and by staff, is reflected in the Constitution. While I agree with the Deputy's apparent aim to increase the significance of the role of the members, the Minister is taking practical action to that end. The Constitution, however, should recognise local government in all its operations as it affects the people. Lest there is any doubt as to the acknowledgment of the elected members in Article 28A, I draw specific attention to the wording in section 1 which refers to a forum for the democratic representation of local communities, section 2 which refers to directly elected local authorities and section 3 which provides for elections for members. Sections 4 and 5 are to be dealt with by later amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is similar to amendment No. 7 and would also seem to bring with it the implication that all functions are exercised and performed by the elected members, albeit in accordance with the law. It is clearly an impractical proposition that all functions could be exercised by the members and, in addition, all local authority functions, not just those of the policy arm but those of the executive, should be <Col N="874" /> required by the Constitution to be exercised and performed in accordance with the law. The amendment would leave the executive off the hook and this would again raise the matter of all functions being performed on behalf of and in the name of the local authority, whether they are of a policy or executive nature.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendments as they may have the effect of limiting the constitutional provision. Real action is under way to enhance the role of the elected member and the elected nature of local government is already encompassed in Article 28A.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State made my case when he said that by default, powers have gone to the executive. He made my case again when he spoke of the action that is under way, which I hope will happen, to redress the democratic deficit. He made my case again when he spoke of the necessity to distinguish between policy and executive action.</P>
      <P>I do not propose that individual staff appointments would be made by the elected members of local authorities. However, I point out that the functions we are talking about are conferred by the Constitution on the local authority. What is the local authority? It is the members elected by the people to carry out these functions. What do we do by law? Those members, and us, acting by law, set out a statutory definition of how the various powers may be exercised, bearing in mind the fact that those powers derive from the mandate given to the elected members.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has made my case by agreeing that by default powers have gone to the executive and that there is a democratic deficit. Those are the reasons for which I do not propose to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Dukes as we are at a stage where the elected members' function is being reduced to adopting the estimates every year and a new development plan every five to eight years. Members are quoted by planners when applications for amenity areas are refused by saying that the members adopted a development plan. However, when lands are zoned by members and applications are refused, there is no redress for the members. I support the amendment which seeks to give powers to elected members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>People do not realise that the only reason we are elected is to take the sting from the officials and managers at public meetings. We have no <Col N="875" /> power. It is over. Take the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday, which was welcomed by everyone this morning. Where was that announcement made? Outside this House. The media and civil servants are running this country. We, the public representatives, are supposed to be running the country, but we are running nothing. Everything is being run by officials and it is time power was returned to public representatives. It is time the people demanded the return of power to them. Faceless county managers, assistant county managers and county secretaries are running the country. The Minister must challenge the Civil Service and county managers and bring power back to the Oireachtas and local authorities. The people will insist that power be returned to their elected representatives.</P>

      <P>This is extraordinary, unique and unpalatable legislation which, having regard to the circumstances, the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, we will not oppose. The amendment is somewhat curious. Why does the Minister of State believe it is necessary? He is removing the words &ldquo;substance or thing&rdquo; and inserting the words &ldquo;human remains or other item&rdquo;. What is the difference between a thing and an item?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) refers to &ldquo;any substance or thing&rdquo;. While the amendment does not change the legal effect of the section, the parliamentary draftsman is of the opinion that greater clarity as to the purpose and intent of the section would be achieved by referring to &ldquo;any remains or other item&rdquo;. The new wording reflects the formulation used in the draft UK Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are dealing with is semantics. If one underscores the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; , the words &ldquo;substance&rdquo; or &ldquo;human remains&rdquo; have no consequence. In removing the word &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and inserting the word &ldquo;item&rdquo; is it the Minister of State's intention to have the legislation word for word with the British legislation? Is that the agreement? That may not be a bad thing but why has the parliamentary draftsman chosen to split hairs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for a dissolution of the commission which will take place as soon as it completes its necessary work. Why does the legislation not go further and provide for repeal at the end of a certain period? This is unique legislation which goes against the grain and everything democracy stands for. It provides immunity for those who have perpetrated the most atrocious and vile acts. Their failure to allow the families of the people they have murdered to locate the remains for a Christian burial is reprehensible given that great emphasis has been placed by republicans on graveside orations marking what they would describe as the death of a hero. The Bill ensures the perpetrators of these acts will not be brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> In the context of the Good Friday Agreement which, although fraught with difficulties at present, engendered great optimism among the people, North and South, consideration should be given to introducing a timeframe allowing the republican movement sufficient time to disclose the information to the victims' families. This is legislation that should not be on the Statute Book. It is not legislation any democracy could look on with pride. The Minister of State should go further, therefore, and provide for repeal, say, in 12 or 18 months time. The process should not be allowed to continue indefinitely, something which could happen under the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all hope people who have information will come forward with it as quickly as possible and that this issue may be dealt with as a matter of urgency. The legislation applies to victims up to the Good Friday Agreement only. The reason we did not do as the Deputy suggested is that we cannot put a time scale on information which will come to light. For that reason, we did not provide for a closing of the commission. It is certainly the intention that information would come forward as quickly as possible and that the matter would be dealt with as expeditiously as possible, and I totally agree with what the Deputy said about proper Christian burials. Section 11 provides for the dissolution of the commission as quickly as possible but to put a time scale on it might have been the wrong thing to do and that is the reason we have not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly desirable that the information required to allow for the discovery of people where they are temporarily interred so that they may be buried properly with their families knowing where they are located, be brought forward as quickly as possible. I accept the point the Minister of State made about putting a six month time limit on that, although I hope all the information will have come to us within that time. There may be outstanding cases &ndash; although I hope there will not &ndash; for a variety of reasons given the situation about which we are talking. It is desirable to leave it open ended and for the Minister and Minister of State to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, in that the legislation is not something of which we should be ashamed. It is a sign of the maturity of our democracy that we can look forward from the point at which we are now and deal, in a legislative sense, with the horrors of what went on. That is not confined to any particular section of the community as there were horrors on all sides. It is a sign of our maturity as a democracy that we can now legislate to put it behind us and move forward. I welcome the legislation in that regard.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation last week and today. It is good that this legislation has received all-party agreement. I also thank the officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for their work in ensuring the Bill will pass in this way. We will need continued co-operation on the various issues relating to the North. As Deputy Flanagan said, nobody takes pleasure in the enactment of such a measure but there is a recognition on all sides of the House that the legislation is needed to try to facilitate the location of the remains of victims, which will ease the anguish of their families, and to give them the right to a proper Christian burial which has long been denied to them.</P>
      <P>The House can be content that it has done everything possible to facilitate this process. I am sure all Deputies will join with me in appealing to those who have information on where remains may be located to co-operate with the commission as soon as possible after it is established and to let the commission have the relevant information so that we may complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with what the Minister of State said but it is with some reluctance, however, that we are agreeing to this legislation. In the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the approach being taken by the Opposition since the signing of that Agreement, we will co-operate with the Government in ensuring that every effort is made to bring about the realisation of the clauses in the Agreement from start to finish. I suppose if one looks at the grief suffered by the relatives of the disappeared, one must balance that against never receiving the information. It is with that reluctance that we agree with the approach being taken by the Mini<Col N="882" /> ster of State as far as the general thrust of the Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>I thank the officials in the Department for the time they made available for an all-party briefing having regard to the fact the legislation was published and introduced in the Dáil fairly quickly. I am pleased we are reaching a conclusion on the same day as the legislation is being concluded in the House of Commons so that both Governments can be seen to be presenting a common approach on this very important issue.</P>
      <P>No signal of any description should be sent from this House that this is a form of blanket amnesty, that this legislation was introduced lightly and that is something which will ever be contemplated again, because I hope it will not be. My final hope is that this legislation will have the desired result and that we will return to repeal it at an early opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening some Opposition Deputies asked me to explain the reason I was not providing for expenditure levels. I made the point that in 1997 when the Electoral Act was being processed, figures were plucked from the air as, in fairness to the then Minister, we had no experience. These figures were included in legislation in relation to general elections. While we have no experience of how they will work in a general election, there have been two by-elections and the two of the Opposition parties had difficulty in staying within the <Col N="883" /> limits set down. As Deputy Dukes said, this was not a huge fault of the parties but rather a result of the amount of work which the provision necessitates. In this context, more consideration of the provision is necessary. The proposal in the Bill covering the declaration of amounts of money spent will allow us sit down after the election on an all-party basis or through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government with the experience of an election campaign and expenditure returns for each of the local authorities. This will allow a more informed decision to be made in relation to local government and expenditure in local elections.</P>
      <P>Some Opposition Deputies said it is a simple matter and that they do not understand why we have to consider or assess such things. The previous Minister had the opportunity of including the limits when drafting the Bill, but decided not to do so for some reason. Some of the amendments suggest that in three seater constituencies there should be a limit of £3,000, etc. However, such suggestions do not take into account the complications of the procedure. For example, what would happen in the case of six, seven, nine and 12 seater constituencies? How could it be fair to agree a limit of £3,000 in a local electoral area with a population of over 60,000 as compared with a local electoral area with a population of 1,000? Such questions are not answered through the amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies and for that reason I am not accepting them.</P>
      <P>To state that there are similarities with Dáil elections is incorrect and misleading. Members of the Dáil are professional politicians who have back-up. To involve local authority candidates, particularly new candidates, in the system being suggested by the Opposition would be grossly unfair. The Bill will allow each of us to assess the level of expenditure which is reasonably normal in local electoral areas. Following that examination we can revisit the issue of limitations. However, at present it is not my intention to accept any of these amendments.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The All-Party Committee on <Col N="884" /> the Constitution has done considerable work to date on proposals for reform of the Constitution. The committee's recommendations set out in its progress reports were considered by the Government at its meeting on 14 April.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed to proceed immediately with the recommendation of constitutional recognition of local government and a referendum to this effect will be held to coincide with the local and European elections in June. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government published the Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill on 30 April 1999 which the House discussed today.</P>
      <P>I have asked Departments to report to me on proposals for constitutional amendments relating to their spheres of responsibility which arise from other recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and from the programme for Government. The committee's proposals will be given further consideration on receipt of observations from Departments.</P>

      <P>There have been three reports from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and 121 recommendations from the Constitution Review Group headed by Dr. Whitaker. Does the Taoiseach accept that one recommendation being put to the people at this stage is meagre considering all the background work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be the fourth referendum in a two year period which is a lot. There have already been referendums on Cabinet confidentiality and the British-Irish Agreement and there will now be one on this issue. I acknowledge and appreciate the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the review group. Deputy O'Keeffe is aware of the responses from Departments to the first two reports which I forwarded to the committee. In conjunction with the all-party committee, I would like to take on board all the work done and try to reach agreement on an omnibus referendum on a number of issues. It is perhaps taking too positive an attitude to assume they can all be dealt with, but a large number of them could be decided upon if agreement can be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there are a number of simple uncontentious proposals from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which could and should have been included in the proposal being put to the people on 11 June, such as the granting of constitutional recognition to the Ombudsman and reducing the age of membership of the Dáil to 18, something which had all-party support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a number of them are not contentious, but it will not make much difference if it takes time to deal with a number of them. The Deputy has seen the responses from the Departments to the effect that some of them are not only considered good ideas but also desir<Col N="885" /> able amendments. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has very positive views on a number of them. The Government's view is that a series of them should be dealt with together by agreement. I am conscious the committee has worked well and I do not wish for a situation to arise where everyone's agreement cannot be obtained, for example, where the agreement of the committee is obtained but not that of the House. There must be co-operation between the committee and the leaders in the House to take a range of recommendations and put them forward.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated in his reply he requested reports from Departments regarding commitments made in the programme for Government as well as the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Is an update on the issue of ground rents included in this request? Is it intended that constitutional proposals to abolish ground rents would be brought forward given that the Taoiseach has repeatedly indicated in the House it is not possible to abolish them without a constitutional change?</P>
      <P>Is it also proposed to introduce a constitutional referendum to give people with disabilities full constitutional rights which take priority over the rights of private property, given that equal status legislation passed by the House was ruled by the Supreme Court to be in conflict with the rights of private property?</P>

    <P>Will the Taoiseach comply with the solemn promise he made while in Opposition and during <Col N="886" /> the last general election and hold a referendum on the Partnership for Peace?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General has submitted a report on the ground rents issue but it is no secret that there would be major constitutional difficulties with it. There is not much difference between the views of the Attorney General on the issue and those of his predecessors. On the disability issue, I do not think it was in the document. I know it relates to what had been said previously. I will check and will find out the position.</P>
      <P>On the third question, the Deputy will be aware that the debate on Partnership for Peace is ongoing and I am glad to see that. It was made clear by me at the time of the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty that a referendum would arise in the context of a departure from this country's neutrality. No such departure is envisaged so participation in PfP would not be incompatible with our neutrality. Therefore, a referendum is not necessary.</P>

It does not change neutrality and the Department of Foreign Affairs will publish a document which adequately explains this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question was about that issue. Arising from the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, does the Taoiseach envisage, given that Northern Ireland is part of NATO, that there will be security arrangements which might need to be addressed and constitutional amendments which might need to be considered?</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's reply with regard to the ground rents issue, that a previous Attorney General identified serious constitutional issues with regard to abolishing ground rent, will he make the report of the Attorney General on that matter available to Deputies in the same way as the information with regard to the constitutionality or otherwise of PfP was made available to Members of the House?</P>
      <P>On the question of PfP, I remind the Taoiseach that he stated explicitly in this House, apart from in his party's general election manifesto,&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes. This is leading to a question. He stated specifically that to join PfP without a referendum would be grossly improper of the then Government.

      <P>What mechanism will exist for changing the representation on these bodies on a non-statutory basis subject to the passage of the legislation given that creating a statutory entitlement for particular organisations to representation can create difficulties because some organisations will wax and others will wane? One needs to have flexibility in the matter of the attribution of the seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised this previously. Many of the new and old organisations of the various pillars may not exist in five or ten years. Others will change their names and structures. It may not be necessary to name them in the legislation but to do that by order. It would be undesirable to build them into legislation. I accept that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the benefit of the legislation? Is it simply for the security of the staff concerned, that they will be in a statutory body which in some sense gives them greater rights, or is there something wrong with the way the NESC and the NESF work which necessitates legislation and which cannot be dealt with otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of reasons. The purpose of the legislation is to secure the independence of both the NESC and the NESF by placing them on a legal, statutory and accounting basis. At present, they operate on an informal and non-statutory basis and that has created a number of difficulties in the past. Over the years their membership, particularly that of NESC, has highlighted this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not hold staff on the basis that they were not offering permanent or contracted posts and people moved on. That created difficulties for them for a long time. In all of the agreements, the <i>Programme for National Recovery   </i> 12 years ago, PESP and the PCW, they had these staffing difficulties because the organisations were run on an informal, non-statutory, non-accounting basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that the staff will benefit. For the first time these organisations will be in a position to offer solid, legal employment contracts. Good quality economists, legal people, researchers and sociologists involved in NESC have not been satisfied with the way this has been. They will now be in a position to establish their own pension scheme. People who have worked there and stuck with it down through the years had no proper pension scheme. This case was put forward for all of those reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In what respect has the independence of NESC been threatened by not being on a statutory basis? Can the Taoiseach outline one recent example of where NESC's independence was tainted in the slightest by it not being a statutory body? Aside from making NESC a statutory body, is there any other mechanism through which the Department of Finance could offer people longer-term contracts? Surely other non-statutory bodies could make a similar claim. If these bodies are established on a statutory basis, does that mean the bulk of staff will be employed on a permanent basis? Would there not be risks associated with that, given that needs will change? While we might have needed financial experts in the 1980s when there were financial problems, we might need IT experts in the 1990s to deal with IT problems. In the next decade, we may need an entirely different set of expertise on the bodies. The idea of freezing a particular staff structure under the umbrella of legislation is not necessarily in the interests of the positive flexible development of these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have a particularly strong view on the legislative basis of these organisations. However, the view was held by all other staff and the staff of the boards that people should be given solid, legal employment contracts; it was not a question of giving people permanency. Over a period of time, the staff of these bodies took up alternatives such as more stable employment or jobs in which they were guaranteed long-term contracts. We saw that in the NESC secretariat which operated on an answer phone basis. I answered questions on that in the House last year. The entire staff was employed either on short-term contracts or on secondment from the Department and other agencies. That was entirely unsatisfactory. NESC made a strong case that the council should be established on a statutory basis, as is the position elsewhere. I do not believe permanent employment contracts should be issued, but people should receive more solid contracts. The idea of giving permanent employment would work against flexibility in the future and I am opposed to that.</P>

      <P>On the make-up of NESC, is the Taoiseach aware that when the issue of institutional abuse was debated in this House last week, I raised the continuing institutional abuse in our prison system?

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the make-up of the board. When the Taoiseach is considering the make-up of the board, he should consider <Col N="891" /> appointing people who will be able to assist us, not just in addressing prison reform, but in addressing the social inadequacies which exist in the areas in which these people live. Those inadequacies contribute to the problem. Many people go into prison without a drugs problem but come out with one. We need to address this issue in a more broadly based manner than we have to date. Will the Taoiseach consider this when reflecting on NESC membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reflect on that, but the new make-up of the council, which came into existence before Christmas, is far better. NESC now comprises five nominees from each of the social partners and four pillars, five representatives from Government Departments and five independent members. NESF comprises 15 Oireachtas members and nominees from other areas. The bodies are more representative than they were.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin and Monagahan bombings, which took place on 17 May 1974, the 25th anniversary of which is next Monday, were among the most appalling outrages in the history of this island. As a result, 33 people were killed and 240 were injured. A great many more lives, namely those of the victims' friends and relatives, were scarred forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Justice for the Forgotten Group &ndash; the Dublin and Monaghan relatives' committee &ndash; with their legal representatives on Thursday, 22 April 1999. It is clear the group, as its name implies, feels it has not been listened to and that its members' concerns have not been addressed over the years. At our meeting, members raised a number of issues with me, including the investigation that was carried out after the bombings. They indicated that new evidence had come to <Col N="892" /> light and undertook to establish a sub-committee to assemble the evidence and present the case for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I gave my commitment to form an interdepartmental group to work with the committee in an exercise broadly similar to that carried out in the Irish Government's assessment of the evidence relating to Bloody Sunday. The recommendations of the victims' commissioner, former Tánaiste, John Wilson, would also have to be taken into account as the Government had put the Dublin and Monaghan bombings into his remit. I also said a tribunal of inquiry would not be ruled out, if an argument for having one could be constructed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am advised that the Garda authorities are pursuing fresh inquiries in the case as a result of information which has been provided to them in the past few weeks. As this is an active criminal investigation, particularly in view of the receipt of this information, it will naturally be essential to ensure its effectiveness is not in any way compromised by other inquiries which may be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he complied with his promise to open the files on this matter when he took office? If the reports that he found no evidence that anyone could be pinpointed or was likely to be charged as a result of the examination of those files are true, will he indicate why Yorkshire Television, which had limited access to the files through the Garda, claims there is evidence that a number of people are at least likely to have <i>prima facie</i> evidence against them and that inquiries should have been pursued North and South? How can there be such a conflict of views? Yorkshire Television staff, who spoke to the Garda at some length on this matter and have audio tapes of their interviews, are convinced there is evidence in the files.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be helpful and constructive on this matter and have given a commitment to work with the relatives' group. Some very useful information is contained in the <i>Magill </i>article and it is clearly of some concern. However, dates, details of meetings and other references appear there of which I was unaware. I note that I held meetings on particular dates with people of whom I had never heard, but I do not want to get into that now.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have spoken to various justice Ministers about this matter. I have never examined the files personally but I was given to understand that a substantive case did not exist. Notwithstanding that, I am prepared to set up the interdepartmental group to see what evidence exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Yorkshire Television programmes seem to indicate the station had access, via the Garda, to information on this case during the term of office of the previous Government. I have spoken to the officials involved and they certainly were not <Col N="893" /> aware of that. I have not been able to establish who is right or wrong in this matter, but the officials in my Department who dealt with this matter were not aware that Yorkshire Television was communicating with the Garda. They did not receive that information at the time. That said, the victims' relatives feel very hurt, upset and, in some ways, ignored. It is not fair to say they have been ignored. I have attended many meetings throughout the years with politicians from other parties on this matter and have also attended commemoration and remembrance ceremonies. The group now has good, committed legal representatives, including Don Mullen who worked with this and the previous Government on the Bloody Sunday case. I have set up an interdepartmental group and we will work with the committee to see if we can establish a substantive case from the available information &ndash; what was said and what was on file.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach undertook to examine the files before entering Government. He now tells the House that he has not examined the files. Surely it would be proper for the Taoiseach to request the Garda files, not just the departmental files, on this case and review them so he can establish to his own satisfaction if the claims being made by Yorkshire Television are true. That would not compromise any investigation by the Garda of the evidence it may have at the moment. It would certainly reassure the victims and their relatives that the Government takes this matter seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The relatives understand that the Government takes this seriously. Another Minister and I discussed this with the Garda Commissioner early on when we entered Government. I have reasonable knowledge of what is on departmental files but I do not have any knowledge of the Garda files. There are ongoing investigations.</P>
      <P>Submissions have been made by more than one person on this matter. I will not identify those who have given information but I will not ignore that information. I cannot say if the information is factual but there are two substantive cases which are not on the records. They were made by people who, with the passage of time, feel they should speak on the issues. That has happened twice; one person spoke in the public domain. There have been substantial discussions of the statements made by that person. The other statements will be followed up.</P>
      <P>Meetings have been continuing for more than a year. I met members of the group many times over the past years. They are now in an organised group, with legal representation, which Don Mullan is co-ordinating. The interdepartmental committee will use the officials whom the previous Government used in the Bloody Sunday case to see what we can put together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the departmental and Garda views on this matter. Notwithstanding those views, we <Col N="894" /> must look at this situation. It is unacceptable from the point of view of the victims and their relatives. There are issues which must be addressed: the presentation of new evidence and following up on a cross-jurisdictional basis, as well as determining if there is sufficient evidence to proceed with an inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the event of the establishment of a tribunal, it should be a tribunal with the capacity to compel witnesses to appear in and from both jurisdictions and perhaps from further afield? Does the Taoiseach agree that for a tribunal to work, it is important that it be simultaneously established by this House and the Houses of Parliament in Westminster? Does he agree that there is a facility for doing that, in that the legislation governing tribunals is joint legislation which was passed before the State obtained independence? Both countries have the same legislation and could easily use it to establish a joint tribunal of inquiry to investigate this matter. Does the Taoiseach agree that short of doing that we are unlikely to get the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct on the legislation. The Tribunal of Enquiry Act, 1921, predated the administration. The cross-jurisdictional basis in determining sufficient evidence will have to be examined.</P>
      <P>However, it is too early for that. We must establish whether there is enough evidence to proceed. To do that we must look at what is available and, as the Garda Síochána is doing, look at the new evidence. Many questions have been raised about this issue. There may or may not be answers to those questions. The <i>Magill </i>article highlighted many of the questions and there are worrying aspects to the case. Some relate to hearsay which was previously in the public domain while some are entirely new. The issue must be examined afresh. The interdepartmental group will do that and work with the legal representatives for the relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the initiative the Taoiseach is taking and I further welcome that he is using the precedent I set in the Bloody Sunday inquiry of having a pre-inquiry of the sort mentioned.</P>
      <P>While supporting the need for an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, will he ensure that we do not take a partitionist approach to this? We must bear in mind that there were also bombings in the Six Counties. If truth and reconciliation are required for bombings which happened in this jurisdiction, there should be similar co-operation from all involved to ensure we hear the truth about those responsible for the bombings in the Six Counties, and that all those who have knowledge of who was responsible for those atrocities would be as co-operative in giving that information as they are in seeking this inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support. Mr. Wilson, the former Tánaiste, in his work for the Victims Commission, has been working with his counterpart in Northern Ireland. The families would point out that the difference is that in most of the terrible atrocities in the North, responsibility was claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the concern of the people continues to be that there has been a massive cover-up. We must take that into account. As we move towards an end to such difficulties, more and more people &ndash; victims in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and their relatives &ndash; want to get to the bottom of what happened.</P>
      <P>Hardly a week goes by without my meeting one organisation or another relating to victims, relatives and those who have served prison sentences in the North. Those organisations come from both sides of the divide and we must take all their views into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that faceless organisations &ndash; whose leaderships maintain anonymity &ndash; claiming responsibility for bombings does not contribute to reconciliation? There is not a feeling that personal responsibility or accountability for these killings is accepted by anyone in a political sense. Does the Taoiseach agree that in addition to an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, we need an approach to truth and reconciliation in general and a willingness among the individuals concerned, through some mediator, to accept personal responsibility for some of the terrible things which have been done? We can then seek reconciliation and healing in this area just as we seek reconciliation and healing in other areas of suffering. Terrorism is not in a different category to other forms of injury to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we are here talking about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the missing people and other issues.In terms of the organisations, many people have served long sentences for many of these bombings. They are not faceless in that many people, both loyalists and republicans, have been charged and sentenced on these issues, but that does not solve the problem for the victims' families. In any of the representations or discussions I have had on a South African type truth and reconciliation group or body &ndash; I raised that issue at many meetings over the past four or five years both in the North and the South &ndash; it did not gain much acceptance from many of them for one reason or another. That is why, in this case, before we go down the road of inquiries, we have to examine carefully the information that is available to determine whether we can proceed.</P>

      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the interdepartmental group will meet with the Justice for the Forgotten group? How soon does he expect that the co-operation between the interdepartmental group and the Justice for the Forgotten group will result in some proposals with regard to how matters might be dealt with? Will the Taoiseach agree it is important to bring to an end the pain and trauma suffered for 25 years by the injured and the relatives of those murdered by the bombs and that for that to happen justice must not only be done but be seen to be done? Will he agree there is a grave sense among them that the agencies of the State have not adequately pursued those who were suspected of having planted these bombs and that it is essential, therefore, that the Taoiseach would be seen to be actively engaged in this by talking to the commissioner, asking him to explain the discrepancy between the information the Taoiseach seemed to have in March 1999, that there is no basis for charging anybody, and the report by Don Mydleton of Yorkshire Television who claimed that in 1992 information given to him by the gardaí indicated that there were people who could have been charged based on the Garda files at the time? Will the Taoiseach agree there is a need for clarity and to ensure that the Taoiseach and the State agencies are not seen to be dragging their feet, no matter how active they may be behind the scenes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any information I used in any of those meetings was information I got from the Minister or from the commissioner &ndash; I have already explained that. It was not known to me at that stage, nor am I certain, but it seems that the people from Yorkshire Television sat down with the gardaí. That was not the information given to the Department at the time, when I was not in Government, but the same individuals are there. I do not want to make a point of that&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would remind him it has been around for 25 years. It is better for us to say bluntly here, rather than somebody saying it outside this House, that these families feel the political establishment of successive parties in power over those 25 years did not have the stomach to examine this issue. That is what they sincerely believe. There has been considerable speculation over the years as to who carried out the bombings and about the subsequent investigations in particular. The first time I asked questions about this matter in the House was in 1978. I would be happy to be able to bring about a resolution of <Col N="897" /> the issue to the satisfaction of everyone concerned. That may or may not be feasible. I am setting out today what we intend to do and I believe we are gaining support for it. I await with interest the recommendations of the victims commissioner on the issue. As indicated, the relatives will get every assistance from the interdepartmental group in the assessment of the evidence.</P>

      <P>I am advised it is reported that there was a direct association with some of those responsible for the Dublin and Monaghan bombings by one of the then members, and possible other members, of the Garda Síochána. That is a serious claim and one that of itself merits a full inquiry to establish the veracity of the claim or put it to bed once and for all. Is there more to the official Garda line at the time and since regarding evidence available? Having waited for 25 years, can we not now act to establish a judicial inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings so that the full truth, with all that entails, can be established?</P>

This issue has to be addressed and we are endeavouring to examine the new and existing evidence, as well as the files, and work with the interdepartmental group to see if there is sufficient evidence to proceed with an inquiry.

      <P>My Department is currently examining the books and documents of six companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Celtic Helicopters Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. I expect to receive final reports on a <Col N="898" /> number of these investigations within the next two months.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have appointed an authorised officer to a further three companies. In the cases of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited, I am awaiting the outcome of High Court judicial review proceedings of my decision. On 10 March last, I appointed Mr. Gerard Ryan to examine the books and documents of College Trustees Limited, a Guernsey-registered company, and I hope Mr. Ryan will be given the books and documents he has specified in the coming weeks. Having regard to the fact that company books and documents have yet to be made available in these cases, it is too early for me to speculate as to when this work might be completed.</P>
      <P>Five reports of companies undertaken by or on behalf of my Department have been completed, and those relating to Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, have so far been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand that in both cases the director has referred the matters to the Garda Síochána for investigation.</P>
      <P>The reports into Garuda Limited and Faxhill Homes Limited, under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, are being examined at present, and a decision will be made shortly on whether these will be referred to the DPP. My Department is also examining the report on Irish Life plc which was undertaken under the Insurance Acts.</P>
      <P>While the inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited were initiated at my request under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, they are proceeding under the auspices of the High Court. While the inspectors appointed by the court have filed a number of interim reports since their appointment, I understand it will be some time yet before they will be ready to submit their final report to the High Court.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether additional inquiries are taking place which she did not refer to in her reply on 16 February? We would not have got as much detail in the last answer. Have any new inquiries been initiated since February? When did the Minister refer the National Irish Bank financial services report to the Garda? Has she had any indication whether prosecutions will be taken? Will she agree that a number of these inquiries are now ongoing for at least a year and, despite court interventions, are taking an excessively long time? Surely the Minister can give the House more information about what is contained in these reports and whether she will take action against people she referred to as a golden circle of swindlers, as stated in a headline in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 31 December 1998. The Minister confirmed to the House that she was very concerned about the similarity of names coming up in these inquiries.</P>

      <P>The only new inquiry since I last reported to the House concerns College Trustees to which an officer was appointed on 10 March 1999. I referred the Bula report to the DPP last summer shortly after I received it. I also referred the National Irish Bank financial services report to the DPP shortly after it was submitted to me. I do not know the outcome of the director's investigations but he has referred the matter to the Garda Síochána. The director is independent in the conduct of his affairs &ndash; he does not report to me nor would it be right if he did so.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that the inquiries are taking so long but that is not due to a lack of effort on our part. We have been the subject of efforts by lawyers operating on behalf of some of the people and companies being investigated. This delayed matters and there was a recent second case in the High Court concerning the two Dunnes Stores appointments. A judgment is reserved in that matter.</P>
      <P>I wish we could have proceeded more rapidly but I am confident that I will have the final reports on many of the companies to which I referred. The reports have to be drafted in conjunction with legal advice. It could take two weeks, a month or five weeks but I will have the majority of them within the next two months.</P>

The Minister will claim that she no longer has responsibility for them. The public is entitled to know that the investigations have led to prosecutions or, at least, a change in the way in which matters have been handled over the past few years. How do we know what will happen to these reports if the Minister will not tell the House what will happen after they have left her office?</P>

I cannot be certain of what will happen in the case of reports sent to them. However, the regime which operates in the Revenue Commissioners under its chairman, Dermot Quigley, will ensure that those who have evaded their tax responsibilities will be pursued.</P>
      <P>I am also certain that the DPP will instigate proceedings if he feels that people have a case to answer. I presume he has referred the matters to the Garda with a view to compiling a case.</P>

      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group published a discussion document on the newspaper sector on 3 March 1999. I asked the group to take account of and advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry dealing with competition issues. The recommendations concern: the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers; an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares; and consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media-wide as well as a single media basis.</P>
      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group invited comments on its document by 30 April 1999. This issue forms but one part of the overall work of the review group.

Does she recall how persistent she was on this side of the House in demanding that her predecessor take action on the central issues involved? When does she anticipate receiving the final report of the review group?</P>

      <P>The review group chaired by Michael Collins SC was established by my predecessor in September 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, because of the comprehensive nature of the work and, perhaps, the pressure of time, it has not been possible to complete that work. I wish matters were different but I expect to receive the final report later this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about ownership and plurality of ownership of the media. These are issues about which I feel strongly, not just concerning single media issues but also the wider media and cross-media ownership. It is important to any democracy that there is not excessive control or ownership in the hands of one group or individual. That is why it is important that if we are going to change the law we do so after due consideration.</P>
      <P>The mergers group published its initial report and invited comments. I do not know if the Deputy made any comment but the recommendations in the initial report should form part of the law. These recommendations give wider powers to the Minister, including powers to refer matters to the Competition Authority, a power which does not exist currently.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it has taken an unconscionably long time to address this issue? Does she recall giving a reply in the House on 30 June 1998 to the effect that she expected the review group to report later that year? It is three years since the original commission was established which made certain findings regarding dominant positions or, more accurately, abuses of dominant positions in the industry. Unfortunately, it looks as if the Minister, who has strong views on this area, will be out of office before being required to introduce legislative changes.</P>

      <P>The review group was put in place by my predecessor. When the Commission on the Newspaper Industry reported, the then Minister and Government, of which Deputy Rabbitte was a member, was free to change the law but chose not to do so. The matter was then referred to this group which published an initial draft report in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>The group made recommendations and invited submissions by the end of April. I presume it has received a number of submissions and I expect to receive the final report shortly. If that report is in line with the intermediate report it should be legislated for in this House and I will be in office to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The central finding of the original report was that there was an unhealthy situation in the print media, at least, which derives from abuses of dominant positions. Does the Government support the Minister's position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No Government has done more in the area of competition across a range of sectors than this one, and the Government will continue to do so. Competition changes matters faster than anything else. It is clear that we do not have sufficient competition in this sector. That is not healthy for this democracy. We have to take seriously the recommendations of the group which comprises a range of individuals who have considered the commission's report and consulted widely.</P>
      <P>The group will make recommendations to strengthen the Minister's hand concerning matters which can be referred to the Competition Authority. For example, the Minister will not have to have formed an opinion to instigate an investigation. The requirement under existing legislation is that the Minister must have formed an opinion. It is extremely difficult to form an opinion and that is why nothing happened under previous Governments. The recommendations are worthy of consideration and should form part of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The matter has not been considered by the Government. However, I have no reason to believe that the Government does not share my views on competition.</P>

      <P>The European Single Market gives the right to any firm within the European Union to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the European Union. This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the Single Market. Once the relevant provisions of competition law and Single Market rules are adhered to, it is open to all companies to source their products anywhere within the EU.</P>
      <P>The company referred to is a private, commercial company over which my Department has no responsibility. However, in view of concerns expressed regarding the sourcing of products by the company, a meeting was arranged to discuss the matter against the background outlined above.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the company explained that it had delisted 25 suppliers, the majority of which were distributors but that the volume of goods purchased from Irish companies remained unchanged. The company stressed that it was committed to growing its business in Ireland and, with the opening of two new stores in the near future, would have 1,200 employees. The company indicated that it would work with Enterprise Ireland, in so far as is possible, to ensure Irish companies can compete for business. The company also stressed that £50 million of products are purchased by their company in the UK from Irish companies every year.</P>

Does the Tánaiste agree this kind of action by a company, despite all the rules on open and free markets, should not be tolerated here and would not be tolerated in any other EU member state?

      <P>I am giving the facts I have. Many of the suppliers who have been delisted are distributors. The Deputy is wrong in saying no other European country would allow this. We have no right to stop it. Just as Irish companies have succeeded in winning business from competitors in domestic economies abroad, other companies win business here. It is significant that the volume of business purchased in the Republic of Ireland by Boots has increased, albeit from fewer suppliers, which I accept. In the context of the Single Market, and even without it, it would be unsatisfactory if we were to discourage foreign investment in this jurisdiction on the basis that in order to invest one was compelled to use the products of Irish suppliers. That is not sustainable in a modern context, nor is it desirable. We have to continue to work, as Enterprise Ireland is seeking to do, to improve, at a competitive price, the products being supplied by Irish suppliers so that they can not only supply foreign companies that invest here but also the wider chain. Much work is under way in that regard. It has been extremely successful on the food side in the case of Tesco, and if we work across other sectors we can be equally successful. However, the Minister and the Government have no authority in this area, and it would not be desirable to seek to have it either.</P>

What we and Enterprise Ireland are seeking to do is to develop strategies with Irish companies to allow them to succeed in the new ever more competitive environment, and it is meeting with success.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I am currently engaged in a thorough consultation with the social partners in regard to the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the future of the community employment programme. I hope to conclude this process shortly. I have made no decision in regard to these recommendations. However, I fully recognise the value of community employment generally throughout the country. I am particularly conscious of its value at local level, where it assists community and statutory bodies, and I will take these factors into account in any decisions I make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parallel to the process of consultation currently ongoing, the Government in the 1999 Estimates reduced the number of community employment places by 2,500 but introduced a number of new initiatives to provide training and other supports for the unemployed and long-term <Col N="905" /> unemployed in particular. Details of these new initiatives, providing a total of 10,275 places at a cost of almost £23 million are set out in a tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report. The additional places include 1,000 additional specific skills training places for under 25s who are long-term unemployed, 800 software-electronics training places, 4,800 Job Club places, 1,500 bridging training places for long-term unemployed, 800 flexible training places for lone parents and 400 Job Club places for lone parents.</P>

      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that managers in FÁS offices throughout the country have received an edict telling them that during 1999 they are to reduce the number of community employment places by 10 per cent by the end of the year? Is she aware of the effect this decision is having on many valuable community projects, for example, in the area of preparation for tidy towns and tidy districts competitions, community endeavours and so on? The National Gallery has lost people who were working on community employment schemes. Had she anything to do with that edict? She said she is still in discussion with the social partners. Why has this edict gone out before those discussions are finalised? Can she have it withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reduced the number of places from 40,000 to 37,500, by 2,500. We have done that not just because of the recommendations of Deloitte &amp; Touche but because we want people to go into more mainstream training. I want to provide more worthwhile training places so that people can progress from training into a real job in the marketplace. Forty thousand was established as the level for community employment at a time when unemployment was at 16 per cent. Unemployment is now down to 6.5 per cent. One of the major problems is the emerging skills shortage. We have to train people for the new jobs being created. We are having discussions with the social partners. Anything that is done will be done on the basis of agreement. Any changes in community employment will be replaced by training places in full training pro<Col N="906" /> grammes. As I said in my response, there are 10,200 more people in training this year than was the case last year, and many of those training places are reserved and ring-fenced for long-term unemployed people. Long-term unemployed people want opportunities to get a job in the real labour market. I am aware of the valuable work done by community employment, and in conjunction with consideration of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, I am preparing proposals on the social economy, which I will bring to the Cabinet very shortly. I agree there is a huge role for community-based schemes in schools, with voluntary groups, in regard to the tidy towns competition and many other activities that cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, ever be commercial but which are very worthwhile and give valuable experience to unemployed people. We will keep all of that in mind as we develop our concept for the social economy. At the end of all of that, I am certain that what is happening around the country in relation to community employment will be maintained. It will be done in agreement with the social partners, and in a way that provides worthwhile opportunities for those who participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is a need, yes, if possible, subject to the budgetary figures. The figure of 37,500 is an enormous number of people in an economy that is booming and where 1,000 jobs are being created each week. We want to ensure that money that is spent on training and community employment is targeted at those who need it most so they can get the kind of experience that will equip them for a real job, which is what this is all about. As the social economy element, hopefully, develops over the years, we will be able to take up the kind of suggestion that Deputy Owen has mentioned &ndash; a worthwhile activity for people who wish to stay in a community based project and may not want to move into a job in the real economy. We are seeking to do both on a basis of consensus, in line with Partnership 2000 and the suggestions that came <Col N="907" /> from the voluntary sector in relation to the social economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft life assurance disclosure regulations are currently undergoing legal drafting in the parliamentary draftsman's office. They will be based on a specific enabling provision in the Insurance Bill, 1999, which is due to be published later this year.</P>
      <P>The essential rationale behind the proposals is to rectify the failure within the market as a whole to provide adequate information to the consumer in the marketing and selling of life assurance products and, as a by-product, to generate more competition among suppliers of insurance.</P>
      <P>The up to date situation with regard to the disclosure regulations remains fundamentally unchanged from my comprehensive responses to parliamentary questions on this matter on 9 March 1999 and 21 April 1999.</P>
      <P>The prime objectives in the formulation of the disclosure regime will be to simplify the presentation of such products to the consumer; minimise the scope for mis-selling, including the churning of policies; ensure transparency of all charges and expenses; identify the principal with whom the insurance consumer is dealing and provide adequate redress through a firm statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Information shall be provided in respect of the terms and conditions of the proposed insurance policy, including benefits and options, cooling off provisions, purpose and intention of policy, type of policy, the costs of the policy and the means and duration of payment of premia, and the consequences of early surrender of the policy.</P>
      <P>As part of this overall comprehensive disclosure package I will be introducing, for the first time, mandatory disclosure of insurance intermediary remuneration and salesperson's remuneration, as a separate item of disclosure. The thrust of the draft regulations is to ensure, as far as is practicable, a level playing field in disclosure as between the different distribution channels, irrespective of whether institutional or individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The achievement of equivalent disclosure across all suppliers is an extremely difficult concept. Nevertheless, the draft regulations provide that in determining illustrations of prospective benefits, all expenses and costs, charges and intermediary and sales remuneration, the insurer, through the appointed actuary, shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the illustrations <Col N="908" /> are not misleading and are presented in a fair and clear manner.</P>
    <P>All the interested representative bodies and parties have been furnished with the draft actuarial guidance notes which will accompany the final regulations and have been given the opportunity to make submissions on their content. The Society of Actuaries in consultation with our Department are considering all observations received and we will take them into account before enacting the regulations, particularly in so far as maintaining the principle of equivalence, which we strongly support.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State please explain why large companies dealing with a company with more than three staff, particularly in the area of life assurance, personal health assurance and group pension schemes, are omitted from the proposed new disclosure regulations? This is giving an unfair advantage to the larger market players while small brokers are being asked to declare commission on small individual schemes. It is unfair that banks can hike charges considerably in their own internal house advertising while small brokers must fully disclose all other charges on a company dealing. It is unfair to small businesses whose brokers must disclose all charges, while banks are omitted once they exceed a staff of three to ten. That is what is being proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Perry is becoming confused with this figure of three. An insurance agent can be an agent for a company selling the company's policies. An intermediary must have a minimum of three staff, or five agencies, to go into that category. Other institutions are selling their own policies across the board. It does not matter whether one is representing a company, an agent for a company or part of a brokerage, one will have the same level of disclosure on an equivalent basis. That is what we are proposing. We have worked assiduously to ensure this matter will be resolved and that there will be absolute transparency. We are confident we will get it right in the Insurance Bill, 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may or may not know that in most cases when insurance policies are sold, the commission, at the rate of about 90 per cent, is charged in the first year and transferred to the person who sells it. Surely the consumer is entitled to know that. Surely consumers are entitled to know that if, for any particular reason, they cannot afford to continue to pay for that policy &ndash; due to a bereavement, an accident or other unexpected difficulties &ndash; and have to cash in the policy, it is worthless for perhaps one, two or three years. It is important that that information be made available to consumers.</P>

I want to ensure that the consumer is treated fairly and that those who are employed to sell these products, or who employ people to sell such products, are treated fairly and equitably. There should be no discrimination whether it is a big banking institution, a small brokerage or an individual. At the end of the day the consumer will be protected. Within that environment we want equality for all so the economy can continue to grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The job initiative is a work reintegration programme targeted at the very long-term unemployed, persons on the live register for five years or more and aged 35 years or over. Job initiative participants have access to three years temporary employment. The budget added an additional 875 places to the job initiative provision, bringing the total number of places available under the initiative to 2,875.</P>
      <P>The first 1,000 job initiative participants are in the third and final year of their programme. An independent review of the pilot programme is being commissioned and any policy decisions regarding the future of the programme will be deferred until this report is to hand, which should be by June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of a further extension for the current participants, I have to stress that the fundamental objective of the programme is to facilitate their reintegration into the open labour market. As a general principle, it would not be fair <Col N="911" /> to other very long-term unemployed persons who might avail of the programme.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, I understand that a number of participants have already left the programme prior to completing three years in order to take up jobs. This is an encouraging sign of the programme's efficacy and of the motivation of participants. On the basis of experience gained a significant number of participants should be able to get jobs in the open labour market on completion of the programme and FÁS will provide progression advice and support to all participants in the lead up to completion. The managing agents for the job initiative have particular obligations in this regard also. I accept however that there may be some participants who face particular problems in taking this final step and can assure the Deputy that we will seek to deal with such cases in a sympathetic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that of all the schemes with time limits, this scheme for people over 35 is one that should be allowed to continue beyond the three year period? It is logical to have time limits for some schemes but does she realise that many people are well over 35 when they take up this scheme after many years of unemployment? If this scheme cuts off they will return to the live register, where they have no chance at 45 or 50 of getting a job. Does the Tánaiste agree that it is essential that there be some leeway to allow these schemes to go further due to the age of its participants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with Deputy Owen. We should have flexibility and one is talking about a hard core of people who have been unemployed for five years and are over 35. There are fewer of them than there were, but there is a sufficient number for special and targeted responses. As I said, some people left before the three years were up and people are at different stages. This is the kind of programme under which we need to look at people almost on an individual basis. If there are people who are not ready for a job in the labour market or an alternative training programme, then we need some degree of flexibility. On the other hand, there may also be people waiting to get into the programme. It may be a question of switching some places in this direction so that we have sufficient places, within reason, for the numbers who wish to access places in this programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen is right. This is probably the most successful programme for long-term unemployed people. These are people who find it impossible to get a job, or even an interview, by virtue of their age. Unfortunately, in today's environment, 35 is elderly. That seems astonishing but it is the reality and we need flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

That is a huge number of the people in the category to which we are referring, and they cannot get answers as to what will happen to them after that. Are any special measures being taken to track how many of them are finding jobs in the economy proper, and what will happen to the people who will reach a dead end when the scheme finishes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is right. I met some people who had been unemployed for more than 12 years, though five years was the minimum period of unemployment and 35 the minimum age. Many people on the scheme had been unemployed for much longer than five years and the longer the period of unemployment and the older they are, the more difficult it is. FÁS has been asked to ensure that the participants can progress either to a job or another training programme. However, we will have to deal with this on the basis of facts, as we are now progressing on the basis of hunches and our own experiences of individual cases. That is why I have asked Deloitte &amp; Touche to complete a report analysing the effect of this by the end of June, well in advance of when the first programme is to finish. I assume they will interview groups of people to assess the effect of this programme with a view to making recommendations. I assure Deputies that no change will be made without&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which came into effect on 13 May 1996, allocated responsibility for <Col N="913" /> authorising credit intermediaries to the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Act defines a credit intermediary as a person, other than a credit institution or a mortgage lender, who in the course of his business, arranges or offers to arrange for a consumer the provision of credit or the letting of goods in return for a commission, payment or consideration of any kind from the provider of the credit or the owner, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of credit intermediaries currently authorised by the Director operate in the retail motor trade. The Act obliges a motor trader who, being an authorised credit intermediary, arranges finance for a customer to purchase a car, to disclose certain information to the customer before any agreement regarding the purchase is entered into. The information which the motor trader is required to disclose includes the fact that the seller receives a commission, payment or consideration of any kind for arranging any such financial accommodation between the consumer and the undertaking.</P>
      <P>I have no knowledge of secret commission payments in the financing of car purchases. Any breaches of the relevant requirements as set out in the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, are a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has assured me that her office will vigorously pursue any specific complaints in this area.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State investigate this matter further? I have been told by a reputable person in the financial world that customers are being ripped off by some finance houses with the co-operation of some garages. I am also informed that there are secret commission arrangements, whether by way of hard cash or trips to the Monaco Grand Prix. If that is so, it must be the job of the Minister of State to stop it. The buyer of the car, who is paying the piper, is not in that case calling the tune. He does not even know the tune. Will the Minister of State take steps to have this fully investigated so that if this practice is being carried on by some finance houses and garages a stop is put to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have publicly stated my views on the issue of disclosure of directors' pay and remuneration. I believe that at a time of increasing globalisation of our capital markets, maximum accountability and transparency are essential in order to ensure investor confidence both nationally and internationally. The Stock Exchange only requires disclosure of directors' remuneration on an aggregate basis. I believe that full disclosure of remuneration of each named director is a desirable development and is not unusual in other jurisdictions. It is in the best interests of all the members of a company that the annual reports of Irish registered Irish listed companies should show the individual remuneration packages paid to directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that I would prefer to see the Stock Exchange's rules on disclosure of directors' pay being revised voluntarily. The Stock Exchange has acknowledged that its rules on disclosure must be reviewed with possible consequential changes. While I welcome this, I wish to see positive action taken on this matter by the Stock Exchange within the next month or so. I will be meeting with the Stock Exchange towards the end of this month to discuss the matter. If necessary, however, I am prepared to use the statutory route in the context of ongoing com<Col N="916" /> pany law reform in order to secure progress on this issue.</P>

      <P>I did not have a formal meeting with the Institute of Directors. I met a group from the Institute of Directors, as the Deputy probably knows, and they made no secret of their opposition to what is being proposed. They do not believe it right that they should be forced to disclose individual directors' remuneration packages. I will meet the Stock Exchange on 27 May to discuss this and other matters. I feel very strongly about this issue. The Investment Managers' Association has recommended change and they are responsible for approximately £100 billion worth of investment. There is individual disclosure in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the United States. Corporate governance and good practice requires us to do this here and it would be better if it were done voluntarily. However, the view of the Institute of Directors, as expressed by their president, Mr. Patrick Galvin, at their recent annual dinner &ndash; I have read his script &ndash; is, unfortunately, that they strongly oppose movement in this direction.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which relates to non-resident, Irish registered companies and the number of boards on which directors may serve, is due before the House shortly, does the Minister consider it a vehicle for a change in the law regarding the remuneration of directors? If she waits until she has concluded her discussions with the Institute of Directors and the Stock Exchange she may miss this opportunity to make a change, if she intends to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if change were brought about on a voluntary basis. Other legislation relating to company law is being prepared at the moment. I believe the response of the Stock Exchange will be positive. A number of people are in favour of change and if agreement can be reached later this month to introduce change on a voluntary basis, that would be the preferred option. We can legislate for change subsequently but if a course of action is agreed it is unlikely ever to change. That is always the best way to bring about change.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that this matter is best left to self-regulation? Apart from indicating that it is of the opinion that a review is necessary, has the Stock Exchange indicated to the Minister what its position on this matter is likely to be? Will she give the House an undertaking that if there is procrastination, she might use the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) <Col N="917" /> Bill to bring in an amendment requiring disclosure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give that undertaking. In other jurisdictions this is done through stock exchange requirements, and that would be the best way to do things here too. The Stock Exchange wrote to me in advance of my address to the Investment Managers' Association pointing out their opposition to this. However, I hope the Stock Exchange is now in a position to change its view in line with what is happening in so many other places. When I meet the Stock Exchange on 27 May I expect to be in a position to discuss the matter and to decide finally if it will be necessary to legislate. Stock exchanges and directors generally always prefer to work on the basis of self-regulation rather than have legislation forced upon them, but it will be if change does not take place on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 30, 36 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest monthly report on the employment action plan, report No. 6, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, shows the outcomes for the 6,010 young unemployed persons who have been referred to date for supports under the plan. By the end of March 3,583, or 60 per cent, had been interviewed by FÁS. Of these, 1,343 or 37 per cent were placed by FÁS. Of the balance of 2,200, <Col N="918" /> some 640 have already left the live register, 825 are awaiting training or are receiving ongoing FÁS support, a further 450 have dropped out and have been referred back to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs while the remainder are not yet ready to progress. With regard to those placed by FÁS, the latest data indicate that 56 per cent are placed in jobs and the remainder in FÁS training programmes or in education.</P>
    <P>The progress report shows that a relatively steady proportion, accounting for approximately 8 per cent of interviewees, are not ready to progress into jobs or training. There is a number of reasons for this, including substance abuse, health issues and advanced state of pregnancy. Currently, an exercise is under way to determine the proportionate incidence of these with a view to designing appropriate rehabilitative or pre-employment programmes.</P>
    <P>The data used by the INOU do not compare like with like and I am perplexed as to why they seemingly want to put the worst complexion on what are generally recognised to be positive outcomes.</P>
    <P>Monthly report No. 6 provides the best objective overview of the outcome of the whole process. Key outcomes are the fact that by the end of March, some 56 per cent of all referrals had left the live register. Furthermore, some 80 per cent of those referred in September last, when the process first started, have now left the live register. Some 82 per cent of FÁS interviewees left the live register for positive reasons &ndash; 47 per cent for a job, 29 per cent for a training programme and 6 per cent to go back education. This compares well to the outcomes for those who did not attend for interview and subsequently left the live register, of whom 37 per cent went to a job. It is not surprising, given the current buoyant labour market, that young persons who did not attend the interview found a job as many of them would have been seeking employment and would have found a successful outcome themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste explain how the mechanics of this works? How is one selected for interview and to what extent is the person monitored and tracked thereafter? Do the interviewers welcome the fact that a certain percentage do not attend interview and leave the live register? Do we know why they left the live register or is it the attitude that this does not matter and attention is given to those who attend for interview?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs writes in the first instance to every person under the age of 25 years once they are six months unemployed. The two computer systems are interlinked. The Department invites them to make contact with FÁS with a view to attending an interview. A placement officer in FÁS then interviews the person, who can be interviewed a number of times. In some <Col N="919" /> of the offices I have attended, people have been interviewed a number of times. If they are suitable for employment, they are referred to a job.</P>
      <P>The idea is to assess their wishes and to seek to find a way to solve a problem in line with them. If an immediate job is required some of the jobs available are matched to the needs of the interviewee. If a job is not available or is not suitable they are referred to a training programme and, in some instances, referred back to education. Some have had to await a suitable opportunity. Those who do not attend an interview are sent a second letter because there may be reasons for their failure to attend. They then become the responsibility of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>After six months we have an analysis of the first cohort of people that were dealt with in September. It shows that 80 per cent had left the live register for positive reasons &ndash; to access a job or training or go back to education. The remaining 20 per cent fall into the categories to which I referred. Some are on substance abuse, some may be pregnant and some may not be suitable for employment for whatever reason. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs follows up these to determine who they are and their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme of intervening with those under 25 years of age is working for a number of them. Will the Tánaiste indicate the percentage of those called under the scheme that has not attended interview? I find the figures confusing and am not surprised the INOU is having difficulty working them out. Will the Tánaiste indicate what happens to those still being handled by FÁS? When the scheme was introduced last September the statistics indicated that a number of people are being handled by FÁS. How many has the scheme identified as unemployable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for an inadvertent discourtesy earlier. It appears our colleagues found the remains of victims more quickly than we had expected.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment. He is not prepared to accept a limitation of expenditure on the part of candidates of parties in local elections. Reference was made in the House yesterday to views expressed by the Minister in the Seanad, where I understand he said we should perhaps abolish expenditure limits for general elections, by-elections and European elections. Will he outline the main reasons he believes we should abolish expenditure limits?</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister believe we are so different from other States which have found that in modern societies it is becoming increasingly difficult to divorce the practice of politics from the possession of money? I speak, as do the majority of Members, as one who is not in a position to spend large amounts of money on elections. I would not wish to, even if I were in a position to spend more than I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is kind of the Minster to say so. I am not sure his view will go down well with those in my constituency who do not already vote for me. Will he indicate in what way he believes we are different from other societies where the pressure of modern society has led to an overbearing influence of money on many political processes? There are examples, the United States of America being one, where, despite the existence of elaborate legislation, it has still proved impossible to ease the pressure to raise ever larger amounts of money for elections. I am not sure that is the case here for the reason that the number of people with large amounts of money to give is much smaller than in many other countries.</P>
      <P>Although there would be complications in the system I am proposing in this and other amendments, the extra work to be done, compared to what is being proposed in the Bill, would not be huge. With random sampling during elections, we could have a working system that would be more onerous than the one provided for in the Bill and which would put the frighteners on candidates inclined to spend large amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="922" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the collective <i>mea culpa</i> for my absence before lunch. It has not dampened, however, my dislike for what the Minister is proposing to do.</P>
      <P>On whether we are dealing with a political intent or an administrative difficulty, if the Government intends to get rid of the spending limits that apply to Dáil and European Parliament elections, it will be opposed in a most vigorous fashion by the Labour Party. We want to have the principle of limits extended to local elections. I am not hung up on the amounts proposed in my amendment, but it is important that candidates in local elections do not have <i>carte blanche </i>to spend any amount they like.</P>
      <P>The reasons offered as to why it is not considered desirable to extend the limits to local elections do not stand up. In arguing that the limits for Dáil elections have caused difficulties &ndash; the recent by-elections have been cited &ndash; one is making the case for examining the limits for by-elections. It is not a case for abolishing them.</P>
      <P>The argument that it would be cumbersome administratively does not stand up either. The administrative arrangements are being put in place. The Bill provides for the making of declarations by local elections candidates and designated persons of political parties and for a panoply of administrative requirements which inherently provide a mechanism through which limits on spending could be policed and monitored.</P>
      <P>There are no good reasons the limits should not be extended to local elections. This should be done urgently as the local elections are upon us. Candidates should be told soon if there are to be spending limits. That would be the public's wish.</P>
      <P>There is much general discussion about the relationship between money and politics. The battery of legislation introduced by the previous Government dealing with ethics in public office, the declaration of expenditure and donations and freedom of information has transformed our system of public life and made available to the public an open and transparent arrangement which governs politics. If this had been in place ten years ago, the matters which are now the subject of examination at the tribunals in Dublin Castle would have been prevented. The spending limits are an integral and important part of that legislation. If they are removed, the arrangement will be seriously undermined. The Minister should give serious consideration to these amendments which provide him with a number of options by which the problem can be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not present to hear the Minister's reply. On Second Stage he did not preclude the possibility of introducing expenditure limits for local elections and said he may have to revisit the issue. That being so, he is missing a golden opportunity to provide for regulations which would allow him to introduce expenditure limits at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Most candidates welcome the fact that there are expenditure limits for Dáil elections. Prior to their introduction, large amounts of money had to be raised. The expenditure limits are sensible. Most local elections candidates would welcome the introduction of expenditure limits as it would mean other candidates would not be able to buy votes in a most unseemly fashion. We can debate the figures, if the Minister concedes on the principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that, administratively, expenditure limits would be unenforceable. If he decides to introduce limits, provision could be made for a graded system of penalties that would fit the offence. Is it the intention to have the Bill in place in time for the upcoming local elections?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that this legislation will apply to the local elections to be held on 11 June. I acknowledge, as I have done previously, the co-operation of Opposition spokespersons in trying to ensure it is in place. I do not want to use the shortage of time between now and local elections as an excuse why I do not have expenditure limitations in place. I recall in 1997, when the legislation for Dáil elections was going through, we wisely took the decision that provisions in relation to expenditure would not apply in the 1997 general election because of the difficulties of putting mechanisms in place. As I said, I am not using that as an excuse in this instance. It is, however, another reason that in this election campaign, the introduction of expenditure limits at this stage would not be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes spoke about a welcome by all candidates at local elections. I will make a prediction here and now in relation to the next general election campaign, when we are all subject to the provisions of the Electoral Act, that it will cause mayhem. That is not a reason for not putting these limits in place, and there are good reasons we should have them in place. That legislation, particularly the limits, was hastily drawn together. As I said previously, limits were plucked from the air with no real thought as to how fair or equitable they were. As Deputy Gilmore said, we found we had some difficulties in this regard at by-elections.</P>
      <P>I predict here and now that, immediately after the next general election, few Members of this House will welcome the provisions of the Electoral Act because of the difficulties it will cause them. We will all genuinely try to comply with the terms of the Act and ensure everything which legally needs to be declared is declared. I genuinely believe Members do not realise what they face when they have to do this the next time round. Even with the most positive will in the world, Members will have huge difficulties. That is an aside to what we are talking about today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is probably timely in some respects. We could do worse than sit down at the <Col N="924" /> Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government, have a good look at the provisions of the Electoral Act and try to get further clarification from the Public Offices Commission. We should use the time we have between now and the next election to make absolutely clear to every Member what is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years should be quite sufficient. I say that generally; it is a non-political point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes asked about expenditure limits. I am not ruling out, <i>ad infinitum</i>, the possibility that we may introduce expenditure limits. In response to the Opposition spokesperson last night, I said one of the benefits of the approach I am adopting in this case where we have to make returns, as Deputy Dukes and Deputy Gilmore said, is that we would be able to look at that, analyse the levels of expenditure and get a somewhat better idea as to what those expenditure limits might reasonably be, if we are to set them. We do not have any idea other than to pluck figures out of the air.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendments tabled by Deputy Dukes and Deputy Gilmore about three, four and five seaters and the variety of proposals of £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000, what about six, seven or nine seat electoral areas, as in the case of urban councils, or 12 seat electoral areas, as in some of the corporation areas? Is it fair for a person to contest an election in a three seater where the population is 50,000 or 60,000 &ndash; another issue in which Deputy Gilmore has an interest &ndash; while in another three seater, it is 1,000? The issues of fairness and equity come into play, and that situation arises. I do not want to repeat what I said earlier but there are issues that need to be teased out.</P>
      <P>I would like to allay Deputy Gilmore's fears in relation to a comment I made. It was meant to be a flippant remark which, I suppose, one should not make on the record of the House. I assure him I have no plans to do away with expenditure limits in the Electoral Act.</P>
      <P>In response to a point Deputy Dukes made about expenditure limits, doing away with them and what makes us different from other countries, there are many things which make us different. In electoral terms, we are one of only two countries which has the PR multi-seat constituency and this type of electoral system. That makes us uniquely different. Deputy Dukes and Deputy Hayes, who come from a larger party, and perhaps not so much someone like Deputy Gilmore who comes from a smaller party, would have some knowledge of the difficulties involved in multi-seat constituencies where there is a multiplicity of candidates. That is what makes us different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent, the principle about which we are talking, disclosure and expenditure, is fine. It is good that we look at practices in other countries in relation to these issues. We should not, <Col N="925" /> however, forget that our system is almost unique and that we need to devise our own solutions and practices. My solution is to have an electoral system where we have a single seat constituency with the PR STV system and an element of the list, as well as direct election.</P>

We will be in a much better position to consider that carefully in the light of the experience we will have. I do not agree with the contention of Deputies that the electorate is stupid enough to be bought by people who can spend money. If it was that simple, we could probably be assured of a 100 per cent turn-out by using money to get people to vote in elections.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister stated he has no intention of getting rid of spending limits for elections. It sounded from his reply that he was offering an Irish solution to an Irish electoral system, something which has an unfortunate resonance. Is the Minister saying he definitely intends introducing spending limits based on the experience of the 1999 local elections? If so, how does he propose introducing such limits?</P>
      <P>Yesterday I touched on the reason spending limits in local elections are necessary. In a way the entire local election system, including the electorate, is probably more extendable when compared with general elections. Generally, the poll in local elections is smaller than in general elections. There is more scope for a person with money to get people out to vote who might not do so or to get out a section of a core party vote to the greater advantage of a particular candidate. In the last local elections I saw a clear case where a political party fielded a number of candidates and ended up with one seat which was won by the candidate with the most money who ran the most expensive campaign. This candidate won the seat to the disadvantage of the other candidates who were clearly not as well resourced. Therefore, there is experience to show that money can play a very significant part in the outcome of a local election, both in and between parties. Earlier the Minister made a point about multi-candidates. In such situations the candidate who is better off has the greater chance of being elected, something which is unfair to other candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point that the provisions have to be fine tuned to meet the circumstances described by the Minister, including variances in popu<Col N="926" /> lation, the number of seats per electoral area, the type of authority being elected and geographical considerations. Clearly, the matter cannot be tied entirely to population as geographical issues should also be considered. However, it should be possible to work out a reasonable limit which would ensure candidates did not go totally wild. I do not necessarily think we should commit ourselves to a limit based on the average expenditure of candidates &ndash; it is not that kind of mathematical exercise. It should be possible for those of us with sufficient political experience and experience of election campaigns to put a reasonable upper limit on the expenditure of a candidate. I would not particularly stick to my provisions of expenditure limits of £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000. Is it reasonable, for example, that a candidate in a local election should spend more than £10,000? Is it reasonable that a candidate in a local election should be free to purchase a full page advertisement in every local newspaper circulating in the area?</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes made the point that many candidates, who are running for an unpaid, part-time office, would probably welcome a limit on spending as they are inundated with requests from local newspapers to take full page, half page and quarter page advertisements on the basis that party colleagues have already agreed to do so. Huge pressure is put on candidates to spend money and many would welcome the discipline of a spending limit. This is important in terms of the integrity of local elections. We should not allow a situation whereby somebody can spend mega-bucks trying to be elected. I accept that the limit can be fine tuned in the light of the declarations made after the election, but for the forthcoming elections we should at least impose an upper limit which would prevent excessive expenditure being incurred by candidates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense we are talking in a vacuum. Throughout the country I have seen posters, etc., for the local elections and even if we decided tonight to put an upper limit on expenditure it would be no more than an academic exercise. I take the point being made by Deputy Gilmore regarding an upper limit, but by the time the Bill is passed such a provision, if included, would not be available for the local elections in June.</P>
      <P>We are coming from two different points of view. Deputy Gilmore believes people can be unduly influenced or bought &ndash; the Deputy did not use this term &ndash; by people who spend money on elections. However, I do not believe this. The Deputy cited cases to support his argument and I have no doubt that he genuinely believes money alone made the difference in such campaigns. However, I could equally give examples of people who spent huge amounts of money in relative terms in local elections and who were not elected. We can agree to disagree on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly. I have said that many of these issues can be teased out at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government subsequent to the elections. Many Members and members of local authorities certainly welcome the concept of limiting expenditure by candidates as they are well established and therefore have an advantage. Many members of local authorities, by virtue of their membership, are able to get on local radio and be reported in local newspapers. The system is not fair and by further limiting a person's possibilities in terms of expenditure we are in a sense giving a further advantage to existing members. Perhaps it is a philosophical argument, but the reality is that we must try to be absolutely fair to everybody.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore asked if it was my definite intention to introduce expenditure limits in future. No, it is not a definite intention. However, it is my intention in conjunction with the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to seek information from the local authorities about levels of expenditure recorded when the returns have been submitted and the documentation is available, and to put that information before the committee so that it can discuss the necessity or otherwise of placing expenditure limits on local government. I make that commitment in the House to Deputies Gilmore, Dukes and Hayes. That is the approach I will adopt in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that setting up the bureaucracy involved will advance anyone's cause. I have listened to the arguments and accept the sincerity with which they were made. I am prepared to revisit this matter after these local elections on the basis I outlined. We are within four weeks of the local elections. Were we to pass the legislation with the various limits included, we would not be in a position to implement it in these local elections. Were we to go the route of the Electoral Act, I would have to issue guidelines and <Col N="928" /> give all involved a reasonable opportunity to examine those guidelines.</P>
    <P>We have had a long discussion on this and the philosophical arguments on both sides have been aired. I ask Deputies, despite their strongly held and genuinely expressed beliefs, to accept my position and the undertaking I have given and withdraw their amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply but he does himself a little too much honour in describing his thoughts on the matter as philosophical arguments. They are not. They are pragmatic arguments of circumstance.</P>
      <P>He says it is too late to introduce expenditure limits. The Government has known since it took office that there would be local elections this year. It could have introduced expenditure limits before. It is a fine and sensible thing for the Minister to suggest the information on the levels of expenditure be examined at a later stage. I note, however, there is no specific provision in the Bill to require local authorities concerned to give information to the Government. They have an obligation to keep information and make it available to the public, but there is no specific provision for them to make it available to anyone else. I do not know if the Government will have the right to ask.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the suggestion that it would make it even less fair for candidates not in office who apparently are already at a disadvantage in that they must compete with incumbent, sitting or outgoing members, or whatever one likes to call them, who have an advantage in terms of access to the media. The Minister and I are long enough in politics to know there are some things in the world which cannot be changed. In any electoral system, no matter what one does, outgoing members of whatever body to which people will be elected already have an established track record as members, be it good bad or indifferent, and nothing can be done to remove that difference. Life is like that.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister will not accept the amendment and I am not minded to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>Amendments 8 to 28, inclusive, 30 to 64, inclusive, 67, 69, 70, 75 and 76 are consequential on amendment No. 2 and may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Public Offices Commission' means the Public Offices Commission referred to in the Act of 1997;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce the Public Offices Commission into the Bill. It seems to me we should use the same procedure in relation to the disclosure of donations and expenditure for local elections as exists for general elections, by-elections and European elections. I cannot see why, when we have put such procedures in place and when they have operated on two occasions, we should now adopt a different approach in relation to local elections.</P>
      <P>On local elections, the Bill provides that local authorities would collect information, announce that they have it at specified times and that it is available for consultation. There seems to be a feeling that by keeping the information at local level, it would be more readily available to those who would be anxious to see it. I take that with a grain of salt.</P>
      <P>The Bill is written in the manner it is because the Minister does not wish to impose limitations on expenditure. This specific proposal arises largely from the fact that I believe such limitations should be imposed. If we impose limitations on expenditure, we should treat those limitations and their invigilation in the same manner we treat them in general and European elections, hence my proposal that the Public Offices Commission be mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> Amendment No. 2 simply proposes to put the Public Offices Commission into the definitions section so that it would not be necessary to define it anywhere else it might arise. Amendments 8 to 28, inclusive, 30 to 64, inclusive, 67, 69, 70, 75 and 76 would substitute a reference to the Public Offices Commission for, variously, &ldquo;the local authority concerned&rdquo; or &ldquo;competent local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not at all convinced that in order to make information accessible to the public, it must be kept in local authorities only. That puts us back, in communications terms, to the horse and buggy age. It implies that because people in a particular locality might like to have certain information, its existence should be announced in a local newspaper and people should be informed that they can go to the seat of their local county council to consult it. I see no difficulty whatsoever &ndash; and I am sure all local authorities are equipped to do this &ndash; with making the information available to the Public Offices Commission where it would be accessible to all local authorities, the increasing number of Internet users, the media, pressure and lobby groups, academics, politicians and others. Neither can I see any reason individual local authorities should be obliged to go to the trouble of placing a notice in a local newspaper stating that the information is available. It might well be useful to publicise the availability of information in local newspapers which are a very widely used and, sometimes underestimated, means of communication. However, the Public Offices Commission would be perfectly capable of ensuring that information would be made available through the national and local press, outlining details on how the information could be accessed.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this amendment is that I believe we should impose limitations on expenditure. The Minister disagrees with that and the House, unfortunately, has also disagreed with it. Nevertheless, it is useful to proceed with the amendment as the more unity we have in the systems we put in place to invigilate donations and expenditure, the more likely they are to have some effect. It is for that reason we should insert this first reference to the Public Offices Commission and follow it up in the other amendments referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. As Deputy Dukes stated, it relates to the core issue of whether limits should be imposed on expenditure. The provisions in the Bill for the handling of information are archaic. They betray an incredible, old style thinking on the manner in which information is disseminated to the public and processed in the public system. It is absolutely antiquated to advance a formula which requires individual local authorities to set up separate systems for the receipt, administration and advertising of information and for making it available to the public. That kind of thinking views information as something which is written <Col N="932" /> with a quill into a big ledger and if members of the public want to see it, they must come along and stick their heads through a hatch. That is very outmoded. It is surely possible for the information to be transferred from the candidate or the political party to the Public Offices Commission which has already established a system for dealing with this kind of information. The Public Offices Commission would make the information available to the public via the Internet and transfer it to local authorities. There is no reason that people should not be able go to their local authorities and consult the information.</P>
      <P>The current provision places an unnecessary administrative burden on overstretched local authorities which are now required to set up independent systems to deal with this information. Local authorities are constantly being given new legislation by the Oireachtas without having the resources to implement it. They are being handed additional administrative tasks to perform when they are already overstretched. The provisions of this Bill will mean that each local authority will have to move staff who would otherwise be processing higher education grant applications or other matters normally dealt with by the general purposes section and put them to work on this, something with which they are unfamiliar and which is already in place in the Public Offices Commission. This reinvents the wheel 90 times over.</P>
      <P>There is an additional reason for the Public Offices Commission doing this. We should harmonise what is being provided for in ethics legislation concerning local authorities. I have tabled an amendment on this. The declaration of donations outside the time of the election itself is amazingly excluded from the legislation. The Public Offices Commission is capable of supervising all of this.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes. It would relieve the local authorities of an unnecessary burden and it would make the information available in a way which is more accessible. It would confer the obligation to do it on the body which is already established to do this, and which has some expertise in the area. It would facilitate the harmonisation of legislation governing ethics, political practice, donations and election expenditure for members of local authorities with other elected persons and public servants who are covered by the legislation. There are many advantages in transferring this responsibility to the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The great benefit of the Public Offices Commission is that it is totally independent of politics, business and the local government system. I am not suggesting that a county manager is not independent when it comes to dealing with politicians. We are, however, placing them in the invidious position whereby they now have to keep this information and decide when it will be made public. The relationship between the county manager and the member, while it is tot<Col N="933" /> ally independent, is different to the relationship between the Public Offices Commission and any candidate, Member of the Dáil or member of local government. We should be consistent and have one system in place for all political activity at local, national and European level.</P>
      <P>The Minister will use the Buncrana example in his reply, as he did so skilfully on Second Stage in the Seanad and in the Dáil. He will tell us that the Dáil has no right to tell the people of Buncrana, Killybegs or anywhere else in the State, that they must go to Dublin to look at the statements of their local authority members. In a general election the people of Buncrana, Killybegs or Clifden must come to Dublin. If the Minister was so concerned about ensuring that they were entitled to see the donation statements of various people, he would have introduced an amendment to the Bill which would allow them to see information locally. That argument will not wash.</P>
      <P>We need to have all information contained within the Public Offices Commission. In amendment No. 29 I asked that all information could be sent by e-mail, fax or post. The current position means that a person who wants to see a donation statement in the Public Offices Commission must turn up at the commission. The information is then photocopied and handed to the person. That practice is completely out of date. If a member of the public or someone from the media wants the information, they should be able to get it by e-mail, fax or post. If the information was kept at the Public Offices Commission, as Deputy Dukes has proposed, it would be more sensible and would not create a new bureaucracy at local authority level where people have better things to do. It is wrong, when the State has established an authority to deal with this, that we are not giving a specific function, as contained in the Act, to that authority &ndash; the Public Offices Commission.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of proposing it. I know full well because I have heard all three Members opposite, and others besides, rightly praising the whole concept of local government, local democracy and subsidiarity. They say that decisions should be made locally and everything should be done at a local level. I agree with those sentiments. That is why we have inserted in this Bill that matters pertaining to elections to a local authority, donations and expenditure should be dealt with at local authority level. I have no doubt that if I went the route of centralisation and not subsidiarity Members opposite would point out <Col N="934" /> the error of my ways to me. I appreciate that the Opposition has to do this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but I am trying to encourage more devolution of responsibility to local authorities and to ensure that any functions best performed at local level are performed at a local level. I know I have the support of Members of this House from all sides. That is why we went this route. I do not accept the arguments which Deputies have put forward, I do not accept the argument that the provisions of this Bill are onerous. We are talking about receiving perhaps 65 submissions, when the county and urban councils are taken into account. The national average for local authorities would be less than that. I do not accept the argument that dumping 3,500 of these forms into the Public Offices Commission would be a more efficient way of doing this. It certainly would not be an efficient way to ensure the information is made available as quickly as I believe it should be. Neither do I accept the argument that invigilation of 3,500 forms would be easier done than a local authority invigilating 15, 20 or even up to 60 or 65 forms. That argument does not stand up. I have said before that local government elections concern local issues, local candidates and, more importantly, the local electorate. There is no reason, therefore, election expenses of local authority members should be centralised in Dublin. Why should a person living in an area other than Dublin have to travel to Dublin for this information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish. I have had a complaint from Deputy Hayes about the Public Offices Commission. We are talking about the information age, and he rightly pointed out that if people want general election information from the Public Offices Commission they have to go to the Public Offices Commission. Deputies are now proposing that I should put 3,500 of these forms and declarations in the Public Offices Commission so that people can travel again&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Dukes let me finish the point? It will be much simpler for local authorities, in dealing with their own candidates, to provide the information by way of all the modern communications available to them. A number of one-stop-shops are in place in local authorities and many local authorities now have the information technology that Deputy Hayes rightly says <Col N="935" /> should be used. That is the way the information should be provided by local authorities. If a local authority meets requests specifically for its own area, it should be able to do that without having to go through the procedures for charging, etc. currently being followed by the Public Offices Commission. It will be much closer to the people. Despite what Deputies say, not everybody has the Internet or e-mail facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter can be addressed to the local authority. Is Deputy Hayes telling me it is better that a person should have to write to Dublin rather than to Navan or the county council headquarters in Tallaght to get information? I do not accept that. It is better to use this at a local level. Great expertise will not be needed to collate these forms, to make the information available to the public and to investigate on foot of complaints. I do not accept the argument that there is a lack of expertise in local authorities to deal with this issue. An ability to read and perhaps tot up the figures on these forms is all that is needed. I am sure Members are not saying local authorities are incapable of doing that.</P>
      <P>The point about placing a county secretary or a county manager in an invidious position is well made and would be a consideration in this context. It is a matter to which I gave consideration. There is a relationship between local authority members and managers who perhaps might not be paralleled at central Government level, but we are talking about reinvigorating a local government system that will make it real local government, where people will have to take on responsibilities. In the past, the local government system, with a recent notable exception, has proved to be upstanding. In terms of integrity, the management system has proved to be first class since its establishment and, like our Civil Service and public service, a responsibility like this, irrespective of the relationship that exists between members and managers or county secretaries, would not stand in the way of a public servant doing his or her duty. I am sure the Deputy would accept that, although I do not want to imply he was saying anything other than that. The point is well made that it is a consideration, but it has to be dealt with in a responsible manner at a local level. There will be a section in the local government reform Bill &ndash; this relates also to the point made by Deputy Gilmore &ndash; dealing with ethics, conflicts of interest and the putting in place of an ethics officer who would probably be the person assigned to oversee this legislation from the next election onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I will avail of every opportunity to devolve and decentralise as much as possible. I know Deputies on all sides of the House support that broad principle. This is an ideal opportunity <Col N="936" /> to put that into practice and it is for that reason I will not accept the amendments the Deputies have put down. This Bill is best dealt with by local authorities in their local area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wonderful experience to see the Minister before us in his garb as the apostle of devolution and decentralisation. Unfortunately, the nirvana he is selling us seems to be far away. The Minister used words which send a chill down every county manager's spine. Talking about the functions he proposes to devolve to local authorities through the Bill, the Minister said this is an issue that has to be dealt with and will be dealt with, irrespective of resources or anything else the local authorities have to do. The Minister gets a good idea, he says he is an apostle of devolution and decentralisation and hands over the function to local authorities. Many of us seem to believe they have infinitely elastic resources that can be used, but that is not the central point.</P>
      <P>I am not arguing that it is easier for the Public Offices Commission to do this than for the local authorities, although that is a reasonable expectation. The Public Offices Commission was set up with a part of its mandate consisting of the invigilation of expenditure by candidates in general elections, by-elections and now European elections. It is a creature we set up to do that. I see no persuasive reason in what the Minster said to change my mind on the point that if it is appropriate to do that for European elections, general elections and by-elections, it is appropriate to do it in the same way for local elections because it is the same kind of system we operate.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister is making such apparently respectable but fundamentally meaningless arguments about this. The central reason for this was that we were proposing limitations on expenditure, but we are not doing so now.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister does not accept the need to address the way in which the local authorities and the Public Offices Commission will deal with this information, particularly since Deputy Hayes has tabled an amendment which would, at least, encourage them to come up to date in the transmission and dissemination of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made an extraordinary contribution. Let us take his argument about devolving this function to local authorities. If he was serious about this he would have brought enabling legislation before the House which would set down principles and guidelines. He would have left the devising of a scheme for the declaration of contributions, arguably for the placing of limits on spending and for the conduct of local election campaigns, to local authorities. The House would pass general legislation which would enable local authorities to draw up by-laws to provide for the declaration of contributions and expenditure and the placing of limitations on expenditure, particular to the circumstances of <Col N="937" /> each authority. There would be much to recommend such a measure. It would constitute real devolution and respect for local government by giving power back to local authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the Oireachtas is not giving power back to local government by enacting legislation which goes down to the last detail and then sends the administration of that legislation to town and county halls. That is not devolving any power as there is no power accompanying such a move. In that context local authorities are only being given a chore.</P>
      <P>The second argument used by the Minister is that in far flung parts of the country there will be people who will not have access to this information if it is stored centrally. The Minister is living in the Dark Ages. As has been stated, this information is capable of being stored, communicated and made available electronically. Not every household is connected to the Internet but in five years time when the next local elections are held, virtually every house will be connected. If not, there will be opportunities in public places for people to connect to the Internet. Within a couple of years, the Internet will be as common as the telephone. People will be as familiar with getting information from it and, in many cases, doing much of their daily business on it. This process will be accelerated by the integration of television and other communications systems.</P>
      <P>This legislation is providing an old style system of dealing with information in the information age when we need to provide for and anticipate the manner in which information is going to be communicated. The Minister has conjured up an image of people taking the train to Dublin to stand at a hatch in some office to view a bound book in which the donations received by candidates are inscribed in vellum. Such an image does not belong to this generation. There is no reason information cannot be made available in the offices of local authorities, public libraries or places where people expect to be able to access public information.</P>
      <P>The third argument put forward by the Minister is that the 3,800 forms which would arrive at the Public Offices Commission two weeks after the local elections would be such a burden that they would not be able to cope with it. He has created an idea that the system provided for in the Bill will be easier to administer and more efficient. Let us look at what is being provided for in the Bill. The first thing to happen after the Bill is passed is that the Minister will have to assign officers in his Department to draw up regulations to bring the Bill into effect. They will have to send circulars explaining how this should be done to every local authority, urban council, town commissioners and so on, all of whom will have to set up a system for the receipt and management of this information. Individual authorities will then have to assign officers to handle the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will also be the issue of the compilation of the form. It is fair to anticipate that the <Col N="938" /> Department will insist that there will be some type of standard form to be used by all authorities which the Department will have to design and send to each authority. These authorities will then have to place an advertisement in local newspapers and receive the information from individual candidates.</P>
    <P>The issue of consistency will then arise. After the local elections we do not want the electoral equivalent of what happened in Dr. Cullen Park last Sunday, where new rules are interpreted differently leading to the disqualification of some candidates because of an over-zealous interpretation of the new legislation by an enthusiastic officer. There will have to be consistency giving rise to a huge number of faxes and other communications between the Department, town halls, offices of town commissioners and county councils to find out whether they are interpreting the legislation correctly on various points.</P>
    <P>What will be the administrative cost in terms of staff in the Department and at local authority level and administration. The paperwork generated will lead to a bureaucratic nightmare which can be simplified in the manner suggested by this amendment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is old thinking when it comes to information. Deputy Dukes's approach would make information more publicly available. It would also lead to greater consistency and a less costly and bureaucratic means of administering the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to my earlier comments concerning the relationship between the county manager, county secretary and the individual member. I do not know of any other legislation where, if a complaint is made against a member for failing to furnish necessary information, the county secretary and the local authority, under section 18, may initiate summary proceedings against the member or furnish a written report on the matter. I know of no other legislation in which such new powers are given to county managers to initiate proceedings against a member. I am only putting this down as a marker. I am not making any comment but we are going down a new route where the county secretary has to initiate proceedings. The Minister argues that people in a local community should be entitled to see donation statements. I agree with him. However, if he is to be consistent, he should introduce amending legislation to the Electoral Act to allow local people in Buncrana, Killybegs or wherever to see information locally. Local elections are organised at an administrative level in the same way as general elections. In a general election the registrar is a local person, and all the personnel who count the votes come from local authorities. If the argument is that we should furnish this information locally, the Minister should introduce amending legislation to the Electoral Act to give power to local people to see the statements of their local Dáil Deputies locally as <Col N="939" /> against coming to Dublin and appearing at a hatch before they can get information.</P>
      <P>In the context of my amendment and also in terms of the guidelines that may emerge, is the Minister guaranteeing that if a citizen in an administrative area wants to see a statement nothing will prevent that person from seeing the statement or getting the information by post, fax, e-mail or over the phone? I was not criticising the Public Offices Commission when I said that people have to appear in person before they can get the information. As I understand it, their interpretation of the legislation is that people must turn up personally. They are interpreting the Act as saying that the information cannot be transmitted by way of modern communication techniques. Is the Minister guaranteeing that every local authority will use all means at its disposal to transmit information, and that a person will not have to call personally between 10.00 a.m. and 4.30 p.m., the time at which most local authorities close up shop, and that he or she can get information by ringing up the relevant section and asking for a copy of the donation to be sent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been accused of dictating to local authorities how they should do their business. I will not give guarantees about how local authorities will administer this Act. There is nothing in this Act to prevent local authorities from giving out information however they decide. I am somewhat surprised, if the Deputy's information is correct &ndash; and I have no reason to doubt it &ndash; that in this age of modern communications and technology the Public Offices Commission would interpret an Act in a very narrow way to mean that somebody has to turn up in person to get information when there are so many other ways in which people can be given information. I understand that in some cases the provisions of the Act allow for a charge to be made for information, which I think is reasonable, but there must be some way of ensuring that information can be provided in both directions and paid for by way of credit cards and so on. I would be astounded if legislation going through this House at this time were interpreted as excluding the transmission of information in any way other than by somebody turning up in person at a public office. A assure the Deputy that there is nothing in this legislation of which I am aware that prevents a local authority from making information available in whatever format or manner it decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point the Deputy makes about the Electoral Acts, I was not responsible for the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1997. I was in opposition at the time. I contributed a great deal to the shaping of that Act in many respects, but I did not have the final say in relation to it. I would not have accorded any priority to the point the Deputy made about making this available at local level. We have so much more legislation that we need to put through that it would not have been a <Col N="940" /> priority. Now that the Deputy has mentioned it, we will look at it in the context of the ongoing review of the Electoral Acts, this one in particular. No doubt, when the public standards Bill, which is before committees of the House, is brought forward, the Deputy might raise the matter in that context because there will be an attempt to have one piece of legislation rather than two or three as we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to Deputy Gilmore's contribution. I was often told that in politics if one cannot convince, one should try to confuse. Deputy Gilmore has succeeded in doing that with some of the arguments he has put forward here. I reiterate that I am not suggesting that people have to board a steam train and go to Dublin to obtain information from the Public Offices Commission. I am well aware of the ways and means of getting information, even though there is some difficulty at the moment. My sole aim in having this information provided locally is to give another function to local government. It would be very demeaning, in the context of local government reform, in the context of decentralisation to which we all subscribe, to have something as important as this is to local elections and the local electorate dealt with centrally. Some people agree with that. Others disagree. I agree with it and, as somebody once famously said &ldquo;I am over here and you are over there, so it is my view that prevails&rdquo;. I honestly do not think that if the Deputy were over here he would be rushing to change this legislation. It would be wrong and demeaning in the context of local government to have this dealt with centrally when it could be dealt with locally.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, powers are being devolved, and this involves administration. Under section 18 specific powers devolve to local authorities. Deputy Dukes went a step further, saying that this was another case of devolving functions without allocating funds. This year local government will have £126 million extra available to it than it had in 1997. A greater proportion of that money is being given to local authorities on a discretionary basis, and it is my intention to try to continue to provide that money for local authorities. However, I will not provide money for relatively simple administrative tasks. Local authorities have more money, and they have more discretion over that money, so we are not talking of any undue burden. Take the example of Meath County Council, which is a reasonably large county council with 29 seats. We are probably talking here in terms of 50 candidates or so. It is much simpler, cheaper and more effective to deal with that matter at a local level than having to deal with it in a huge, centralised public offices commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned the administration of all this. The position is that the declaration forms are already printed and will be available to local authorities. The guidelines have already been prepared and will be made available to local <Col N="941" /> authorities as soon as the Bill becomes law, but not before that for obvious reasons.</P>

      <P>I would say it is presumption in <Col N="942" /> this case. The administrative burden the Deputy talked about is being dealt with in the Department at the moment. I do not anticipate a huge administrative burden being placed on any local authority as a result of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 3 to 9, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Every regulation proposed to be made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall come into operation on such date after its passing as shall be specified in the proposal.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an old hobby horse of mine. Every time I see a provision in a Bill in the form taken by section 3, I ask why. This is the lazy person's way of making regulations. It is a lazy Minister's and a lazy Government's way of making regulations. There is another way of making regulations which requires the positive assent of the Houses of the Oireachtas and when issues of importance are being dealt with we should take that route. Having said that, I tabled this amendment partly to find out what is covered by section 3. It may be that I have not subjected the Bill to a sufficiently forensic examination but as far as I can see the Minister will certainly be required to make regulations on matters arising in sections 6, 13 and 24. I do not know if there are others.</P>
      <P>Section 3(1) is also a little unusual in that it provides that the Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in this Act as prescribed. The things the Act prescribes, it seems to me, are things the Minister prescribes in local authorities. He is to prescribe confident local authorities. He is to prescribe forms of statutory declarations and statements and the Minister must make some prescriptions in connection with research into electronic methods of voting. I very much regret that on both occasions when the Minister organised demonstrations of the method he is examining for electronic voting I was unable to attend, due to other commitments. Can the Minister tell me what matters or things he will be prescribing so that I can judge whether they are of sufficient importance to warrant the application of a different form of regulation under section 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of Deputy Dukes's amendment, I wish to know where section 3(2) will leave us with regard to the forthcoming local elections. The Minister told us earlier that this legislation will have effect for the local elections. He indicated earlier that preparations have been made in his Department for making regulations and drafting the necessary forms, circulars and guidelines. Section 3 provides for a manner in which regulations may be introduced and annulled. It provides that regulations may be introduced and lays down the standard 21 sitting days within which the Oireachtas may annul the regulations. If this legislation is to be used in the <Col N="944" /> forthcoming local elections there are not 21 sitting days within which the annullment procedure may be activated. The Minister appears to have anticipated this difficulty because the section states that this is without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder. An odd procedure has been established. The Minister is proposing that the legislation will allow him to make regulations and provide the Oireachtas with the standard 21 days safeguard for the annullment of those regulations but there are not 21 days between now and the local elections when the legislation will have effect. The section then states that, even if the regulations are annulled anything already done under them will be valid. This undermines the purpose of the 21 day period and provides a reason for adopting Deputy Dukes's amendment by which the regulation would be given effect by a Vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Is section 3(2) constitutional? Is it constitutional to provide in primary legislation for a means of dealing with secondary legislation which cannot be activated in practice and which, in any event, allows things to be done which need not comply with the terms of the legislation and the procedures laid down by it? I wonder if this provision is constitutional and I hope the Minister will address this question.</P>
      <P>The best way to deal with this matter is that proposed by Deputy Dukes, that is, by bringing the regulations into effect by a Vote of the Oireachtas. The method proposed by the Minister could lead to a constitutional difficulty. If, after the coming elections, a candidate is disqualified from a local authority and decides to challenge the disqualification in the courts, such candidate might argue that his constitutional rights are being denied because the legislature did not have the period of time laid down in the legislation for the annullment of any regulation, available to it. For example, the regulations will prescribe the way in which declarations are to be made. This is not an abstract point but one which may become an issue in litigation when the legislation has been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations referred to are those prescribing the forms for making declarations of election expenses; section 25 contains an order for obtaining ballot papers and for their retention and destruction and under section 2(11) an order must be made in connection with Dublin Corporation. The only matters prescribed in the Bill are the two forms to be used for furnishing election expenses statements to local authorities. They are being prescribed by legislation in case changes are necessary in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note what Deputy Dukes has said. In opposition I had the same view of statements being put into legislation regarding regulations with no stipulation that regulations should come before the House. The Deputy will agree that it is not necessary to bring every regulation before the House. The regulations referred to here relate to <Col N="945" /> two simple and straightforward forms. When the Deputy sees those forms I am sure he will agree it would not be a productive use of the Houses' time to debate these draft regulations in detail. The forms required by the Electoral Act, 1997, which Deputies may consider deal with more serious matters, did not come before the Houses for discussion. The forms are not included in the Bill and it is not considered necessary that they should. I share the Deputy's view that, in general terms, regulations should come before the House, particularly where serious matters are involved. Deputy Dukes has waged this campaign for a long time and when I was on his side of the House I waged it too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says. I was right about the context in which these regulations are to be made. As a matter of course I dislike the form of regulation provided for in the Bill. The form of regulation requires the Government to lay the regulations before the Houses and unless the Houses of the Oireachtas have had notice of the regulation within 21 sitting days, they continue in force. Even if the Houses annul the regulations within 21 sitting days nothing previously done under those regulations can be challenged.</P>
      <P>This presents the difficulty that the Government need only put the regulations on the Order Paper and simply not provide any time for any one of those 21 sitting days to debate them. Once, in my experience, we objected to the form of a regulation but were obliged to put down a motion in Private Members' time to annul the regulation. That is entirely unsatisfactory. This is not a matter we can concern ourselves with here but somewhere in our parliamentary procedures we should have a provision which allows the House parliamentary time to discuss regulations which they consider objectionable. I see its usefulness and that it would not always be desirable or necessary to debate the regulations in the House. However, there should be a procedure where the House, especially the Opposition, has access as of right to parliamentary time in the event that it considers there is something in a regulation of this kind that is objectionable. It is a lack in our system. It is not very important but it could happen from time to time that important regulations would be passed in this way without the House having had a say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of what the Deputy has said. This may be an unpopular suggestion but perhaps chairpersons of the Oireachtas committees could give consideration to the possibility that there be an automatic right to raise regulations for debate. If a minimum <Col N="946" /> number of committee members sought such debates they would not be dependent on Government time. Such a mechanism might be worthwhile. Perhaps the Deputy would pursue it. I will pursue it with the Chief Whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If candidates fail to make returns within the specified period of time of seven days they are automatically disqualified. If a councillor makes a false return or declaration the matter would be prosecuted in the courts, probably under the statutory declaration legislation. The local authority would prosecute. A constitutional challenge would be made to the primary legislation, not the regulations, which apply to the forms and the other matters I mentioned. While we do not know what might happen if proceedings go to court, they would not fall because the regulations were not before the House for 21 days.</P>

      <P>In page 6, before section 6, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;(1) No candidate at a local election covered by this Act may incur election expenses in excess of £3,000, or such other amount as may be determined from time to time by regulation under this Act.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (7) deals with third parties. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that a third party, for example a residents' association which draws to the attention of the public in its area the position of a certain candidate on an issue it has raised over a two or three year period will have to obtain a certificate from the local authority concerned when this legislation comes into effect? Who will implement and police this provision? What is the thinking behind it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the Seanad, these provisions mirror the provisions in the Electoral Act which were inserted after a long discussion about how third parties might interfere with an election campaign. Members are required to disclose donations and expenditure which is subject to limits. There was a concern that a third party with a gripe or at the behest of another candidate, clandestinely, would be able to expend money willy nilly to defeat a candidate or, alternatively, that an organisation with a particular point of view such as the local chamber of commerce would be able to expend money willy nilly to have a candidate elected.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked who will police these provisions. That is a reasonable question. Every local elections candidate will be conscious of these provisions and will bring any breaches to the attention of the appropriate authorities. It will be in his or own interests to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>After they have lost their seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>They will bring any breaches to the attention of the appropriate authorities as soon as they become aware of them. Knowing the skilful use that can be made of situations like this by some, I have no doubt that they would make it public that there is a plot to undermine their candidacy. It is right that this Bill should contain these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most would agree that those who stand for election are entitled to respect. A third party whose only ambition is to be negative against a <Col N="950" /> particular candidate or candidates or party should not be allowed to attack that candidate or candidates or party willy nilly. He should be required to register and be subject to the same constraints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue raised by Deputy Hayes, if a residents' association or community body decides to inform the public in its newsletter that particular councillors voted in favour of the rezoning of a controversial site in the last review of the development plan and that it should support those councillors who opposed the rezoning in the local elections, will this have to be declared? Is that contemplated by this provision? Will they have to declare that? </P>
      <P>If, as has happened, a residents' association or another group wants to give some information or direction to its members on for whom they should vote in the local elections and it circulates literature saying a candidate or a number of candidates have been particularly helpful to the association in recent years and asking people to vote for them in the forthcoming local elections and if, for example, they found other candidates were not helpful or took a position with which they did not agree, and actively discouraged people from voting for them, is that included in this legislation? Will they have to declare that?</P>
      <P>The provision regarding opinion polls states that expenditure on &ldquo;opinion polls or similar surveys relating to an election within the period of 60 days before polling day at the election by or on behalf of a political party or one or more candidates at the election&rdquo; will have to declared. In recent weeks, I have heard of many opinion polls on the local elections which have been conducted&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;by individuals or parties. What is the procedure whereby the existence of the opinion polls may be validated? What is the procedure by which the cost of the opinion poll may be established? Any time I have seen the results of many of these opinion polls, they have usually been written on the backs of envelopes late at night in a public house. I have not ever been able to see the raw data or the original report, so I am curious to know how the existence, validity and the cost of these opinion polls will be established for the purpose of this legislation. Every opinion poll which has been conducted over the past two months is in the net as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this legislation will not be retrospective, so it does not apply to anybody who carried out an opinion poll before its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It does apply to them. It says 60 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be retrospective. It says 60 days but that will apply only from the time <Col N="951" /> the Act becomes law. This is an import from the 1997 Electoral Act and I cannot answer any of the Deputy's question in that regard. He might ask his colleague, Deputy Howlin, about how it might be done. A national opinion poll for Dáil elections would probably be easier to police, but I cannot answer his question in relation to local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. People have some experience of that.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's first question, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Any expenditure incurred by an individual, group or association for electoral purposes would be deemed to be expenditure under this Bill. A person should be registered and should make declarations to the local authority. This brings us back to the question of a letter from a residents' association to its members saying someone has been very helpful and asking them to please remember that, as opposed to a leaflet from a residents' association saying &ldquo;vote number one for Eamon Gilmore&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there would be some interesting court cases about something such as that. A strict interpretation of the legislation means that it is necessary for a person who intends to undertake any expenditure to register and make themselves amenable to section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comment on whether the legislation may be applied retrospectively. Does that mean any expenditure incurred by candidates or political parties up to the passing of this Bill in respect of the local elections will not have to be declared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, which is exactly the same as happened with the 1997 Electoral Act. If one had one's money spent, as most parties did, prior to the passing of the Act on 26 May or whenever, it was not declarable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This makes a nonsense of the legislation for the purposes of the forthcoming local elections; it is a fig leaf, if the Minister is saying that as long as the bills are paid and the cheques are written before the President signs this legislation into law, it is not covered. It is making a total nonsense of its application for the local elections. We will end up with declarations <Col N="952" /> of expenditure which are meaningless. People who incur their expenditure after the date will have to declare it, but those who are clever enough to incur the expenditure before the enactment of the legislation will not have to do so. It will make a nonsense of the declaration process and will make it meaningless. It is even worse than we thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is what Deputy Gilmore said correct? Is it true that if one buys leaflets, posters and the other paraphernalia attached to elections before the Bill becomes law, it will not have to be declared in the statement? I understood from reading the Bill that even if one purchased all the election material for the three or four week election campaign, one would still have to declare it? We need to be absolutely clear about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only a layman in relation to law. This legislation can have no effect in the period before its enactment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, irrespective of when the literature is distributed and whether it has been paid for and so on. To answer Deputy Hayes' point, once this legislation in is place &ndash; for example, for the next local elections, as with the 1997 Electoral Act, the rules will apply in that if one buys one's election material six months prior to the local election, it will be declarable. The situation is as it was for donations prior to the general election under the Electoral Act. The Bill only becomes effective when it is signed into law by the President. Anything paid for post the passing of the Bill is covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Seán Ryan on introducing the Bill because the problem it addresses is one from which I am sure every constituency suffers and from which I know mine does. There are many unfinished estates which are the bugbears of residents who find themselves living in them for three or four years &ndash; the longest of which I know in my constituency is 17 years, but I am sure there is longer &ndash; without roads, footpaths or lighting. They live in what they consider to be building sites and they are frustrated that the powers that be, the corporation, county council or whatever, cannot seem to ensure the work is completed. The Bill proposes that developers should not be given planning permission in respect of another housing estate or development until their previous development is completed to the satisfaction of the planning and regulatory authorities.</P>
      <P>It is too easy to build another 40 or 50 houses and leave behind small problems which residents must face daily. A housing estate in my constituency had a problem with roads which had to be resurfaced. The developer did not contribute to the cost of that work. It was organised between local politicians, corporation representatives, the corporation engineer and residents. The developer was responsible for it in the first place, but he chose to move on and leave behind a mess for others to sort out. One way of dealing with such problems would be to build into planning laws a provision whereby developers will not be allowed carry out further developments until the first is satisfactorily completed. I commend Deputy Ryan on his proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he would not accept the Bill, and two of the reasons he advanced were that the problem mainly exists in old estates and there was a limit to the extent to which the Bill can apply retrospectively. I can see his point, but we must make a start. Surely we have learned from our mistakes and the Bill is worth accepting as a provision with which to progress. I do not understand why the Minister of State cannot accept it. If he is concerned about the estates which have not been satisfactorily completed and have been left unfinished for many years, let us see some provisions to solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" />
      <Col N="956" /> The Bill provides for the levying of financial contributions on developers to enable planning authorities develop facilities in the area. There is a similar commendable provision in the Cork County Council region where £500 per house is levied to contribute to roads and footpaths. I have some reservations about that in that I do not believe it is confined to a specific area. However, funds collected locally should be reinvested locally and that is important in the context of the Bill. If a developer plans to build 100 or 200 houses on a greenfield site, he should contribute to services in the area and to the development of roads, footpaths and lighting. Too often houses are built and people move into them to find they have neither a footpath on which to walk to the shop or public lighting at night. These are people who spent a great deal of money on their houses.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Ryan on introducing the Bill. I am sorry the Minister is not prepared to accept it. I hope we will see some progress in this field which is difficult for many of us in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Deputy Ryan's Bill deals with unfinished estates. To a large extent, his Bill is somewhat similar in that, as the Minister pointed out last night, it is unfinished. Deputy Ryan seems to have acted hastily. Perhaps he was anxious to have it debated here before the local elections but it is unfortunate that he did not think it through. As Deputies pointed out last night, there are a number of flaws in it. At the same time we must commend Deputy Ryan for tabling the Bill and giving us an opportunity to debate it. If it helps to speed up a response from the Government, that is all the better.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a large increase in the demand for housing, particularly in areas bordering Dublin. For many years people had emigrated, but the reverse has been happening in recent years. Last year more than 40,000 people returned to Ireland. They all need housing and I suppose many of them make their way towards Dublin to try to find accommodation.</P>
      <P>There is a big demand for housing and this results in problems, but people are in such a hurry to buy houses that they are buying them before they are built. They are buying them in good faith and are given promises and pictures of how estates will look when they are finished. We have all seen this happen in our constituencies, where promises were made and the houses were built but the estates remain unfinished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> It is a difficult matter for local authorities to address. For instance, for a number of years there has been a serious problem in Kildare where the council was forced to take the builder to court. As Deputy Clune stated earlier, some of these estates are like a building sites. Everything which is not used or which is left over is dumped in a big heap. There are mounds of rubble and the area becomes a health hazard. It also devalues the properties which the people have just purchased.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister mentioned bonding and that is where the solution lies. If the developers are forced to put down a deposit before building commences and then the conditions of the planning permission are properly enforced, there is an incentive for all builders to ensure that the job is completed as promised and according to the conditions of the planning permission.</P>
    <P>The report of the strategy review of the construction industry was published in 1997. I know the forum is dealing with it at present but the problem is so serious that two years later we have made little or no progress. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Bill is brought before the House as quickly as possible. In the interests of providing a better environment and a better country, it is important that this Bill comes before the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate also. While, like Deputy Power, I would say that Deputy Ryan's Bill is seriously deficient, I welcome the opportunity of addressing the issues which he raised. The debate is timely. It will inform the debate on the planning and development consultation Bill which the Minister intends to introduce.</P>
      <P>Every constituency has its share of unfinished housing estates, many of which are small. The larger builders, to their credit, do a reasonably good job of finishing estates but in my constituency there has been a number of cases where proceedings, up to and including those of the High Court, have had to be entered into in order to get satisfaction and redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a small number of builders are fly-by-night operators but they bring the building industry into disrepute. As I mentioned, there was a particularly intractable case in my constituency where a builder constructed about 20 houses at Patrickswell Parade. He did not finish the estate, he left the roads unfinished and did not construct footpaths. He did not undertake any open space treatment either. The company went into liquidation and left an inadequate bond to complete the work. Dublin Corporation had to find funds to do it. In the meantime it pursued him through the courts and it was only on the steps of the High Court that the matter was ultimately resolved to reasonable satisfaction. Then another development was undertaken about 300 yards up the road by a different company involving the same personnel. That is a matter which needs to be addressed in any review of the planning Acts. <Col N="958" /> Manipulation of the companies legislation is rampant in some parts of the building industry. The Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Home Builders' Association have a role to play in that. There should be a registration scheme for contractors in the building industry to ensure consumer protection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the bond scheme, the size of bonds set by local authorities is entirely unrealistic. In some cases they are cash bonds and in other cases they are insurance bonds. Often the bonds do not take into account the possible legal costs which may be incurred in trying to enforce the planning conditions.</P>
    <P>I have always been critical of local authorities for the inadequate enforcement of planning conditions. Resources should be made available to local authorities to provide more staff to enforce planning conditions if necessary. The conditions of planning permission ought to be much more specific, more readily available and more widely understood. They should be written in clear and unambiguous language.</P>
    <P>In Dublin I notice a trend, which I do not like, where management companies are being formed for small housing estates of ten or 15 houses. Often buyers of houses in such estates do not know and have not been informed by their solicitors that it is intended that a management company must be formed. This means that the estate will not be taken in charge by the local authority except in the case of an unfinished estate, such as one with which my colleagues and I are involved where Dublin Corporation must bail out the builder. It will have to put down new drains, bring the public lighting system up to a satisfactory standard, arrange for the grass-cutting and maintain the footpaths. This was not what the buyers thought they were purchasing.</P>
    <P>Section 39 of the planning Act, where the roads, open spaces, public lighting, etc., are put in place before the building takes places, should be invoked more often.</P>
    <P>Solicitors ought to make purchasers of houses aware of the detail of the planning permission for the estate. They should be aware of whether laneways will be closed off, the standard of footpaths to be made available and the extent of the open space to be provided. All of that needs to be teased out. That would pre-empt the situation where a shared ownership purchaser &ndash; one would have thought the local authority would have been a little more careful &ndash; of whom I am aware is stuck with a management company and cannot get out of it. The legal profession is answerable in that case.</P>
    <P>No individual, group or local authority should have to end up on the steps of the courts to resolve the issues of unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Minister take the lead in this matter of unfinished estates. He should set aside money from the local authority fund currently being set up to allow local authorities to draw down funding which they should <Col N="959" /> then match to enable them to take existing housing estates in charge. A time limit should be imposed to allow this work to be done. The Minister should also enter into discussions with the construction industry and ask its members to contribute to this fund as past difficulties were caused by some of its developers. I hope the departmental officials and the Minister of State will return to the Department with these proposals.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that estates should come under the remit of local authorities, it should be a condition of sale that all house purchasers of private residential houses should be part of a management company in which they should have shares. If one considers the service charges which must be paid annually and the services provided for those charges, the time is fast approaching for the residents of new housing estates to contribute to their upkeep. More and more local authorities do not have the resources required for the normal maintenance of housing estates and less and less services will be provided.</P>
      <P>I want to share a terrible experience I had with Cork Corporation and Cork County Council as a result of the inadequate controls and bonding put in place. I am happy to report that this is no longer the case. Two estates in my constituency, 21 and 15 years old respectively, have not been taken in charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork County Council has abdicated its responsibilities in regard to these estates. In 1994, Cork Corporation bit the bullet and put £250,000 into a fund to enable it to take in charge estates, which were not adequately bonded or policed by the local authorities. At long last, Cork County Council has engaged consultants to consider the number of estates which have not been taken in charge over a long period. I am very upset with the council and strongly criticise it for the way it has dragged its feet on this issue for many decades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The builders have either gone into liquidation, ceased trading or flown the coop. The local authority, when granting planning permission, set out a number of planning conditions including criteria to ensure adequate bonding. Until 1994, Cork County Council did not observe those. I hope the Minister will take on board my proposals when the new Bill is being introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of unfinished estates and planning must be dealt with in a more comprehensive manner than the one being <Col N="960" /> advanced through this Bill. Much of this could be done through the current planning process if some adjustments were made to it.</P>
      <P>There is currently a huge increase in the level of planning applications to local authorities. Contractors are providing houses but are failing to complete estates as they move along. Therefore, huge demands are being placed on local authority staff to police the various conditions attached to planning permissions. If we are to take these changes into consideration, comprehensive legislation is required and additional staff from a variety of disciplines is required within planning authorities. Most planning authorities are guided by engineers but there is a need for the involvement of architects and town planners in the process. I hope that change will be included in the new legislation.</P>
      <P>I would also like to see An Bord Pleanála overhauled as there are inconsistencies in the manner in which appeals and inspectors' reports are dealt with. I have seen cases in Kilkenny where inspectors' reports recommend that planning applications be refused, refusals are approved by the local authority engineer but one member of the board overturns the report. That is wrong; it harms the planning process and causes serious public concern. The matter will have to be rectified by legislation. Recently, a 20 page report was produced in Kilkenny by a Bord Pleanála inspector recommending the refusal of a planning application. A one page report from a board member granted permission. Under the Freedom of Information Act, we can now access these documents. Such instances reveal inconsistency in the system and cause public disquiet. There is a need to police all of the conditions laid down by An Bord Pleanála and local authorities. That is not happening at the moment because sufficient staff are not available in local authorities to deal with breaches of planning permissions.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála must acknowledge county development plans where these exist. Until now, it has almost been able to ignore the wishes of local communities and authorities. Planning permissions have been granted which run contrary to county development plans. There is a need to overhaul the planning system to make it reflect new developments in local authorities and planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a comprehensive subject and while the subject matter tonight is quite narrow in its focus, the debate affords us an opportunity to consider the broader issue of housing supply and demand. There is no arguing with the sentiments expressed by the majority of Members. There have been some very bad experiences in relation to unfinished estates throughout the country, some of which relate to the inadequacy of bonding arrangements. Many local authorities are endeavouring to find solutions to the problems created as a result of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House prices are escalating. There is a huge demand for houses because of the buoyancy in <Col N="961" /> our economy, with people wishing to buy or build their own homes. Supply is inadequate to meet current demands.</P>
    <P>In some older housing schemes, as few as one or two elderly people live in two storey, three bedroom houses. I came across a number of cases in my constituency in County Louth where people suffering from arthritis or various disabilities were simply unable to utilise upstairs facilities because of their conditions. If we evaluate those houses as part of the national housing stock, we discover they are being seriously under-utilised. Finding a formula to release these type of houses while at the same time providing more suitable accommodation for elderly people is a real challenge. It is a challenge the Minister and the officials in his Department should attempt to meet when there are such difficulties with supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Care of the elderly is expensive for the Exchequer. If we can accommodate the elderly in suitable, custom built housing accommodation, the back-up services could support greater numbers of them. There would be a net saving to the economy and better services and care for the elderly involved.</P>
    <P>With the culture of home ownership in this State, how can we release those houses in which one elderly person lives? There could be between 25,000 and 30,000 such houses across the State. If they could be made available for rehousing purposes, even for one or two years, perhaps for those who are in the priority category on local authority housing lists, and we were in a position to build suitable alternative accommodation for the elderly, it could have a significant impact on the problem.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting there are any ready made formulas we can bring to bear on the problem. The new planning and development Bill will be introduced later this year, giving an opportunity for innovative thinking on our housing strategy. Many of the tried and tested formulas of previous years may have to be looked at closely. We must ask ourselves if they are suitable to deal with significant increase in demand. The reality is that people on low and middle incomes will not be able to purchase houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. As a local public representative for the past 25 years, I am unfortunately very familiar with the problems which unfinished estates can present, not only to residents but to those providing services to them. I strongly condemn the actions of builders who leave estates unfinished.</P>
      <P>I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Dempsey, on the new planning reform Bill which will soon come before the House. I am glad it will contain measures to deal with the problem in older estates. Deputy Ryan's Bill does not address this area and the worst problems are often encountered in these estates, although some of the newer estates also have serious problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Ireland has one of the highest levels of home ownership in Europe. This reflects the high value people place on owning their own homes. People who purchase houses in estates are entitled to have the necessary infrastructure of roads, footpaths, lighting, open spaces, sewerage and other services provided as part of their contract. In the past a minority of contractors failed to provide home owners with proper and safe surroundings. Unfinished areas have often become a nightmare for young people trying to raise a family or householders going about their daily duties.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has always been an important part of the economy. As in every other sector, however, a small number of contractors reneged on their duties. They have done the industry no favours with their less than favourable actions. Any builder who fails to finish an estate properly should not be eligible to register with HomeBond.</P>
    <P>The problem of unfinished estates requires a comprehensive review of the planning legislation. The necessary conditions and their enforcement must become part of the planning permission procurement process. The concerns addressed by Deputy Ryan are being addressed by Deputy Dempsey's Bill. It is at an advanced stage and will ensure planning systems will provide this State with effective solutions to problems related to unfinished estates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, spoke on this Bill last night, he explained to the House that this Government strongly condemns those builders who fail in their duty to customers to ensure that housing estates are fully completed in accordance with planning permission. I sympathise with Deputy Ryan's objective but, listening to the debate, I suspect the reintroduction of this Bill has more to do with political opportunism before the local elections than with the issue of unfinished estates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that I will introduce a comprehensive planning and development Bill to the Dáil this summer which will contain major reforms to the planning system. The Bill will also consolidate all planning legislation in one enactment. Specifically the Bill will address the issues raised yesterday and today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to a previous debate on an earlier version of Deputy Ryan's Bill which was introduced in the Seanad in November 1997 where I promised to bring forward new planning legislation. That legislation was promised in the context of the review which I had then initiated and the National Planning Convention, which was shortly to take place. My Department spent the months following that review appraising the <Col N="963" /> issues raised before preparing draft legislation for the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes questioned the Government's commitment to the introduction of a Bill. Deputy Hayes is well aware that, following the review, the Government approved the drafting of a planning and development Bill in January, and I have promised on more than one occasion that the Bill will be before the House this summer. This Bill is not being left on the back burner it is a priority for the Government and has been accorded that status in its drafting. It will be a major Bill which will deal with complex issues. It is vital that we strike the right balance so the economy can continue to prosper and the environment and our quality of life is protected. It is a major achievement that I will bring forward such an important Bill so soon in the lifetime of a Government &ndash; within the second anniversary of coming to office. The Government does not propose to deal with planning or unfinished estates in a piecemeal fashion but to put forward comprehensive legislation which will last the test of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to the issue of constitutionality as &ldquo;hogwash&rdquo;. It is not respectful for a Member of this House to refer to the Constitution as &ldquo;hogwash&rdquo;. It was explained last night that there are serious issues to be considered. Deputy Ryan's Bill could result in the brother or sister of a rogue developer being held accountable for the developer's past failure. The Government cannot act irresponsibly in putting forward legislation.</P>

      <P>The question has to be dealt with in a comprehensive manner. The bonding system was raised by some Deputies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, who is not involved in any way in that association, should take the opportunity for the new beginning we heard so much about and break that connection. We are also now dealing with a new breed of builder who rides roughshod over the rights not only of their own workers &ndash; we are conscious of the high rate of deaths among workers in the building trade &ndash; but over the rights of residents in the area in which they operate and the residents who buy the houses from them. In one instance I know of in Kildare, the contractor, a new arrival from Dublin who is well known to the Minister's party, has insisted that the people buying his houses join a management company. They rip off about £70,000 per year from the residents for cutting the grass; that was part of their house contract. In that contract they were also obliged to sign an undertaking that they would not object to any future development. I would like to see that tested in the courts. These are people who take profits of approximately £50,000 per unit on the backs of young families. They can afford to build safely and without disruption and they can afford to complete their estates and still take a good profit.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the debate colleagues mentioned that only a minority of builders were involved in this practice. My experience is that a majority of builders are involved in the problem of leaving estates unfinished. They ignore the rules and the law by dragging dirt onto the public roads from their sites when they should be prosecuted for doing so. They have no regard for trees, shrubs, hedges or adjoining property.</P>
      <P>The planning section in my own council has been engaged in industrial action for the past six months because of the level of staffing. It is staffed at the same level as a county like Roscommon, where there is no major development. It has never caught up with the boom in development so all it can do is barely deal with the applications, so enforcement is non-existent. The builders have now realised that the level of bonds allowable by the planning appeals board is low and, arising from that, they leave work to be done to perhaps ten times the value.</P>
      <P>In Kildare, there are 5,842 houses in 103 estates where the work has stopped, the houses are sold, the building is complete, the builders have made their profit but the houses are incomplete. Some of these housing estates are 25 years old and the builders are daily moving from one site to another and leaving the same type of mess behind. Another 2,738 houses in 54 estates are currently under construction and they can look forward to the same fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is happening because it pays greedy developers not to finish estates. There is no sanction on <Col N="965" /> them except the bond and the bond is regularly appealed to An Bord Pleanála which reduces it. It now pays builders to leave estates unfinished and move on to pastures new. One of the complications arising from that is that good builders cannot compete with these cowboys who are getting extra profits by not finishing estates.</P>
    <P>We can put a stop to this widespread practice by accepting the Bill. The Bill is simple but it is effective.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but the fact is that the close affinity Deputy Stagg adverted to between Fianna Fáil, the builders' party, and some builders is the cause of this problem. The Minister should talk to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, about any of the estates in my constituency constructed by Brennan &amp; McGowan. Twenty years later there are no footpaths or public lighting. If the market suffered a relapse houses were half-built, vandalised and left lying there. That is the pattern across my constituency. The county council tries to deal with the problem by creating an enormous backlog of estates to be taken in charge. The county manager contrives not to take them in charge because if he does, there is the imposition of additional cost to him that he cannot meet. The estates, therefore, are left in this half-finished condition.</P>
      <P>The only reason this House has not passed a law to require and make builders amenable is because of the close relationship that has traditionally existed&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to think it is improper of Deputy Ryan to bring a Bill into this House because there are local elections pending. What else would he do? This is a local election issue. Tens of thousands of my constituents live in estates that have been pockmarked by builders who marched off, did a deal with the county manager to get planning permission for additional lands, constructed houses on them and did not go back to the original estates.

      <P>We are entitled to ask questions as to why the Government has refused to accept the Bill. It is legitimate and it is certainly an issue the people will raise with us when we knock on their doors. Why has the Government refused to accept the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been complaints for a long time regarding unfinished estates. No councillors have been more vociferous than Fianna Fáil members for continually berating local authority officials <Col N="967" /> for not dealing with the issue of estates which have not been taken in charge. Why is a Fianna Fáil Minister not doing something about this?</P>
    <P>Having worked in the Department I have great confidence in the capability of officials to deal with deficiencies in the Bill. Why is the Bill not being accepted, particularly when the debate is taking place against a background of investigations into the most unsavoury links between Fianna Fáil and developers? If anything, this should galvanise a Fianna Fáil Minister, whose integrity I trust, to show by example that he will face down what is being done by developers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the consolidation planning Bill will be before the House soon. I have difficulty with terms such as &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, used by the Taoiseach, and &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;. It is clear that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister can guarantee that they will be in Government in the near future, let alone that they can deliver a planning Bill, welcome as it would be.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach was shamed into accepting a Labour Party Private Members' Bill from Deputy O'Sullivan with regard to statutes of limitations. It can be done &ndash; the Minister has a choice as to whether to deal with this issue seriously or whether to reject it and continue regardless.</P>
    <P>This morning the Government was shamed because of recent revelations by excellent television programmes. However, there is a shamelessness concerning this Bill. The Minister is trying to browbeat and attack the Opposition for a failure on his part. Why is this Bill being rejected when elections are pending? Is it because Fianna Fáil candidates are expecting developers and builders to bankroll their campaigns? Reform on the never-never is very reassuring for developers who are making enormous profits out of housing.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Government to simply reject this Bill because it is deficient. Of course there are deficiencies. We are limited in what we can put forward but the Minister knows that the Bill is basically sound. It is a disgrace that he is adopting a cavalier approach when he has the option to take it on board at a time when voters are cynical about the power of the political system to deliver their needs.</P>
    <P>Many people are still living in estates which have been unfinished for 18 or 20 years. It is not just that people are living in unfinished estates, they are also being denied basic infrastructural services such as gas because of difficulties with builders. An estate in Greystones is being denied gas because the builder has not given permission and the estate has not been taken in charge.</P>
    <P>I have a litany of unfinished estates in County Wicklow, some of which have spectacularly awful histories. I will not go into that now but the rejection of the Bill will be noted by the public which is more aware of the nature of Fianna Fáil's connections with the building industry and rogue builders. People understand what is happening by <Col N="968" /> the Government rejecting this Bill. We do not need to tell people what is happening, but when asked we will have to explain that the Labour Party put forward a Bill to deal with a long standing problem which has constantly been asked for by Fianna Fáil councillors who blame everyone but themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is inadequate, unconstitutional and would let rogue builders carry on merrily.</P>

      <P>I thank the Labour Party Deputies for sharing time with me and Deputy Mitchell. I congratulate Deputy Seán Ryan on this Bill. Every Member who has canvassed for the local elections in the past fortnight will have been lambasted in new and old estates about this problem. It was unfair of previous speakers to lambast local authorities for their failure to take over these estates. It is popular to say this because local authorities are the only people to whom people can turn their attention. However, it is an unfair accusation as local authorities should not have to bale out builders for their inadequacies and dishonesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>They should enforce the planning regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I will come to that point. Many builders set out to break every planning rule and regulation. Fifteen years ago in Loughrea a builder submitted a fine plan for an estate of 18 houses. He completed three quarters of the scheme. However, an opportunity had been lurking which he eventually took and he decided to move one or two houses, giving himself additional space. He reapplied for further planning permission on what was initially supposed to be an open space. Permission was refused so he pulled out and disappeared. This builder subsequently changed his name and continued on his merry way.</P>
      <P>This practice has to be stopped. It has been highlighted by Deputy Ryan in the three elements he mentioned concerning builders' records. I welcome the Bill's proposal that builders who have not completed work according to the plan submitted should not receive further planning permission, under any name or disguise, unless they fulfil their obligations. I know of a man who tried to sell his house on the end site of the estate in Loughrea. He cannot do so because the house was not correctly sited. The building societies and lawyers will not allow him to sell the house. The man's heart is broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must urgently tackle inconsistencies between local authorities with regard to certain categories of planning permission. In particular, we have to address the definition of high amenity &ndash; what is regarded as high amenity in one local authority area is not so in another. People living on one side of a county boundary, such as those on the banks of Lough Derg, look with envy on <Col N="969" /> those who received planning permission in another county in an area which seems equal to their own in terms of high amenity. I am not being alarmist but it seems easier for non-nationals to obtain planning permission than for a resident or landowner who has a son, daughter or relative who wishes to settle in the area.</P>
    <P>There may not be a reluctance on the part of the Minister, but the Government is reluctant to tackle this problem because of Fianna Fáil's traditional affinity with the building industry. Some builders will buy every patch of land possible when Fianna Fáil is in power because they know they can develop the land and go forward.</P>

      <P>I thank my Labour colleague for sharing his time. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because is raises issues that anybody who has ever been a member of a local authority has to deal with on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The first issue it addresses is the notion of making future planning permissions conditional on past compliance which is intuitively a sensible one. I would not say that the Constitution is hogwash, but equally I would not say that just because something is unconstitutional it is not sensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole business of unfinished estates has caused grief to councillors and absolute misery to residents. I stress that a minority of builders and developers at fault. We all know who they are, and many councillors feel their hearts sink when they see some planning permissions going through because they know for sure that there will be trouble in the future. We have seen county councils over the years trying to follow up and ensure compliance and going through a tortuous legal process. Finally, if they have success in cashing in a bond, by the time it is cashed in it is wholly inadequate for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standards are rising. The problem of non-compliant builders is not as common as it was. That does not mean it will not present a real problem in the future, particularly in the context of the housing crisis and the rush to provide additional housing. The rush of builders to cash in on high prices at the moment may well result in a drop in standards in finishing off estates. The move to higher densities will, as the Minister has admitted, require higher and different standards of finish which will be critical to the success of <Col N="970" /> implementing the strategic planning guidelines and the higher density planning guidelines. Developers may regard these as unimportant and there may be a real problem in enforcement.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister put his finger on the nub of the problem which is appropriate conditions which are properly enforced, and proper enforcement is the key aspect. It is critical to the success of solving the housing crisis. I want the Minister to listen very carefully to what I have to say. In Dublin the county councils do not have the staffing resources to enforce conditions, to follow them up or to take the tortuous legal road to getting bonds cashed in. There is a real bottleneck in economic progress occasioned by the inability of Dublin local authorities to keep or attract staff. Professional staff, engineers, planners, IT staff are all going to the higher-paid private sector or to local authorities outside Dublin where housing costs are much lower and there is much less work to do.</P>
    <P>In my local authority we have the same number of staff in the planning department as we had four years ago, and the number of planning applications has gone up by 60 per cent. It is not just the number of planning applications. They are bigger, more complex, more time-consuming and more technical. That is before getting to the stage of enforcement. We had a complement of 70 engineers three years ago. Now we have 40 engineers, and there has been a huge explosion in the amount of work. There is one thing the Minister can do to solve this problem quickly and that is to change the system in the Local Appointments Commission whereby people who are offered a job have six months to decide whether or not to take it and on the last day may decide not to take the job which is then offered to the next person on the panel who has another six months to decide. One cannot run a business like that. Real money is being lost. Jobs are being lost in the private sector. Jobs are being done badly in the public sector or the wrong jobs are being done. We are not optimising value for money at the moment.</P>
    <P>The final issue is that of contributions. If the Minister is not accepting this Bill I ask him to look at this in the context of his own Bill. Contributions for roads, water and sewerage are appropriate in certain circumstances. However, in some circumstances they are not, particularly in the context of the new guidelines whereby we are to consolidate the metropolitan area. We may not need capital investment, but we do need public transport and community facilities. Let the local authority request contributions as appropriate without necessarily raising the cost of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, 12 months ago I asked each of the local authorities to have a look at their staffing and planning offices and to make submissions to the Department for the extra staff they needed. I appreciate the problem the Deputy mentioned. There is a <Col N="971" /> fairly open policy in relation to getting staff. I will have a look at the six months leeway as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating Deputy Seán Ryan on bringing this very important Bill before the House. It seeks to do three things. First, it seeks to deal effectively with builders who leave housing estates unfinished, and allow local authorities to take into account the track record of a builder or developer before future planning permission is granted. Second, it seeks to provide some protection for the home-buyer against the failure of builders to complete housing estates, a matter that is particularly important now, given the hugely escalated prices home-buyers have to pay for their homes. Third, it seeks to amend the planning law to widen the circumstances in which a local authority may require a developer to contribute to community facilities. This is a Bill which would be welcomed by home-buyers all over this country, by people who are living in housing estates that have not been properly finished, by residents' associations, and by the many people who have had to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to this Bill is pathetic. The response that the Minister of State gave yesterday and that the Minister gave again today is dripping with condemnation for builders who do not complete housing estates and full of sympathy for the people who have to live in them, but there is no sign of any effective action on the part of the Government to deal with the problem. We are told that this Bill cannot be accepted because there is a new planning and development Bill on the way. Incidentally, it is a Bill for which we have been waiting two years now and the Government still cannot meet the deadline of 11 June when that Bill would be tested by public opinion in the local elections. We are still promised it by mid-year. We are told that it will be a comprehensive Bill. Yesterday the Minister of State said &ldquo;In that Bill we will bring forward the Government's proposals for dealing with the problems arising from unfinished housing estates&rdquo;. He did not, however, tell us, even in general terms, what measures the Bill would contain to deal with the problem. We are left to wonder what it is the Government has in mind for dealing with the problem of unfinished housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the Government's position is revealed in the way in which the Minister responded to the individual provisions in Deputy Ryan's Bill. For example, the Minister of State told us that section 3 could not be accepted. This is the provision which simply requires that in making a planning application the applicant would have to submit information relating to his previous track record in completing housing estates. He said that this needs to be carefully considered. If the Government is preparing a planning and development Bill which we are told is comprehensive and is about to be published in mid-year, has this not already been considered? <Col N="972" /> If it has not, can we expect anything in the Bill to deal with this problem. On section 4, which provides that the local authority can take into account the track record of the planning applicant in granting planning permission, the Minister again tells us that there will be some measures in his Bill to deal with this but does not explain what exactly they will be. He dismisses section 5 on the grounds that there are complex legal and constitutional issues which will require further consideration.</P>
    <P>If, as we are told, the Government has prepared a Planning and Development Bill, which the Minister says will address the issue of unfinished housing estates, has it not already considered the constitutional and legal issues?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

The Constitution is being repeatedly used by the Government to protect the builder friends of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to private property is clearly qualified in the Constitution. There are two references to the right to private property in the Constitution. The first is that the right to private property, as expressed therein, does not prevent the Legislature from enacting legislation in the interests of social justice. Second, it explicitly states that the right to private property can be delimited in the interests of the common good. Is the Minister seriously saying that the right to private property or the right to ownership of a building site by a builder, who has already taken the money from some young house buyer but has not completed the estate, supersedes the common good? Which private property is the Minister defending? Is he defending private property that is owned by a builder who has not finished an estate or is he prepared to defend private property for which working couples spend their savings and borrow up to the hilt? </P>

      <P>I wish to thank everyone who contributed to the debate over the past two evenings, especially Members who spoke in support of this <Col N="974" /> very important legislation. I am particularly pleased that the author of the pending planning legislation that we have heard so much about, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has attended the debate for the past 45 minutes.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister of State said the Government is in favour of the Bill, in principle. However, he went on to say that it is a complex issue which needs to be addressed by experts. Furthermore, he stated that the Bill does not address the problems in older estates throughout the country. This is a cop-out and is a typical ploy used by a discredited Government to justify avoiding the issues and addressing the problems that exist throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The mechanism is available: accept the principle of the Bill, bring it to Committee Stage and make the necessary amendments, or incorporate it into the Minister's Planning and Development Bill, but let us deal with it. This would be the proper course of action and would be seen by the public, particularly at a time when politics is not held in high esteem, as politics at work, dealing with a festering problem on behalf of the people. The Minister has the opportunity of dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>The contributions to this debate from the Government benches were nothing more than crocodile tears. Perhaps I was expecting too much in hoping for a more imaginative and proactive approach from the Government on this occasion. Obviously, nothing has changed. The script read by the Minister of State yesterday had not changed one iota from that delivered by the Minister in the Seanad in November 1997. It was nearly the same, word for word.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was first published, I have received letters and telephone calls from different parts of the country wishing me well and supporting the Bill. Today, for example, I received a call from a resident in the Cartron Bay estate in Sligo. Those residents have had an ongoing problem with Cartron Bay Construction for the past 14 years. This is just one example. The builders in question have constructed five other estates but finished none of them.</P>
      <P>Throughout the years, Fianna Fáil was known as the party that looked after builders at local level. That view has been reinforced by statements emanating from the Flood Tribunal concerning contributions by big business, builders and developers. Those contributions will continue to be made to Fianna Fáil councillors during the local election campaign for services rendered. Is it any wonder the Minister has refused to put a cap on expenditure for candidates in the local elections? Irrespective of what the Minister and his backbenchers are saying, it is pay back time once again for builders and developers.</P>

The same people are being abused and blackguarded day in and day out by cowboy developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My original Bill was published in 1997. The current one has been amended to take into account the benefit of community planning on a <Col N="976" /> proactive basis. It has not been done under the counter as a carrot to provide rezonings, but on the basis of proper legislation to ensure that playing pitches and community buildings are provided for at the planning stage. At the time Mr. Michael O'Connor, a barrister, wrote in <i>The Bar Review</i> that despite the difficulties it is submitted that there is a good deal of merit in the proposed reforms, particularly in the present economic climate which has seen such high growth. He went on to say that the reforms proposed in the Bill may be a useful preventative measure to ensure that abandoned and incomplete developments are kept to a minimum. I rest my case and ask the Minister to take the brave decision at this late stage to accept this Bill in principle. Let us go forward together on behalf of the people.</P>

    <Title>Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to bring this Bill before the House. The Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999, is designed to introduce amendments in two areas of existing law, those relating to insider dealing and disclosure of interests in securities. These amendments are designed to bring Irish company law into line with international practice by permitting a mechanism known as price stabilisation to be used in connection with new issues or offers of securities on the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of the insider dealing legislation introduced in the Companies Act, 1990, is to prevent manipulation of the stock market. Such manipulation would impede the stock market from functioning as an independent pricing mechanism and undermines the integrity and fairness of the market. However, in the case of new issues or offers of securities on the stock market large volumes of a particular security may be released onto the market at one time. This may lead to large fluctuations in the price of the newly issued security in the immediate aftermath of the issue. Such volatility in the first few weeks after an issue is undesirable for all those involved, whether they be investors, the company or those selling the securities. Price stabilisation may be used to minimise this volatility, thus helping the price of the issued security to settle in a more orderly fashion.</P>
      <P>Although price stabilisation may appear to permit the type of manipulation which the insider dealing legislation is designed to prohibit, a closer examination shows that when appropriately regulated it is an effective mechanism for fostering a more orderly aftermarket for the new issues and offers of securities. The Bill strikes a balance between exempting stabilisation actions from the prohibition on insider dealing and laying down appropriate safeguards to ensure that the mechanism is only used as intended.</P>
      <P>Before going into the detail of the Bill I will briefly explain how a Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill has become necessary so soon. In February of this year, a Private Members' Bill was tabled by Deputy Rabbitte. That Companies (Amendment) Bill had as its sole objective the amendment of section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to the disclosure of information which becomes available as the result of investigations carried out by inspectors or officers appointed by the Minister under section 19 or section 20 of Part II of the Companies Act, 1990. That Bill has still to be discussed.</P>
      <P>In March of this year the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999, was published. That Bill deals primarily with amendments to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which introduced the process of examinership into Irish company law, the removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain small private limited companies and introduces a number of company law amendments as part of an overall package involving both company law and finance law to tackle the problems created by Irish registered non-resident companies. I hope that Bill will be brought before the Dáil for its Second Stage in the very near future.</P>
      <P>While the Company Law Review Group also made recommendations for a number of changes in the insider dealing provisions contained in Part V of the Companies Act 1990, because of the diversity of the areas examined by the group, the decision was taken early on to progress implementation of the recommendations on a phased basis. Work on the preparation of proposals to implement the changes recommended by the group to Part V has not yet been progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill arises in the context of the proposed flotation of Telecom Éireann. Given the size and importance of the proposed offering, the Government has decided that it would be appropriate that price stabilisation be available on the Irish Stock Exchange, which will be the principal market for the shares. Subject to certain rules and limitations price stabilisation is already permitted on the other two stock exchanges where it is proposed to list Telecom Éireann, namely London <Col N="979" /> and New York. It makes sense that if this mechanism is to be made available for the flotation that it be available on all three stock exchanges. Given that the flotation is planned to take place later this summer, there is an urgency in having the Bill enacted without delay.</P>
    <P>However, under the Bill the stabilisation mechanism will be available for all companies making issues or offers on the Irish Stock Exchange, be they private or state owned enterprises. It is equitable and desirable in the light of the increasingly global nature of the equity markets that those trading on the Irish Stock Exchange can avail of this mechanism, which has been permitted for a number years in many other countries and has become accepted practice for large issues of securities.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to the House if I were to outline the reason this legislation is needed to permit price stabilisation. Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, introduced into Irish law provisions to deal with the issue of insider dealing in relation to the securities of companies. Insider dealing occurs when people who are in possession of price sensitive information use that information to buy or sell shares to realise a gain or avert a loss. Thus, section 108 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides that it shall not be lawful for a person who is at any time connected with the company to deal in any securities of that company if by reason of his or her connection with the company he or she is in possession of information that is not generally available, but if it were would be likely materially to affect the price of those securities. The section goes on to prohibit people who indirectly obtain price sensitive information from dealing, as well as people seeking to have the dealing done by procuring other people to engage in the deal on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Chapter Two of Part IV of the Companies Act, 1990, deals with the disclosure of information in the shareholding of a company. In particular, a person who has an interest of 5 per cent or more of the share capital of the company has to disclose that information to the company. In addition, where as a result of buying or selling securities, the interest increases or decreases by one percentage point, that information has also to be disclosed.</P>
    <P>In the context of the public issuing or offering of securities, international practice permits those organising the issue or offer to engage in price stabilisation for a limited period after the issue or offer takes place. As already mentioned, the reason price stabilisation has been allowed in other jurisdictions is essentially to help the price of the security which has been issued or offered to settle in a more orderly fashion. However, as Irish law currently stands, such action would be in contravention of Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, prohibiting insider dealing if carried on within the State.</P>
    <P>The regulations made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1992, clarified that <Col N="980" /> stabilisation activity carried on outside the State, for example on the London, New York or Tokyo stock exchanges, could be carried on without breaching Part V of the 1990 Act. Accordingly, to permit price stabilisation in Ireland it is proposed in the Bill to provide an exemption from the insider dealing, and certain of the disclosure requirements in the Companies Act, 1990, but only for a limited period and only where certain criteria are met. In this respect the legislation is modelled on best international practice.</P>
    <P>In broad terms the rules and limitations that apply to stabilisation action are as follows: the fact that stabilisation may take place in a particular issue must be disclosed widely in the documentation relating to the issue, to ensure that potential investors are made aware of the fact; stabilisation is only permitted to stabilise or maintain the market price of a security and for no other purpose; stabilisation may only occur within a 30 day period after the allocation of the securities; the stabilisation manager may only purchase securities in the open market at the prevailing market price or the issue price, whichever is the lower; and the stabilisation manager must ensure that procedures are in place to keep an accurate and detailed record of any stabilisation transactions that take place and must disclose these records to the Irish Stock Exchange. These are the general requirements that must be met before stabilisation can be engaged in.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains seven sections and a Schedule containing the stabilisation rules, which must be observed by parties engaging in stabilisation activity. Section 1 contains the interpretation and definition of a number of terms that are used subsequently in the legislation. I draw attention to the definition of &ldquo;stabilising period&rdquo; and to the fact that it defines this period within the jurisdiction by reference to the stabilisation rules. The stabilising period for stabilising action outside of the jurisdiction is specifically defined in the definition. While the latter definition is similar to that applying within the jurisdiction, it is not identical, because the same control will not apply to stabilisation conducted outside of the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the main operative part of the Bill as regards exempting stabilising action from the prohibition contained in Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to insider dealing. Paragraph (a) exempts stabilising action conducted within the State for the purpose of stabilising or maintaining the market price of securities once it is done in conformity with stabilisation rules. Paragraph (b) on the other hand, exempts stabilising action undertaken outside the State, but only if the action taken is in all material respects permitted by or is otherwise in accordance with all relevant requirements, applicable to such actions in the jurisdiction where the stabilising action is undertaken, including, if the securities are listed on a stock exchange in the jurisdiction, the rules or other regulatory requirements governing that stock exchange.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Section 3 exempts acquisitions or disposals of interests in the relevant share capital of the company which is acquired by a person conducting stabilising actions during the stabilisation period from the disclosure requirements contained in sections 67 to 79 of the Companies Act, 1990. This exemption only lasts for the duration of the stabilising period. At the end of the stabilising period, if the person engaging in the stabilising actions on behalf of the party issuing or offering, still holds securities, then disclosure will have to be made in accordance with the relevant sections.</P>
    <P>The disclosure that is required by the relevant sections is a holding of 5 per cent or more of the share capital of the company in question. Where a person has such a holding, disclosure must be made to the company. Moreover, where a person holds more than 5 per cent and engages in purchases or sales of securities which result in a one percentage point change in the amount of securities held, that must also be disclosed to the company concerned.</P>
    <P>Chapter Two of Part IV of the Companies Act, 1990, also implemented an EU directive on the disclosure of major shareholdings. In this context where a shareholder crosses certain defined thresholds, that is where a holding moves between the threshold of 10 per cent, 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent, then disclosure must also be made to the competent authority, which in the case of Ireland is the Irish Stock Exchange. Section 3(3) provides that the obligations in respect of such disclosure will continue to apply even to the activities of any manager of an issue or offer of securities which is otherwise exempt from the earlier disclosure requirements described.</P>
    <P>With regard the background to section 4, in 1991, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce made regulations under section 121 of the Companies Act, 1990, to modify section 110 to facilitate the operation of Part V. Specifically, a number of clarifications were made in respect of the activities undertaken by underwriters in offerings and issues of securities. The opportunity is being taken in the Bill to revoke this statutory instrument and to replace it by the content of section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is designed to enable the Minister by regulation to make what would be termed minor adjustments to the stabilisation rules to remove any difficulty that may arise in their operation. Any such amendments would obviously be within the policies and principles in the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 revokes two statutory instruments which were made by the Minister of the day, and which I have already briefly referred to, on the basis that the present legislation effectively replaces them. Section 7 contains the Title, collective citation and arrangements for the commencement of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the legislation contains the stabilisation rules which must be observed by par<Col N="982" /> ties who wish to engage in stabilisation activity. Rule 1 contains a number of definitions which set out precisely what the terms mean within the rules. Of particular note are the definitions of &ldquo;introductory period&rdquo; and &ldquo;stabilising period&rdquo; which set the limits on the periods during which certain actions must or can be taken. Rule 2 defines the scope of application of the rules and the securities to which they apply. Essentially, any issue or offer of securities for cash which are not already dealt with on a stock exchange will be covered once arrangements are made for the securities in question to be listed on the exchange. In respect of an offer of securities for cash where the securities are already listed, the offer will have to be for at least £15 million. This is designed to ensure the exemption provided stabilising action is not used in normal sales of securities on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Rules 3 and 4 set out the action or ancillary action that may be taken by the stabilising manager and includes the purchase or sale of securities or associated securities. The stabilising manager has to be satisfied that he or she meets the other conditions set out in later rules. Rule 5 sets out the information that must be contained in any preliminary announcements or other publicity that are issued prior to the actual offering or issue taking place. Rule 6 prohibits stabilising action in relation to associated securities where the basis on which the associated securities may be exchanged for or converted into relevant securities had not been finally settled and been made the subject of a public announcement.</P>
    <P>Rule 7 imposes limits on the price that the stabilising manager may pay for the securities. Essentially, the issue price is the maximum that may be paid. However, if a stabilising manager undertakes intervention at a lower price, he or she can intervene again at that price or if there had been an independent deal in the marketplace at the market price. Rule 8 is designed to deal with the early termination of stabilising actions and provides that notification must be made to the Stock Exchange where this occurs. This will have the effect of ending the period during which interventions may be made by the stabilising manager.</P>
    <P>Rule 9 sets out the requirements as regards records to be kept by the stabilising manager and the fact that these must be communicated to the Irish Stock Exchange where the stabilising actions take place within the State. The Irish Stock Exchange is the competent authority in respect of the examination of possible breaches of Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to insider dealing and it is considered appropriate that it should be informed of any actions undertaken by the stabilising manager in the course of an issue or offer. In this instance, however, the information which is communicated to the Stock Exchange will not be disclosed by the Stock Exchange to the market. However, it will help the Stock Exchange better understand how and why prices may be moving in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> That is a brief overview of what is contained in the Bill. The Government has decided that the ability to engage in price stabilising activities in the context of the forthcoming Telecom Éireann flotation is considered appropriate and, accordingly, there is an urgency in having the Bill enacted without delay. I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this early debate and look forward to the Bill passing all remaining Stages. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is required to bring Irish law into line with international practice by providing for price stabilisation which is permitted in many EU member states, the United States and Japan. It is to be regretted, however, that the Bill is being taken so quickly. It was published and presented in the Seanad on the same day. At least Senators had the opportunity to table amendments which were debated yesterday. Because it is accepted that the matter is urgent we have agreed to take all Stages tonight. This is not good practice and is one which I hope will not be continued. Neither the Opposition nor the Minister of State will have an opportunity to table amendments at the end of Second Stage. I am putting down a marker that the Opposition will not always co-operate in this way if the Minister of State decides to take all Stage of a company law Bill on the one night.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the report of the company law review group which was chaired by Mr. Gallagher. It was made look as if the review group recommended this change but that is not the case. It recommended other amendments in connection with insider dealing which the Minister of State has not had time to present to the House. I accept, however, that the proposed change is necessary.</P>
      <P>It is not today or yesterday that the flotation of Telecom Éireann was first mooted. It has been talked about for a year, if not longer. The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, should have realised that legislation would be required. The Minister of State said, &ldquo;Given the size and importance of the proposed offering, the Government has decided that it would be appropriate that price stabilisation be available on the Irish Stock Exchange, which will be the principal market for the shares&rdquo;. Clearly, the Government does not want anything to go wrong with the flotation of what is a State asset, and neither do I, but it is not good practice to rush legislation through. It should have been prepared and presented at least six months ago.</P>
      <P>I have no great argument with the terms of the legislation. Unlike other stocks and shares which are above most people's heads, everybody understands the purpose of the flotation. I purchased some bank shares in the early eighties which I had to declare under the ethics legislation as their value had increased above the £10,000 threshold. This does not mean, however, that I am experienced when it comes to the Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> Because everybody is familiar with Telecom Éireann, I am certain that the share issue will be oversubscribed. It is ordinary subscribers, not the big investor, who should receive the lion's share. It is they who have made the company so wealthy. The Minister should increase the number of shares that will be available to them. Many have registered in the hope that they will be able to accumulate a nest egg and they should not be limited to between £50 and £80 worth of shares.</P>
    <P>There has been informal stabilisation in the market for many years. This is a necessary prerequisite when a company is floated. Two examples come to mind where perhaps management of the flotations was not as well done as it should have been. When Xtra-Vision went public those who ever rented a video knew about Xtra-Vision and wanted a piece of the action. Share prices went up and down and were badly managed. Many people who put small sums of money they had saved into that company probably suffered a loss as a result. That was a time when stabilisation was certainly needed. The flotation of Dana also lead to small subscribers, people who would not normally have dabbled in stocks and shares, buying shares, and many of them were stung. Again, the management of those shares was not as good as it should have been after the flotation. I have no great difficulty with what the Minister is doing. There was a certain amount of informal stabilisation where certain people would buy blocks of shares to ensure they were available to sell or hold so as to keep the price somewhat stable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Minister has included a 30 day limit, although I have tabled an amendment which I hope he will convince me is not needed. I am somewhat concerned that section 1 says the stabilisation period will commence with the date of the announcement of the price. I would have thought it should have commenced with the date of the trading of the share. That would have been the relevant and pertinent day &ndash; the day on which the market price begins to destabilise and go up and down. I hope the Minister will convince me that amendment is not necessary when I move it.</P>
    <P>Another area which gave rise to some concerns in the Seanad related to Rule 9 where the Stock Exchange would not have to disclose the fact stabilising was taking place and that it could keep that information quiet until the end of the period. I note from the legislation that the stabilising manager has a great deal of authority and power and I should like to know what controls will be placed on that person. Can it be anybody in a company? Will certain criteria be laid down so that that person will be fully accountable and open in what he or she is doing? </P>
    <P>For example, Rule 8 refers to the stabilising manager determining, before the 30th day after the closing date that he or she will take no further action. It does not appear that the stabilising manager has to give a reason for making such a decision. I understand the market will settle down <Col N="985" /> and the stabilising manager will say there is no need to continue to have a stabilising regime and will let the market forces come into play. The stabilising manager is in a very powerful position and I hope controls will be built in. I note no offences have been created in this stabilising legislation. If the person appointed as stabilising manager is found to be abusing that position, will a jail sentence or a fine or whatever is considered appropriate be imposed? It is important that would happen.</P>
    <P>Rule 9 relates to the recording of stabilisations and transactions and where the implementing of those rules is the responsibility of the stabilising manager, he or she does not have to give a record as to why, for example, a decision might have been taken to reduce the 30 days or to go the full 30 days. When setting out the rules, perhaps it will be possible to ensure full disclosure of why the stabilising manager felt ten or 15 days was necessary and that the reason be recorded. Perhaps the stabilising manager should be given a certain number of days on either side of the final date to give the reasons for his or her action.</P>
    <P>I also intend to table an amendment on any further rules or regulations which the Minister of the day may wish to introduce. Our legislation should not give open-ended regulatory powers to Ministers whose sole function is to lay the regulation before the House because if there is no annulling amendment within 21 days, the regulation becomes law. Most Members do not see those regulations and very often they are not aware they have been laid before the House and that the 21 days are running. The House should have a greater say in relation to these regulations. We have got into the habit of bringing in enabling legislation giving Ministers powers to enforce legislation through ministerial orders and regulations. That is not a good thing and legislation does not get sufficient scrutiny. I had hoped the Minister would have accepted the amendment tabled in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much consultation the Minister had before he introduced this legislation. Given that the House had no notice that theBill was being introduced in the Seanad and little time for preparation, I suspect others outside the Houses were not aware of it. That is the position in regard to IBEC. I was in contact with IBEC and would like to raise a point with the Minister which that organisation made to me but which I did not have in time to incorporate in an amendment. According to IBEC under section 6, S.I. No. 131 of 1992 is revoked. That statutory instrument, as the Minister will know, states that Irish law cannot apply to share dealings outside the State. IBEC states that the revocation of it, by implication, means that Irish law will now apply to dealings outside the State in Irish securities. This may not be the case, and I suspect section 2 deals with it. IBEC states it appears to extend the scope of our territorial remit to matters other than stabilisation of shares and, as such, goes beyond the ambit of this Bill. That organisation <Col N="986" /> is concerned that there has been no consultation on this Bill and that such a measure would go through under the guise of such a narrow issue of stabilisation. It also states this particular revocation may be of concern to other parties which may not, as yet, have picked up on it.</P>
    <P>IBEC asked me to raise that matter with the Minister. I would like to be sure that by revoking S.I. No. 131 of 1992 we are not, in any way, changing the implication of the Companies Act. The Minister is aware that S.I. 131 of 1992 was introduced by Deputy O'Malley, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce. Section 2 of that statutory instrument states that in order to remove any doubt, it is declared that section 108 of the Companies Act, 1990, does not apply to dealings outside the State in securities. The explanatory memorandum explains that section 108 does not apply to dealing outside the State in securities. Will the Minister confirm that is the case? I hope the concerns expressed to me by IBEC, and its legal representatives, are unfounded. Again, this confirms the point I made earlier that rushing legislation through the Houses does not give us time to delve into issues such as this which might be raised by very valuable organisations such as IBEC. We may have to amend this legislation in the future.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Stock Exchange is authority to which the stabilising manager should report. As we know, our Stock Exchange was founded in 1793 and has been, by and large, a very good organisation with few scandals attached to it. Obviously, some people have diddled investors out of their shares by disappearing, leaving large debts behind them and leaving the Stock Exchange to pick up the pieces. I very much welcome the fact that the interests of investors are safeguarded by the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, because all member firms come under the terms of that legislation. It provides for the compensation of eligible investors up to a maximum of £20,000 arising from losses incurred as a result of the default of any firm listed with the Stock Exchange. The Central Bank is still the statutory supervisory and competent authority for investment compensation. Does the Minister have information on whether the Central Bank will be relinquishing that authority if and when the Government decides to bring in the single regulatory financial regime which has been talked about by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance and which was recommended by the Committee on Finance and Public Affairs. Will this new body be the supervisory body and will legislation be required in this regard?</P>
    <P>Over the past 200 years and more recently with up-to-date legislation the Stock Exchange has provided an efficient and effective market for Irish and overseas securities and meets the highest international standards. It also facilitates companies and other investment vehicles in raising capital for their businesses, a very important part of its function. We have seen many companies <Col N="987" /> going from strength to strength by becoming public and floating on the exchange, thereby raising money which allows them expand their operation, increase job capacity and develop innovative areas of trading and marketing.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange and its members must be of the highest calibre. I recognise that the listing of securities in Ireland is covered under the European Community Stock Exchange regulations of 1984 and that under them we have fulfilled our obligations under the EC listing directives to provide common standards throughout the EU. One could say the legislation is extending that with the coming on stream of more or less the same regime in terms of stabilising. It is important we continue to ensure we are matching what is happening in other markets. Clearly, some flotations in Ireland will also be offered on markets outside the country, in Europe, America and Tokyo, and it is important that people here are fully up to date with the regimes which exist in those places.</P>
    <P>The regulatory role of the Stock Exchange in facilitating the efficient operation of the securities market is important. The exchange has produced rules which ensure fairness in the market but which do not at the same time restrict competition any more than is necessary to protect investors. I want an assurance from the Minister that the legislation which we are agreeing to pass in no way thwarts or restricts competition. We would not like to see the introduction of any type of protectionism or restrictive practices just because a State owned company is being floated at this time. A Senator raised this matter and spoke about the market being rigged. I do not believe the Bill when enacted will do that, but we must safeguard competition in terms of sales. However, we must also safeguard investors and I think this is achieved in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from the amendments I will move and later discuss with the Minister, I support the Bill. I warn the Minister not to be complacent in any way. We recognise the need for urgency in this instance, although we do not recognise the need for the tardiness on the part of the Minister in not introducing it sooner given that there was such a long lead-in period in terms of the Telecom Éireann flotation. The Bill could have been introduced three or four months ago and everything could have been in place for the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, whom I am sure would have been much happier if the legislation was in place. Nonetheless we will support the legislation.</P>

      <P>This is probably as bad an example of how not to process legislation as the House has seen. Occasionally the House is required to deal with emergency legislation for good objective reasons which deserve the term &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;. However, there is no such justification in this case. It is scandalous and the Minister owes the House an explanation as to why we <Col N="988" /> have been presented with the Bill at the 11th hour. There is no answer to Deputy Owen's point about the tardiness in introducing the Bill given the period of time we knew the Telecom Éireann flotation would take place. The Minister stated in his script that the Bill was prompted and provoked by the imminent Telecom Éireann IPO and that because of the size of the offer the provisions in the Bill are considered necessary. The Government has known about this for some years. Not only this, but if my memory serves me correctly &ndash; I am speaking without a script &ndash; the Book of Estimates for last year included a figure of £40 million for advisers. That is an unconscionable figure. It is very difficult for a lay person to understand how £40 million could be spent on advisers to facilitate a successful flotation. However, our business is not to ask why. Apparently there are civil servants, otherwise eminent in their positions, scattered throughout the public service who are prostrate every morning in front of consultants. That seems to be the way of modern public administration. However, what were these advisers doing? Why did the advisers who were paid £40 million not advise the Minister that this mechanism is necessary, if it is necessary, rather than the Minister present the Bill as emergency legislation to the House?</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan told the Seanad that he was speaking having only received the Bill the previous day. He commented on the Bill from what he called an initial perfunctory perusal. This is not acceptable. The Minister told the Seanad in his summing up remarks, when he seemed to have got off the leash of his excellent civil servants:</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. Members may be assured that this legislation is straightforward and enables Ireland to conform to that which exists in the international marketplace. When professional people, banks, institutions, stock brokers and other issue managers manage funds for investors or when funds are available for investment, the investors, shareholders and the people who control the liquid assets want to know that a stabilising mechanism is available where the issue takes place otherwise they would have no confidence in that issue.</P>
      <P>I submit that we have no objective evidence for this. The change being introduced tonight has not been the practice in the Irish Stock Exchange. Whatever the Bill is, it is not a straightforward measure. It is quite complex and opaque legislation which, as the small number of Senators who contributed to the debate in the other House said, is quite difficult for the average person to understand. There is no gainsaying this. I am sure the Minister has gone through the Bill line by line and will know it deals with an extremely complex area. Indeed, much company law is complex. Now, late on a summer's night, we are expected to take all stages of the Bill. That is not the way to deal with legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> It is strange we have a habit of doing this in the area of company law. The Bill proposes to amend the Companies Act, 1990, primarily in respect of two important areas, one to do with insider dealing, the other to do with disclosure of interests in securities. Members may recall that the Act was only passed after we had passed, again in emergency circumstances, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which preceded it. It is what I refer to as the Goodman Act. The House was reconvened in August 1990 and its agreement sought to interfere with the market and bail out a dominant group of companies in the beef industry. An excerpt from the main Act was taken and enacted separately with the Act proper being enacted later. We have not consolidated the two since or examined the implications, and there is now a serious and urgent necessity to codify and examine the areas of deficiency in company law rather than doing it on a piecemeal basis.</P>
    <P>I know a little about this. I also bear a little of the blame for the pace of progress in this area. There are a number of reasons for that. One of them is that, during the short time I was Minister of State at the then Department of Enterprise and Employment, I had seven Bills enacted, some quite complex and very long. As the current Minister and Ministers of State have discovered, there is little thanks to be had in enacting legislation. It is much better to deal with county enterprise boards in Ballinasloe and other places than to be here every night going through the complex detail of company legislation.</P>
    <P>Company law is badly in need of rectification and modernisation. It is lamentable that we are here at the eleventh hour dealing with an important matter. This matter may well have been provoked by the imminent IPO in Telecom Éireann but we are not making law for that company. This will be on the stocks and I am not equipped to deal with the legislation at short notice and scrutinise it in the detail I would like.</P>
    <P>I do not know why this is dealt with at the eleventh hour. The Minister of State did not just have civil servants advising him he had better proceed with it. He had expensive advisers in sharp suits whose job it was to bring it to his attention, yet we are still here at the eleventh hour. Maybe there were turf wars behind the scenes. Perhaps the Department of Public Enterprise said it was its Bill and that everyone had better keep their hands off it. It has a very proprietorial Minister who would give a person six slaps of the hardest if he or she intruded on her territory. Perhaps she laid claim to it only to discover it was so complex that something might go wrong so it might be better to pass it up the line to the Department of Finance. That Department might have said it would not deal with it because it concerned company law and sent it back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That is probably the most plausible explanation of why we are here at this late hour without having any opportunity to take professional expert advice on what is a very complex area.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said in his summing up in the Seanad when he got off the leash &ndash; he has a tremendous rhetorical flourish when he gets loose &ndash; that Senators could be assured the legislation was straightforward and only conformed to international practice. We have a Constitution. Other countries are not impeded or buttressed, depending on one's point of view, by a written Constitution. Article 43 of the Constitution sets out the rights antecedent in positive law to the private ownership of external goods. Article 43.2.2º states:</P>
      <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights [to private property] with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
      <P>That harks back to Article 43.2.1º which states that the delimitation to the right to private property must conform to &ldquo;the principles of social justice&rdquo;. I would like the Minister when he is replying to tell me what legal advice he has in terms of this conformity to the principles of social justice and how it answers the dictates or exigencies of the common good. I pose the question because the word abroad, in so far as anyone understands this, is that this is for the small punter, that the country will rise up as one and regard the IPO in Telecom Éireann as something akin to the Grand National and that all the people will have a flutter. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in the time-honoured tradition of his party, is in the House to protect the small man. The word abroad is that we will protect the small man who will have a flutter on this.</P>
      <P>That is not what it does. Whatever else, it does not protect the small man. This is essentially a contrivance between the market, senior managers in the company, the Government and the institutions to permit the entry at a low price so that ultimately they will all disproportionately benefit. There can be no doubt but that that is its effect. They all have a convergence of interests as to why that should happen. The Government wants a successful flotation. The jostling between the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for the photograph on the Stock Exchange floor will be a sight to behold, but they want the photograph to look well and for the headlines on the nine o'clock news to be that there was a successful flotation of Telecom Éireann and that we are now a share-owning democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest of the fund managers is that, depending on the performance of shares, they will have to ensure their portfolio is balanced in terms of proportionality. For example, if the people were to rise up and demand ownership of a portion of what was theirs anyway, and they were to ring the magical telephone number, receive their share allocations and the shares were subsequently to go through the roof, the institutions would then have a problem in terms of the balance of their portfolios. They do not want that to happen. The shares will not fall in value from the price on offer day. There is a convergence of interests.</P>
      <P>A situation which would otherwise be illegal and fraudulent will effectively no longer be illegal and will escape the charge of fraud as a result of the changes we will make to the 1990 Act. That is the impact of it. As a result, it is the Government and the institutions whose positions are being protected. Therefore, I ask the Minister to state what advice he got on the requirement in the Constitution that to delimit the right to private property ought to be in answer to the exigencies of the common good.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there was quite a nifty little revolt in the Seanad on this matter. Senator Quinn, in particular, became quite exercised by all of this. It seems to me that the questions he raised in the Seanad were not answered. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, displays facial bewilderment that any questions posed to him in debate would not be fully answered, but Deputies would like him to take this opportunity to give verbal expression to that confidence that he dealt with these questions.</P>
      <P>There were substantial questions. I do not agree with Senator Quinn's ideological position. I have no difficulty with the market being rigged but my concern is on whose behalf is it being rigged. I object to the notion being put aboard that the market is being rigged on behalf of the small punter because I do not believe that is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any evidence in the Minister's speech that he has looked at this beyond the question of the Telecom Éireann flotation. It seems that somebody rushed into the Department of Public Enterprise one morning and said that the rules of the stock exchanges in New York and London permit this price stabilisation mechanism, there is no such mechanism in Dublin so how can the Department offer such a huge chunk of public property to the market with different rules obtaining at different locations. It appears that somebody then said they had better prepare a Bill quickly, the officials of the Department of Public Enterprise said it had nobody with any knowledge about that and that the Department had better go to the company law section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and request it to introduce an emergency <Col N="992" /> Bill. That is not the way to make law and it seems to me that is what happened.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain the point of the &ldquo;Reason for a (No. 3) Bill&rdquo; heading on page 2 of his script? As one reads the page, one thinks that this is great because the Minister did not explain the position in the Seanad but we will now know the reason for the (No. 2) Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The first reason is because this year I introduced a Private Members' Bill, the purpose of which was to enable the Tánaiste to pass on to a tribunal of inquiry matters which came into her possession as a result of investigations initiated by her. The Minister stated he already published the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which has to do with examinership, the audit of small companies and a third matter arising out of the row we had in the House and elsewhere on the question of Irish registered non-resident companies. Again, I am not sure what this has to do with being a reason for the third amendment Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It sets a certain background but it does not explain to me the purpose of this.</P>
      <P>The Minister has put the House in an extremely difficult position. Manipulation which was not heretofore permitted will now be permitted as a result of this panic which has beset the Department of Public Enterprise arising from the imminent coming to the market of Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some claims for the intelligibility of all of this. He has a keener brain than mine if some of this material is easily intelligible. I find it quite difficult. For example, I do not understand why, in respect of Rule 6 in the Schedule, stabilisation is not extended to this category of trading. I do not understand this restriction on stabilising action in associated securities. What is contemplated here? It seems to me, trying to read this section, that it probably refers to option-type instruments. Will the Minister state whether it is option-type instruments which are envisaged here? These would be high-risk takers. Why should the stabilisation mechanism not apply to them? Why are they exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rule 7, states: &ldquo;No stabilising action shall be effected by the stabilising manager at a price higher than any relevant price determined in accordance with this Rule&rdquo;, and then goes on to refer to the &ldquo;limits on prices at which stabilising action may be effected&rdquo; and lists them. It refers to &ldquo;the initial stabilising action&rdquo; and then goes on to talk about &ldquo;for subsequent actions&rdquo;. Does that mean that there can be more than one action? Does that mean that when the 30 days is up there may be a second 30 days? I find it difficult to understand whether that is what is intended and <Col N="993" /> that, in fact, it can go on for 60 days. I am not sure.</P>
    <P>The rather opaque and difficult notice posted in Rule 5 states:</P>
    <P>In connection with this issue [name of stabilising manager] may over-allot or effect transactions which stabilise or maintain the market price of [description of relevant securities and of any associated securities] at a level which might not otherwise prevail. Such stabilising, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend including a provision that this notice would be posted prominently in every page so that the prospective consumer knows exactly where he or she stands? Indeed, it seems to me that it ought to carry a notice requiring the consumer to consult with his or her adviser because it is a complex area.</P>
    <P>It is a great shame that we now find ourselves in a position where, as Deputy Owen stated, we cannot observe the normal practice, which is that we express our view on the principle of the Bill on Second Stage and then both the Minister and Opposition spokespersons may go away, take professional advice from interested and disinterested parties and return to this House with amendments to tease out the legislation in the manner in which it ought to be scrutinised. Effectively, it is anticipated that we will go through the motions here tonight, the Bill will become law and will be chalked up on the ministerial belt as an Act enacted by the Oireachtas. However, it will be an Act enacted in extraordinary circumstances. That is a great pity. Senators were presented with the Bill only yesterday. Some of the serious points raised in their contributions were not dealt with in the Minister's replies.</P>
    <P>This area of company law is a very important one in the modern world in terms of the regulation of commerce. A number of Senators expressed concern about the manner in which the Bill was dealt with. Senator Feargal Quinn alleged that the Bill purports to create transparency, yet has the opposite effect. Senator Cox, as a member of the Minister's party, obviously supported the Bill but she commented on the lack of intelligibility and, therefore, transparency of the language. Senator Coghlan raised questions about the possible manipulation of some of the terms and pointed to recent experiences of breaches or non-compliance with company law. For these and other reasons, I am unable to express any enthusiasm for the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the simple, straightforward argument is that because they do it this way in Tokyo, London and New York we must conform, it seems extraordinary that such a realisation only dawned at the last minute. Even though our stock market has not been as busy as other markets, there have been flotations on it recently. Why have we been presented at this late stage with a Bill as substantive as this one which we are expected to scrutinise line by line? That is an unsatisfactory way to <Col N="994" /> deal with legislation and I regret its presentation in this fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is designed to bring Irish company law into line with international practices by permitting price stabilisation on the Irish Stock Exchange in connection with new issues of securities and large offers of existing securities. Permitting stabilisation will allow traders on the Irish Stock Exchange to use a mechanism already available in other countries. I do not welcome the fact that we have to rush through a Bill on the complex issue of company law which is a veritable minefield.</P>
      <P>To allow price stabilisation here, the Bill provides exemptions for a maximum period of 30 days from the insider dealing rules and some of the disclosure of interest requirements contained in the Company Act, 1990. I wonder whether the 30 day period is adequate. The Bill also sets down strict rules under which price stabilisation may be carried out. That stabilisation may occur in regard to a particular issue must be widely disclosed in all documentation to ensure potential investors are made aware of the facts.</P>
      <P>I feel this measure is being particularly geared towards Telecom Éireann. I am disappointed by the level of shares being offered which I expect will be very minimal. People who will collectively invest millions in the company will not gain a great deal aside from the fact that they will have a solid base share. They will effectively be silent partners. I wonder whether stabilisation will work towards subscribers' interest.</P>
      <P>Stabilisation is only permitted to stabilise or maintain the price of a security. An initial stabilisation price on the amount of shares offered will assist in evaluating the assets of a particular operation, such as Telecom Éireann. Larger companies will block buy Telecom shares which will also be floated on the London and New York stock exchanges. It will be interesting to see how that develops.</P>
      <P>Stabilisation may only occur for a 30 day period after the allocation of securities and the marketplace will determine the full value of shares after that period. People have shares in building societies which subsequently became PLCs. In some instances shares were very tightly controlled with people being offered 150 to 200 shares. I am aware of cases where certain building societies were anxious to buy back shares at a very knockdown price where customers defaulted on payments. I am not suggesting that will happen with Telecom if people do not pay their telephone bills but the matter should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stabilisation manager may only buy securities on the open market at, or below, the issue price. The stabilisation manager will have immense powers. To whom will he or she be answerable? The manager must also ensure procedures are in place to keep accurate and detailed records of any stabilisation transactions which occur and the records must be disclosed to the Irish Stock Exchange. Is the stock exchange <Col N="995" /> obliged to make disclosures to the Minister if any anomalies arise? The stock exchange is a relatively new phenomenon in the Irish marketplace; only the privileged few deal on the stock market. The Minister should consider making the stock market more accessible and transparent. Many people feel that the stock exchange is for other people's use.</P>
    <P>The stock exchange will have a role in the future in raising capital for SMEs. In regard to venture capital, it is an area Irish business people should seriously consider. The Government has advocated public-private partnerships and joint ventures.</P>
    <P>There is a certain mystique to the Stock Exchange. Much could be done to dispel that. This Bill had a limited timescale and the language in it, although it is simple when you read it, is mind boggling. People will read about stabilisation and the various conditions attached to it and will not closely observe it.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to all offerings and issues of securities but it is intended that it should be in place to permit the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann. It was mentioned that £3 million is being spent promoting the share offer on television, after an initial pay-out of £40 million to advisers.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt it is a prize-winning production, but £3 million is a large sum? The newspapers will also make a great deal of money from it. The <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> will probably get thousands of pounds. If £3 million is being paid to advertise the shares on television, the newspapers could get £0.5 million each for publishing advertisements for the flotation. I would question expenditure of that size in such a small State.</P>
      <P>It is good that subscribers are being given an opportunity to buy shares but I hope they will not be used as pawns in a PR exercise on behalf of the Government. It could say that this flotation went extraordinarily well and that Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta could be sold. This is the start of a major campaign of sales. If this goes well it will set the precedent. The Government is indicating what it will do with Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus and its attitude to future share flotation of joint ventures. This is similar to flotations in the UK where the Government sold the various water companies and the railways.</P>
      <P>The sale must be handled carefully. Major assets could be governed by external forces in the stock exchanges of New York or London. It may not happen but many small shareholders will have no say at the AGM. They will receive the normal letter of invitation and it will be thrown in the dustbin.</P>

      <P>The company can then be controlled by those with a vested interest. Stabilisation will exist for 30 days but after that period external forces will feel very secure and will have shares in a major company. They cannot lose. The fact that the State is backing this makes it very attractive to such forces.</P>
      <P>The role of the Stock Exchange in Ireland should be looked at. There were huge risks for those who bought shares on the Stock Exchange when there was no stabilisation. People thought Xtra-vision was the business to follow and invested in it. The owner of the chain started with one video store and a fantastic idea but the shares plummeted due to changes in the market. There is no comparison, however, between Xtra-vision and Telecom Éireann, Aer Rianta or other companies which have State support.</P>
      <P>It is only after the 30 day period, however, that it will become apparent who the major shareholders are. We should look at who buys the major shareholdings We are looking at the role of banks and talking about a merger of ACC Bank with ICC Bank and the sale of TSB. This process has started very suddenly and has been rushed &ndash; the Bill was introduced on 30 April and is being enacted within a very short period of time.</P>
      <P>Rule 9 sets out the requirements for records to be kept by the stabilising manager and these must be communicated to the Irish Stock Exchange where the stabilising actions take place within the State. What happens if they take place outside the State? Who has jurisdiction over that?</P>
      <P>The Irish Stock Exchange is the competent authority in the examination of possible breaches of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, on insider dealing. It is considered appropriate that it should be informed of any actions undertaken by the stabilising manager in the course of the issue or an offer. In this instance, the information which is communicated to the Stock Exchange will not be disclosed by the Stock Exchange to the market. It will, however, help the Stock Exchange to understand better how and why prices may be moving in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal contained in Rule 9, a point the Minister developed in the Seanad. The role of the manager is huge. Who appoints him? Does the Minister appoint him? To whom is he answerable? The Stock Exchange is made aware of anomalies. Where does that information go once the Stock Exchange gets it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the company law review group submitted its report at the request of the then Minister, the group made recommendations for a number of changes in the provisions for insider dealing. Because of the diversity of areas examined by the company law review group, the decision was taken to progress the implementation of the recommendations on a phased basis. This was the start of a major change. It was in this context that <Col N="997" /> the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill was prepared, to implement the recommendations of the company law review group on examinership and on the removal of the statutory audit requirements for certain small companies. Work on the preparation of proposals to implement the changes was not put to the company law review group which sat for some time. It was an afterthought and was incorporated in the group's proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to be an expert on any of this but the people who should avail of shares should be given a genuine opportunity to buy them. If there was more time available I would like to talk about the future sale of other State assets but, as Deputy Rabbitte correctly stated, the Bill was introduced in a very short period of time. We seem to be following what is happening in other parts of the world and it is an indication of where this country is going. I wish the Minister of State well on the election trail to Europe but it appears that in all legislation we are merely following suit in most issues. We should be able to stand alone in certain aspects and this is a major opportunity for Irish people to buy shares in an Irish company built by Irish employers who do an extraordinary job. It should not be manipulated by big companies but evenly distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank all the Deputies for the interesting contributions they made on this legislation. As I explained in my opening statement, the purpose of this legislation is essentially to bring Irish law into line with international practice. It will allow those trading on the Irish Stock Exchange to use the price stabilisation mechanism which has been available in other countries for a number of years. It is worth repeating that the balance we have struck between permitting the managers of the issues or offers to engage in price stabilisation and the rules with which they must comply is in accordance with international standards. Put at its simplest, the market will be aware, at the very start, that price stabilisation is a possibility even before the issue or offer takes place. The stabilising activity can only happen within a short window period of 30 days after the allocation of securities &ndash; there is a defined period. The stabilising manager may only buy securities in the open market at or below the issue price. The stabilising manager will have to be satisfied that appropriate procedures were followed leading up to the issue or offer, and records of any stabilisation transactions will have to be maintained and be disclosed to the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen made the point that no time was given by us on prior notice of the Bill. We drafted the Bill to deal with one issue, price stabilisation. The Companies (No. 2) Bill was published in March last. The Government normally gives a good deal of time for consideration of Bills, and <Col N="998" /> that Bill has yet to be discussed here, so obviously ample time has been given. I am sorry&ndash;</P>

      <P>If this was more urgent why was it not brought in beforehand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>I will come to that point, Deputy. I am sorry if the chronological order which I narrated earlier in my Second Stage contribution caused confusion but I wanted to give due credit to Deputy Rabbitte for his Bill, which was the first. We then had the second Bill which is published but has yet to be debated, and now we have the third Bill. Rather than cause confusion I felt I was being fair in ensuring we put that information on the record. If that caused confusion, I sincerely regret it.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Rabbitte that sufficient time was not allowed, the advisers to the Government first mooted the need for the stabilisation towards the end of last year. Subsequently, they informed us&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. In all fairness, Deputy Ring, the Deputies are entitled to a response.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the insider dealing provisions contained in Part V are one of the areas examined by the company law review group. The group reported in December 1994 and the report was published in early 1995. As mentioned also, it has been decided to implement the recommendations of the group on a phased basis. Accordingly, the proposals for amendment of Part V have not yet been the subject of detailed examination with a view to implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably fair to say that a number of difficult technical issues will have to be addressed in <Col N="999" /> seeking to implement the recommendations of the company law review group in this area, something that was acknowledged by the group when it made its report. Moreover, arising from the experience of the competent authority in the operation of the provisions, some further refinements have been recommended to better facilitate their task in operating Part V.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State give way because what I said was that change was not recommended. Where did it come from? I fully accept the Minister of State has much more to do but this was not recommended in the company law review group report.

      <P>On a serious point, is it not a fact that such expensive advisers would come to this conclusion just before Christmas? It really is difficult to understand. Some £40 million is provided in the Estimates for advisers associated with the flotation of Telecom, and the Minister of State was presented with this before Christmas. It is extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In all fairness, we cannot take it out of context. It was mooted that it may be necessary, and as a result of the discussions that went on &ndash; I was not present with the advisers at those discussions &ndash; the advice came through that it was necessary to do this. I return to the point made earlier by Deputy Rabbitte. Perhaps we should have done this many years ago. I personally believe that we erred in one or two cases. This is positive legislation. I cannot see the difficulty with it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Owen and Rabbitte referred to the Telecom flotation. While it is intended to have the legislation in place to permit price stabilisation in Ireland in respect of the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, the Bill will apply to all offerings and issues of securities in the future, and why should that not be so? We cannot bring in legislation that will be good for one semi-State organisation but <Col N="1000" /> not for a private company &ndash; Deputy Perry spoke about the importance of that earlier. There will be equalisation of opportunity in any flotation that might take place in the future.</P>
      <P>The Telecom flotation falls within the ambit of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and she is the person responsible for the issue. Because of stock exchange listing rules both here and on the exchanges abroad on which the securities may be listed, I do not wish to comment further on the details of that specific offering. Work was proceeding on different amendments to company law. The Government, on the recommendations that were made, decided that stabilisation should be available in the Telecom flotation, hence the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Owen that there are no offences in the Bill, if a person does not comply with the rules he or she will not benefit from the exemption being provided in the Bill. In such an event, he or she will be subject to both criminal and civil sanctions in Part V of the 1990 Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen said that section 6 revokes S.I. No. 131 of 1992 and she had concerns as a result of discussions with IBEC. That Statutory Instrument was designed to facilitate stabilisation abroad but did not deal with such action in this State. The present Bill now deals with the issue both at home and abroad and, consequently, the statutory instrument is being revoked; we are including it in primary legislation on stabilisation in our own jurisdiction and in all other jurisdictions. Other changes to Part V have been recommended by the company law review group and will be addressed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen made the point that the stabilising manager need not give reasons for ending stabilising actions. If the stabilising manager ceases stabilising actions, he or she is obliged to inform the Stock Exchange. This will be published as the Stock Exchange sees fit. The decision on when stabilisation action ceases is a matter for the manager's discretion and judgment based on market conditions. It is not necessary that stabilisation has to take effect, nor is it necessary that it takes effect for 30 days. It is for the stabilising managers to decide whether they will continue with it or terminate it at an earlier date than the 30 days. Once they make the decision they must notify the Stock Exchange which must make it public knowledge.</P>

      <P>Could there be a second action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Once it is initiated and terminated there is only one chance to stabilise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No reason has to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. On the point made by Deputy Owen that we are in line with Europe, the insider dealing directive which was transposed into Irish law by Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, specifically allows member states to permit stabil<Col N="1001" /> isation. We are conforming. Deputy Rabbitte stated that company law must be consolidated and codified and this issue will be progressed as a result of the McDowell report. It will be done.</P>
      <P>While stabilisation may appear at first sight to permit undesirable manipulation of the market, in reality, in the special circumstances of a new issue or offer of securities, this mechanism is desirable to help ensure a more orderly aftermarket for the securities concerned. When a large number of new securities are released on to the market at once, as happens with a new issue or offer, it sometimes takes a number of weeks for them to settle within the markets. A sudden glut could otherwise lead to the price becoming artificially depressed. The stabilisation mechanism encourages a more orderly transition from the abnormal trading volume when a new security is issued to a normal volume sometime later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked on whose behalf the stabilisation is being made. Price stabilisation is aimed at promoting a more orderly aftermarket for all issues or offers should the managers wish to avail of it. Counteracting artificial volatility in the aftermarket immediately after a new issue or offer is in the interest of all investors as well as the seller of the securities. We all have a duty to the taxpayer. Huge amounts of money have been invested in Telecom Éireann and it is only fair to the State that we realise the value of the company. That is the purpose of this measure. This law will affect all flotations, including the semi-State sector, if the companies' advisers wish to avail of the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about Rule 7 which pertains to the upper limit on price. All stabilising actions can take place within 30 days. However, the manager can engage in this a number of times within that period once he notifies the Stock Exchange that he has terminated the stabilising action.</P>
      <P>Rule 5(2)(a) expressly requires the notice to be included in a prominent place. It has to be clear to the prospective purchaser of the stocks that stabilising may take place. Deputy Rabbitte said that he did not understand Rule 6. This rule does not allow stabilisation in respect of associated companies to take place in circumstances where the terms of exchange for ordinary securities have not been finally settled. These circumstances may arise with some form of financial instruments and it would be inappropriate for stabilisation to take place if the final terms were not settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister of State explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a complex matter. Rule 6 does not allow stabilisation in respect of associated instruments or companies to take place in circumstances where terms of exchange for ordinary securities have not yet been finally settled. This means that a stabilisation mechanism can take place for up to 30 days after a company is floated until the markets settle. That stabilisation affects that flotation only and cannot be used in other associated companies or instruments pertaining <Col N="1002" /> to subsidiaries. It can only affect the company floated at that time &ndash; it is clearly focused.</P>
      <P>As Irish law stands, stabilisation action would be in contravention of Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, prohibiting insider dealing. I referred to this in response to a point made by Deputy Owen. Regulations made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1992 clarified that stabilisation activity carried on outside the State, for example on the London, New York or Tokyo Stock Exchanges, would not breach Part V of the Act. The regulation exempted and disallowed stabilisation action in Ireland but accepted that it was relevant for Irish companies floated on international stock exchanges to use such mechanisms. That was not a level playing field for Irish consumers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry asked to whom the Stock Exchange was answerable. If the stabilisation managers do not comply with the rules, they will be in breach of Part V of the Companies Act, 1990. The Stock Exchange reports these breaches to the DPP. It also makes an annual report to the Minister for Commerce in which it would be obliged to report these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry referred to stabilisation action outside the State. Section 2(b) exempts such action as long as it applies to rules applicable abroad. I hope I have covered all the points made by Deputies. I thank Deputies for their contributions and appreciate their commitment of time and effort to the Bill. I thank the Opposition for allowing the Government to put the Bill through the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever we needed a gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage of a Bill it is now. I am not <Col N="1003" /> sure I understand some of the English used by the Minister of State, let alone the terminology. I hope for his sake those who drafted the legislation are fully aware of what they are doing and that we do not find ourselves in a dilemma during the flotation of Telecom Éireann, the first company to be affected by this legislation. I am still not clear whether the Minister of State answered my question as I have not had time to tease out his answer. Perhaps his officials might be able to reassure me later that my concerns have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>My concern on section 1 is that the Minster of State said that the 30 day period commences on the day of the earliest public announcement of such issues or offers made which states the issue or offer price. My concern is that there might be a difference between the time of the announcement of the price and the time at which trading starts. I recognise that trading will start at the price announced but the price could change instantly. I would have thought that the 30 day stabilisation period should commence at the date of trading if it is not the same as that on which the price was announced.</P>
    <P>I may be reading this wrong. Section 1(b) seems in conflict with section 6 but we do not have time to tease that out. Perhaps the Minister will be able to reassure me that these amendments are not necessary. If ever there was a reason for bringing each new regulation before the House to be agreed, it is the speed with which this Bill has been dealt with and the lack of detailed examination. If ever there was a need for the Minister to accept an amendment, it is in the context of this legislation. I am deeply disappointed that the Minister will not accept my amendment to section 5.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this issue of extreme public importance. Like other Deputies I received many letters on the issue of child care. I have a personal as well as a political interest in this matter. As the father of a one-and-half-year-old with a second child to follow at the end of this week I can testify that the claims made by parents in relation to this matter are not at all exaggerated. There is now widespread frustration and even anger at the lack of a coherent response from the Government on the question of child care.</P>
      <P>The situation which was previously unacceptable has now reached crisis proportions because of the implementation of the 1996 child care regulations. This has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of children permitted in crèches and Montessori schools while fees have increased sometimes by 30 to 40 per cent in order to make up for the shortfall. To put it simply, the supply of child care services is diminishing while demand has increased rapidly. NoMember objects to higher standards, but the short and medium-term consequences of the implementation of the child care regulations should have been foreseen and, perhaps, the crisis could have been averted.</P>
      <P>The failure to recognise the impending crisis should not, however, deter the Minister from taking immediate action to prevent an even worse situation. I am suggesting the provision of a once-off capital grant for pre-school service providers to enable them to comply with the regulations. I want the Minister of State to address this directly in his reply and to recognise that this is not a waste of money. Investment in child care is vital if we are to have a properly functioning society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above measure will be simply a stop-gap. What is required is the sort of child care policy that is taken for granted in other EU states. In Finland all child care is subsidised and regulated by the state. Some 82 per cent of mothers of children between the ages of seven and 12 work outside the home. In Ireland the figure is 36.6 per cent. Finland gives mothers nearly a year of paid maternity leave plus a further two years' optional parental leave after which they can go back to their jobs at the same level as when they left. We <Col N="1005" /> have no comparable policy in Ireland, because when it comes to child care Ireland is still living in the dark ages.</P>
    <P>The Green Party has called for the introduction of a national strategy on the provision of child care. This Government, and previous administrations, failed to plan and provide for the child care which is so necessary in our rapidly changing society. The Green Party is recommending that only one Department should be in charge of child care and that it should not only inspect the physical surroundings but also take into account the well-being and development of the children in child care services. This would at least be a means of getting action from the Government in solving this crisis. It would also have avoided the current difficulties, where the planning laws have increased prices and reduced the number of child care places, without other Departments having to take action to counteract the problems caused by these changes.</P>
    <P>The current position forces many childminders and parents to operate outside the regulations, and much child care takes place in the black market or with the crucial help of friends and family. This leaves many children sometimes in the care of unqualified and untrained minders in an environment that cannot be inspected. The desperate need for someone to mind one's children leads to desperate measures being taken.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is also calling for a network of child care bureaux to be set up locally to oversee the implementation of a national child care policy and to ensure that local child care facilities are properly resourced, represented and co-ordinated. By decentralising the everyday running of child care to the local level, it can be tailored to suit local needs. The management boards of such bureaux would comprise representatives from the local community with emphasis on the participation of parents and child care providers.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, the Green Party recommends that the cost of day care should be tax deductible, and child care should be subsidised for those parents who do not qualify for tax deductions. In the medium to long-term the Green Party recommends the phased introduction of a guaranteed basic income for adults. With basic incomes valid work such as parenting and caring, which at present is not given an economic value, would be given equal status with traditional paid work outside the home.</P>
    <P>The Green Party recommends tax incentives and supports for businesses which provide a play area or a children's section and for companies and institutions to provide in-house child care so that parents can visit children easily during the day.</P>
    <P>There are examples throughout Europe of how child care can and does work to suit both parents and children without costing individual parents a fortune. The calls by industry to increase the number of women in the workforce to fill the skills shortage can go ahead only when women and men feel there is an adequate and safe place for their children to stay while they are working away from home. We have had three reports on this issue and now it is time for action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
      <P>The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and/or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times.</P>
      <P>Where deficiencies are identified, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers, achieved through natural reduction, that is not replacing children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year, or by the provider moving to a larger premises. The time scale for making improvements may vary from a requirement for immediate action if the health and safety of the children is at risk, or may extend to six months if it is appropriate to use a phased approach.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to expanding the availability of child care. Health boards are providing financial support to pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to stimulate the supply of child care places, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement of 2 December 1998, announced that capital allowances were being introduced for expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, refurbishment and extension of a crèche or nursery. The expenditure can be written off over seven years at 15 per cent per annum for the first six years, and 10 per cent in the seventh year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Child Care, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure, including the financing and resourcing implications of its implementation. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. The Government has since established an interdepartmental committee on child care to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the <Col N="1007" /> child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. The committee has been asked to report within a time frame of six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise the important matter of the future provision of surgery at Monaghan general hospital. I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to reply to the Adjournment debate. There has been much anxiety in the north Monaghan region regarding the lack of progress towards the implementation of the North-Eastern Health Board's proposals for the upgrading and restructuring of Monaghan general hospital.</P>
      <P>A recent article by Ms Margaret Curley in the<i> Irish Medical News</i> stating that major surgery procedures are likely to be phased out over two years at the hospital, has raised anxiety among staff, patients and the general public.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that a statement by the North-Eastern Health Board clearly said that surgical services will continue and be developed at Monaghan, the real answer people are awaiting is a clear commitment from the Government that the £5 million needed to build theatres and restructure the hospital in general will be granted now.</P>
      <P>Monaghan continues to provide a necessary and important service to the people of County Monaghan, as well as for all those who travel through Monaghan, especially along the Dublin-Derry road and the Belfast-Galway road. It is essential that surgical treatment is available seven days a week.</P>
      <P>New theatres together with back-up services must be provided if Monaghan general hospital is to be treated as an equal partner with Cavan general hospital, in the joint arrangement agreed by the North-Eastern Health Board supported the former Ministers for Health, Deputies Howlin and Noonan. That joint hospital structure continues to be supported by the present Minister, Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>Monaghan general hospital is a much older structure than its counterpart in Cavan. Consequently, it requires considerable upgrading. A new accident and emergency department must be provided to avoid causing upset to in-patients and their families, especially during the night, as happens at present.</P>
      <P>Apart from the new theatre suites and upgrading the medical and surgery wards, a new maternity unit, together with pathology and radiology departments, must be provided. Extended out-patient and child care facilities plus a new high dependency coronary care unit is also vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other issues need to be addressed. I hope that before too long the Minister will see for himself that even a proper car park is crucial for the hospital. A new mortuary is also required so that post mortems can be carried out on site to avoid further trauma for the families concerned. When this necessary work is sanctioned and financed by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the story in the <i>Irish <Col N="1008" />Medical News</i> will be refuted. Comhairle na nOspideál will be glad to agree the necessary consultants needed to the Cavan-Monaghan unit, giving equal status to Monaghan general hospital in all the vital areas, including maternity, child care and accident and emergency on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>The commitment by the North-Eastern Health Board to develop speciality services should mean that many journeys to Dublin will be avoided, along with the cost they entail. In addition, patients' pain and suffering will be relieved much earlier.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to provide the funds necessary to allow work to start this year, thus removing the rumours and uncertainty. The tax and general income received by the Government is above all expectation, so the funds are available. The Minister Deputy Cowen, has provided £50 million for Tullamore and a further £24 million for Portlaoise. The sum of £5 million for Monaghan should not only be possible but justified for the Border region. The total package for the four counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath proposed and approved in June 1998 by the North-Eastern Health Board, would cost £25 million. It would deliver a full and comprehensive health service to the region. It compares favourably to the capital cost in any other health board region.</P>
    <P>The appointment last year of two new surgeons to the Cavan-Monaghan hospital, based on the Monaghan site, brings to five the total number of surgeons, each with special interests. The Cavan-Monaghan hospital has the capacity to supply a full range of services to the catchment area. However, Monaghan must be upgraded. There have been some problems in the provision of anaesthetist services. I understand this is being rectified, but it led to added anxiety.</P>
    <P>Many lives have been saved, especially at weekends, by the fine surgeons, doctors and nursing staff at Monaghan general hospital. All the staff are committed to serving the people of Monaghan. Please given them a chance to do so. I hope the Minister of State will be able to advise me, sooner rather than later that the Minister can come to the region to announce the necessary funding. The Border region deserves this and I know the Leas Ceann Comhairle will fully support me in any efforts to make sure that Monaghan general hospital is not only saved but improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board at its meeting in June 1998, approved the framework for the development of acute hospital services in the North-Eastern region and has submitted to the Department of Health and Children, a set of proposals for the development of all five acute hospital sites in its region, including Monaghan hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure the highest possible quality of service for patients, the North-Eastern Health Board is now providing acute hospital services on the basis of two integrated hospital groups &ndash; the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and the Louth-Meath-Drogheda group. This approach, in addition to promoting quality health care on each site, underlines that all five hospitals in the region <Col N="1009" /> are secure. The establishment of an integrated Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has ensured that the population of the catchment area of both hospitals will have available to them a range of high quality, easily accessible medical and surgical services.</P>
    <P>In its development proposals, the North Eastern Health Board envisages the following improvements at the Monaghan site of the Cavan-Monaghan group: composite diagnostic and treatment unit for accident and emergency services; day services and improvements in out-patients and surgical services; improvements of existing hospital wards for high quality accommodation; the immediate refurbishment of theatre and the provision of an emergency/recovery area.</P>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board's policy on acute surgical services is clear and explicit. The plans included in the framework will significantly develop the range and complexity of services in the region and allow the board to develop self-sufficiency in regional services.</P>
    <P>The general and specialist surgical services are an important component of the board's overall service. Joint departments of surgery have been developed at each of the hospital groups. The majority of surgeons have assignments across two hospital sites within the hospital groups. The framework document confirms that all hospital sites will provide a high level of surgery consistent with patients' needs and best clinical practices.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, the appointment of two new surgeons last year to the Cavan-Monaghan hospital, based at the Monaghan site, brings to five the total number of surgeons, each with special interests. The Cavan-Monaghan hospital has the capacity to supply a full range of surgery services to the catchment area.</P>
    <P>The board has indicated that the new appointments in Cavan-Monaghan secure the future of acute surgical services at the two hospital sites and that significant investment is planned at these sites over the coming years.</P>
    <P>In the Louth-Meath hospital group, new consultant posts are being created in Dundalk and Drogheda, and the appointment of a replacement surgeon at Navan is imminent. These appointments will bring the team of general surgeons in the Louth-Meath group to seven. These posts underline that the future of surgical services in these hospitals is also secure.</P>
    <P>The board has indicated that surgical services will continue and be developed at Monaghan hospital. In this context I wish to inform the House that the Minister is currently examining the health board's latest proposals for the development of the acute hospital services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter as I know he has a personal interest in this issue. I have been very concerned for some time by the many difficulties ordinary people &ndash; I emphasise ordinary people &ndash; have in obtaining planning permission. I refer specifically to applications for once-off domestic dwellings and small developments. We are all <Col N="1010" /> aware of major national concerns about past planning problems, particularly in the Dublin area, which are being dealt with by the Flood tribunal. I am a public representative for a mainly rural constituency where we have never experienced such problems and never abused the planning process even by use of a section 4 motion. My concern is that recently it has become very difficult for an individual who wishes to set up home in his native parish or region to obtain planning permission from the local authorities. The usual excuses are ribbon development, traffic and road problems, speed limits and lack of infrastructure such as water and sewerage systems. These excuses are used freely and frequently by the Executive, which now has sole discretion to grant planning permission.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand on one hand the Department of Agriculture and Food's new proposed policy on rural development for retention of the population in rural areas while another arm of the State, local authorities, ensures by refusing planning permission that people can no longer live in their native parishes? What is the alternative? The alternative is to move people to large urban centres where sites are unavailable or, due to prohibitive cost, many people cannot afford houses for themselves. We have had the two Bacon reports, yet the situation worsens daily.</P>
      <P>Another matter of concern is the inconsistency in the approach to planning from county to county and from urban to rural areas. For example, last week planning permission was granted on appeal by An Bord Pleanála in Kilkenny city for a development which was in contravention of Kilkenny Corporation's development plan and which had been refused by Kilkenny Corporation on those legitimate grounds. This development involves a well known commercial outlet in a designated residential area in Kilkenny city adjacent to a number of schools where there are serious traffic congestion problems. These matters were fully considered by the planning office of Kilkenny Corporation and the application was justifiably refused by that body. An appeal was lodged with An Bord Pleanála and that body's inspector's report completely vindicated the corporation's stance. Imagine the concern, dismay and anxiety of residents of that area, who are mainly senior citizens, when An Bord Pleanála decided to grant this application on appeal, despite the valid grounds for refusal. I have a copy of that inspector's report.</P>
      <P>I deal with individual applications on a regular basis and make no apology for that. Recently I dealt with the application of an individual wishing to build a home on the family farm. It was refused by Kilkenny County Council and was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Despite the recommendation of the board's inspector to grant permission, the board refused the appeal. Planning permission for a huge development in a residential area is granted on appeal by An Bord Pleanála against the recommendation of its own inspector, while a single house for a person on a family farm, recommended by the inspector, is refused. I could produce numerous similar examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I am aware there is promised legislation in this area and that it is the Minister's intention to initiate major reforms in the planning process by bringing forward a planning Bill. I understand he intends to update and consolidate the planning legislation and I ask him to take a serious look at planning matters.</P>
    <P>Either we are serious about having people live in rural areas to maintain the population balance or we can have everyone living in urban areas, with the associated problems of traffic congestion, population density, overcrowding and consequent social problems. This is at the expense of rural Ireland. The declining population of schools is leading to closures. Post offices are also closing and there is a general decay in rural Ireland. Many Members have spoken about this but we tend to get very little attention.</P>
    <P>Surely in this age of high technology there are systems available for sewage treatment for one-off houses, such as the puraflow system. I understand that an alternative system has been developed in Australia which could be applied in Ireland. This would enable applicants for planning permission to live in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that everyone should be allowed to live in their own region if they so wish and it is imperative that this basic civil right is made available to them. The local elections will be held on 11 June and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is well known for championing the cause of local government and local democracy, particularly the role of the local public representative. If we are serious about enhancing the role of the local representative, we must give them some input into aspects of local government, particularly the planning process. They cannot be given the role of simply endorsing a county development plan put forward by council officials and interpreted solely by them.</P>
    <P>I have always accepted the need for controls and regulations for those of us in public office, but as a member of a local authority since 1974 and a Deputy since 1977, I have concluded that regardless of difficulties in the past the role of the public representative must always be recognised. If that role is abused &ndash; that abuse has been on the part of a tiny minority, not all of those elected &ndash; the electorate would far prefer to see some powers given to that person than to those they never get an opportunity to meet. There must be consistency and fair play. That is a very important message.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this item and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, one of the Minister's priorities when he came into office in 1997 was to carry out a comprehensive review of planning legislation. He has made known in replies to many questions in the House that this review is now coming to an end and that he intends to publish a comprehensive Bill within the next two months to reform and consolidate the planning code in <Col N="1012" /> Ireland. The publication of this Bill will give both the public at large and all Members ample opportunity to debate the legislative code governing the planning system. The publication of the Bill will be one more example of the Government honouring the commitments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium , which stated: &ldquo;it is now time to start the process of updating and consolidating our planning laws to prepare for the challenges of the new millennium&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The review was initiated in August 1997 and has evoked a lot of interest with over 160 submissions being received, many of them very substantial.  A national planning convention was held in November 1997 to discuss the matters arising out of the review. This proved very successful, with a wide range of issues being discussed. The Minister and officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government spent the early part of 1998 drawing up proposals for reform arising out of this consultation phase and, following consideration of these proposals, a broad range of reforms were agreed which were finalised during the latter part of last year. In January 1999 the Government approved the general scheme of this Bill and the Bill is currently at an advanced stage of drafting in the parliamentary draftsman's office. The wide-ranging nature of these reforms which are being brought forward, affecting all aspects of the planning code, will allow the Minister to repeal all existing Planning Acts and replace them by one major consolidated Act containing all primary planning legislation. The Deputy will understand that the Minister cannot pre-empt publication of the Bill by going into detail.</P>
    <P>An effective land use planning system in Ireland must on the one hand cope with the demands of unprecedented economic growth and on the other with increasing awareness of the environment. The Minister has, therefore, stated that the planning system must be strategic in approach, informed by an ethos of sustainable development, and must give high quality performance.</P>
    <P>I will make a general point about our planning system. As development pressures have increased due to our economic success the planning system has been criticised. In fairness to all involved, the system has facilitated cumulative growth in construction output of 63 per cent between 1994 and 1998. Bottlenecks have emerged, however, and the Minister has actively assisted local authorities and An Bord Pleanála in the employment of additional planners by increasing their resources. He intends to keep the issue of resources under constant review. However, the Minister is prohibited under the planning Acts from getting involved in particular cases with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála are dealing.</P>
    <P>Providing extra resources is not sufficient if the planning system is to meet the challenges imposed by a fast changing world. To do so, the system must be reformed, updated, guided by better national planning guidance and underpinned by a modern legislative framework. The <Col N="1013" /> Bill will provide the modern legislative framework while the programme of providing planning guidelines which the Department has embarked upon will provide consistency in approach throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Once the Bill is published during the summer the Minister intends to allow for a further period of consultation before it is discussed in detail in the Dáil. He will seek the views of a wide range of organisations and it is his intention to hold a number of seminars for the benefit of local planning authorities. This will facilitate dialogue with regard to the proposals between the Department and the local authorities who administer planning law on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is much concern among Deputies on all sides of the House regarding the planning process and I will bring the very valid points made by the Deputy to the attention of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Many social welfare recipients in rural areas are concerned about access to pension payments which will no longer be available at local post offices from next year and the proposal of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure local access to payments.</P>
      <P>The stark threat of closure hangs over 1,500 sub-post offices. This threat arises from the Minister's intention to put out to tender from his Department the contract for the payment to beneficiaries of social welfare entitlements . More than 60 per cent of the business of sub-post offices is comprises paying out social welfare benefits. Removing that business will make those sub-post offices uneconomic to run and will sound their death knell.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider who will benefit from his proposal to put out to tender a contract which is worth approximately £30 million to An Post? All the major financial institutions will actively seek this lucrative contract and it is they who stand to gain. If one of the major financial institutions obtains this contract there will be fewer outlets for the payment of social welfare benefits than are currently provided by An Post. All the major banks are rationalising their branch networks and are closing offices in most small towns. In the event of a successful tender by a major bank or building society, all business formerly enjoyed by An Post relating to the payment of pensions will be concentrated in the larger towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of this proposal will be devastating. The post office plays a central role in the life of rural communities, villages and towns. People congregate at the post office where they collect their entitlements and then spend money in their local grocery shops and do the bulk of their business locally. If An Post loses this £30 million contract, pensioners will be compelled to travel long distances to larger towns and the big multi-national supermarket groups will be the main <Col N="1014" /> beneficiaries as their vast profits swell even further. If An Post loses this contract there is a real danger of devastation in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to Question No. 143 this afternoon included this statement: &ldquo;Neither I nor my Department have any strategy to remove this business from post offices&rdquo;. That is a negative reply. I expect a clear, comprehensive policy to retain this business in our post office system from a Minister in an Irish Government, representing a rural constituency. The long-term result of the loss of this contract by An Post would be the dismantling of our post office system. When individual post offices close major protests are made but this proposal threatens all rural post offices. I have confidence in An Post and in this matter the company is being treated most unfairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three requests. First, I ask the Minister to shelve the recommendation that this £30 million contract be put out to tender. Second, I ask An Post to pay its staff a proper salary. Third, I ask An Post to postpone its plan to allow major supermarkets to sell stamps.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Enright and our purpose is to protect rural Ireland. If we lose the small post offices we will have lost another rural institution. We have lost our garda stations and our schools. If we lose the rural post offices, fewer and fewer people will wish to live in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who represents a rural constituency, must understand that if he proceeds with this proposal, small post offices will not survive; many already find survival difficult. Far from allowing them to close, he and other Ministers should seek ways to support small rural post offices. This could be done, for example, by allowing motor taxation payments to be made at post offices. All motor taxation in County Mayo, for example, must be made at a single office in Castlebar and people are forced to queue for long periods when paying their motor tax.</P>
      <P>Sub-post masters and mistresses and their staff provide many social services. They assist people with filling forms and give advice on applications for benefits. The closure of small post offices would be yet another culture shock for rural Ireland. I ask the Minister to abandon this plan. Why should this contract be given to a bank which makes huge profits and does not give a service to rural areas. A bank has refused to provide even a travelling bank service in Achill. Why should they be given responsibility for a service which they will not manage properly? We have seen how badly banks have treated our people for many years.</P>
      <P>Rural post offices, on the other hand, have done an excellent job but they will not survive if this business is taken from them. The Minister must ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to ensure that An Post pays its staff a decent salary and gives them more work to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post is considering doing deals with large supermarkets with regard to national lottery machines while the people of Kilmaine, Killa<Col N="1015" /> walla, Ballintubber to Aughleam in Belmullet &ndash; all thirty miles from their nearest National Lottery machine &ndash; have no access to machines locally. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs must do his duty but An Post also has a part to play.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): I thank the two Deputies for raising this issue. This matter contains two distinct elements. The first is the contract under which my Department currently purchases payments delivery services from An Post. The second distinct but related element is the future of the post office network.</P>
    <P>The payments contract to which I have referred is due to expire at the end of this year. Under EU law, large public sector contracts must go to tender. My Department is currently examining the various legal and other considerations which arise in this regard.</P>
    <P>An Post is well aware that it will have to compete for this business, as indeed for other aspects of its business in the future. I have no doubt that, bearing in mind its experience and track record, it will compete very effectively for my Department's payments delivery business. Given the legal constraints imposed on me, it would be incorrect for me to say anything more on this issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second issue, namely, the future of the post office network, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, has stated clearly the Government's policy in this area. There are no plans to close rural post offices &ndash; this needs to be said loudly and clearly. The Minister has been to the fore in encouraging An Post, and indeed other State companies, to be ready for the inevitable competition that is coming down the line, including e-commerce. This is not just about what might or might not be required under EU policies, it is a fact of commercial life in this competitive and changing world. Our ability to cope with this environment has been a significant factor in enabling this country to make huge economic and social strides in recent years.</P>
    <P>My Department has had a successful relationship with An Post going back a long number of years. Let me put this in context. An Post is the dominant supplier of payment delivery services to my Department's customers. In 1998 some 46 million social welfare payments were cashed in post offices. This represents 80 per cent of all social welfare payments. The remaining 20 per cent of payments are delivered either by cheque or by direct transfer to customers' personal accounts. My Department is a customer of An <Col N="1016" /> Post. It exercises no supervisory or management role in this regard, as I have no doubt the Deputies are aware.</P>
    <P>In 1992, following much discussion and analysis of An Post's counter services, my Department and An Post entered into a contract which provided the basis for a significant transfer of business from my Department to An Post. That contract reaches the end of its term in 1999. The contract paved the way for a major modernisation programme which involved the development and installation of state-of-the-art computer and telecommunications systems in post offices throughout the country. As part of this contract, my Department contributed £18 million to An Post for investment purposes.</P>
    <P>Over recent years a number of organisations, both national and international, have been in contact with my Department offering alternative and competitive payment delivery systems. This reflects the development of the industry in response to customer choices and preferences. An Post has always acknowledged this &ndash; indeed the recent establishment of the e-commerce division in An Post is a good example of its awareness of new business opportunities through the use of new technologies. In this context An Post has to ensure that its services are both modern and attractive to customers and that its charges are kept in line with those of its competitors.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that my desire is that An Post, as a commercial service provider, should actively and dynamically keep pace with developments. It can do so by providing a range of modern, cost-effective payment options, thus enabling it compete effectively, win new business and meet the changing needs and aspirations of my Department's customers.</P>
    <P>Quality of service and convenient access to payments have always been, and will continue to be, indispensable features of my Department's payments delivery systems. The attractiveness of any proposals for new means of payments delivery will be measured against these standards. I wish to give an absolute guarantee that my Department will require that our customers have convenient access to their payments at a nationwide network of outlets of at least the same size and scale as we use at present.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the sterling service which An Post, through its staff throughout the country, have been providing for my customers. The company, through its staff, has already shown that it can successfully adapt and change. I am confident it will continue to meet the challenges presented by its rapidly evolving marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 May 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I met the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Yasser Arafat, in Dublin on Monday, 3 May. The visit was part of an extensive tour of capitals which Mr. Arafat is undertaking. He was accompanied by the Palestinian National Authority Minister for Planning and International Co-operation, Mr. Nabil Shaath, and the Minister for Information and Culture, Mr. Abdar Rabbo. I had a brief private meeting with President Arafat followed by a working dinner where we were joined by the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>We discussed the current state of the Middle East Peace Process. President Arafat informed me that the Palestinian National Authority is now awaiting the outcome of the Israeli elections. When the elections are over and whatever the results, President Arafat expects that international pressure, particularly from the US, would be put on Israel to meet its obligations. President Arafat believes that President Clinton is personally committed to solving the impasse arising from the non-implementation of the Wye Agreement. I expressed the hope that the peace process would be revived as quickly as possible after the formation of the new Israeli Government. I reaffirmed to President Arafat that together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland remained fully supportive of the peace process and would continue to press for the immediate implementation of the Wye Agreement.</P>
      <P>We discussed the terms of the declaration made by the European Council in Berlin on 24-25 March. President Arafat indicated that this was extremely important in the deliberations of the central committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation which resulted in the deferral of the decision to declare an independent Palestinian state. I informed President Arafat that I had strongly supported the EU declaration and welcomed this decision which was a tribute to his skilful leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Arafat also outlined continuing Israeli practices in relation to, for instance, trade, free <Col N="1018" /> movement of individuals, access to water and the expansion of Israeli settlements.</P>
    <P>I informed President Arafat that the Irish Government is proposing to establish a representative office in Ramallah and that all necessary arrangements would be made to give effect to this. In the context of the representative office, we discussed Irish aid levels to Palestine. Ireland is currently operating an aid programme of about £2 million a year in the occupied territories. I also briefed President Arafat on Ireland's SECCO campaign. While the Palestinian National Authority has no vote in the elections, its support for our campaign would be very beneficial among its Arab neighbours.</P>
    <P>I was happy to accept President Arafat's invitation to become a member of the Bethlehem 2000 Committee. I intend that my membership will signal support for what will be a major world religious and cultural event.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to brief President Arafat on the latest position in the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>

      <P>A number of letters have been received from students in Kilbride national school, County Meath, suggesting that a peace house be built on the site of the Parnell Street bomb as a memorial to all those who died in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974.</P>
      <P>As I am sure you will appreciate there are a number of issues which would need to be considered for such a project to go ahead, for example ownership of the site, funding of the project and implementation of the project.</P>
      <P>The proposal will be considered by the millennium committee in the context of its mandate. It would greatly assist the committee in its consideration of the project if a more developed proposal were submitted to it.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>A total of 25 fatalities were reported to the authority in the construction and construction maintenance sector in 1998. There were 579 non-fatal accidents in the sector reported to the authority and these are estimated to be about a quarter of all reportable injuries sustained in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and part<Col N="1021" /> nership. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 general application regulations and the 1995 Construction Regulations all provide a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed.</P>
    <P>This legislation is enforced in a targeted and proactive manner by the Health and Safety Authority. However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector there must be a stronger partnership approach &ndash; by all the parties at all levels in the sector &ndash; to the issue of safety.</P>
    <P>During 1998 I launched the construction action programme &ndash; this action programme was drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority after consultation with both sides of industry. The programme is designed to address the specific issues surrounding health and safety in the construction sector. Apart from targeted inspections of construction sites, other areas being addressed under this action programme include: scaffolding safety, safety in working with fragile roofs, training of workers, safety representation and role of clients. The authority's programme of work for 1999 plans for 4,300 proactive inspections in the construction sector in 1999.</P>
    <P>The construction action programme is a wide-ranging exercise which seeks to involve all the players, from client to employers and workers, and to highlight their respective roles in improving site safety. In addition, the authority continues to meet regularly with both sides of industry as part of the drive to improve the safety culture of the construction sector at all levels.</P>
    <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally sound legislation which provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety. It is enforced in a targeted manner by the Health and Safety Authority and is complemented by the commitment and activities of the social partners. It is through this continued commitment from all sides that we can bring about real improvement in safety standards.</P>

      <P>The objective of Workplace is to bring together jobseekers unemployed for six months or more and employers for a trial period of up to six weeks with no strings attached on either side.

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring an adequate skills supply to meet the needs of the economy. In 1997 we established an expert group on future skills needs to identify in a systematic way the skills requirements of different sectors of the economy and to advise on the actions necessary to meet those needs. The expert group's first report was completed in June 1998 and dealt with the software and electronics sectors.</P>
      <P>My Department is responding to the expert group's report in a number of ways:</P>
      <P>&ndash;An additional £3.2 million has been allocated to FÁS in my Departments 1999 Estimate to train an extra 730 people for the electronics and software sectors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;Forfás has strengthened its National Skills Awareness Campaign, which is aimed at encouraging second level <Col N="1023" /> students to pursue careers in information technology.</P>
    <P>&ndash;To encourage industry to identify its own training needs, a sum of £3 million is provided in my Department's Estimate this year for a pilot enterprise-led training networks programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures being taken by my Department, the Minister for Education and Science recently announced that 5,400 new places will be provided over the next four years in third level education. This extra provision is aimed at addressing skills shortages in the information technology and electronics sectors. The Minister also launched a £250 million education, technology and investment fund in 1997, to meet the short, medium and long-term needs of technology and high-growth oriented firms.</P>

These programmes are designed to facilitate progression to mainstream FÁS training courses; £1.8 million to create 800 new places on a special tailored training programme for lone parents; £2.5 million to facilitate 4,800 new jobs club places for long-term unemployed people; £0.2 million to facilitate the provision of 400 new jobs club places for lone parents in the FÁS regions of Dublin north and Dublin west; £4.9 million to create 875 new places on the jobs initiative.</P>

    <P>On 4 May I announced 226 new jobs for Donegal in two new IDA Ireland and six Enterprise Ireland backed projects, as follows. PacifiCare Health Systems Incorporated is to set up an insurance processing centre in Letterkenny. It is expected to create 150 jobs within the next two years. PacifiCare plans to be in operation by this autumn. Sterling Fluid Systems is to set up an information technology centre in Letterkenny, creating 16 new jobs. Recruitment has already started. Gundry's Limited Killybegs, is expanding to create 18 new jobs by the middle of next year. Atlantic Marine Supplies Limited Killybegs, is expanding to create seven new jobs by the end of this year. Sean Ward (Fish Exports) Limited, Killybegs, has expanded to create 12 new jobs. Donegal Carpets Limited, Killybegs, will expand to create ten new jobs over the next three year. A newly established company, Scafftex Manufacturing Limited will create seven new jobs at Rossiger, Lifford, by the end of the year. Carrymacarry Networks Limited, Greencastle, is <Col N="1025" /> expanding to create six new jobs by the end of July.</P>
    <P>These projects arise out of intensive promotion activity by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in response to the pending job losses at Fruit of the Loom. I also announced that two further projects in the engineering sector, with potential for 300 new jobs, are at an advanced stage of negotiation. While there is no guarantee of success I am hopeful that these negotiations can be concluded successfully in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Donegal employment initiative is currently finalising a report which I expect to receive towards the end of this month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 43, 86 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the business awareness campaign in relation to the year 2000 computer problem, I have been actively involved with this issue for some time now and I am personally disappointed with the level of preparation by some business sectors.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the awareness campaign involved the distribution of over 100,000 brochures and the organisation of regional meetings around the country last year. This was followed by the current Enterprise Ireland information campaign, which has involved a whole range of activities geared towards getting the small and medium sized companies to take urgent remedial action. To date a total of about £400,000 has been spent on these efforts.</P>
      <P>Despite all of this work, the level of action by small and medium sized companies has been poor. While the recent survey undertaken as part of the Enterprise Ireland campaign showed many positive trends, it has revealed that many companies do not regard this very important issue as a priority and the level of action falls far short of what is required to avoid business problems later.</P>
      <P>For this reason I have decided that the next phase of the Enterprise Ireland campaign will target the sectors which have been least responsive to date, particularly smaller business outside the Dublin area. I was also pleased to announce last week that agreement has been reached with FÁS to provide training grants to firms through its training support scheme in respect of courses on the year 2000 issue.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on many occasions previously, this is a matter on which businesses themselves must take action. While the State has initiated an intensive awareness campaign, the process of actually taking steps to become compliant is entirely a matter for individual businesses and the consequences of their not doing so have been well publicised.</P>
      <P>One of the risks facing companies which do not become compliant is that they may be delisted as suppliers to bigger companies. From the larger company's standpoint, this is an understandable commercial reaction to protect themselves from possible disruption to their supply chain. If companies decide to set such a condition, this would be a business matter between them and their sub-suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other risks for non-compliant companies <Col N="1027" /> included insurance problems, health and safety issues and possible litigation. With regard to any such legal actions against companies, the Government has no proposals to introduce legislation on the subject. I do not consider that this would be an appropriate subject for legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I addressed this House on this issue on 24 March. I assume the Deputy is referring to recent press reports of comments attributed to the chief executive of the Hibernian group regarding a review of its underwriting criteria.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance underwriting criteria are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint and the premiums charged will reflect any material increase in the risk. Increasing use is being made by insurers of technology in segmenting risk categories into more discrete groupings. This technology should give insurance underwriters the tools to examine claims performance with more accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of normal practice in this regard, I <Col N="1028" /> was surprised by the comments attributed by the press to the chief executive of Hibernian Insurance regarding proposed alterations in their assessment of motor risks. I was also concerned at the implications that these alterations may entail for targeted motor insurance policyholders. Accordingly, I requested our officials to urgently seek clarification on the issue from the company. I also forwarded papers regarding this matter to the motor insurance advisory board for its immediate attention and appraisal. The company subsequently assured both the chairperson of the motor insurance advisory board and myself that the Hibernian group did not propose to alter its standard underwriting practices: that it did not intend to inquire into any individual's personal financial circumstances or use such information as a factor in quoting for motor insurance. The company confirmed that their underwriting criteria will continue to be dependent on an individual's historic claims, car type and engine capacity, driver age and experience, gender and whether they live in an urban or rural area.</P>
    <P>In a separate letter to me, Hibernian repeated the assurances they had given to the chairman of the motor insurance advisory board and confirmed that they do not discriminate against customers in selected addresses nor do they discriminate against persons because of their personal borrowing commitments. If that were so, it would raise certain ethical questions and matters of concern in the public interest. I am satisfied that the Hibernian group will continue to assess applicants for motor insurance in the normal manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Insurance Ombudsman is only seven years in existence. Since its establishment in 1992, in all but one year, the number of cases received annually have increased. In my <Col N="1029" /> view, this is a clear indication of the outstanding success of alternative dispute resolution in the insurance sector. I have no doubt that as public awareness of the scheme continues to grow, the number of cases handled by the insurance ombudsman will exponentially increase. Indeed the insurance ombudsman has stated in her report for 1998 that one of her objectives will be to make the scheme better known. I would encourage and support the insurance ombudsman in her objective to improve awareness of the office and its functions.</P>
    <P>As regards the adequacy of the office in terms of protecting consumer interests, it is widely recognised that the office provides an invaluable service to the consumer and that, in developing jurisprudence through the adjudication process, the decisions of the insurance ombudsman have the impact of changing existing sales practices within insurance companies to the benefit of the policyholder. The former insurance ombudsman had estimated that access to the alternative dispute resolution procedure under the scheme had saved the parties involved the equivalent of circa £35 million in legal fees over a five year period reviewed. The insurance ombudsman's annual reports are also a valuable source of information to our Department as regulator of the insurance industry. The insurance ombudsman, in her recent annual report, emphasised the importance of independence and of the provision of resources to carry out her responsibilities in accordance with the terms of reference. She reported satisfaction with the co-operation which she receives from the member companies.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is scope for evolution and development of the existing insurance ombudsman scheme. While this scheme has served the policyholder well, difficulties have arisen which have tended to undermine public confidence in a scheme which is structured and operated by the insurance industry. It is of paramount importance, therefore, that the industry continues to address the structural defects that have given rise to these difficulties. I am hopeful that our previous discussions with the insurance ombudsman's council and our Department's ongoing contact with the council and insurance ombudsman will be fruitful in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would expect that the report of the implementation group for the single financial regulator will contain references to ombudsmen's schemes for the financial sector when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>The Government is determined to ensure that Irish business will be at the heart of the information technology and e-commerce revolution and have taken a number of key initiatives in this regard.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications infrastructure is vital to the development of e-commerce and the Government recently approved the formation of a public private partnership to significantly enhance Ireland's connectivity to the global broadband network. This, together with increased competition in the newly liberalised Irish telecommunications sector, is expected to deliver the necessary competitive low cost telecommunications charges to Irish business.</P>
      <P>On the skills front, the Government has allocated a total of IR£365 million to various educational initiatives designed to provide an additional 5,400 new third-level college places in high technology courses over the next four years. My Department has also allocated an additional £3.2 million to FÁS in 1999 to provide an additional 730 places in electronics and software courses. FÁS is also participating in the recently launched fast track to information technology initiative to help some 3,500 long-term unemployed persons to secure a job in the information technology industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Society Commission, together with the Department of Public Enterprise, IBEC and the development agencies under the aegis of <Col N="1031" /> my Department, are continuing to promote awareness and increasing adoption of information communication technologies.</P>

      <P>The introduction of a national minimum hourly wage is a key priority for Government and one to which I am firmly committed. Immediately on taking up office, I established the national minimum wage commission which subsequently recommended that a target date of 1 April 2000 be set for the introduction of a minimum wage. It is my intention that this target date will be met and considerable progress has been made in this respect.</P>
      <P>Before finalising the necessary legislation, it is important to properly assess the likely impact on the economy as a whole, and on various sectors of the economy, of the introduction of a national minimum wage. In particular, I am concerned to ensure that the measure is introduced in a way which does not damage employment or competitiveness and which lays the foundation for the proper monitoring of the wage after implementation. An interdepartmental group of officials was established to look at some of these issues and their work is well advanced and will provide an important input in determining the final shape of the legislation. Preparation of the legislation is in any event continuing and I am confident that the process will be completed well in advance of the April 2000 deadline.</P>
      <P>Again, I confirm that it is my intention to have a statutory national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour in place on the expiry of Partnership 2000 in April 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The community employment (CE) programme is designed to specifically target a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e. those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means tested payments. These are the persons who are at most disadvantage in the labour market. This targeting maximises the availability of places by part-financing the programme from savings in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In addition, social welfare recipients in receipt of a qualified adult allowance can swap their eligibility entitlement for community employment with that qualified adult allowance. Persons on the new farm assist scheme are eligible for participation in the community employment programme on the same basis as long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>All persons seeking to return to work or enter the workforce can avail of the FÁS employment service for assistance and support in getting a job. They can also participate in a return to work course, or other FÁS courses if places are available, if that is the appropriate course of action for the individual. In many rural areas where there is no training centre, FÁS utilises external training facilities to deliver training.</P>
      <P>Under the P2000 agreement a working group composed of the social partners is examining the overall issue of women's access to labour market opportunities. I understand that the working group, which is chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is expected to report shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently examining the books and documents of six companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Celtic Helicopters Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Kentford Securities Limited.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive final reports on a number of these investigations within the next two months or so.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have appointed an authorised officer to a further three companies. In the cases of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited, I am awaiting the outcome of High Court judicial review proceedings of my decision. On 10 March 1999, I appointed Mr. Gerard Ryan to examine the books and documents of College Trustees Limited, a Guernsey-registered company, and I hope that Mr. Ryan will be given the books and documents that he has specified in the coming weeks. Having regard to the fact that company books and documents have yet to be made available in these cases, it is too early for me to speculate as to when this work might be completed.</P>
      <P>Five reports of companies undertaken by or on behalf of my Department have been completed, and those relating to Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990, and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989, have so far been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand that in both cases, the director has referred the matters to the Garda Síochána for investigation.</P>
      <P>The reports into Garuda Limited and Faxhill Homes Limited, under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, are being examined at present, and a decision will be made shortly on whether these will be referred to the DPP. My Department is also examining the report on Irish Life plc which was undertaken under the Insurance Acts.</P>
      <P>While the inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited were initiated at my request under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990, they are proceeding under the auspices of the High Court. While the inspectors appointed by the court have filed a number of interim reports since their appointment, I understand that it will be some time yet before they will be ready to submit their final report to the High Court.</P>

      <P>The 1999 competitiveness report of the National Competitiveness Council which was published last week contains the following five key messages for Irish enterprise and for Government.</P>
      <P>A complex set of interrelated issues, including serious skills shortages, poor transport infrastructure, underdeveloped environmental infrastructure, inadequate housing supply and unbalanced regional development are now working together to threaten the capacity of the economy to fulfil its medium-term economic potential &ndash; the basis for future social progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's growth performance has been strongly engineered by a highly successful industrial development strategy based on attracting foreign investment. In aggregate terms, Ireland is far less well-placed in achieving enduring competitive advantages anchored in the indigenous sector of the economy, in par<Col N="1036" /> ticular, in terms of overall positioning in key growth sectors, operational scale and capabilities in research and development and innovation.</P>
    <P>While recent developments in the sector are encouraging, Ireland lags behind more advanced economies in telecommunications infrastructure &ndash; a prerequisite for future success in key growth sectors and in particular e-commerce.</P>
    <P>Regulatory reform and competition policy must become more central to efforts to boost the competitiveness of the Irish economy. Market liberalisation has the potential to deliver sustained increases in productivity and living standards in the economy.</P>
    <P>In the transformed competitive environment for the Irish economy in EMU, competitiveness policies, particularly those relating to human resources, research and development and innovation, trade and investment, infrastructure and telecommunications, focused on boosting the economy's potential hold the key to closing the wealth gap with other advanced economies.</P>
    <P>In assessing Ireland's exceptional recent economic performance, the NCC says it is essential to differentiate clearly between the rapid progress that certainly has been achieved and Ireland's absolute standing in terms of key measures of national well-being. GNP per person in Ireland remains around 10 per cent lower than the EU average and up to one-fifth lower than that of the small high-income EU economies. I share the belief of the council that establishing and maintaining competitive advantage is an issue which straddles all facets of the economy in an ever-changing global environment.</P>
    <P>The Government holds the work of the council, which was established in May 1997, on foot of a commitment to the Partnership 2000 Agreement, in the highest esteem and considers its advice to be a valuable input into the continuous process of improving our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As such, the Government has asked the interdepartmental group on competitiveness, set up last year to oversee implementation of council recommendations, to consider this year's report and to prepare a response which will ensure that the council's advice receives appropriate recognition.</P>

      <P>In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis by the Government and the industrial development agencies on the regional dispersal of investment projects. The Border region is a particularly priority location for promotional purposes by IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage investment to the Cavan area, a 23,000 sq. ft. advance factory has been constructed on a site adjacent to Cavan town. This factory is now being actively promoted by the IDA to overseas mobile investors. There have been approximately 20 site visits to the facility in the period since its completion.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current difficulties facing the contract moulding industry are a consequence of signifi<Col N="1039" /> cant changes which have occurred in the sourcing policy of global computer companies. These companies have been demanding a high level of integration of their suppliers and the ability to supply on a global basis. The recent shift within the marketplace in favour of global supply agreements has undoubtedly presented a significant challenge to local suppliers in this sector. The Irish sub-supply network has been successfully built up over the past 20 years and has experienced considerable change since 1996. The Irish based supply companies which have proved to be most vulnerable in these circumstances are those with a high dependency on a single customer or those currently sharing contracts with other global suppliers.</P>
    <P>The recent entry into the Irish marketplace of new overseas companies has also presented a new competitive challenge to the established local supply base in Ireland. These new corporate suppliers have sought to establish a manufacturing base in Ireland in order to meet the requirements of the major computer manufacturers already located here. While continued international growth in the computer sector in 1998 resulted in increased orders of 20 per cent approximately for local suppliers, overall supplier capacity has increased by 200 per cent in both the plastic contract moulding and metal stamping supply sectors as a consequence of the arrival of these new entrants in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should point out that IDA does not make its normal range of grants, i.e. capital and employment grants, available to these new entrants to the country. However, IDA is prepared to offer limited grant assistance to these new companies if this is justified by training needs and if it encourages the companies to locate in priority areas.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to predict future sourcing patterns, it is inevitable that some contraction in the local supply base will occur as business is switched to global suppliers and, consequently, those suppliers whose competitive position is most vulnerable will be unable to sustain their present operations at current levels.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department recently met with representatives of all the development agencies to discuss the strategies required to respond to these difficulties. The industrial development agencies, and in particular Enterprise Ireland through its national linkage programme, will continue to monitor the situation and to work with established supplier companies on an individual basis to try to offset any negative impact and to help them in the restructuring and refocusing of their businesses. In this context Enterprise Ireland is actively searching, through its overseas office network, for technology partners for Irish based mechanical suppliers who exclusively offer contract moulding or metal stamping as a service to their customers. I am satisfied that significant progress is being made on this front.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the unemployment problem and particularly the <Col N="1041" /> long-term unemployment problem in certain parts of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas of Dublin have been designated as such and have the benefit of active partnership companies addressing the problems. In addition, the Government continues to tackle the problem through a range of other initiatives such as the integrated services project in four particular unemployment blackspots; and active labour market initiatives taken under the auspices of my own Department and FÁS including through the employment action plan, the strengthening and integration of our employment services, the FÁS action plan for the long-term unemployed and the whole gamut of initiatives we announced in the last budget.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is a wide range of jobs currently available in the Dublin region and a corresponding range of backup services available to help those most removed from the labour market to progress to a situation where they can rejoin the workforce.</P>

      <Col N="1042" /> These employment figures are an indication of the progress being made on enterprise development in the counties concerned. Furthermore, economic growth is boosting regional prosperity and is having a positive impact on local economies. Evidence of local economic improvement and overall employment expansion, of which agency-assisted job creation is only a part, is also reflected in unemployment data for the counties concerned where, in the two years to March 1999, the numbers on the live register have shrunk by 1,042 or by 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>Government policy places particular emphasis on improving the potential for job creation in less advantaged parts of the country and these counties are expected to retain Objective One status for the next round of structural funds. These counties will also benefit from my intention to ensure there is a greater regional balance in future industrial policy and enterprise investment.</P>

      <P>As announced in my press release of 23 April 1999, I have initiated a six month long enforcement campaign in the hotel and catering industry, the objective of which is to secure compliance by employers in that sector with the relevant statutory worker protection requirements affecting their employees. The campaign is currently under way involving the full complement of ten labour inspectors to the virtual exclusion of all their other inspection work.</P>
      <P>There are a number of distinct elements to the campaign. First, inspectors will conduct random inspections to investigate employers' records and to interview both employers and employees in relation to the compatibility of the terms, conditions and pay of employees with the relevant applicable legislation. In this process a priority will be to ensure that any irregularities discovered are immediately rectified and that, where relevant, arrears of moneys owing to employees are recovered. Legal proceedings will also be instituted, where appropriate, against offending employers.</P>
      <P>Second, there will be an educational and information dimension to the campaign. This will involve my inspectors in giving information and advice, where necessary, in relation to the requirements of the law on individual components of worker protection entitlements.</P>
      <P>Third, a programme of national and provincial advertisements will be operated in conjunction with and as a complement to the activity of the inspectors. The purpose of these advertisements will be to give a high public profile to the campaign in the hope that due note and timely corrective action will be taken by all non-compliant employers notwithstanding that &ndash; by reason of the very resources available to me &ndash; an investigation of each and every employer in the sector is simply not possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In earlier replies to similar questions on this issue I detailed the requirements imposed on employers by the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, and how the Act seeks to protect the welfare of children, persons under 16 years of age and young persons, 17 and 18 year olds. The Act seeks to protect the welfare of young persons in the workplace by requiring employers to keep wages and employment records detailing the hours of work of any such young persons, rest intervals etc. The Act also lays down specific limits as to the hours that can be worked by young persons and prohibits the employment of persons under 18 in late night work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The Act is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. Inspections of employers' records are carried out based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Act and as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Act can be detected by close examination of these records. Inspections take place during normal office hours as the majority of employers carry on business during these hours. Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur a follow-up inspection is usually carried out after a suitable lapse of time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work in relation to the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes most efficient use of the enforcement resources available to me. A comprehensive six month long enforcement campaign commenced by the labour inspectorate last month and focusing on the catering sector nationwide is continuing. It is expected that 1,000 cross legislation inspections will be carried out in the course of this campaign, particular attention being paid to compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken to enforce the 1996 Act with a view to safeguarding the rights of young persons in the workplace. I am conscious of the concerns expressed by various groups in relation to the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons and would urge anyone with information in relation to breaches of the Act to notify the employment rights division of such breaches. I am confident that all such reported breaches will be dealt with expediently and that every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with this and indeed any other employment rights legislation.</P>

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, ensuring the health and safety of employees in Ireland, including employees work<Col N="1046" /> ing in the aviation industry, is primarily the responsibility of their employers.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority inspects places of work to ensure that all relevant health and safety provisions are being complied with. Where contraventions of health and safety legislation come to the attention of the authority, its inspectors have the power to take enforcement action, including the issuing of enforcement notices and the bringing of prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority, as part of its ongoing inspection programme, inspects workplaces in the aviation industry and takes enforcement action as appropriate. The role of the authority in relation to the aviation industry centres on all ground operations, with a more limited role when aircraft are under the control of air crew. In the latter circumstances the air accident investigation branch of the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority play key roles.</P>
      <P>The total number of personal injuries in the aviation sector reported to the Health and Safety Authority over the last five years was 185 in 1994; 164 in 1995; 161 in 1996 &ndash; this included one fatal accident; 80 in 1997 and 120 in 1998. There have been a number of serious accidents to workers at Dublin Airport this year which are currently the subject of ongoing investigations by the authority.</P>

      <P>The Wise Finance Company Limited was incorporated in the UK and registered as a branch in this state on 10 November 1995 under the European Communities (Branch Disclosures) Regulations, 1993. Its directors are Ronald Weisz and Fiona Weisz.</P>
      <P>An allegation that Ronald Weisz was declared a bankrupt in New York State in 1994 was made to my Department. Section 183 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended, prohibits an undischarged bankrupt from acting as a director of a company. As the bankruptcy was allegedly declared in a foreign state, legal advice was sought on the issue of jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I have since been advised that a person declared a bankrupt in the US and remaining undischarged would not be in breach of section 183 by acting as a director in this jurisdiction. Such circumstances are clearly unsatisfactory and will be addressed in the preparation of future companies legislation, and my Department will give the matter its attention in the interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> Part II of the Companies Act, 1990 sets out the limited circumstances in which an investigation of the affairs of a company may take place. Section 8 provides for the appointment by the High Court of an inspector on the application of the Minister where the court is satisfied that there are circumstances suggesting, <i>inter alia</i>, fraud or unlawful activity. Under section 19, the Minister may appoint an authorised officer to investigate a company where she is satisfied that similar circumstances exist. Before contemplating an inquiry using public funds, a wide range of issues need to be taken into account, not least of which is the evidential quality of the allegations. The information available to my Department at the present time does not suggest that the present circumstances meet the requirements for an investigation as laid down in either sections 8 or 19 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that as the law currently stands, it is possible for individuals or companies to act as mortgage lenders without a licence or authorisation from any authority and without any restrictions as to the interest rates they may charge. Both I and the Director of Consumer Affairs are concerned about this situation and my Department has recently begun a review of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, with a view to identifying any gaps in the protection afforded to consumers, including the issue of unregulated mortgage lending.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>There are three task forces of relevance.</P>
      <P>The Clonmel Task Force was established in December 1997 with the principal focus of finding a replacement industry for the Seagate plant. In April 1998 following on the work of the task force I announced an expansion of 200 jobs for Clonmel Healthcare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1988 I announced that Guidant Corporation, a global leader in the medical devices sector, had decided to establish a 518 person project over five years in the former Seagate facility. The <Col N="1048" /> work of the Clonmel task force was brought to a conclusion following this announcement. Guidant Corporation are progressing well and in March 1999, the Taoiseach announced a 700 person expansion project for the company.</P>
    <P>An inter-agency group was established in February 1999 in response to Schiesser's announcement that its Clonmel plant would close on 2 April 1999. The group has met on a regular basis with the objective of finding an alternative industry to take over the building in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>The current position is that Hydrotech, an IDA Ireland client company located in Carrick-on-Suir, have purchased the facility and will be relocating to Clonmel. As a result of this the focus of the inter-agency group has now transferred to Carrick-on-Suir and IDA Ireland will actively market Carrick-on-Suir for new investment.</P>
    <P>I announced the establishment of the North Tipperary enterprise initiative on 28 March 1999 in response to the announcement by C. M. Offray in Roscrea of their decision to close their facility. Two meetings have taken place to date. A brochure has been produced on the Offray facility and the IDA Ireland will continue to market Roscrea for overseas industry.</P>
    <P>Jobs created by client companies of the industrial development agencies in Tipperary in 1997 and 1998 were as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work permit scheme, which is administered by my Department, specifically allows employers to take on non-European economic <Col N="1049" /> area nationals, i.e. persons other than nationals of the member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, where specialised skills are not readily available here or where reasonable efforts have been made, unsuccessfully, to recruit Irish or EEA nationals for particular posts. A total of 5,776 such permits were issued last year.</P>
    <P>I have recently submitted proposals to Government for the introduction of new legislation in regard to the operation of the work permit scheme. My intention is that the scheme will continue to operate on a flexible basis having regard to skill shortages in the Irish economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Commission proposal for a council directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community. This proposal was published in November 1998 and as yet it has not been placed on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council. It is of course, at the discretion of the Presidency of the day to set the agenda for discussions by the Council.</P>
      <P>In Ireland a wide range of statutory provisions for information and consultation is already in place, which addresses areas of vital interest to employees. These provisions include the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, as amended by the Protection of Employment Order, 1996; covering collective redundancies; European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980; certain provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989; transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act, 1996 which applies to large-scale multi-nationals; and particular terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 includes commitments by the social partners and the could I say that Government to the development of partnership at the enterprise level. These include the advancement of information and consultation in the workplace. Indeed many Irish based enterprises are developing employee information and consultation as part of a competitive strategy, which recognises the role and value of employees in business development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> I question the need for such a directive at this time. However, the social partners will be consulted and the text of the directive is currently being examined in preparation for the beginning of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>A training bonus of £25 per week for long-term unemployed people on FÁS training courses was introduced on a pilot basis with effect from 19 April 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bonus is payable to trainees who were on the live register for 12 months or more before commencing training with FÁS. People who progress to such training from community employ<Col N="1051" /> ment will also be eligible for the bonus, provided they were on the live register for 12 months or more immediately prior to commencing community employment.</P>
    <P>The bonus, which is being introduced on a pilot basis for 12 months, is payable in addition to the individual's normal training allowance entitlement and will represent a genuine increase in the training allowances paid to long-term unemployed people.</P>
    <P>The employment action plan, which commenced in September 1998, provides systematic intervention with unemployed people with the objective of re-integrating them into the labour market as quickly as possible. Under the employment action plan, unemployed persons will be offered training, re-training, job placement and other employability measures by FÁS. The plan is being extended this year to include people on the live register for 12 months or more. The extension of the employment action plan will result in more long-term unemployed people being offered training by FÁS.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the numbers of people on existing FÁS schemes and the numbers of long-term unemployed people who may be incentivised to undertake training, it has been estimated that up to 11,000 people could benefit from the allowance.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>Due to the high-risk nature of agriculture, it continues to be an ongoing priority area of activity for the Authority. In 1999 the Health and Safety Authority has planned 1,000 inspections in the farming and forestry sector, which is an increase of 200 over the 1998 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular attention will be paid throughout the year to the promotion of child safety with the assistance of farming organisations, the education authorities and the Garda community liaison service and an emphasis will also be placed by the Authority on encouraging farmers to carry out appropriate risk assessments and to draw up safety statements. In addition, the Authority will <Col N="1052" /> participate in a European campaign on farm safety focusing in particular on safety statements and child safety education and training.</P>
    <P>The authority is organising an information campaign on child farm safety during the 1999 summer season, targeting both safe work and safe play on farms. The Authority, in consultation with relevant interests in the sector, is also currently considering the development of a code of practice on the prevention of accidents to children on farms.</P>
    <P>The Authority has written to all primary school teachers, through the Department of Education and Science, urging them to reshow a video <i>Farming &ndash; a way of life</i>, which was produced and first distributed in 1996. The intention is that this video will be shown before the summer holidays. The video is also accompanied by a teachers manual.</P>
    <P>The Authority's farm safety task force continues to offer guidance to the Authority and to spearhead promotion activities. The members of this task force are drawn from the farming community itself, and they work closely with farming organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICA and Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The Authority this year is also part-funding a Department of Health and Children promotion at the clinical sciences institute, University College Galway. This will involve (a) an evaluated report on the safe tractor driving programme, and (b) the provision of an evaluated farm safety information/activity package for use in primary schools as part of an ongoing agri-sector project.</P>
    <P>The year 1998 was a very tragic one in terms of farm fatalities. There were 26 fatalities, six of which were children. To date in 1999, there have been 12 fatalities, five of which were children.</P>
    <P>As with all sectors of employment, prevention is the key element in tackling workplace accidents and fatalities. Farmers must acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation which carries very specific risks to themselves, their workers and, indeed, their families. As part of the preventative process all farmers should draw up a safety statement and keep existing statements under regular review.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has an extensive range of information material available to anyone seeking advice and guideance and also works closely with all of the major farming organisations. I would encourage all farmers to seek information from either of these sources on how best they can improve their work practices and so ensure the health and safety of both themselves and their families.</P>

      <P>An application was subsequently made to the High Court on 26 January 1998 on foot of a petition of one the company creditors seeking the appointment of a liquidator. This petition was granted at a court hearing on 9 March 1998 with the appointment of Mr. Joseph Moreau, Byrne Moreau Connell, 77 Strand Road, Sandymount, Dublin 4, as the official liquidator. As the court has appointed the liquidator, I have no function in the matter, at this stage.</P>
      <P>The liquidator is now liquidating the assets of the group of companies to pay their admitted debts. The order of priority of payment is determined by the Companies Acts and is subject to the supervision of the High Court. Among his duties will be the responsibility to inquire into the reasons for this company failure and to report to the court. In addition, the liquidator is obliged to file a copy of his accounts in the companies registration office which will then be available for public inspection, on payment of the appropriate fee.</P>

      <P>The European Single Market gives the right to any firm within the European Union to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the EU. This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the Single Market. I have no reason to believe that Irish suppliers are at a disadvantage relative to other suppliers.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive legal framework exists through which anti-competitive behaviour and abuse of a dominant position can be challenged. This framework is enforced at national level by the Competition Authority. Competition in trade between EU member states is covered by Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. These Articles empower the European Commission to intervene in cases where anti-competitive behaviour is suspected. The single market unit of my Department is available to assist any business or citizen who may be experiencing difficulties in exercising their rights in the Single Market.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that Irish suppliers continue to avail of the opportunities which the increasing number of overseas firms in the Irish retail market provide. To this end, Enterprise Ireland administers a supplier development programme which determines, at an individual company level, the appropriate changes required to assist Irish suppliers to respond to the challenges arising from the structural change under way in the market and to take advantage of new opportunities arising.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to a similar question raised by him on 23 March last. In my reply to the Deputy, I outlined that the main element of Ireland's industrial policy has been to seek to move our economy further up the value chain by promoting the quality of our education, skills and overall competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The quality of our educated and skilled workforce is our key advantage in any competition with low labour cost locations for overseas mobile investment. Many companies in Ireland, both Irish and overseas owned, are highly competitive in the international marketplace. Wages, whilst important, constitute only one element of a company's overall costs.</P>
      <P>Obviously companies do, from time to time, make a decision to relocate their facilities. This is generally for a combination of reasons including lack of competitiveness in certain labour intensive operations, consolidations, the availability elsewhere of spare capacity or as a result of mergers and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>The long standing objective of our industrial policy has been to increase overseas companies' commitment to Ireland and our economy. I am pleased to say that we have been increasingly successful in this approach and I see this as the way ahead. The impact on the economy of IDA Ireland supported companies has increased by nearly 20 per cent in value terms in the past four years. This economic impact is a major contributory factor to the high levels of growth in other sectors of the economy. The maintenance of Ireland's low tax regime beyond the year 2010, as recently agreed with the EU Commission will facilitate Ireland's current competitive stance in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we cannot be complacent, being the most open economy in Europe, we are potentially exposed to the impact of any serious and sustained downturn in our key markets. The 150,000 plus new jobs created in our economy over the past three years are encouraging and are clear <Col N="1057" /> indicators of the success of the present approach. The task for the coming years is the prioritisation of ongoing enhancement of the physical / technological infrastructure and the need to continue to expand the range and level of skills in the labour force so that the advances of recent years will continue.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government, through its appropriate agencies, will continue to focus on improving our overall international competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Education Development Committee was established by the then Minister for Labour in June 1992. The original objective of the committee was to develop a pilot programme for adult learners aimed at raising consumer awareness. Members of the committee include representatives from the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Department of Education and Science, the vocational education committees of Offaly and Tipperary North Riding and the curriculum development unit of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, the committee prepared a ten-unit study pack called Consumer Action containing consumer education materials. Consumer Action was piloted in five centres for unemployed and marginalised people during 1993. In 1994, the study pack was expanded to 20 units and piloted in four adult education centres and six post-primary schools. Encouraged by this success, the committee commissioned a report on consumer <Col N="1058" /> education in Ireland and the results of this were produced in a report in November 1997 entitled Towards a Critical Awareness of the Marketplace.</P>
    <P>The committee is currently working on a new project titled Teaching the Consumer. The project is designed &ndash; through the use of CD-ROM and other education materials &ndash; to increase awareness of students and teachers at primary and secondary school level on a wide range of consumer issues. As part of the project, a working seminar was held in February 1999, which was attended by over 30 participants and was designed to give the partners to the project, referred to in my reply to the Deputy's question &ndash; No. 138 &ndash; on 16 February 1999, and other interested parties an opportunity to view and evaluate the draft materials being produced.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, a conference on the project was attended by close to 60 participants from primary, post-primary, further adult and community education interests. Two keynote speakers addressed the conference and workshops organised on the day focused on the importance of experiential learning in increasing critical consumer awareness. An editorial board has now been appointed with the task of producing a CD-ROM for the project and written materials are being sent to a number of pilot centres for evaluation and feedback. The project is scheduled to run from 1 September 1998 to 31 August 1999.</P>
    <P>Through the students and the providers of the materials it is expected that the information will extend outwards to a larger group of consumers, especially those in the disadvantaged and marginalised groups. The materials will be used in the national network of adult and youth education centres.</P>

This turbine was driving a pump, which handles a solution used to remove carbon dioxide from process gas. Process gas is a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and water.

      <P>On 6 April 1999, a WTO panel ruled that the EU revised banana import regime is non-WTO compatible. The panel assessed the damage to US interests at $191 million, which is less than half the amount of sanctions threatened by the US. On 9 April, the US published a revised hit list of European products to reflect the panel's findings, which would be subject to 100 per cent tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I are monitoring the <Col N="1060" /> impact of these sanctions on Irish exporters. Some products of importance to Irish exporters which featured on the US preliminary list, including greeting cards, chandeliers and pigmeat, are now no longer affected, and therefore, the impact, if any, of the sanctions has been considerably lessened.</P>
    <P>The EU has until 13 May 1999 to comply with a WTO ruling that its ban on hormone treated US beef is not scientifically based. The EU ban was introduced in 1989 on consumer health grounds and extends to live animals and meat to which any of six hormones have been administered. The EU is currently conducting further scientific studies to assess the health risks attached to use of these hormones. However these studies will not be completed by 13 May.</P>
    <P>On 22 March, the US published a preliminary list of products which would be subject to 100 per cent tariffs if the EU does not comply with the 13 May deadline, or in the absence of an interim solution being found. It is calculated that US action, on the basis of this preliminary list, would affect an estimated $900 million worth of EU exports annually.</P>
    <P>Irish exports affected could be of the order of £14.6 million per annum spread across a range of products, including beef, pigmeat, poultry meat, cereals, cheese, tomatoes, chocolate, confectionery, jams, mineral waters and adhesives. It must be stressed that the US list is a preliminary one and if the US decides to proceed with these sanctions, it would be required under WTO rules to get WTO authorisation. It would then be open to the EU to seek arbitration on the amount. It is very likely therefore that any final list of products would differ substantially from the current list. I am well aware, however, that for exporters a loss of potential US markets for their products would represent a serious strain on their resources. It is for this reason that every effort needs to be made to avoid any trade sanctions although the threat of such sanctions remains very real.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing discussions within the EU and also between the EU Commission and the US, with a view to resolving the disputes. Ireland is very active in these discussions. We support a WTO compatible resolution of the bananas dispute, which would have regard to our trading interests in bananas. We also hope that an agreement can be negotiated with the US on the beef hormones issue before sanctions are introduced. Such an agreement could entail the negotiation of temporary compensation measures as an alternative to the proposed US sanctions.</P>

      <P>Self-employed people can avail of a number of training schemes operated by FÁS. FÁS evening courses, which are held in training centres around the country, are available to self-employed people. A registration fee is charged for these courses. FÁS also operates the training support scheme which provides financial assistance towards training costs incurred by firms. The training support scheme gives special consideration to small enterprise and owner/manager development.</P>
      <P>Self-employed tradespeople derive benefits from the apprenticeship training programme. Under the standards-based apprenticeship system which was introduced in 1993, apprentices are recruited by employers. During the apprenticeship, off-the-job training is provided in FÁS training centres and in institutes of technology or Department of Education and Science colleges. Although each apprentice remains an employee of his or her employer, apprentices are paid by FÁS during the off-the-job training modules.</P>
      <P>In addition to the provision made by FÁS, self-employed people are also eligible to benefit from management development training arranged by the county enterprise boards and for management development supports provided by Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these schemes function effectively within the overall framework of training provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that I referred in a reply to a previous question to my intention to hold a conference on consumer policy and the Amsterdam Treaty in Dublin in October 1998. I have recently issued a report on the proceedings of the conference, copies of which have been lodged in the Library of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The Consumer Policy Action Plan, 1999-2001, contains details of the Commission's plans in the consumer area for the next three years, under the following headings: a more powerful voice for the consumer throughout the EU; a high level of health and safety for EU consumers; and full respect for the economic interests of EU consumers.</P>
    <P>A resolution adopted by the Consumer Affairs Council on 13 April 1999 calls upon the Commission to implement the action plan and to have regard for consistency of, and complementarity between, the different Community activities. The resolution also calls upon the Commission to put a specific emphasis on the health and safety of consumers and to protect their economic interests; to ensure a more powerful voice for the consumer; and to ensure that consumer protection requirements are fully understood and taken into account in devising and implementing other Community policies.</P>
    <P>The resolution calls on the Commission and the member states to further develop their dialogue on consumer policy with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of consumer policy measures and to continue improving the development and enforcement of Community legislation.</P>
    <P>The resolution calls upon the member states, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure at national level that consumer protection requirements are taken into account in other relevant policies; and to strengthen, by appropriate means, national consumer organisations. This accords closely with my own thinking, as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, on the way forward for consumer protection in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Government, together with our European partners, are continuing to take a close interest in the trials of Father Leno Sebit, Father Hilary Boma and their co-accused who are being tried in connection with the bombings which took place in Khartoum last June.</P>
      <P>I raised my concerns about the human rights situation in Sudan, including with specific reference to this case, when I met the Sudanese Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Mustafa Ismail Osman in Dublin on 12 April last. I urged that their cases be conducted in accordance with international standards of human rights and justice. I have also raised the subject of the trial at the EU General Affairs Council. At my request, the Irish ambassador in Cairo, who is accredited to Sudan, and the ambassador to the Holy See have been closely monitoring the situation since last year.</P>
      <P>I had been especially concerned that the two priests were being tried by a military tribunal with limited access to their legal representatives and under threat of the death penalty. I am happy to inform the House that they are now thought to be safe from the threat of execution. I also understand that the trial has been moved from the military court to the new constitutional court. I understand, further, that Fathers Sebit and Boma were moved in late April from a military prison to a federal prison. I hope that this will make it easier for them to receive visits and medical attention and to confer with their legal representatives.</P>
      <P>Our continuing concerns about human rights violations in Sudan were taken up at the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, where a specific resolution on this issue was adopted.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue its efforts, both bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners, to urge the Sudanese authorities to treat these cases in accordance with international standards of human rights and justice with a right to appeal. We will closely monitor any future hearings. It is hoped that our efforts can help to ensure a fair trial for those accused as well as contribute to building the confidence necessary for lasting peace with justice for all the people of Sudan.</P>

      <Quest>if those who took voluntary severance and who will receive a pension at the age of 60 will be entitled to the same concessions regarding the availability of shares to Telecom Éireann employees and pensioners as those who are pensioners.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Telecom Éireann employee share ownership plan, ESOP and the forthcoming initial public offering, IPO, of shares in Telecom Eireann. Under the ESOP employees will pay £190 million for a 9.9 per cent shareholding in the company with an additional 5 per cent shareholding acquired for company transformation.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of employee shareholding schemes is to incentivise and motivate employees through giving them a stakeholding in their company leading to improved productivity and increased employee loyalty and interest in their company's commercial success.</P>
      <P>The detailed criteria governing eligibility under the ESOP, including the qualifying service requirement, were matters for the union coalition, representing employees, and the company. In simple terms, these criteria provide that staff who had at least one year's continuous service with the company on 1 November 1998 are eligible to participate in the ESOP. Employees in Telecom Éireann are receiving shares through the ESOP in return for acceptance of substantial changes in work practices, including, <i>inter alia</i>, significant reductions in overtime and subsistence, and the making of pension contributions of 5.3 per cent of salary and the foregoing of the companywide bonus schemes.</P>
      <P>As eligibility for participation in the ESOP requires that all participants make these adjustments or contributions, people who have left the company cannot be participants in the ESOP since they are not in a position to make such adjustments or contributions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the forthcoming IPO, the current situation is that the overall structure of the retail offer is under consideration by the Government and its advisers. Within this, the Government is considering the question of special purchase rights for Telecom Éireann pensioners. I anticipate that a decision in this regard will be announced closer to the time of the flotation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest single impact of the introduction of the euro on agriculture, as on other sectors in the economy, is the fall in interest rates which it has caused. Agriculture is a relatively highly indebted sector and has had a proportionately large gain from lower interest rates. Every 1 per cent drop in rates is worth about £20 million to the sector. As interest rates have already dropped by around 2 per cent due to EMU, this is worth up to £40 million per year to agriculture. This benefit is likely to be long term, as it is generally accepted that euro interest rates will continue to be lower than Irish rates would be outside of EMU. Interest payments now absorb around 10 per cent of farm income as opposed to almost 30 per cent in the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>Substantial benefits will also arise for the agri-food sector due to the elimination of foreign exchange transaction costs and risks on exports to euro countries. This is particularly important as the development strategy for the sector is to maximise exports into these high price countries. The ten other euro countries currently account for nearly 30 per cent of agri-food exports.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1 January 1999 institutional prices and direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy were fixed in ecus. The ecus were converted into national currency by means of agricultural conversion rates, more commonly known as green rates. From 1 January 1999 institutional prices and direct payments have been denominated in euros and, as the conversion rates to the euro have been irrevocably fixed from that date, green rates have been abolished.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, institutional prices have been reduced by 1.125 per cent but this decrease will not necessarily be reflected in market prices.</P>
      <P>The green rates which applied to certain direct payments to farmers, that is, livestock premia, arable aid, farm retirement pensions, rural environment protection scheme payments and certain forestry payments, were frozen in 1995. These frozen green rates were due to lapse on the introduction of the euro. These direct payments, which amounted to an estimated £890 million in 1998, will now be made at the euro rate, which is 5.055 per cent lower than the frozen green rate. The agrimonetary arrangements for the introduction of the euro, which were agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in December 1998 include compensation provisions, whereby gradually reducing compensation will be paid over the next three years.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the measures undertaken by his Department to restore pension parity for retired public employees are available for all those who are affected particularly in view of the report by the National Association of Retired Public Service Employees that one third of pensioners have not had full restoration of pension parity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures taken by my Department have restored pensions parity for the pensioners in question.</P>
      <P>The position is that in June 1997 in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997 the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates; however, in order to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided, as a once-off measure, that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent, or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent. The Government also announced that, because those restructuring pay deals posed major difficulties in applying parity, they were referring the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Initially, there were difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines applied to certain groups of pensioners, particularly in the local authority and health board areas. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department along <Col N="1073" /> with other Departments made every effort to ensure that public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have met representatives of the National Association of Retired Public Service Employees, formerly the Public Service Pensions Action Group, on a number of occasions, most recently in March 1999. The issues now being pursued by that association and other pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy. For example, they want personal long service increments paid to certain serving staff on a personal basis under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel. My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale. This was one of the key criteria set out in the guidelines issued to Departments.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, Government policy in relation to PCW restructuring deals has been determined primarily on the basis of adhering as closely as possible to parity as traditionally applied but with certain adjustments to protect the position of those groups of pensioners who would otherwise lose out because of the nature and complexity of the pay deals.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to the PAYE allowance is governed by section 472 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 &ndash; TCA 1997. The PAYE allowance, currently £1,000 at the standard rate, is  available to ordi<Col N="1074" /> nary employees. It is not available to the self-employed, proprietary directors, or the spouses of those two groups when employed in the business. Section 472 defines a proprietary director as &ldquo;a director of a company who is either the beneficial owner of, or able, either directly or through the medium of other companies or by any other indirect means, to control, more than 15 per cent of the ordinary share capital of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The 1994 Finance Act extended the PAYE allowance to children of the self-employed, including farmers, and of proprietary directors who are genuinely employed in their parent's business. The conditions determining such genuine employment, which are set out in section 472, include a requirement that the person be required to devote substantially the whole of their time to the employment throughout the relevant tax year, and also that the amount paid in respect of the employment should be not less than £3,600 per year.</P>
      <P>The self-employed and proprietary directors, who are the self-employed in an incorporated form, and their spouses do not receive the PAYE allowance because, despite the changes to a current year basis of assessment, it is considered that they still enjoy a more favourable tax regime than ordinary PAYE workers.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total number of self-employed, proprietary directors and wives assisting currently excluded from the PAYE allowance is 216,400, of whom 150,000 are self-employed or spouses assisting self-employed. It is estimated that extending the PAYE allowance to the self-employed, proprietary directors and their spouses, would cost a minimum of £52 million and up to £76 million depending on the extent to which there was an increase in the number of spouses assisting in the family business in order to avail of the PAYE allowance.</P>

This area is near the boiler house and was principally used for tipping ash from the turf-fired boilers and from the hospital incinerator. This use was discontinued in the late 1980s. Engineering and environmental consultants studied the area prior to the sale of the lands and their findings were made known to prospective purchasers.</P>

Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, <Col N="1080" /> and despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services for both children and adults with intellectual disabilities outlined in that document.</P>
      <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional revenue funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, to continue the process of meeting these needs. This funding will provide approximately 320 new residential places; 80 new respite places and 200 new day places. It will also provide additional health related support services for children with autism, continue the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from inappropriate placements and provide additional specialist and other support services. At least £10 million capital funding will also be made available this year from the national capital programme to support these new developments.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to enact any legislation in this area. The question of the possible provision of legislation on the rights of persons with disabilities to services would be a matter in the first instance for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Pre-retirement allowance is a means-tested payment which allows a person aged 55 or over to retire from the labour force and receive a weekly allowance. The person must <Col N="1083" /> be in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment, or be no longer entitled to one-parent family payment or carer's allowance or be separated from his or her spouse and have not engaged in employment or self-employment for the preceding 15 months.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for pre-retirement allowance a person must retire from the workforce and thus will not receive earnings from insurable employment. However, the first £2,000 of savings, the value of investments or any property owned by the applicant other than his or her own home are not assessed as means. There are no plans at present to change the means test for the pre-retirement allowance.</P>
      <P>A person who qualifies for pre-retirement allowance is also entitled to butter vouchers and may be entitled to a fuel allowance, assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and a medical card from the health board.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the living alone allowance of £6 per week is to recognise the extra cost of living alone. It is payable as an addition to weekly social welfare pensions to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments, and who reside alone. The living alone allowance is not payable in conjunction with a pre-retirement allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the expert working group on child care, which was established by the Government under Partnership 2000 to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector and which published its report in February last, included in its recommendations proposals for an integrated package of child care supports for parents in employment, or seeking to access employment or training opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considered that the report of the expert working group provided a good base for discussion on the future development of child care. However it also recognised that child care is a complex issue and that two other reports, the report of the commission on the family and the report of the national forum for early childhood education, which also contained proposals in relation to child care, had to be considered. The Government therefore decided on 2 February last, to establish an interdepartmental committee, which is chaired by my Department and comprises senior officials representing 11 Government Departments, to evaluate, cost and prioritise the child care proposals in all three reports in addition to the Government's own child care <Col N="1085" /> proposal in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The committee is required to report to Government by August this year and has met on six occasions since 15 February last.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that my Department already provides funding for the development of child care facilities through the equal opportunities child care programme. The equal opportunities child care programme has a budget of approximately £6 million made up of EU and Exchequer funding and is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment. While it is targeted primarily at community based projects in disadvantaged areas, it also incorporates an employer demonstration initiative which is currently being developed in conjunction with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity child care facilities for their employees. It involves 21 companies, some forming a consortium with other companies and community projects in their locality, in developing child care facilities for their employees. The total EU-Exchequer funding available for the employer demonstration initiative over the two year period 1998-99 is approximately £850,000.</P>
    <P>My Department last month secured additional EU funding of approximately £1 million for enhancement of the equal opportunities child care programme through expanding the services of the main national voluntary organisations involved in child care, research to develop working models of family-friendly arrangements for use in small to medium employments and for training-staffing grants for the 25 projects in disadvantaged areas being funded under the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget also included measures to facilitate and encourage the supply of child care facilities by employers. The provision of certain child care facilities by employers on a free or subsidised basis will no longer be subject to income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind. Capital allowances have been provided to allow for the write-off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.</P>

      <P>Civil legal aid and advice, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, are provided by the Legal Aid Board from a nationwide network of law centres for applicants who meet the qualifying criteria contained in the 1995 Act and in regulations made under that Act. While the Act provides for payment of a contribution by an applicant, which is calculated in accordance with the regulations, it also provides that the contribution can be dispensed with in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The board operates two law centres in Cork which are located at South Mall and Pope's Quay. They had a staff complement which included four solicitors and five solicitors respectively until July 1998 when they were allocated an additional solicitor post each. This was done in order to help reduce the waiting times at the law centres. Both law centres have a vacancy currently for a solicitor at grade A level, recruitment grade, and the board is in the process of recruiting staff for these vacancies.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the coming months the board intends to extend on a nationwide basis the private practitioner scheme which it has operated in the Dublin area for some years. This should enable the law centres to devote more resources towards non-District Court matters and consequently reduce waiting times. The private practitioner scheme provides a complementary legal service to that which is already available from the law centres in certain family law matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a total of 528 referrals were made to the juvenile liaison office in Waterford during 1998, which represents a 39 per cent increase on the previous year. It would be unsafe to assume, however, that an increase in the number of referrals is matched by a corresponding increase in the amount of crime committed by juveniles.</P>
      <P>Statistics for 1997, the last year for which figures have been published, indicate that the Waterford city area has the highest detection rate for crime in the country, at 61 per cent. This figure represents an 11 per cent increase over the detection rate for 1996, which is, as I am sure the Deputy will agree, a praiseworthy achievement on the part of the local gardaí. It is not surprising against that background that there would be an increase in the number of referrals to the juvenile diversion scheme. This is not to suggest that there are grounds for complacency in regard to the incidence of juvenile crime but we must be aware that statistics for referrals need to be treated with caution as indicators of the changing level of juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following are the principal intervention initiatives operated by the Garda Síochána in the Waterford area: the Garda juvenile diversion programme operates nationally, and provides for the cautioning of juvenile offenders as an alternative to prosecution. To date in excess of 95,000 young people have been cautioned under the programme, and 89 per cent of those cautioned have not been prosecuted before reaching 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that there are two juvenile liaison officers attached to the Waterford district Garda area, who also serve on the following inter-agency working groups in their area dealing with an early school-leavers programme and a family support committee. The former comprises a multi-agency group comprising the local school inspector, health board, school principals and others. The committee has employed a co-ordinator and two other staff, and has targeted a number of schools in the city to work with and the latter, run by Barnardos, is working with families in Ballybeg.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently funding 24 Garda Síochána special projects nationally. These projects aim at identifying young people at risk of involving themselves in criminal or anti-social behaviour in a defined geographical area. Special projects provide a series of intervention and-or prevention programmes with the objective of having an effect on their lifestyle and assisting them in avoiding future criminal behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware Waterford city has two Garda special projects. The first of these, known as the BALL project, has been in oper<Col N="1088" /> ation since April 1996. This project covers the Ballybeg, Larchville and Lisduggan areas of the city. The launch coincided with the deployment of increased Garda resources in neighbourhood policing in this particular area.</P>
    <P>The second such project in Waterford is about to come into operation. Its target area is the Farran Park, St. Catherine's Grange, St. John's Park, Kilcohan and St. Herblain Park areas of the city. Interviews for the post of co-ordinator of this project have just been completed.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána also operates a Garda schools programme, which targets fifth class in primary schools throughout the country. The programme works to develop behaviour that would keep the children safe from accidents and crime. It aims to teach children sensible and responsible patterns of behaviour in order that they may, <i>inter alia</i>, lessen the risks faced by them from crime.</P>
    <P>My Department also helped fund the conference on teenagers and prison in Waterford which was held last November and which published a report recently on juvenile crime issues.</P>

      <P>It is intended in due course to replace the existing Garda station in Ferns, County Wexford, with a purpose-built facility. It will be a number of years before funds become available for this development, and no site has yet been acquired for the proposed new station. The provision of a new station will not affect manning levels or the Garda requirement for a radio telecommunications mast.</P>

      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at Arklow community college, County Wicklow can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes and priority has to be given to the provision of essential classroom accommodation.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group on the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags outlines a number of recommendations which have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations relates to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy school bags</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary level, has initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters have also been distributed to all schools which highlight the potential health hazard of heavy school bags and outline a range of local measures that can be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures which would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
      <P>The question of books being provided in two or more parts is essentially a matter for publishers, who would be influenced in such matters by customer demand. The report of the working group which considered this matter stated that there is currently a demand for multi-level or omnibus textbooks and that such textbooks also tend to be more cost effective. It also stated that the provision of smaller, lighter textbooks, particularly at second level, requires the communication of this demand by parents and teachers to publishers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a scheme of job sharing for primary teachers was introduced in 1997. This scheme provided for job sharing arrangements involving two permanent teachers both based in the same school.</P>
      <P>My Department also approved, on a pilot basis, two job sharing arrangements involving teachers based in different schools. This was primarily to facilitate teachers in smaller schools who could not find a job sharing partner within the school. Initially it was the intention to limit the number of teachers job sharing between schools pending a review of the arrangements. However, there appears to be a consensus among the partners that the scheme is operating satisfactorily, and I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have decided to continue with the pilot scheme for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

      <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides the statutory framework within which the rights of <Col N="1096" /> children with a disability to a proper and complete education service is guaranteed.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Act provides that, the Minister for Education and Science shall ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary sector who have been assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.</P>
      <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend upon the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of full or part-time resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this new development in special education services, coupled with the measures set out in the Education Act, 1998 will ensure that all special needs children receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
