    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have been in constant contact, both directly and on the telephone, with Prime Minister Blair and Northern Ireland's political leaders right through from the end of the summer when agreement was reached on the review of the Good Friday Agreement by Senator George Mitchell.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, Senator Mitchell has this morning issued a statement. Let me quote what he has said about the point he has reached:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of these intensive discussions, conducted over a period of nine weeks, I am convinced that these parties are sincere and <Col N="1331" /> acting in good faith in seeking the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. They want devolution and decommissioning. The problem, of course, is that there are differences among the parties on how those objectives can be achieved.</P>
    <P>My meetings with the parties are well advanced. Consultation with them is the most important but not the only part of the review. Before advancing it further I must meet with the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, since they initiated the review. In addition, I must obtain the assessment of the independent International Commission on Decommissioning, since two of the three principles agreed on June 25 relate to decommissioning; one of them refers specifically to the Commission. Accordingly, I have asked the Commission for its assessment.</P>
    <P>I will meet the Taoiseach in Dublin later today, with the Prime Minister in London tomorrow and with President Clinton later in the week. I will renew my meetings with the parties in Belfast on Monday. I expect to have my report ready shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>I will listen clearly to what Senator Mitchell has to say when I meet him this evening. I have previously set out the Government's view on the importance of Senator Mitchell's review. He is working in a dedicated and determined way and is doing an excellent job in still difficult circumstances. I do not believe it correct to speculate in any way ahead of my meeting him. I simply reiterate at this time the Government's wish for a successful outcome to the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the Taoiseach on an issue which arose recently and is relevant to these questions. Will the Taoiseach raise with the British Prime Minister and Mr. Mandelson the disgraceful decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Six Counties not to prosecute in the case of the four men implicated in the murder of Séamus Ludlow? In light of the failure to prosecute, will the Taoiseach revisit the decision to hold a private inquiry into the Ludlow case and will he acknowledge that, in line with the recommendations of the former Tánaiste, Mr. Wilson, the report of such an inquiry must be published in the absence of prosecutions? The argument for a public inquiry is now, due to the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions, greatly strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the former Tánaiste, Mr. Wilson, acting as commissioner, issued his report he said he believed the review should be in private at that stage. It is probably a fair assessment that he also believed the Director of Public Prosecutions was proceeding with the case. I am not certain of that but that is how I would have interpreted his remarks at the time. I have seen the statement by the Director of Public Pros<Col N="1332" /> ecutions and we are examining the matter. I will raise it with the British Government again. As the Deputy knows, I have met the family and the people who have campaigned about this case over the last 20 years. We will reassess what to do next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that at this juncture it is possible that the least said the better and that the more space left to the participants to reach agreements, without having questions put to them in a stark way that creates a difficulty for some of their supporters, the better? Subject to that general consideration, will the Taoiseach indicate how the Government sees the situation evolving in the event that Senator Mitchell is unable to come up with a complete solution to all the problems? What process does he envisage for solving such problems, if any, that may remain thereafter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy Bruton's question, he is correct and that consideration applies to me as well. The less I say the better&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I appreciate the Deputy raising it. It was an intensive and exhaustive weekend, particularly for the parties and those close to the process. However, there are still difficult issues. The next few days will allow the dialogue to continue. It resumes again next Monday in full form. It is difficult. I do not wish to predetermine what might or might not happen. Needless to say, I hope Senator Mitchell, with the help of the three Governments, can bring this across the line. I do not know if that is possible yet. There are still a few weeks, at least, in that process and I do not want to contemplate what we will do at the other side of it. If that happens, we must pick it up very quickly and I assure the Deputy we will do that. As I said over the weekend on the question of not being over optimistic or over pessimistic, I am heartened that Senator Mitchell, who was to leave in mid-October, is staying &ndash; I think he will stay until he completes his work in the next few weeks. Other than that, I cannot say any more on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree we should maintain a sense of proportion in this regard &ndash; I compliment the media who report on these matters for maintaining one &ndash; in the sense that a huge amount has already been achieved? An important amount remains to be achieved, but the simple passage of time, in many respects, is assisting a process of healing in any event. We should not set ourselves deadlines, however enthusiastic we may be to achieve them, that create artificial disappointment when they are not achieved, rather we should see the whole forest, which is a forest of achievement against a background of a few trees that have yet to be properly cultivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1333" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is a fair way of putting it. It is 14 months today since we were engaged in trying to get the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and the Leader of Sinn Féin to have their first meeting, which at the time was seen as an extraordinary achievement because of the past. Hours and hours of intensive dialogue have taken place between the parties, particularly during the past ten days. They have moved forward an enormous amount and made an enormous amount of progress, but they have not resolved all the difficulties. Some of the key issues, which some people tire of hearing but they should not because they are major difficulties, are still barriers that have to be addressed, but the intensity and friendliness of the discussions, the extent of the assistance parties are giving to each other and the personal relationships that have been built up are quite unbelievable. That does not, however, solve the problems. We still have to achieve the last part, but as I said, certainly they are trying &ndash; the last day we dealt with questions on Northern Ireland, I was asked if I was convinced people were anxious to try to achieve this on their party's behalf.</P>
      <P>Everybody involved &ndash; I include all the pro-Agreement parties &ndash; is doing everything he or she possibly can to resolve the outstanding issues. Those involved have put in a huge amount of work since the bank holiday weekend, which was not a bank holiday weekend in the North. Neither we nor the parties' supporters could have asked them to do any more than they have done. There is no point in going into the details and the effects of all these matters because they are very fluid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Taoiseach does not want to say anything that might be construed as being less than constructive, and I share the view expressed by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in that respect, but I want him to clarify two points. First, from the point of view of this Administration, will he indicate to the House and to those involved in the negotiations taking place in Belfast what will be the timeframe that will result in the transformation of the Constitution to give effect to the referendum that took place last May, in other words, the change in respect of Articles 2 and 3? Can he give an assurance to the negotiators in Northern Ireland that as soon as an executive is established and agreement is reached there will be no delay in this Administration giving effect to the referendum to change the Constitution? Will he outline what will be the timetable for that to become a reality in the South so that some comfort could be derived by the negotiators in respect of that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, will he agree that while it appeared in the past ten to 12 days that there are only two parties to the negotiations, the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin, in reality, they are negotiating a platform carefully constructed by the SDLP, and that it would be a mistake to forget the extraordinary contribution the SDLP has made over <Col N="1334" /> many years and the contribution it has yet to make once this agreement is finally reached?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Articles 2 and 3, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and I have said we will move on that immediately and if it is possible to have the Cabinet meeting on the same day, we will do so. I have made that clear in recent discussions with members of the UUP and other parties.</P>
      <P>On the second issue, I purposely mentioned the pro-Agreement parties because of the direct negotiations. While the main workload is on two parties, all the pro-Agreement parties are needed to achieve this goal. An enormous amount of work has been done. While it is not always right to single out people, I must mention Séamus Mallon because of the position he has held, the role he plays and the positive influence he has on everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach concerned that while the political leaders in Northern Ireland drag on their talks to an excruciating degree, communities, particularly working class communities, are being polarised and a vacuum is being allowed to develop which is being filled by elements actively fostering sectarian divisions? There is an increased tendency, for example, to mark out territory with flags, bunting and painted kerbstones etc., which sends out a signal that people of another creed are not welcome. This is a serious matter. In view of the fact that the Good Friday Agreement sets up structures based on sectarian divisions, does he agree that an agreement between leaders is not sufficient and that it is crucial for the people, particularly those in working class communities who have been affected by the polarisation and sectarianism which has been allowed to develop in recent years, to participate in the peace process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ongoing difficulties and sectarianism. However, a lot of good work has been done both by the political system and community organisations. I welcome the decision by the Bogside residents not to disrupt the Apprentice Boys' Christmas commemorations in Derry, which created difficulties over the past few years. A large number of groups and bodies in Belfast and other parts of the North are trying to find ways to heal the old divisions and to resolve the marching issue. Good work is being done in Portadown to try to find a resolution to the Garvaghy Road and other problems and some progress has been made. There is still tension in some areas and some people have evil intentions. However, a large number of people across the traditional divide are trying hard to find ways to move forward. I am not denying the difficulties, but I would rather highlight the large number of positive groups, organisations, religious and non-religious bodies which are trying to work together and which deserve our support. If partial or full political progress can be made, it would allow <Col N="1335" /> them to strengthen their position in the communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the reasons for sectarianism in Northern Ireland is the two radically opposed views of history held by the two communities who have two different mental maps of the groups to which they belong? A way of defeating sectarianism in the long term would be to work towards a more informed view of history in both communities. Perhaps a millennial all-Ireland study of history would encourage both communities to see from each other's perspective, rather than that of their ancestors, and would move matters forward, not in the short term but in the medium to long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully, that is already happening in some way. As regards the suggestion for a millennial approach, last year's 1798 commemoration was useful as it gave people in the North an insight into that period and its leaders. This commemoration is continuing this year. As regards the millennium project, there is still a focus on the site of the Battle of the Boyne. Although agreement has not been reached, there is a desire that the site be used to enable people to share their history and learn about the teachings of each tradition. The feasibility of this proposal is being assessed but some groups in the North believe it would be helpful. Staff in my Department are researching history projects to which amounts of money, although small, will be allocated. I agree that the more that can be done, the better.</P>
      <P>We should focus our efforts on assisting groups which are working positively to break down sectarian divisions. Given that violence was associated with groups over the years we always highlighted the difficulties. We should change track in the new millennium and highlight the groups which are trying to break down divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty nine thousand Irish people gave their lives in the Great War, most of whom are buried in Flanders and whose graves are tended by the British War Graves Association. Most of them did not consider themselves British, in the sense that the British War Graves Association considers itself British, and fought in the trenches for what was, in their minds, Irish freedom, under the leadership of John Redmond and Major Willie Redmond, who gave his life in 1917. Does the Taoiseach agree that a greater Irish involvement, along the lines of the commemoration at Messines, in tending to the graves of Irish people of both traditions who died in the Great War in Flanders and more regular visits by Irish leaders, including members of the Government, to those graves, might help people in Northern Ireland to see we have a common history, that we share much sacrifice and there is much in history that is painful and unites us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, two years ago I provided the resources for the development of the project at Messines which has been completed, and which the President visited last year on behalf of this country. This year, there were discussions about the maintenance of the monument. I cannot recall the conclusion reached, but we offered the assistance of the Office of Public Works or that resources would be provided to assist in its upkeep. Extra resources were needed to complete the project as there was a shortfall in the budget and we said we would favourably assist. I do not know whether any other projects are proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach is aware there is a proposal for the construction of a wall on which the names of every one of the 49,000 Irish who died would be inscribed, showing exactly what part of Ireland they came from, whether it was Ballymena, Bandon or Ballydehob, along with their surnames, Christian names and units. Those details should be inscribed permanently in a place in Flanders. Would the Taoiseach consider that might be something worth supporting as a means of giving a human face to each one of these 49,000 Irish people, of both traditions, who died for a cause in which they believed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support that, but I would like the original project to be completed, managed and cared for. Although it is not a fault of the people who were involved, such projects can be undertaken and then neglected, as we have seen from reports this year. I would like to see that properly sorted out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the ongoing negotiations in the North &ndash; which, as another Deputy has already said, are moving at a very slow pace &ndash; does the Government intend making a declaration under Article 29.7.3º of the Constitution for the substitution of the new Articles 2 and 3, in the absence of the creation of a Northern Ireland executive, for a new North-South ministerial council, and legislation for the implementation of those bodies to be agreed by the council, and for the actual functioning of those bodies? The people on both sides of the Border, North and South, have voted overwhelmingly for a new shared vision of how this country should be. If, for whatever reason, the parties currently in negotiation in Northern Ireland fail to agree the composition of an executive, does that mean that every other part of the Good Friday Agreement must fall? Or, can the Taoiseach and the Government, under Article 29.7.3º of the Constitution, proceed to alter Articles 2 and 3 as was agreed <Col N="1337" /> and to provide for the ministerial bodies North and South? There will still be Ministers&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quoting from one which you thought was hypothetical. However, I would respectfully suggest to you that the Taoiseach has been asked quite a number of hypothetical questions. I am asking him a similar question. Any similarity with the question that was disallowed is entirely coincidental.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be closed to anything at this stage but my total concentration is on seeing that the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full and that the institutional aspects are dealt with in full. I do not want to get into the argument about what will happen if we do not achieve this, that or the other. At the end of the period we will either be successful or not and at that stage I will look at it, but I do not want to start speculating on it or cause an argument or row about what my view would be if it failed, when my heart says that I do not want to give in until we succeed. So, it is really a pointless exercise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all want these negotiations to be successfully completed and all components of the Good Friday Agreement implemented, can the Taoiseach hold out some measure or glimmer of hope to the people who voted &ndash; 95 per cent in this State and 73 per cent in Northern Ireland &ndash; for that agreement as a single package, that failure to arrive at the consolidation of one component of that package would not result in its abandonment. Will the Taoiseach give some indication, without prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, that the Government will not sit back and allow the entire package to fail because of the failure of one component to be put in place? That is a message of hope the Taoiseach could usefully give to the negotiators at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was just one aspect that would be easy but the whole institutional part of the Agreement is not one aspect. It is the executive, it is how the Assembly will relate thereafter to the executive, it is how we will have a cross-community divide working within that executive, it is how <Col N="1338" /> the North-South bodies operate, it is how the North-South implementation bodies and the British-Irish Council operate. It is not one specific part.</P>
      <P>However, as I said previously in relation to the Patten Commission and human rights legislation, we will continue to try to implement everything contained in it. At this stage, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I are trying to articulate that the way to achieve this is, as the Deputy said, by listening to what the people North and South said. They voted for the full Agreement. All the parties in the North agree, and they continually tell me, that no document in Northern Ireland was ever read, studied and understood as much as the Good Friday Agreement. It is for this reason that it should be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Bruton that at this juncture the least said, the better. I am glad that to a large extent this has been the tone of the House on this occasion. I accept entirely the importance of increasing personal relationships. Does the Taoiseach agree that anybody who has any experience of negotiations finds that this is of paramount importance? This has been the most welcome development in recent times. We often reach a stage where it is easier to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; than &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I hope that might be the ongoing scenario.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Joe Higgins's comments, sectarianism in Northern Ireland is not only a problem now. It has been a problem for 350 years and throughout the history of the Northern Ireland state. Does the Taoiseach agree that probably the best way to diminish sectarianism is to have representatives of the two traditions in Northern Ireland working together in partnership in government in tackling the political, social, economic, cultural and other problems, including sectarianism? Working together is the best way in which sectarianism can be diminished and eventually eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding an executive that would include representatives of Nationalists, Unionists and republicans and which would have the support of Nationalists, republicans, Unionists and loyalists. People would run the administration and geographical area within that executive with devolved powers and they would deal with everyday issues that affect people's economic, social and cultural lives. It would change everybody's lives in the medium term. As I continually argue, people would have a responsibility to support such an arrangement. If people support it, normal politics, of which there has been an absence, would develop. This is why the institutions are so important in terms of the Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I attended the Special European Council in Tampere from 15 to 16 October 1999 with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, who deputised for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi, also attended the Council.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my comprehensive statement to the Dáil on Thursday, 21 October, the aim of the summit was to address the issues of protection, assistance and access to redress, in both civil and criminal matters. The core agenda had three main elements: a common EU asylum and migration policy; a genuine European area of justice and a Union-wide fight against crime. The summit also addressed the development of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and in this regard the nature of the body to be charged with the formulation of the charter was endorsed.</P>
      <P>The body will consist of 62 members drawn from the European Parliament, national parliaments, representatives of Heads of State and Government and a representative of President Prodi. A number of other institutions and representative groups will attend as observers or will be consulted, as will the applicant states. The body will submit the draft charter to the European Council for adoption. The aim of the charter is to bring together, in a single politically binding declaration, all the fundamental rights applicable at Union level to make these rights more visible to the citizens of the Union.</P>
      <P>The meeting offered a useful opportunity for leaders to note the ongoing progress on the enlargement process and to consider informally the matters they will discuss at Helsinki next month. I welcomed the latest reports on the applicant states from the Commission and the proposed revised arrangements for the conduct of the negotiations with individual applicants.</P>
      <P>The leaders also discussed other issues of an international nature which were current at the time of the summit. This provided an opportunity for the European Council to make known its views on the <i>coup d'etat</i> in Pakistan and rejection by the US Senate of the proposal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The ongoing resolution of the situation in East Timor and the conflict in Chechnya were also discussed by Heads of State and Government during their working dinner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Blair on the eve of the summit at which we reviewed the agenda for Tampere and, of course, the current situation in Northern Ireland and the progress of the review being undertaken by <Col N="1341" /> Senator Mitchell. I met with Dr. Walter Schwimmer, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, on 29 October. We discussed Ireland's priorities for our chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which will commence this week when the Minister for Foreign Affairs attends the ministerial session of the Council in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>The political agenda for our Presidency will include the Stability Pact agreed at Sarajevo in July, enlargement of the Council of Europe and the compliance of member states with their commitments and obligations as members of the organisation. We will emphasise the necessity for member states to implement the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. I look forward to Ireland's term of office and believe we can make a positive contribution to the work of the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the matter, there was no row on this issue that involved Irish Government representatives at the Tampere Summit. The representatives of the Swedish Government did not raise the matter with representatives of the Irish Government at the summit, nor did they raise it with me at any time. The Swedish authorities did not make a complaint to the Irish authorities concerning the matter. This was not a money laundering issue, nor was there any question of freezing an account. The evidence given in the District Court disclosed that there was no money left in the account at the time the request was made. The case involved a gross breach of trust and gross embezzlement concerning a trust or investment company. The request sought information concerning transactions of a Bank of Ireland account in the name of Selrex Corporation in June 1997. The request was received on 22 January 1998 and the information sought was furnished on 11 June, approximately six months later. The processing of the case involved the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Chief State Solicitor's office, including counsel, the Garda Síochána and the District Court. This was a new area of work for all of these bodies and the legislative framework was put into effect less than three years ago. The 16 month period breaks down as follows: one month for a response <Col N="1343" /> from Sweden for information needed to meet our statutory requirements; four months for legal advice from the Chief State Solicitor's office and counsel; two months for a reply from the Swedes, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to information sought by counsel; seven months for the Garda to obtain names of witnesses from the Bank of Ireland &ndash; the Garda authorities have been asked to make further inquiries in this matter &ndash; one month for approval by the CSSO to arrange a court hearing; one month between the request for court hearings and the case being heard and a report by the EU team of experts in August on Ireland's arrangements concerning these matters.</P>

      <P>Given that some of the offices concerned, including the Chief State Solicitor's office, come under the aegis of the Taoiseach and not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he does have a ministerial responsibility to the House in the matter. Does the Taoiseach agree what he has just read out is one of the most deplorable litanies of pointless paper-pushing in recent Irish public administration? Does he also agree it is deplorable that an issue that involves the theft of large sums of money from decent Swedish savers should not have been assisted in being brought to a conclusion with greater promptness by the Irish authorities? What action is the Taoiseach taking regarding the delay of four months in furnishing the relevant legal advice and what action is he taking regarding the delay in dealing with the matter in the Chief State Solicitor's office? Is the Taoiseach ashamed of this saga?</P>

      <P>Incidentally, if the Swedish Prime Minister had really thought that it was a burning issue, the Swedes would have raised it very quickly, as they do in other issues. It is a long delay but there are reasons for it. The August 1999 report of the EU team of experts on Ireland's arrangements for mutual assistance was highly complimentary and recommended some streamlining of procedures. The Deputy asked me if we will follow up on that report and streamline procedures. The recommendations have been <Col N="1344" /> accepted and are in the process of being implemented. Prior to this issue being raised, therefore, it was being dealt with. In October of last year, an evaluation report on Ireland by the International Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering was also highly complimentary. I congratulate the agencies of the State on getting such an excellent report from this international body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches the highest priority to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. While very substantial progress has been made, and continues to be made in the implementation of many aspects of the Agreement, it has not been possible to establish the institutions in the absence of an agreed basis for the formation of an executive.</P>
      <P>The review of the implementation of the Agreement, which is being facilitated by Senator George Mitchell, is continuing. The parties have been meeting intensively, in a range of formats. The Government, with the British Government, is maintaining very close contact with Senator Mitchell and the parties and we are doing all we can to support them in their efforts.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, Senator Mitchell today issued a statement. He will meet the Taoiseach, the Minister of State and me later today and we look forward to hearing from him at first hand. On the point he has reached he said:</P>
      <P>On the basis of these intensive discussions, conducted over a period of nine weeks, I am convinced that these parties are sincere and acting in good faith in seeking the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. They want devolution and decommissioning. The problem, of course, is that there are differences among the parties on how these objectives can be achieved. My meetings with the parties are well advanced. Consultation with them is the most important, but not the only part, of the review. Before advancing it further, I must meet the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, since they initiated the review. In addition, I must obtain the assessment of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, since two of the three principles agreed on 25 June relate to decommissioning and one of them refers specifically to the commission. Accordingly, I have asked the commission for its assessment.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>I will meet the Taoiseach in Dublin later today, the Prime Minister in London tomorrow, and President Clinton later in the week. I will renew my meetings with the parties in Belfast on Monday. I expect to have my report ready shortly thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> Senator Mitchell is doing an outstanding job and we are anxious that nothing is said or done to make his job more difficult. Therefore, I hope the House appreciates that, at this sensitive stage, it is not possible for me to enter into further detail on the progress of the review. I am encouraged by the improved atmosphere and by the fact that there is real engagement between the parties on the key substantive issues. I share Senator Mitchell's belief that the parties are sincere and acting in good faith in seeking the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It represents far and away the best opportunity for long-term peace, stability and reconciliation, and it would be a tragedy if that opportunity were not taken in full.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied the ceasefires of the main paramilitary organisations remain intact and that there is no threat to them. However, the activities of extreme paramilitary elements on both sides are a cause for concern and for extreme vigilance on the part of the security forces North and South. I am sure the House will join me in expressing thanks and admiration for the recent outstanding work of the Garda.</P>
    <P>At our meeting a fortnight ago, on Tuesday, 19 October, I reviewed with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, a range of matters, including the Mitchell review, the report of the Patten Commission, the ongoing dispute over the Drumcree parade, and the cases of Robert Hamill and Pat Finucane. In warmly welcoming Peter Mandelson and wishing him well in his challenging new appointment, I place on record a warm tribute to the contribution made by his predecessor, my good friend, Mo Mowlam. The achievement of the Good Friday Agreement and the progress made so far in its implementation owe a great deal to her efforts. She was an outstanding Secretary of State and I am sure the House joins me in extending to her our deepest gratitude, admiration and best wishes for success in the important new position at the Cabinet Office to which she has been appointed.</P>

      <P>Given the sensitive stage of these discussions, I do not wish to pursue the question beyond asking the Minister where stand Articles 2 and 3.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Articles 2 and 3 were the subject of a question asked by the Labour Party leader of the Taoiseach. If I may, I use the well worn phrase, &ldquo;Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo;. As sure as day follows night, the establishment of the executive, having regard to ongoing negotiations, will follow the establishment of the assembly in due course, the North-South implementation bodies will follow the executive, which will be followed automatically by the British-Irish Council, followed by the British-Irish Agreement. The whole package is inter<Col N="1347" /> linked and in that will be triggered Articles 2 and 3, as amended, and agreed to by a massive majority of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan by the military there is a matter of grave concern to the Government. The Government is particularly dismayed by the proclamation of emergency, the suspension of the constitution and democratic structures, and reports of the arrest of Cabinet Ministers. Together with our EU partners we have called on the military to respect the safety and legal rights of those under arrest and to release them without delay. The situation within Pakistan was already complex and marked by political tensions and economic difficulties. The proclamation of emergency and the suspension of the constitution and democratic structures will further exacerbate these difficulties. These extreme measures were condemned by Ireland and its EU partners at the recent special European Council in Tampere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political and economic pressures in Pakistan increased last year as a consequence of the arms race, initiated by India's nuclear tests, which led to the imposition of economic sanctions. Tensions increased further this year as a result of the military clashes in Kashmir, provoked by Pakistan. The absence of civilian control over Pakistan's nuclear weapons, combined with other tension in the region, for example, in Afghanistan, show clearly the dangers of wider regional destabilisation. Continuing dialogue, not confrontation, is <Col N="1348" /> needed between Pakistan and India to resolve the tensions in the region. Both Pakistan and India must join and adhere to the global non-proliferation regime.</P>
    <P>A major ingredient of the crisis within Pakistan has been the extremely difficult economic situation. Pakistan needs the assistance of the international financial institutions, especially the World Bank and the IMF, as well as supportive agreements with the EU and other major trading partners. However, to receive such assistance, Pakistan needs stable and democratic government capable of sustaining an economic reform programme. In the absence of these conditions, the necessary financial and other support will not be forthcoming. Pakistan was on the verge of signing a trade and co-operation agreement with the EU, but this has now been postponed indefinitely as a result of the military coup. The immediate restoration of democracy and the rule of law is in the best interest of the Pakistani people and will be crucial in preserving the stability of Pakistan and the wider region.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The question of Pakistan will remain high on the EU agenda. The General Affairs Council will consider the issue at its next meeting on 15 November. The question of further appropriate measures and the future of development assistance will be considered at that time.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's request for approval for the appointment of a new honorary consul of Ireland in Karachi was made to the Government of Pakistan early in October before the military coup. The primary function of an honorary consul is to provide assistance and protection to Irish citizens, especially in situations of uncertainty or distress. While the number of our citizens resident in Pakistan is no more than 150, the services an honorary consul can provide for them are particularly valuable because there is no resident Irish Embassy there. The practical advantages of appointing a new honorary consul must be balanced against other considerations. Accordingly, I do not see such an appointment as being inappropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say when there will be a response from the Pakistani authorities to our request for approval for the new appointment. As is normal for appointments of this kind, I received representations from interested persons in Pakistan and in Ireland, including from Deputy Ellis, supporting one or other of the 14 possible appointees who were considered.</P>

Can the practice be made public and can those who made representations be made known? It is an area which needs to be open and transparent.</P>
      <P> I acknowledge what the Minister said about the situation in Pakistan being extremely complex. Will he indicate his or his Department's assessment of General Musharraf? Is he on the extreme of Pakistani politics or would he be regarded as a moderate? How soon does the Minister think he, or those backing him, are likely to return Pakistan to civilian authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the philosophy of General Musharraf, the Pakistani military ruler, I recommend an excerpt from today's <i>Financial Times</i> to the Deputy for his perusal. As for his political position in the spectrum, on the basis that he has abolished the Government I presume he is extreme right or so far right that he has fallen off the spectrum. The <i>Financial Times</i> contains an interesting reference on the matter. The heading to the article written by an individual in <Col N="1350" /> Islamabad states, &ldquo;Pakistani Military May Seek Popular Approval&rdquo;. The article states that Pakistan's military ruler may call a referendum in an attempt to secure popular approval for last month's coup, that General Musharraf's remarks were the first indication that the military regime was thinking of seeking electoral support for remaining in power and that Western diplomats said the idea of a referendum was the latest in a series of indications that General Musharraf wished to project a soft image of his regime.</P>
      <P> The appointment of an honorary consul had been recommended to the previous Government but it has yet to be made. I do not know what is the status of the appointment in the context of the military coup. Inquiries are ongoing in that regard. For the information of the Deputies &ndash; I do not wish to diminish Deputy Mitchell's specific question on the issue &ndash; there were 14 candidates for one nomination which was vacated as a result of the resignation of the previous incumbent, a resignation which was effectively called for by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Arising out of that, the then honorary consul took legal proceedings which were subsequently settled on the basis that he would resign which he duly did leaving this vacancy.</P>

      <P>I am aware of statements by some supporters of the Irish team and by the official carrier of the Football Association of Ireland &ndash;  which is not arranging any travel for supporters on this occasion &ndash; about their experiences when the team last played against Turkey in Istanbul in 1991. I have also seen a statement by another Dublin travel agency which takes a more positive and benevolent view of those events and of the prospects for the forthcoming match in Bursa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the announcement of the match was made, the Department was in contact with the Turkish ambassador in Dublin and the Irish <Col N="1351" /> Ambassador to Turkey spoke with the Turkish Government and the Turkish Football Federation. On each occasion, we conveyed our concern for the safety of Irish fans travelling to Turkey for the game. The Department has also been in touch with the Football Association of Ireland on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued on 14 October, the Turkish Embassy in Dublin stated that the Turkish authorities &ldquo;have long since taken measures and perfected their crowd control skills that has put a stop to any kind of inappropriate and/or violent behaviour during football games.&rdquo;. The statement went on to say that Irish footballers and football fans can rest assured that they will be treated as respected and honoured guests in Turkey. The Turkish Football Federation has indicated that it will take all necessary security measures in line with FIFA and UEFA regulations.</P>
    <P>While the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible in today's world to give absolute guarantees of safety on such occasions, the Turkish authorities are aware of our concerns and have indicated their intention to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of Irish citizens attending the match.</P>

      <P>Additional staff will be brought on board on a temporary basis in the Irish Embassy in Ankara. As far as the segregation of supporters is concerned, I understand that approximately 500 Irish supporters will travel to Istanbul and subsequently on to Bursa.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have participated in a number of discussions by EU Foreign Ministers on security and defence issues, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam on 1 May 1999. This treaty incorporates into the Common Foreign and Security Policy the Petersberg Tasks, that is, humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks.</P>
      <P>There is a strong view within the EU, which I share, that the EU should be better able to act at an early stage to prevent and resolve conflict and to prevent and manage the kinds of crises which we have seen in the Balkans during this decade. The Amsterdam Treaty's provisions respond to that viewpoint. The challenge facing the EU is to make a reality of the Treaty of Amsterdam's provisions.</P>
      <P>The Cologne European Council in June, which I attended, adopted an important Declaration on European Security and Defence. The Cologne decisions reflect the EU's wish to give further impetus to the development of the EU's capabilities for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management, on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>The Cologne European Council focused on ways of enhancing the EU's ability to take effective and informed decisions in peacekeeping and crisis management. Various possibilities have been mooted and the Finnish Presidency has taken discussions forward. The Cologne European Council mandated the General Affairs Council to consider how the Western European Union's Petersberg Tasks functions could be adapted and brought into the EU to allow the EU to fulfil its responsibilities under the Amsterdam Treaty in the area of Petersberg Tasks. The Finnish Presidency will submit a progress report to the Helsinki European Council in December.</P>
      <P>Ireland is examining this approach sympathetically since it emphasises the Petersberg Tasks but leaves the Western European Union's Article V, mutual defence clause, to one side. The Cologne declaration explicitly makes clear that the different status of member states in regard to collective defence guarantees will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose, as set out at Cologne, is to increase the EU's ability to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. It is important that all EU members have the right to participate <Col N="1353" /> in the Petersberg Tasks. We welcome, therefore, the Cologne conclusion that the goal is to develop an effective EU-led crisis management in which both allied and neutral members of the EU can participate fully and on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>Discussion has focused, in particular, on the question of setting up a CFSP committee of senior officials in Brussels with expertise in the area of Petersberg Tasks. Also of importance is the issue of the EU's ability and capability to respond rapidly to international crises. In this connection, the Western European Union is currently undertaking an audit of assets and capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. The Western European Union observers are associated with this audit which should be completed before the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    <P>These are issues for further reflection under the Finnish Presidency and subsequently. The current aim of the EU is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000. Security and defence issues within the EU are intergovernmental matters, subject to the sovereign decision of the member states. It is accepted that participation in Petersberg Tasks is a voluntary and sovereign decision for member states in each and every case.</P>
    <P>NATO, which has already welcomed the EU debate in this area, has indicated its readiness in principle to grant the EU direct access to its resources for Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>In a separate but related process, the EU is examining its capacities for non-military crisis management. This issue will also be considered at the Helsinki European Council. The possibility is being considered of a stand-by capacity to pool national civil resources and expertise for responding to crises. Work on this issue is still at an early stage. I very much welcome the objective of this work which will go hand in hand with the work on Petersberg Tasks.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware of the appointment of Javier Solana, the former Secretary General of NATO as the Council of Ministers Secretary General and High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy &ndash; Mr. CFSP &ndash; and his imminent appointment, if it has not already taken place, as Secretary General of the Western European Union. Would the Minister agree that, in view of this development, the Cologne declaration and the report of former Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, former President von Weizacker and Lord Simon in relation to security and defence policy issues, that EU common security and defence policy issues are clearly coming centre stage? Does he agree that it is in Ireland's interests not to allow other member states to make the rules, such as occurred with EMU, which states joining NATO will have to take on? Does the Minister agree that whether or not we participate from the beginning, should any such entity emerge, we should develop a strategic approach which seeks to have the article 5 commitment negotiated as a protocol rather than a <Col N="1354" /> full treaty section, thereby leaving us the option to opt in or out. Has the Minister pursued this line of reasoning, or does he agree it is a line which should be pursued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is a line which should be looked at. With regard to the so-called three wise men's report &ndash; the report by Mr. Dehaene, the former Belgian Prime Minister, a former German President and a Member of the British House of Lords &ndash; I totally reject it. I do not welcome the involvement of the Dehaene group in the defence area nor did I welcome the unhelpful speculation in Brussels prior to the report's publication on 18 October. The Dehaene group's report is not binding on any member state. The Deputy will be aware that the Cologne conclusions clearly entrusted the follow up in the security and defence areas to the Finnish Presidency and, of course, to the General Affairs Council. The Finnish Presidency is to submit a progress report, as I already stated in my answer, to the Helsinki European Council in December. There is no reference in the Cologne conclusions to the Dehaene group. Rather than the so-called three wise men Dehaene group, the issues are being effectively considered by, I would consider, 15 wise men and women of the General Affairs Council led by a very wise women indeed, the Finnish president of that Council.</P>
      <P>As regards Javier Solana, it is clear the Western European Union may well cease to operate by the end of the year 2000. Clearly, Javier Solana will have a responsibility, as &ldquo;Mr. CFSP&rdquo;, for the Petersberg Tasks. It is in this context that I see his role, which would also touch on the Petersberg functions of the Western European Union, which may, as the Deputy will aware and to which I believe he adverted at a previous Question Time, be incorporated into the EU. I would be opposed to any role for Mr. Solana in the mutual defence dimension of the Western European Union, as the Deputy properly states, the so-called article 5 clause. No such proposal has been made in the European Union.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the circumstances surrounding the recent nomination of an Irish consul to Pakistan.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Honorary consuls are appointed in places where the number of Irish citizens requiring consular assistance or protection and/or prospects for the development of economic relations warrants. Their services are particularly valuable in countries such as Pakistan where there is no resident Irish embassy. Persons appointed honorary consul must be well established professional or business people with a knowledge of Ireland who have good contacts in political, administrative and business circles in the country concerned as well as centrally located <Col N="1355" /> premises and other facilities suitable for use as a consulate. Appointments are subject to the approval of the Government of the other country and are made only after careful consideration of the suitability of the appointees.</P>
      <P>The honorary consul in Karachi, appointed in 1988, resigned in May 1998 and the position has been vacant since then. Each person considered for appointment was interviewed by the Irish Ambassador to Pakistan, who lives in Tehran. Some 14 possible appointees in Pakistan, two of them Irish citizens, have been considered. As is normal for appointments of this kind, I received representations from interested persons in Pakistan and in Ireland supporting one or other of those under consideration. Of the two persons considered by the Ambassador and the Department of Foreign Affairs as being the most suitable for appointment, I decided on the one who, in my view, was the better and asked the Ambassador to Pakistan to seek the approval of the Pakistani authorities for his appointment. The formal request was presented to them early in 1999.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that among the reasons for the removal of the previous Irish consul to Pakistan, who took a legal case and whose term of office may well have been terminated during the term of the last Government, although the process commenced before that, was that he had made complaints about Indus Bank and what he considered its unethical business behaviour? Given the apparent connection between this bank and a Member of this House, did the Minister's Department investigate that connection when that Deputy came to nominate a successor, who was conveniently accepted by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the previous incumbent resigned and I believe that was one of the undertakings in the settlement reached between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the individual concerned. As far as the current nominee is concerned, two names were proposed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, as I pointed out to Deputy De Rossa, arising out of 14 names. As between the two, the Ambassador had a preference for the person other than the person I nominated. It is fair to say that at all times arising from questions from the media and elsewhere I have been open, transparent and accountable as far as this appointment is concerned. If the Deputy has any difficulties in that regard, I would be prepared to do my best to help him with whatever answers he may seek.</P>

      <P>Arising from his reply, if 14 persons applied for this job and two names were sent to the Minister and he chose the second on the list rather than the first, is the Minister telling the House that it is coincidental that the person was appointed after lobbying from Deputy Ellis <Col N="1356" /> and that was not relevant? Will the Minister also say why his Department gratuitously leaked the name of the Tánaiste's programme manager as the person supporting the other candidate because that is exactly what happened?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly deny the suggestion that the Department of Foreign Affairs leaked the name of the Tánaiste's special adviser.

To give the Deputy a <i>soupcon</i> of the information put to me on the two individuals concerned &ndash; and I admit Deputy Ellis made a representation on behalf of the individual I propose to appoint, Mr. Ahsan. Commenting on Mr. Ahsan, the Irish Ambassador to Pakistan said: &ldquo;He is socially comfortable and comes across as someone who is used to dealing with a variety of people and has wide experience. The second individual, Mr. Gilani, confirmed the impression he had given on the first occasion I met him of being socially at ease, open and direct and a solid and reliable person&rdquo;. That was the opinion among a number of views expressed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Thomas D. Lyons. Based on that and other information, I made my choice. The matter now rests with the Pakistani authorities for the time being and I await the outcome of their decision with great patience and anticipation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>A report about planning services for Irish emigrants and prisoners abroad, compiled for the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, was published in May 1999. The report contains useful information, observations and conclusions which merit serious consideration by those of us with responsibilities regarding emigrants.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the report's findings, the Episcopal Commission for Emigrants has asked that a task force representative of Government Departments and agencies and non-governmental organisations be established to develop a long-term policy approach to emigration and the needs of emigrants, an approach that would address perceived inadequacies such as the level of funding of Irish voluntary organisations abroad.</P>
      <P>I have told the Director of the Episcopal Commission for Emigrants that I accept many of the report's conclusions and that I will consult the Government about setting up such a task force. The matter will come before the Government shortly. The amounts provided in grants to voluntary organisations serving Irish emigrants in Australia and the United States from the Foreign Affairs Vote and to organisations in Britain from the Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote this year were about 20 per cent higher than in 1998. The Government will continue to support these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the concerns of the Irish Episcopal Commission and others, including the Irish community in Britain, as well as the fact <Col N="1358" /> that there are approximately 800,000 persons of Irish birth living in Britain, would the Minister consider it useful to make a quarterly statement to the House on the issues which affect emigrants? That might make the issue more relevant and more direct interest might be taken in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle enunciated by the Deputy is quite right. We should have more discussion of this matter in the House from time to time. I am not certain if that should be done on a quarterly basis, but a minimum of once or twice a year would be acceptable to me. It is a matter I would urge my Chief Whip to examine in consultation with his colleagues in other parties. It is a very relevant subject and I do not disagree with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 150, 153 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions in the House, human rights is a priority issue for this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. We believe that the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is actively pursuing its human <Col N="1359" /> rights objectives in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and in conjunction with our EU partners, for example, at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly which is currently taking place in New York. In its capacity this year as chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland has sought to promote discussion of human rights issues throughout the world. At the regional level, Ireland will avail of the opportunity provided by its forthcoming chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to focus attention on the human rights role of that institution.</P>
    <P>However, despite the efforts of the international community in international and regional fora such as those I have mentioned, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses &ndash; and for preventing conflicts and humanitarian crises &ndash; are not proving adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of States to ratify relevant international instruments, both human rights and humanitarian law treaties, to a lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems.</P>
    <P>Consequently, as I have already indicated in my response to an earlier question on the prevention of humanitarian disasters, there is a developing debate on how the international community can react most effectively to crisis situations and humanitarian disasters, such as those in East Timor, Kosovo and in a series of conflict situations in Africa.</P>
    <P>This debate is focusing on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for external intervention. In this regard, there is an evident need to reconcile the requirements of international human rights provisions with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention, as established by the UN Charter. Ireland is actively involved in this debate and is currently engaged in discussions with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network. This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the concept of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict. I attended the most recent meeting of this group which took place in New York on 24 September last.</P>
    <P>On another front, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has recently spoken of the need to build support for the principle that massive and systematic violations of human rights should not be allowed to stand, wherever they may occur. Furthermore, the international community should progress from a culture of reaction to one of prevention. Ireland strongly supports these efforts of the UN Secretary General to develop better prevention strategies and to encourage a strong sense of deterrence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that given our membership of the EU Council of Ministers, our pending chairmanship of that Council and our possible membership of the United Nations Security Council, we should use those fora to ensure that word goes out to the genocidal maniacs of the world that they will be called to account for their genocide? The single biggest fear we can arouse in those who wish to commit genocide is that they will be called to account at some point. Will the Minister give the expeditious creation of the international criminal court priority in these fora? Will he seek to press this in every way he can? If those tyrants who commit genocide throughout the world knew they would have to face trial they would be much slower to commit these offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his intervention and I strongly support what he says. He will be aware that I will be taking over the chairmanship of the 41 member Council of Europe next Thursday on behalf of Ireland and I consider this an enormous privilege. When I make my presentation to ministerial colleagues regarding my intended agenda, human rights will be at the centre of that agenda and I will pursue that matter in the context of the flagrant abuses of human rights which have become such a feature of international affairs, as the Deputy said. This has been a particular problem since the end of the Cold War, when we thought most violations of human rights and regional wars would cease.</P>
      <P>That will be central to my agenda as chairman of the Council of Europe. If and when we are elected to the UN Security Council, again I will make human rights part of my stock in trade. The international criminal court is very high on the Government's agenda and is a matter we are seriously concerned with. It is a matter that will receive urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 52, 71, 156, 163 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>Looking first at the question on the efficiency of the Irish aid programme, I draw the attention of Deputies to the peer review of Irish aid carried out recently by the development co-operation committee, or DAC, of the OECD. The report was published in late August.</P>
      <P>The DAC, in its report, notes that Irish Aid sets high standards for its official aid programme. It acknowledges the strong policy basis for the programme and commends the positive Irish performance in putting a partnership approach into practice, especially in the six priority countries. The report goes on to comment: &ldquo;the last DAC review and the present one have traced the impressive process through which Irish Aid has managed to accomplish such volume increases, while simultaneously strengthening the quality and operating professionalism of the programme.&rdquo; The DAC report in effect validates that the programme is on the right lines and operating to the highest professional standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to aid allocations, in 1998 Ireland's official development assistance, ODA, amounted to £139.6 million. The forecast for 1999 is that ODA will reach £178 million, an increase of £38 million. On the basis of a GNP estimate calculated in June last on the old European system of accounts, ESA79, this would have turned out at 0.35 per cent of GNP. However, as Deputies will <Col N="1362" /> be aware from recent replies to parliamentary questions, the Central Statistics Office has adopted a new method of calculating GNP which results in a higher base figure. The expected outturn using the new system, ESA95, is that ODA in 1999 will reach 0.31 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the target for official development assistance, ODA, which is accepted in principle by most donor countries, is 0.7 per cent of gross national product, GNP, a target set by the United Nations. In its programme in 1997, the Government set an interim target to be achieved by 2002 of 0.45 per cent of GNP en route to the UN target.</P>
    <P>The ODA provision has grown substantially in cash terms every year since 1992, from £40 million in that year to £178 million in 1999. For most of that period there has been progress also in GNP terms. Since 1996, because of rapid growth in GNP, we began to experience difficulties in making good progress towards the GNP target despite substantial annual increases in the ODA budget. Deputies will recall much debate on this last year which lead to a multi-annual approach being taken by agreement with the Department of Finance for the next three years.</P>
    <P>Our planned upward trajectory has now been thrown off course by the new system of calculating GNP, ESA95, which has been introduced by the Central Statistics Office. My Department was officially advised in mid September that the old system would no longer be used. This was referred to on 5 October in a reply to Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the introduction of a new system whose impact boosts the GNP figure still further has had an adverse impact on the rate of movement toward the UN target, despite very substantial annual cash increases in funding. We are examining this issue carefully with a view to establishing a new consensus with our stakeholders on progress to the UN goal. However, the most important fact is that we are fully committed to continued substantial volume increases each year in the aid budget with a view to making steady and significant progress to an interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP and ultimately to the UN target of 0.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the total ODA budget comprises payments made by a number of Departments as well as by the Department of Foreign Affairs. It includes, for example, contributions by the Department of Finance to the International Development Association of the World Bank, by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the Global Environment Facility and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the World Food Programme and the Food Aid Convention. The sums contributed are counted as ODA and are non-discretionary as far as the Department of Foreign Affairs is concerned. The bilateral and multilateral aid programme is funded through the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> In order to deal with the challenge of fast growing GNP and the need to ensure steady and substantial growth, agreement was reached last year on significant cash increases in that part of the budget administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs. In so doing, we hoped to achieve and had in sight visible staging posts on the road to the interim GNP target. The agreement relates to subheads C to G of Vote 39, which will be re-lettered A to E in the 2000 Estimates volume. In the three years in question, these amounts, totalling £406 million, are agreed as: 1999 &ndash; £110.374 million; 2000 &ndash; £136.4 million; and 2001 &ndash; £159.2 million. The volume increase from 1999 to 2000 will be over £26 million and from 2000 to 2001 will be almost £23 million. The equivalent amounts for the previous three years were: 1996 &ndash; £77.2 million; 1997 &ndash; £92.459 million; and 1998 &ndash; £103.959 million. Overall official development assistance for those same three years was as follows: 1996 &ndash; £112.066 million; 1997 &ndash; £124.14; and 1998 &ndash; £139.605 million.</P>
    <P>As mentioned above, the best estimate available for ODA in 1999 indicates a figure for the year of £178 million. Given the large number of variable elements involved, we do not at this stage have reliable estimates for the next two years but can be quite clear that there will continue to be steady and significant growth. The real issue here is to ensure that growth in the aid budget is sustained and well managed. A steady and substantial increase each year will allow for proper planning to obtain maximum impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if we are to reach the target of 0.7 per cent by 2007, according to the best estimates of GNP at that time we would need to be contributing in the region of £660 million to development aid? Does she also agree, given that approximately 20 million children die each year from easily preventable diseases, including six million children because of dirty water &ndash; a holocaust a year &ndash; it is shameful that we have not set a date for the GNP target to be met? Does she agree with the proposal I have put forward in the House time and again that we should legislate for that 0.7 per cent target so that she and her successors do not have to go through the annual wrangle in the Estimates with the Department of Finance? No Member of the Dáil represents those 20 million children who die each year. I assure the Minister that if she introduces legislation we will support it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the cross-party consensus in the House, which has existed for some years, in favour of substantial volume increases in ODA to the poorest countries in line with our international obligations and a genuine commitment on the part of all parties to reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent. What has happened since 1996 in particular is that our unprecedented growth has caused complications in our reaching a ratio of ODA to GNP. Notwithstanding the fact <Col N="1364" /> that in 1999 our ODA will reach £178 million, by far the highest amount ever for ODA, because of a new system of calculating GNP, which has been instructed to us by the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand that and absolutely agree with the Deputy. There is broad consensus on that matter, but our staged progress which was in sight for reaching the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP has been set off course by the fact that the calculation or computation of GNP has changed. This has thrown us off the upward trajectory. We are now looking at the development of cohesion and agreement behind a new consensus of how we are going to reach these international targets, particularly the UN target of 0.7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the agreement about the new assessment of GNP was made in November last year, that the negotiations in relation to a rate of 0.45 per cent of GNP happened subsequent to that, that the decision made in terms of last year's December budget was that there would be a 0.45 per cent ratio by 2002 and that for her to come to the House now and say that the 0.45 per cent of GNP has been put off track because of the new assessment of GNP is to mislead the House yet again? We were mislead on 5 October when the Minister's Department, in a written reply by the Minister, Deputy Andrews, indicated that we were on track to reach a level of 0.45 per cent. We are now being told it is not on track because of some new way of assessing GNP, agreed with the EU. However, that agreement was made in November last, before last year's budget and before the Minister was forced by the Minister for Finance to cut the ODA budget.</P>
      <P>Would she not agree that she should insist that the agreement she made with the Minister for Finance for a contribution of 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002 must be complied with? We have the money; there is no reason for it not being complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement reached by me with the Minister for Finance last year was in relation to the subheads administered by my Department. They related to and guaranteed substantial cash increases in volume terms for 2000 and 2001. The figure agreed for 2000 is an increase of £26 million and there is an increase of £23 million for the following year. They are substantial cash increases which are guaranteed by agreement with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> There are other aspects of ODA which are reckonable as ODA but which are the responsibility of other Departments, for example, the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We are working on debt relief measures which will increase our overall ODA and are reckonable for ODA. In the agreement reached last year, we tried to guarantee, regardless of GNP, that there would be substantial cash increases to avoid a situation where there might be cuts in the aid administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>The new system of GNP calculation was flagged in the written reply to Deputy Quinn. My Department was only formally advised that the new calculation of GNP would be used for the year 1999 in mid September. As soon as a question was put down on 5 October, it was flagged that the new system would apply.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is confirming that the Minister for Finance misled her last December in relation to GNP.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that this talk about cash increases is nonsense? Ireland undertook to the United Nations to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. Regardless of how one measures GNP, that is our commitment. Time and time again, the Minister of State has changed her position on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is she aware that the chairman of the Oireachtas sub-committee on development aid has expressed concern that the great fanfare surrounding the Minister of State's £5 million donation to the Kosovo region has resulted in a reduction in the contribution from development aid, particularly EU development aid, to countries in Africa and Asia? Until we meet our 0.7 <Col N="1366" /> per cent of GNP commitment, we will not be able to influence our EU colleagues to do the same and 20 million children will continue to die each year from easily preventable diseases. That has nothing to do with cash increases but with Ireland meeting its obligations and, therefore, being able to put other Governments under pressure to meet theirs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we are having difficulty maintaining our ODA as a percentage of GNP, not only because of our unprecented growth but also because of the new mechanism for calculating GNP. I am examining that with a view to developing a new consensus with our stakeholders as to how we can meet our commitment to reach the UN target.</P>
      <P>In relation to the £6 million for Kosovo, the Deputy appears to be confusing two separate issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government awarded an extra £6 million in emergency humanitarian response last year for the Kosovo difficulties. That is quite separate from the response of the European fund for development. There is a degree of controversy at European level at present that the least developed countries are obliged to suffer as a consequence of extra aid going to East Timor and Kosovo. That is a separate matter from our budget, which was substantially increased last year in order to respond effectively to the Kosovo crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my advocacy of a substantial increase in the budget for overseas development aid, the Minister of State will be aware that I also advocate greater accountability for how that money is spent. In particular, I have sought that the Estimates be redesigned to show the amounts going to NGOs and Irish missionaries. We get a great bang for our buck, so to speak, from those organisations. Does the Minister of State intend to redesign the Estimates to ensure greater accountability and transparency in the expenditure of such funds in future years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's concern about accountability. My political responsibility is not only to increase the aid budget but also to ensure its impact and effectiveness and that includes accountability. We have a good relationship with our NGOs, who are extremely skilled and exercise their talents all over the world on Ireland's behalf. At present, approximately 12 per cent of our budget goes through NGOs but <Col N="1367" /> there is always a demand from them for an increased share of overall ODA. My concern is that long-term development co-operation requires Governments working together on long-term structural improvement and capacity building in Third World countries. I am open to the greater involvement of NGOs and we discuss these matters frequently with our stakeholders and the NGO community.</P>

I have guaranteed cash volume increases over the next three year period. This has been agreed with the Department of Finance, separate from the Estimates process. We are now trying to examine how we can get to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>With regard to the interim target, given the new calculation mechanism of GNP, which has boosted GNP by several percentage points, the staging post of 0.35 per cent this year which we had hoped to reach<i> en route</i> to the target of 0.45 per cent in 2002, will not be achievable. However, we are working towards providing other ODA, apart from through my Department, which will boost our performance towards that interim target.</P>

The campaign went extremely well for her and I hope she has an enjoyable and long service in this House. I also congratulate Deputy Quinn, Leader of the Labour Party and director of elections in the constituency and all the Labour Party members who worked so hard during the campaign.</P>
      <P>There was a good deal of talk about the turnout, but as in the case of the opinion polls, regardless of whether the turnout was 30 per cent, 60 per cent or 90 per cent, proportionately these things work out the same at the end of the day and, regardless of the poll, Deputy Mary Upton would still be here today. Perhaps we have other issues to examine, but they do not have anything to do with her successful election.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton's brother was very well liked on all sides of this House and we all paid our tributes to him. She follows in his footsteps. He was a person of integrity and honour and he proved himself. I have no doubt she will do likewise. She takes on the difficult task of representing people in Dublin South-Central, but it is one she will relish.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I thank our candidate, Michael Mulcahy. As a councillor and a former Senator, he worked very hard for us in that constituency.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party, now enlarged once again, I thank the Taoiseach and the Leader of <Col N="1370" /> the Fine Gael Party for their words of tribute to a successful campaign and to a new and stunning Member of this House. It is a moment of sadness because of the circumstances in which this by-election came about in the first instance. I acknowledge the presence in the House of the family of the late Dr. Pat Upton. They will take some solace in the realisation that his name and memory are being maintained by the successful election, albeit with the low turnout, as the Taoiseach said, of his sister, Dr. Mary Upton. All of us should take some solace from the fact that a person of her calibre with other career options and another life, so to speak, has chosen to participate in the rigours of electoral politics, rigours to which everybody in this House can relate and those of us with families can understand.</P>
      <P>While this is a moment of triumph for the Labour Party, and we have had triumphs and defeats, which has been the experience in democracy of parties on all sides of the House, there is a worrisome implication in the low turnout that has affected all our parties and all our political activists who campaigned to try to persuade people to vote. This may not be the appropriate occasion for the Chair to respond to the suggestion &ndash; perhaps he will consider it at another time &ndash; that we should charge an existing all-party committee to examine ways in which we could make it easier for people to get on to the electoral register and, irrespective of what their choice happens to be, to exercise their franchise and understand what that means. Having regard to the survey produced by the National Youth Council and the comments made by a number of people, it is perhaps time for us, collectively and without in any sense being partisan, to examine how people get on the electoral register in the first instance and how they are facilitated in knowing where, when and how to vote. We take that for granted, but quite a number of people to whom I spoke said they did not know how to vote. It was not a case that they did not know who they wanted to vote for but because they were not sure how to vote they chose not to exercise their option to vote. I do not want that set of observations to cloud or obscure what is for us, in the Labour Party, a very happy day.</P>
      <P>I am immensely proud of the calibre of the newest member of the parliamentary party, who in her own right &ndash; she started last night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;&ndash; will make a significant and qualitatively superb contribution to the proceedings of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach, the Leader of Fine Gael and the Leader of the Labour Party in welcoming Deputy Mary Upton to this House. She fills the seat vacated by the untimely death of her brother, Pat. Pat Upton and I did not always agree, but we had a good deal of respect for each other. He was genuinely respected right across this House and he is sadly missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Upton's election helps to improve the gender balance in this House, which I welcome. It <Col N="1371" /> is good to see five females sitting together behind Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are right behind me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As others said, Deputy Upton brings with her enormous expertise and her contribution will add greatly to the legislative process in this House. We are fortunate that people like her will put their names forward for the democratic process at a time when politics is being heavily criticised in so many quarters.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dismiss any good ideas put forward by Deputy Quinn. I agree we must examine how we can make it easier to facilitiate more people to vote, but a certain complacency has set in at this time of great prosperity. Some people have become so selfish that they could not be bothered voting and that has wider implications.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding many of the difficulties that have emerged, politics has achieved an enormous amount here this century. We need only look to places that do not have democratic political structures in place to know what happens. We ignore the democratic political process at our peril. We need to examine this issue on an all-party basis because it is deeply worrying that fewer than three out of every ten voters entitled to vote last week bothered to cast their votes.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputy Upton every success. I hope she has as long a career in the House as she wishes. She is in a very competitive constituency in Dublin South-Central, which is the case in most constituencies. That constituency is especially competitive, but I have no doubt she is well able for the competition that is ahead of her, as she showed last week.</P>

In the schedule published for the autumn the status of the Bill is described as follows: &ldquo;Bill not being proceeded with at present due to other priorities&rdquo;. There are only two other items of legislation listed for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate to the House whether this Government's policy is the same as the previous one. Will such a Bill be published and, if so, when?</P>

Tá orainn féachaint go géar ar chothrom na féinne a thabhairt do dhaoine atá ag fulaingt faoin eacnamaíocht agus faoin chóras atá i réim faoi láthair. Baineann sin le cúrsaí sláinte, scolaíocht, tithíocht, iompar poiblí, bochtanas agus go leor eile. Ach is beag duine atá ag caint faoi chostas cogaíochta. Má tá an Rialtas i ndáiríre faoi Partnership for Peace tá sé de dhualgas orthu a rá linn cé chomh costasach is atá cogaíocht mar is cogaíocht atá i gceist le Partnership for Peace. Mar shampla, chosnaigh sé £6m ar NATO droichead amháin thar an Danube a scrios i Kosovo agus cosnóidh sé £10m chun é a aththógáil. Chosnaigh an buamáil ar far a rinne NATO i Kosovo £2.6 billiún agus ceaptar gurb é praghas an aththógála ná £30 billiún .</P>
      <P>I gcomparáid leis seo chun íoc as fiacha fiche de na tíortha is boichte ar dhomhan, ní chosnóidh sé ach £3 billiún. Tá fhios againn gur $35 billiún an praghas ar an Phólainn, Poblacht na Czech agus an Ungáir chun íoc as interoperability, mar a thugtar air, sé sin an treallamh míleata ar fad atá le ceannach chun dul in oiriúnt do NATO.</P>
      <P>Ní hamháin go mbeidh Partnership for Peace an-chostasach do mhuintir na hÉireann nuair atá partnership sóisialta i mbaol a bháis cheana féin ach ní bheidh aon smacht dáiríre ag pobal na nÉireann ar ghníomhaíochtaí PfP.</P>
      <P>Níl rud ar bith sa Framework Document ag PfP a deir go mbeidh sainordú na Náisiún Aontaithe riachanach chun tabhairt faoi &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo;. Mar an gcéanna leis na Petersburg Tasks faoi Chonradh Amsterdam. Níl ráite in aon áit go mbeadh sainordú riachtanach.</P>
      <P>Abraimis slán mar sin le daonlathas na tíre i gcúrsaí slándála amach anseo. Comhaontú míleata san Aontas Eorpach a bheidh romhainn. Abraimis slán chomh maith le neamhspleachas intinne agus le meas idirnáisiúnta i measc na dtíortha is boichte. Ar nós &ldquo;Animal Farm&rdquo; le George Orwell is iad Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael agus ceannaireacht Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre na muca sa scéal seo, a bheidh sásta béilí a ghlacadh leis na daoine céanna atá ag imirt cos ar bholg ar chosmhuintir an domhain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá mbeadh Raymond Crotty beo fós táim cinnte go mbeadh Reifreann againn ar an cheist seo. Ach tá spiorad bródúil síochánta Crotty fós <Col N="1383" /> beo i gcroíthe go leor daoine ar nós mo chomhleacaithe sa Chomhaontas Glas agus i gcroíthe go leor grúpaí creidimh, carthanachta, polaitúla agus síochánta a thuigeann go maith gur feall ar phobal na hÉireann agus ar shíocháin domhanda agus ar na Náisiúin Aontaithe é ballraíocht na tíre seo i PfP.</P>
    <P>Is tír bheag sinn. Tá an Cold War thart. Cad tá romhainn mar mhuintir an domhain? Fiacha na dtíortha mbochta? Míchothromaíocht idir daoine saibhre agus bochta? Cad is cóir dúinn a dhéanamh? Tá rogha againn. Is cóir gníomhú faoi na Náisiúin Aontaithe mar idirghabhálaí idir tíortha na hEorpa agus Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá agus ar an taobh eile, na tíortha bochta. Tíortha cosúil linne na tíortha bochta sin, ó thaobh na staire de.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth mar sin go bhfuil PfP ag titim amach? Dar liom, tá an brú ag teacht ón tionsclaíocht airm. Tá an Cold War thart agus tá margaí nua uathu. Níl na Náisiúin Aontaithe ag iarraidh orainn dul isteach sa PfP. Níl pobal na tíre ag iarraidh orainn na billiúin a chaitheamh ag ceannach trealamh míleata. In ionad sin, tá pobal na hÉireann ag iarraidh orainn airgead a thabhairt don chóras sláinte, d'ospidéil, do scoileanna, don chóras taistil phoiblí, to thógáil tithe, do chóras athchúrsáil dráimhaoile, do chórais séarachais, d'áiseanna súgradh do leanaí agus do dhaoine óga, agus mar sin de. Ach tabhair faoi ndeara nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh ar an Dáil labhairt faoi na gnéithe sin go meánoíche mar a tharla coicíos ó shin.</P>
    <P>Deir ceannairí NATO go bhfuil an deighilt idir NATO agus PfP razor thin agus léiríonn an díospóireacht seo go bhfuil an deighilt idir na páirtithe móra sa Tigh seo razor thin chomh maith. D'fhéadfaí an rud céanna a rá faoi na príomh nuachtáin, Irish Times agus Irish Independent ach go háirithe. Ach is mór an deighilt idir ballraíocht na tíre seo i PfP agus an Bhunreacht, go mór mhór Airteagal 27 a luann móráltacht idirnáisiúnta. Cad is móráltacht idirnáisiúnta ann ag cur san áireamh buamáil agus marú leanaí in Iraq agus Kosovo agus gan faic a dhéanamh i Timor Thoir cuir i gcás.</P>
    <P>Deir an Bhunreacht go gcaithfimid a bheith ag gníomhú go síochánta. Ach cad a chiallaíonn &ldquo;go síochánta&rdquo; nuair a chuireann tú PfP agus NATO agus first strike nuclear warfare san áireamh?</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite sa Bhunreacht chomh maith go gcaithfimid a bheith ag gníomhú faoi bhun-rialacha idirndáisiúnta. Ní thuigim é sin nuair nach mbeimid faoi smacht na Náisiún Aontaithe a thuilleadh. Tá ballraíocht na tíre seo i PfP míbhunreachtúil dar liomsa. Gan Reifreann beidh an Dáil seo ag teacht salach ar théarmaí na Bunreachta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le pobal na Gaeilge a labhair amach go tréan le blianta anuas i gcoinne Partnership for Peace. Le cúnamh Dé beidh ar a laghad cúlbhinseoirí i Fianna Fáil ach go háirithe sásta seasamh suas agus a bheith misniúil faoi seo agus gan a bheith ag teacht leis an chlár oibre atá leagtha síos ag na daoine is cumhachtaí ar domhan agus is measa ó thaobh a <Col N="1384" /> bheith ag imirt cost-ar-bholg ar chosmhuintir an domhain.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá i dtosach báire go n-aontaím go hiomlán le gach atá cloiste agam ón Teachta Sargent.</P>
      <P>Some speakers suggested that Fianna Fáil is a party which cannot be trusted and that the failure to honour the commitment to have a referendum on participation in Partnership for Peace shows yet again that the ethos of Fianna Fáil is one of untrustworthiness. I do not agree entirely with that view. There are good and bad in all parties and ignoring commitments or breaking promises is not unique to Fianna Fáil. Unfortunately, it has been a feature at times of all the main parties to make commitments while in Opposition and to do the exact opposite when in power. However, I agree there is something glaringly dishonest about Fianna Fáil's stated position on Ireland's proposed membership of Partnership for Peace prior to the last general election when viewed in the context of the U-turn when the party is in Government.</P>
      <P>To stand for election on the basis of its manifesto, which clearly stated Fianna Fáil's opposition to participation &ldquo;in NATO-led organisations such as Partnership for Peace or the Western European Union&rdquo;, and then shortly after winning the election and taking office to state and do the exact opposite shows contempt not only for the electoral process but for the electorate. It is blatant dishonesty and hypocrisy. It reminds me of a senior figure in Fianna Fáil in my Dublin Central constituency who, in the weeks before the last general election, gave a personal pre-election commitment at a public meeting to a small and vulnerable community that its homes would be protected against the Luas development. This was to be guaranteed by Fianna Fáil if elected to Government. The people at the public meeting were delighted because they respected the senior figure in question and loudly applauded what he said. Unfortunately, that commitment proved to be as empty and false as the commitment to hold a referendum on Partnership for Peace. Neither has been honoured.</P>
      <P>It is such examples of political and moral dishonesty that has politics and politicians at such a low ebb in the eyes of the people. One Deputy described in this debate some weeks ago the anger and distrust he had encountered on the doorsteps in the Dublin South Central by-election. He said it was worse than he had ever witnessed in the past. He was right; when he was speaking he probably did not realise how right he was. Is it any wonder only 28 per cent of the electorate voted? There was a suggestion in the House when the Dáil met for the first time after the last general election, which has been repeated in recent days after the by-election, that a committee might be established to examine why the number voting in recent elections has declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency has one of the lowest turn-<Col N="1385" /> outs in elections. In the local elections, it was not as low as 28 per cent, as in the recent by-election, but it was close to it. While I accept there are many factors involved in the source of this distrust or lack of participation, I am certain the dishonesty of the type to which I referred is a significant element. If people cannot rely on the word of prominent politicians, what is the point of voting? It is one of the most shameful and distasteful aspects of politics today. The media is concentrating on shirts and other items but it should also look at blatant examples of hypocrisy and dishonesty such as the case I outlined because it is much more important.</P>
    <P>The critical question is, why would politicians elected on the basis of clear cut commitments be so dishonest and dishonourable when all that is required to fulfil their pledge is to hold a referendum and allow the people to decide on the important issue for themselves? Why not hold a referendum? In recent times, there have been some obscure referenda. Why not have one on an issue that is of interest to many people? There is only one answer to that question, which is that the Government is convinced it would lose if a referendum was held on the issue of participation in this, as Fianna Fáil called it before the election, NATO-led organisation. This is the reason it will not hold a referendum, or at the very least it believes there would be an extremely high risk of losing the vote. If I am correct, there is an even more important issue involved. The refusal to keep the pledge to hold a referendum is a deliberate and calculated act to subvert the will of the people.</P>
    <P>The wording of the amendment which I and Deputies Joe Higgins, Ó Caoláin, Gormley and Sargent have tabled is straightforward and contains no ambiguity. It adds the provision that the people must first approve such a course of action in a referendum. Since the U-turn on this issue by Fianna Fáil, it has been stated repeatedly that there is no requirement to have a referendum on PfP because it does not involve any constitutional change. Yet the Constitution provides for precisely such an eventuality and specifically provides that referenda may be held on important issues which do not involve change to the Constitution. Article 47.2 states that every proposal, other than a proposal to amend the Constitution, which is submitted by referendum to the decision of the people shall be held to have been vetoed by the people if a majority of the votes cast at such referendum shall have been cast against its enactment. Surely the question of Ireland's participation in a NATO-led organisation is such an issue.</P>
    <P>A NATO report, a study on NATO enlargement published in September 1995, states that active participation in Partnership for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of the enlargement of NATO. In July 1998, NATO's assistant general secretary stated that the new Partnership for Peace is now welded to the new NATO. They are clear on the role and <Col N="1386" /> place of the Partnership for Peace. Given our traditional and unambiguous neutrality, surely even this initial step towards NATO must be of immense significance.</P>
    <P>Ireland has already played an important role in world peace and disarmament. Under the UN flag Ireland has a proud and valued history in peacekeeping throughout the world. Our independence of all military alliances has been one of the key factors in understanding our global acceptance. When the Irish Permanent Representative in Geneva argued the case for Ireland's admission to the Conference on Disarmament earlier this year she stated:</P>
    <P>Because Ireland is not a member of NATO, Ireland enjoys a wide range of friendships with other countries and is, therefore, well placed to act as a bridge builder between different interests.</P>
    <P>A document issued by the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament also points out:</P>
    <P>The fact that Ireland, alone in the EU, has never colonised another country and has itself suffered colonisation may further explain the high standing we enjoy among developing countries.</P>
    <P>In that document Irish CND describes Partnership for Peace as an arrangement among states, not necessarily members of NATO, on a programme of co-operation with NATO. Indeed, President Clinton called Partnership for Peace a force for peace. In this context Irish CND views the NATO formed Partnership for Peace as &ldquo;. a dangerous attempt to upstage and eventually replace the United Nations peacekeeping role.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the arguments most commonly used for Ireland's entry to PfP is the need for what is referred to as the inter-operability of our Defence Forces, yet surely this argument demonstrates that PfP is in reality a partnership for war. The objective of inter-operability, of high-tech weapons, is to provide a boost for the arms industry, which will inevitably fuel war. Surely this context of Partnership for Peace is an appropriate matter to put before the people by way of referendum, as provided for under Article 47.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>While the Fine Gael Party is at least consistent in so far as it is in favour of joining PfP without a referendum, it is fearful that the Irish people might not to wish to join this military partnership. As the main Opposition party it is failing in its responsibility by not insisting that the Government honours the commitment to the electorate given in the Dáil to hold a referendum. I applaud Deputies Fox and Blaney for their support for a referendum.</P>
    <P>Ireland should continue to play an important international peacekeeping role under the flag of the UN. We should concentrate our efforts on strengthening the role of the UN at a time when it is at a fairly low ebb. It appears the US is intent on doing the opposite by undermining the UN <Col N="1387" /> through the creation of a rival force under the control of NATO. Partnership for Peace is a significant step in that direction. No matter what the Government says it will drag Ireland towards a nuclear alliance. The utterances of the Government on this issue are as believable now as its statements when in Opposition.</P>

        <b>:</b> Tá an díospóireacht seo ar siúl le cúpla seachtain anois agus taispeánann sé sin go bhfuil an-shuim ag na Teachtí Dála san ábhar. Taispeánann sé freisin go bhfuil déistin ar an ghnáth Theachta Dála ar an dtaobh seo den Teach mar gheall ar an athrú mheoin a léirigh Fianna Fáil i leith Partnership for Peace. Rinne cainteoirí eile romham tagairt don rud sin.</P>
      <P>Caithfidh mé féin tagairt a dhéanamh don mhéid a dúirt an bheirt chainteoir a labhair romham. Dúirt an Teachta Sargent nach raibh éinne ag caint faoi chostas cogaíochta. B'fhéidir nach raibh, ach i ndáiríre, cad mar gheall ar luach saoil na ndaoine a maraíodh agus luach saoil na bpáistí óga? Éinne a chonaic na pictiúirí uafásacha a bhí ar an teilifís, déarfainn go raibh sé an-thábhachtach dóibh go mbeadh cosaint éigin ag na daoine bochta seo a maraíodh i dtíortha ar fud an domhain. Dúirt an Teachta Gregory gur aontaigh sé go hiomlán leis an méid a bhí ráite ag an Teachta Sargent. Ní raghaidh mé chomh fada leis sin. Aontaím leis an mbeirt acu mar gheall ar an athrú mheoin i Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why both speakers have referred so much to NATO, nor do I understand why Partnership for Peace will always be associated with NATO by its opponents. I fail to see how involvement in peacekeeping can elicit the accusation of being an aggressor. The price of war is high in monetary terms, but the price of peace cannot be costed because we must protect those who need protection. In this regard one only needs to see the pictures of the savagery that has occurred in different parts of the world. We stood idly by and made no effort at protecting those caught up in such conflicts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> I join in the criticism of the Government. When in Opposition it unashamedly played with words and sought an opportunity to take a different line to the then Government. In a speech made in 1996 the Taoiseach asked rhetorically if joining Partnership for Peace would mean the return of British troops to the Curragh and French troops to Bantry Bay. Even if such use of language was meant seriously, it damages the credibility of politicians. In the same speech he said the failure to hold a referendum would amount to a serious breach of faith and was fundamentally undemocratic. It is now clear he did not believe a word of what he said because if he did he could not change his mind to the extent that he has.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael never took the view that there was any doubt about the reasons we should join Partnership for Peace. My party's spokesman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has given a consistent lead on this by advocating that Ireland take its place in peacekeeping. At times peace enforcement may be necessary, but this will not amount to aggressive invasion by way of conquering other countries, even if we had the capacity to take on huge nations in such a process. We can only do what has been done so successfully by many peacekeeping troops, keep the peace and help people to have a better life. Even the genial Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Partnership for Peace was a back door to NATO. These statements should not have been made because they are wrong. Having made these statements, it is a cause for concern that the Government should do such a somersault and not hold a referendum. This indicates, perhaps, that when in Opposition it pays to be extreme and to make reckless and untrue statements. Sometimes people listen to these statements and get wound up about them. People get into power having made statements that they then completely ignore.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why a particular group of people is prepared to take everything that is going. We have been members of the EU for 26 years. We have gone to Europe with empty barrows and come back with barrows full of money. Surely a sense of pride should suggest that we defend our colleagues. I am talking about helping to keep the peace, not being aggressive. Being a member of a football team, for example, suggests a certain comradeship whereby people help each other in order, perhaps, to save a team mate from being kicked black and blue by a bully from the opposition team. There is a sense of comradeship throughout life and I cannot understand how people can talk about being in Europe but not defending Europe.</P>
    <P>If Ireland was invaded in the morning the first thing we would do is appeal to Europe to come to our assistance and defend us. This is understandable because we are not a very strong country. The likelihood of our country being invaded is not great. However, if it happened we would contact Europe or the United States right away to seek defence. Neutrality at that level is a form of moral and physical cowardice. We must be pre<Col N="1389" /> pared to defend ourselves and our friends. If citizens of a country are being ill-treated, we should be willing to help to maintain peace in that country.</P>
    <P>NATO has been linked to Partnership for Peace, yet Switzerland, Finland and Austria, which are as neutral as Ireland, are in PfP. It is amazing that some of our learned colleagues &ndash; Independents and members of the Green Party &ndash; have more of a negative attitude towards Europe and defence than Switzerland, Austria, Finland and a majority of Members in this House. We have been sending troops abroad for many years and they have covered 37 peacekeeping missions for the United Nations. They have not attacked anyone and some of our soldiers have died in defence of other nations. It is gratifying that this country has played a role in helping other countries at that level. It is significant that the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Jerry McMahon, speaking in Trinity College, favoured joining Partnership for Peace and pursuing opportunities for Defence Forces. They have gone abroad and seen what is needed in many countries. They have done what any honourable person with backbone would do; they have helped others who are worse off than themselves. They have not set out to shoot right, left and centre and some have given their lives. A neighbour of mine lost his life while serving in the Congo. This was done in an effort to promote peace for which one can never be criticised. Referring to NATO and other aggressive groups &ndash; although it is debatable whether NATO could be described as aggressive &ndash; and the notion that one is causing war by supporting peace is something I cannot accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. It is noteable that many Deputies have spoken on this issue. That is as it should be but it is noteworthy also that so many Deputies have taken time to come to this House to speak on our entry into PfP. Despite this interest, the real debate which should have been initiated by this Government, is not taking place &ndash; a full public debate ending in a free popular vote, which was promised but has now been jettisoned by Fianna Fáil, would have reflected public concern and the public's right to make a decision on this issue.</P>
      <P>The decision on whether to join PfP belongs to the Irish people, not just to politicians, because in 1997 they went to the polls on the understanding that a referendum was guaranteed by Fianna Fáil. The party was elected but promptly abandoned this commitment. There has been no adequate explanation from the Government as to why it opted for betrayal rather than being true to its promise. It may be that it has succumbed under duress to US interests which are intent on drawing Ireland into the sphere of NATO influence and future NATO membership. It may be, as others have said, that the Government is afraid to face the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Joining Partnership for Peace is not just about a closer relationship with NATO, it is also about loosening our connection with the United Nations. Ireland's role in the UN has been distinguished, notwithstanding the fact that we are a small country. Unlike the richest country in the world, we pay our dues on time. At the UN we have a good track record in relation to the developing world. Our neutrality and our history have defined our contribution towards world peace. Irish soldiers have served and some have died under the UN flag. The current UN Commissioner for Human Rights progressed her role as a human rights campaigner to Irish Head of State and on to international leader at the UN on a seamless and logical route.</P>
    <P>Now we are being asked to join a misnamed Partnership for Peace. This decision would constitute a significant break in the logical progression of our historical relationship with the UN. The UN is clearly a flawed organisation but it has one great strength possessed by no other organisation of its type &ndash; its global nature encompasses everyone regardless of their economic status. Its global ethic offers potential for world peace and conflict resolution based on respect and equality. For that reason alone, we should not move away from building the UN security framework.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, NATO, as its name denotes, concentrates decision-making in the hands of what AFrI describes as an exclusive club of governments &ndash; those traditionally described as first or second world countries. PfP is the child of NATO, regionally specific yet claiming to be global. Its proponents argue that it does not compromise Ireland's neutrality and it is true that joining PfP does not require a constitutional amendment. However, we know from experience in politics that change can occur by way of building blocks erected one at a time, slowly but inexorably, and that small changes can build into one big change over time.</P>
    <P>The importance of this step was acknowledged by Deputy Bertie Ahern in opposition when he said that a decision to join PfP without a referendum would be &ldquo;a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo;. He subsequently changed his story by stating that he had since been advised that a constitutional referendum was not required. To rewrite history, as he did, makes a mockery of the debate. The advice he had available to him before the election was precisely the same advice he had after the election. If he had genuinely thought that a constitutional referendum were needed, it would have been irrefutable. It would not have been simply a breach of faith to make a decision without a referendum, it would have been a breach of law. It would have been, in effect, an illegal act. Deputy Ahern knew that in opposition and he has conveniently forgotten that now that he is in Government.</P>
    <P>This is not an argument about abstract concepts. There are strong proponents in favour of our entry not just into Partnership for Peace but <Col N="1391" /> into NATO, people who have strong vested interests in influencing public policy for private gain. The McEvaddy brothers, for example, who have shown themselves generous to a fault in relation to entertaining the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance this summer, could easily fit into this category. They are keen proponents of NATO membership for Ireland. A recent article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> made it clear when it stated:</P>
    <P>Ulick McEvaddy has confirmed that the McEvaddy brothers US operation has done business with the US military and that the military have been their largest customer in the US. The brothers have supplied the US military with Boeing 707s to be used as part of very sophisticated radar, surveillance and target attack systems.</P>
    <P>Only the most trustworthy of people would be likely to get such contracts. The systems included AWACS and Joint Surveillance Target Radar Systems. These systems were used in the Gulf and Kosovan wars and are at the cutting edge of NATO's technology. Indeed it was the inability of these systems to target efficiently in bad weather that prolonged the war against Serbia. This, it should be emphasised, was not the fault of the planes but of the systems they were carrying.</P>
    <P>In 1996 a report produced by AFRI found that more than a dozen Irish companies had links with the arms trade and the military industry. The number of military export licences issued since then by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has increased from 81 in 1996 to 346 in the first 11 months of 1998. At the root of this debate is a simple question: who will profit from our entry into Partnership for Peace? Who will make the money?</P>
    <P>It is not easy for many people to gauge the importance or otherwise of this question. This is not what anybody would call a bread and butter issue. It is not a parish pump issue. Most of the time, foreign policy is foreign to most of us unless it arises from disaster or war. International commitments or global politics rarely arise as burning issues at any of my constituency clinics, yet with regard to joining Partnership for Peace I have been struck by the approaches that have been made to me as a constituency TD &ndash; the pregnant mother of two children who wants to make her voice heard, not on her behalf but on behalf of her children who she wants to see growing up, and who wants to exercise her right to vote against Partnership for Peace, and the older man who called to my constituency office who is affronted by the fact that the Government is usurping his right to choose. There is also my neighbour, who is sitting in the Public Gallery as we speak, and the UCD students, who have come here today with a petition signed by 2,000 of their fellow students, who are seeking a referendum on Partnership for Peace as was promised. This is the <Col N="1392" /> voice of the young electorate, the people who did not come out to vote in Dublin South-Central. They are certainly a factor in terms of the dwindling numbers who see a reason to come out to vote at election time. This is a political decision in which they are actively seeking to be engaged. These are not the comfortable, the complacent or the selfish to whom Deputy Harney referred earlier. They are committed people who want a choice.</P>
    <P>I want to read a letter I received from a constituent of mine whom I have never met and who has never contacted me. He states:</P>
    <P>I've never written to a TD before. If I'm doing so now, it means that for the first time in my own life, I feel compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>I write to you in the hope that you can make a difference. Bear with this letter. I'm sure you're familiar with most of it but perhaps it can galvanise you into taking further action.</P>
    <P>The circumstances now enfolding at national and international level indicate that people who would not normally intervene through their local politicians must now stand up and be counted. I do this here.</P>
    <P>The present government has turned its back on democracy and I feel that our remaining TDs must now bring pressure to bear to remind it that the electorate is still there to be answerable to after one gains power.</P>
    <P>International peace depends on mutual recognition between different countries and mutual credibility of parties at the 11th Hour negotiating table. At present &ndash; and for a number of decades past &ndash; this 11th Hour negotiating table has been hosted by the universality of the United Nations. It exists to give a platform to ALL nations.</P>
    <P>I speak of course about the present government's plans to have this country join Partnership for Peace (PfP). The situation is stark. The present government promulgated what transpired to be a barefaced lie to the electorate during the last election.</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil's Election Manifesto it clearly stated, &ldquo;We oppose Irish participation in NATO itself, in NATO-led organisations such as Partnership for Peace, or in the Western European status&rdquo;. They were elected on the strength of that manifesto.</P>
    <P>In 1996 Taoiseach Bertie Ahern stated in the Dail that any attempt to join the PfP without a referendum would be a &ldquo;serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What changed his mind since then?</P>
    <P>He continued, &ldquo;While the government may reassure the public that there are no implications for our neutrality, and that may be technically true at this time, it will be seen by other countries as a gratuitous signal that Ireland is moving away from its neutrality and towards incorporation into NATO and WFU in due course&rdquo;. True.</P>
    <P>What changed his mind since then?</P>
    <P>Later, the Taoiseach assured John Gormley <Col N="1393" /> that a referendum on PfP would be held. He has since backtracked on this.</P>
    <P>Again what changed his mind since then?</P>
    <P>Present government claims that PfP is not the same thing as NATO ring hollow. At the 1994 launch of PfP NATO hailed it as playing an important role in the enlargement of NATO itself.</P>
    <P>It was acknowledged that the PfP would play a key role in NATO's expansion.</P>
    <P>Indeed NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe termed the present 'neutrals' in the PfP as 'former neutrals'. A serious development, you will agree. Surely you will agree too that there can be no question of Ireland joining a military alliance based on nuclear weapons?</P>
    <P>What has happened to our humanitarian outlook that distinguishes us from the Superpowers?</P>
    <P>And how does joining PfP square with David Andrews' own Irish New Agenda disarmament initiative in 1998?</P>
    <P>Just words apparently.</P>
    <P>Two points of current relevance: The PfP operates under the authority of the North Atlantic Council. Let's be clear we effectively join NATO's Allied Command when we join PfP and all the silken statements from the government cannot camouflage that simple fact to everybody.</P>
    <P>The PfP brief can go beyond Europe and won't necessarily need a UN mandate &ndash; or at least (as has been demonstrated in the past) the US or NATO's &lsquo;interpretation' of any mandate might differ from what was intended.</P>
    <P>This means that in time it can just as easily help the US and the UK bomb Iraqi civilians on a whim ... and remain outside the sanction of a politically weakened UN.</P>
    <P>While PfP may not need a UN mandate&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to have read the whole letter. My constituent ends the letter as follows:</P>
      <P>This issue is too important for people like ourselves to remain silent. I prefer to stick with being European. I'm also proud to share a healthy revulsion to what is being carried out in countries such as Iraq by the US/UK in the name of &ldquo;Western democracy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Refusing to join the PfP means that we're taking a stand on behalf of those asserting the primary role of the UN (and not that of the US) in peacekeeping (and not seeking partnership in global carpetbagging).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to listen to people such as my constituent and others who are concerned. They have a right to express that concern by voting in a referendum guaranteed by a party facing the electorate. We have <Col N="1394" /> seen many broken promises but this is one the Government should and can face up to. It has carried out many U-turns in the short time it has been in power, but this is one where it could, in a small way in the overall context, redress the balance by ensuring that the people make this decision rather than politicians alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to contribute to this debate although I do not normally speak on matters of foreign policy or security issues. The world is a rapidly changing place in that the old antagonisms between East and West, the Cold War, the world being seen as two superpowers, one US-led and the other Russian-led and a series of attritions no longer apply. We live in a world where the media can bring real evil into our homes. When I see the evil perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic against the Kosovan people, open graves full of skeletons which are the result of mass destruction, women raped and beheaded and appalling breaches of human rights, I say to people opposed to Partnership for Peace that all they offer the people in East Timor, Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda and Algeria is sympathy and nothing else.</P>
      <P>That is something we must all confront because war is an evil. To have a military base and security forces, to arrange premeditated mass destruction, bombing and killing is evil, but it is necessary when faced with the greater evil of genocide, dictatorships and the absence of any form of transparent democracy in regional conflicts. There must be a world policeman, someone to implement UN security resolutions and who can offer something more than sympathy. For too long in this country, many of these issues have been taboo and people in favour of Partnership for Peace have been misrepresented as being in favour of a European army and Irish people coming home in body bags. The fear and dread generated fail to confront the arguments about the type of world we live in, the type of human rights we are to have and how we are to enforce principles of human dignity. Therefore, we cannot resist the temptation to contribute to the debate in a meaningful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a proud tradition of being in favour of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of being a member of the UN. Have we enhanced or diminished our sovereignty by being part of the EU, the UN and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe? I remember in my short period as Minister that I found myself as President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers. It often struck me as unusual that I represented Ireland, which has 1 per cent of the European member states' population, and yet I was in a most influential position, regardless of powerful countries with massive populations, such as the UK, France and Germany. By participating in PfP, the EU, the UN and the Security Council within the UN, we can have an influence on the principles and architecture of European and world security and the principles of human <Col N="1395" /> rights well beyond the scale of our size and population. There is no cogent argument for Ireland remaining outside PfP. To do so would be damaging to our interests. I regret that there has not been an informed debate on this. A person is either labelled pro-NATO or anti-NATO.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was very ill-advised in Opposition in committing itself to a referendum on the matter. Article 29.1 of the Constitution specifically states:</P>
    <P>Ireland [is devoted] to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>Since our membership of the UN in 1955, we have, through referenda, voted for the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty and the Good Friday Agreement, all of which provide a legal basis for us to join PfP. It was never necessary for us to have a referendum in this regard. People speak of the electoral difficulties in by-elections and low turnouts. Referenda, even on the most uncontentious mundane matter, have become a nightmare because of the McKenna judgment. It is time the Government grasped the horns of that dilemma which requires the State, regardless of unanimity in favour of a proposal in the House, which was elected and can subsequently be rejected by the people, to fund equally the arguments against the proposal and give equal weight to them. That disregards the democratic principle underlying membership of the House.</P>
    <P>There has been a sequence of events since we joined the UN in 1955, since our association with peacekeeping, our joining the OSCE, our observer status in Western European Union, and the passing of the Maastricht and other treaties. We have set out a pattern. The Petersberg Tasks are worthy of support. They involve humanitarian, search and rescue and peacekeeping missions and crisis management tasks, including peace enforcement and environmental protection. We should pay due credit to our Defence Forces. Last year our international peace commitment was such that we had almost 800 military personnel employed on peacekeeping missions in 13 countries. They were offering more than sympathy. They were offering effective implementation of humanitarian principles.</P>
    <P>The world has changed in the period 1990-5. UN Security Council resolutions have increased fourfold and there has been a threefold increase in the number of conflicts in which the UN has become actively involved. The number of UN peacekeeping operations in the same period has increased from five to 19. The East-West axis is at an end. Things which were impossible during the Cold War when there were two competing superpowers are now possible. We now have regional and internal security disputes rather than East-West conflicts. We have all seen the slaughter of innocent women, children and elderly people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The SFOR mandate under the UN has worked well there and <Col N="1396" /> credit must be given in that regard. We must optimise our capacity to play an increasing role.</P>
    <P>Another argument made is that by joining PfP we will join NATO. While we have never had a proper debate on joining NATO, I accept that there is no public desire to join it. However, 43 nations participate in and are members of PfP. If this is a malign UN-NATO body, how is it that only 16 NATO member states are members? What about the other 27? The ethic of unprecedented flexibility encompasses a membership which is reflected in the profile of PfP. Russia is a member, as are many of the Baltic and neutral European states, including three Balkan states. Are we going to join Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and the Holy See which are not members or will we join the rest of the civilised world, including Russia, which are members? PfP's role is to acknowledge the failure of Europe and NATO to take effective peacekeeping action, the need to allow former Warsaw Pact states to participate in western security co-operation and the need to promote stability and strengthen international relations through co-operation.</P>
    <P>PfP's aims of safeguarding freedom, justice and peace and the preservation of democracy and international law are aims to which all sound thinking people should subscribe. Transparency, national defence budgeting and the democratic control of defence forces are all bases for joining PfP. The procedure by which a state joins is that a member state establishes a bilateral agreement with the 16 NATO countries. We, in our Presentation Document, can fully enshrine our peacekeeping commitments and our commitment to humanitarian philosophy. When I see countries such as Switzerland, Austria, Finland and Sweden &ndash; all neutral states &ndash; joining PfP, I ask myself how it could be perceived as a backdoor to NATO. The myths surrounding PfP have not been properly contested and now is the time to contest them.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of hypocrisy in this debate. Government back benchers such as Deputies Roche, O'Kennedy, Browne and Deputy Fox all want to have an each way bet on this issue. If they were fully committed to what they are saying, they should vote against this. I do not believe a referendum is required.</P>
    <P>In 1996, the former Government, of which I was a member, produced a White Paper on Foreign Policy which addressed this issue, among others. No commitment was given in that White Paper to hold a referendum. Fine Gael's position on this matter has been utterly consistent. PfP is not a matter of signing a blank cheque; it is a matter of offering more than sympathy to the down-trodden people who face being looted, ransacked and run out of their houses where ethnic strife occurs.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department of Foreign Affairs on its consistently balanced and calm handling of this issue in which it has attempted to preserve the elements of our foreign policy and tradition of peacekeeping. When we visit America on St. <Col N="1397" /> Patrick's Day, we portray an image of ourselves as being more American than the Americans themselves in the same way as the Americans portray an image of being more Irish than us. Yet, we can talk to Libya, as I did about the beef crisis, and it can point to its difficult history with imperialist Britain. We have an each way bet on many aspects of our foreign policy. However, I do not believe there is any conflict on this issue.</P>
    <P>PfP seeks to provide the underlying strengths of peacekeeping and peace enforcement in a world where regional and internal strife, as opposed to East-West strife, is the order of the day. We should seek to clearly establish in our Presentation Document that PfP's role will be to operate under a UN mandate and that its principles will be developed in a humanitarian based manner.</P>
    <P>Last weekend, we witnessed the near loss of life off the west coast. The further evolution and development of our coastal search and rescue services is very important. Some constituents of mine were tragically killed in a helicopter rescue accident and tribute must be paid to them. Too often, we lose sight of practical considerations. If the northern talks progress satisfactorily, I see PfP providing for the development of further common sense, practical arrangements where tragedies, such as naval incidents, arise.</P>
    <P>The establishment in May 1997 of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council provides the best forum for regular consultations between all PfP states, be they NATO or otherwise, to discuss how we will be of practical humanitarian assistance in the Balkans and elsewhere. That is the proper way to proceed. The arguments against PfP do not stand up. Joining PfP is a sign of a mature state which is taking its responsibility seriously, a state which is committed to more than sympathy through the implementation of the real values of human dignity. I am, therefore, happy to support the Fine Gael position as outlined in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Ireland declared its neutrality in the 1930s, world security has taken on a completely different form and aspect. Through the debate surrounding PfP, we now realise it is in our interest to play a vital role in world security and in securing the freedom of other nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most spectacular aspect of this debate is the somersault effected by Fianna Fáil whereby it rejected PfP prior to the last election and guaranteed that a referendum would be held on the issue but has now decided to adopt the Fine Gael position which supports involvement in PfP without a referendum. Fianna Fáil will come in for a great deal of criticism in the long run for this change of position. On 28 March 1996, the current Taoiseach and then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, outlined Fianna Fáil's position on PfP. He said: &ldquo;The case for concluding a bilateral pact with NATO under the Partnership for Peace has not been made.&rdquo;. He went on to outline the reasons Ireland should not have joined PfP at that <Col N="1398" /> time, citing the threat of NATO naval and army troops coming into the bays and harbours of Ireland. I am delighted he has abandoned that position and adopted the Fine Gael one. Last January, prior to this debate, the Taoiseach claimed that PfP would allow us retain the credible, viable and constructive neutrality which has always defined the character of our foreign policy and stated that it did not mean our foreign policy would be uncritically aligned with NATO. The Taoiseach's position has changed since 1996. That is to be welcomed, although it represents one of the greatest changes in policy direction I have witnessed since entering this House.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is an important initiative for Ireland and is one which must be taken in order that we can move forward on our commitment to the European and world community. The initiative has obvious benefits without any reasonable or rational drawbacks. Fine Gael has consistently backed this initiative since the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy in 1996. We do not see PfP as infringing on our strong historical stance of neutrality. We should consider security and neutrality as separate issues. As a committed member of the EU, our security, and that of other EU member states, is something we must take very seriously. At the same time, we can preserve our historical neutrality. They are two different issues and must be looked at separately.</P>
    <P>PfP, although designed in part as an initiative to allow former eastern bloc countries to move into NATO, has also evolved into a partnership among most European nations to provide for enhanced security and peacekeeping. PfP does not require or ask us to give up our historical and strong desire to maintain our neutrality. It is not a military alliance, which has been stated by speaker after speaker in this House. It does not require Ireland to support the military or defence initiatives of NATO, for example. Instead, PfP is a proactive agreement among all but a few OSCE nations to enhance our ability to participate in peacekeeping, collective European security and humanitarian missions.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only nation in the EU which is not a member of the EAPC/PfP leaving us out of the negotiating table on the common security and peace of the European Union. PfP is also a self-determined alliance and the Government and people maintain control over the depth and length of our involvement in each mission and by our initial agreement to join. PfP is not a front for NATO aggression, as was pointed out by a number of speakers, but allows us to continue to enhance our ability to participate as peacekeepers and humanitarians and to act in common security with our EU neighbours and our supporters in the broader world community.</P>
    <P>PfP will help in future co-ordination of humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, common training and exercises. The future of European collective security depends on our ability to act in a co-<Col N="1399" /> operative fashion among NATO and UN members and to give the fastest and most efficient aid while remaining secure and neutral. PfP enhances and is essential to our ability to complete that task. It is not only a benefit to our future security and co-ordination with other nations but it also allows us to remain on our own individual autonomous terms as a nation.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace in no way inhibits our ability to determine our own foreign policy, especially in regard to the constitutionally deemed power over the declaration of war to the Dáil. It is an essential and important step forward for Ireland as a member of the European Union and the broader world community. Without taking this step, Ireland will not be able to keep up its outstanding record as neutral peacekeepers and humanitarians, especially now that we have been called to step up to the Petersberg Tasks of special responsibility to our European neighbours and, possibly, future EU members.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Fine Gael position clearly states that the focus of PfP is on co-operation, training and joint exercises. Nothing in the PfP framework document entails international commitments of a treaty nature and participation in PfP programmes is entirely voluntary. Ireland needs to be ready to participate as a member of the European Union and the world community in future peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts throughout Europe. PfP is the way to prepare for this future while maintaining our neutrality and sovereignty over the declaration of war.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has been consistent in its support for PfP as a better structure in our humanitarian relief and defence efforts and which will not call into question our neutrality or sovereignty. Our membership is important for the future of Ireland as a member not only of the European Union but of the world community. As I said, PfP is not a military alliance nor a necessary stepping stone into NATO. It is not a reversal of Ireland's strong history of neutrality and it will not give NATO a free reign to interfere in Irish domestic politics or to do anything which would in any damage our neutral position.</P>
    <P>PfP is a proactive initiative to maintain peace and security for ourselves and our fellow EU members and European neighbours. It is a self-determined alliance and the Dáil and the people will have control over the depth and length of our involvement. It is a humanitarian effort by us and other countries, many of which have a strong history of neutrality, such as Finland and Switzerland, and draws half its membership from outside NATO. In PfP we are in the company of countries with probably the longest tradition of neutrality in modern times. PfP will aid in the future co-ordination of humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts and will allow Ireland to be an active member of the European Union in important issues, such as defence and rescue missions, peacekeeping and so on.</P>
    <P>Ireland has no option but to be part of PfP. I would like a broader and more extensive debate <Col N="1400" /> on security and the security of the European Union in which we are enthusiastic participants, unlike perhaps our neighbours. This debate cleared the air. For a long time Fianna Fáil used neutrality at times, particularly at elections, to gain popular support but it has now shown clearly where it stands on security. Fianna Fáil policy is now the same as Fine Gael, and this debate was helpful if for no other reason than to display that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In three quarters of a century of independence, Ireland has played an important role in peacekeeping through the UN and in advancing the cause of the non-nuclear states. Some 25 years ago after half a century of independence we joined what is now the European Union. In the past quarter of a century our sovereignty has become a greater reality not because we chose to stand aside from certain organisations but because we joined specific organisations, most notably the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and, most significantly, the European Union. Our decision not to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 1949 continues to enjoy wide public support, although the reasons for not joining have never been enumerated or publicly consented to. As this document points out, the public is able to discern between membership of NATO and an association with NATO tailored to our needs and with our full agreement and consent.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes there is no argument for Ireland remaining outside PfP and that to do so would be damaging to our interests and to the evolving European security arrangement in which we must play a role and of which we must be one of the main sponsors. This, in turn, is important for the morale of our Defence Forces. We all know of the support and enthusiasm of the Defence Forces for this initiative. They are extremely conscious of this having served in areas throughout the world with the UN. WE should listen to those in the Defence Forces because they are aware of the international situation, of our military involvement and the importance for each country to have arrangements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Drug smuggling has become a curse throughout the world. We see co-operation between police forces in different countries and it is only right and natural that military forces in these countries would have the same arrangements to combat this terrible threat to humanity. We should be more conscious of this than are other countries, as Ireland has become a busy trafficking area for international drug smugglers. I compliment the Garda and Customs and Excise officers, who have been very successful in seizing drugs, but if our security forces had not been as successful in seizing drugs as they have been in the past five years, for example, the situation would be very frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international drugs problem gives an example of the movement of people between <Col N="1401" /> countries. The idea of isolation and of a country standing on its own was all right in the past, as Deputy Deenihan said, when drums were beaten at election meetings in the village green. That kind of politics went down well in the past. People were complimented for keeping Ireland out of the world war, but the hard fact is that the two opposing sides decided not to invade Ireland. That was one of the reasons Ireland was kept out of the war, but we had to have a belief that it was due to great performances from Irish statesmen.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the stance of Fianna Fáil on this issue. I am not naive enough to think that Fianna Fáil has not adopted this stance on many other occasions. For example, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was being put in place, Fianna Fáil, which was then in Opposition, opposed it. It would not be true to form had Fianna Fáil had not opposed this matter in Opposition. It was once pointed out to a well-known Fianna Fáil Minister that he had said one thing about a topic when in Opposition and something different when in office. His reply was that he had been in Opposition at the time. Fianna Fáil does not have a policy on anything and this is the way it has performed on many issues. It is not worth dwelling on this too long, but the main party in Government has had to do a U-turn on this matter and by doing so has not done itself any favours. More importantly, it has not done the country any favours. However, that is politics and politics cannot be avoided. It is a sad reflection on the so-called new Fianna Fáil that it stuck with the old policy of opposing matters when in Opposition before making the usual U-turn in Government.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is a very flexible arrangement. The flexibility of its structure is unprecedented in that it allows full participation to member states who wish to fulfill a variety of different aims. Partnership for Peace is a bilateral agreement between any given member state and the 16 NATO members. It is NATO's military co-operation programme for non-NATO countries and it is a normal way for a nation to evolve. I am happy to support this move, though I am disappointed the Government was not more upfront on the matter when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I have a reservation and feel there should have been a referendum. In that, I differ to an extent from my party. However, that is water under the bridge and I totally support this policy. Ireland will honour its role on the international stage as it has done in the past and this will enhance our stature as a nation. I have every confidence in our military forces. Their service abroad has given Ireland a great record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion that Ireland participates in Partnership for Peace. It makes me proud to see Ireland playing its part in international peacekeeping efforts and Irish people are proud of our contribution over the years. We want to contribute and we want to play our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the United Nations Secretary General, <Col N="1402" /> Mr. Kofi Annan, visited Ireland earlier this year, he reminded us of Ireland's reputation, given our 46,000 individual tours of duty on 37 UN peacekeeping missions. Irish peacekeepers serve on UN mandated, NATO commanded stabilisation forces in the former Yugoslavia. We have troops deployed in Lebanon, among the UN forces in Cyprus, western Somalia, Afghanistan, Kuwait and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Article 29.1º of the Constitution provides the basis for this tradition. It states that Ireland is devoted &ldquo;to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.&rdquo;  This is why we became a member of the UN in 1955 and since then our armed forces have become internationally recognised as peacekeepers in numerous operations around the world. We have also joined the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, again indicating our willingness and commitment to fostering peace in Europe. In May 1998 the Irish people voted in referenda on the Amsterdam Treaty and the Good Friday Agreement and both were endorsed by the citizens of the State. Under the Amsterdam Treaty Ireland agreed to play a greater role in European security through a common foreign and security policy and indicated a willingness to participate in the Petersberg Tasks, which include humanitarian work, search and rescue missions, peacekeeping missions, crisis management tasks, including enforcing peace, and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>We are already committed to activities similar to those we could participate in under Partnership for Peace. I remember the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty and many people I spoke to approved of Ireland's involvement in these types of missions. From examining developments across Europe and our military capabilities, it is clear that continued membership of the UN alone will not allow us contribute in a meaningful way to operations and decision making in missions such as those under the Petersberg Tasks. Partnership for Peace affords us this involvement. It is a bilateral arrangement between NATO on the one hand and the individual non-NATO countries on the other, covering co-operation and co-ordination in the areas chosen by individual countries. Of the 43 participating nations, practically all are members of OSCE. Sixteen EU members states are members of Partnership for Peace, 11 of which are members of NATO. These 11 members see NATO membership as necessary in the context of providing for their security needs. We do not see such a necessity and neither do our fellow neutral EU states, namely, Sweden, Finland and Austria. However, these countries see a need to join Partnership for Peace. They are conscious, as are other EU member states, of the need for co-operation and discussion which is respectful of different opinions and the need to exchange different views. The other three neutral countries have access to political discussions with <Col N="1403" /> NATO and the opportunity to air their views. Ireland does not have this opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting what the former Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon, has to say on the matter. He believes our inaction in joining Partnership for Peace has sidelined our Defence Forces in training for peace operations and in the techniques involved. He points out that new techniques are evolving through Partnership for Peace workshops from which we are excluded. We have been denied an opportunity of playing our part and having an influence when we could be prime movers. He believes we are at a potentially dangerous disadvantage in Bosnia under NATO command because of our non-membership of Partnership for Peace. Detailed intelligence in the mission is restricted to NATO members, but members of Partnership for Peace have a less classified level of intelligence available to them. This arrangement does not apply to Ireland, and this could prove life threatening to our soldiers.</P>
    <P>Membership of Partnership for Peace will mean that Irish soldiers will be training and attending co-ordination conferences, upgrading their skills and improving their ability to take part in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. During the NATO bombing of Serbia Ireland found itself without a voice or a channel to direct its concerns. Membership of Partnership for Peace will change this. We were the only country in Europe without a voice. Every other country was either in NATO or a member of Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is not a set and rigid arrangement, rather it is an extremely flexible arrangement, a fact not focused upon and perhaps ignored by opponents in the argument. If we decide to join PfP we will sign the partnership framework document and we will then present NATO with a document setting out the areas of participation in which we are interested, not in those dictated to us by NATO. We will not be faced with any commitment other than voluntary commitments. Partnership for Peace is not a treaty and membership does not imply any mutual defence commitments, membership of NATO or any commitment to NATO. It is not NATO membership by the back door, as opponents of PfP would like us to believe or as Fianna Fáil suggested in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace will present us with a menu of options from which we can pick and choose, a fact which is well documented. I have no doubt we will participate in areas already agreed to by the people of this country &ndash; I refer to the areas covered by the Petersberg Tasks to which we agreed under the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Government already has a mandate from the people to do this. Under the Good Friday Agreement the people gave the Government their consent that it should develop east-west and North-South security arrangements with the British Government. Therefore, I do not believe a refer<Col N="1404" /> endum is necessary. Membership of Partnership for Peace would in no way involve a change in our Constitution. We had an opportunity to express our opinion on common foreign and security policy in Europe in previous referenda and membership of Partnership for Peace allows us implement these decisions. This is clear and has always been so.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has always been clear on where it stands in relation to this issue; it always believed it is necessary for Ireland, as a member of the EU, to participate fully in such a programme. We believe firmly that our commitments to European politics, security and development mean we must play an active role and not hide behind a neutral banner which would allow us to opt out of our responsibilities. Shirking our responsibilities in an expanding Europe is not what the Irish people want. We want to play our part and are proud to do so.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed and angry at the way politics is being played with this issue. The shameless U-turn by Fianna Fáil on a referendum on Partnership for Peace has been widely documented in debate in this House, in the media and among the general public. The explanatory guideline issued to us by the Department of Foreign Affairs contradicts the wild and inaccurate statements of the Fianna Fáil party when in Opposition, eager to get into Government at all costs. The document states that there is no conflict between Ireland's military neutrality and full and active support in Ireland for collective security. On the issue of a referendum, the Attorney General cannot see any legal reason why one would be required prior to Irish participation in Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the coalition Government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left produced a White Paper on foreign policy, summarising Partnership for Peace. The Fianna Fáil led Government can now confirm the validity of the conclusions in that White Paper. It is pure cynicism that Fianna Fáil in Opposition promised a referendum on Ireland's membership of Partnership for Peace and used grossly misleading statements in an effort to gain electoral support while it switched tactics in Government. This type of irresponsible behaviour contributes to the cynicism with which people view politics today. If I, as a Member of the Opposition, can inform myself of the true reality of Partnership for Peace and what it means for Ireland in terms of our history in Europe, our commitment in Europe and the general desire of the people to see our nation participating in humanitarian, peacekeeping and search and rescue missions, surely Fianna Fáil in Opposition could have done so. I suggest the party probably did, but irresponsibly chose to ignore it in a cynical exercise which has placed the body politic in further disrepute.</P>
    <P>I believe firmly Ireland will and has to play its role. We are committed and I believe the Irish people want to play their role in Europe and in expanding our commitments in Europe. Partnership for Peace in no way restricts or interferes <Col N="1405" /> with our neutrality and I do not believe a referendum on this issue is necessary as has been cynically promised by other politicians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Were Fine Gael to behave as Fianna Fáil feels it should behave when in Opposition we would be voting against this motion, and using every political opportunity to embarrass members of Fianna Fáil and trying to encourage Independents to follow us in to the Níl lobby. I am proud that we are not doing this, because this issue is too important to play politics with. If others want to behave in such a fashion then they should examine their own consciences. It is no wonder that people are staying away from the polling booths, as we saw in the recent by-election, while this type of politics continues. Politics is about leadership and we owe it to the people to give leadership on this issue and to tell the truth.</P>
      <P>As has been outlined by many speakers, this has nothing to do with neutrality. When we talk about Partnership for Peace we talk about bringing peace to the world, not aggression. We are not talking about a group of countries getting together to be aggressive towards others, but rather about a partnership of countries coming together to restore peace in the world. As a former Minister for Defence I had the great benefit of seeing at first hand the role our Defence Forces have played through the years in peacekeeping throughout the world. I visited the Lebanon on numerous occasions. I visited Somalia as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I have been to many parts of the former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia Herzegovina. We played our part there even though it involved a small number of Defence Forces personnel. I also witnessed at first hand the outrageous atrocities that occurred in these parts of the world. When people see what is happening to these human beings on television there is, naturally, an outcry. People want to know what we are doing about it. This is an opportunity to do something.</P>
      <P>Some people are using scare tactics in an effort to persuade the Irish people that as a result of joining Partnership for Peace, members of the Defence Forces will be led into a situation where they will be fighting wars throughout the world. That is scandalous. This is an extremely serious issue and the public demands to know our policies in relation to our Defence Forces and the role they will play in future in bringing peace and stability throughout the world. I will be pleased to walk through the Tá lobby in support of this motion, even if it is cynical on the part of the Government, particularly the Fianna Fáil element, which changed ship on the issue. Nevertheless, we now have an opportunity to show some leadership for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would happen if Ireland did not join? Irish troops have spent nearly 20 years in Lebanon. Hopefully, that conflict will be resolved in the near future. What will we do with the skills of the personnel who have been trained in these <Col N="1406" /> tasks over the years? These skills are in true peacekeeping and they would be lost to the world. The soldiers could walk up and down in the barracks square every morning and prepare guards of honour for the various dignitaries who arrive to this country but what will they do afterwards? The reality is that they have an important part to play in passing on the skills they have gained in peacekeeping to other countries.</P>
    <P>Compare those skills with the aggressive approach of, for example, the United States, whose military gets involved in conflicts throughout the world but who have never been trained in peacekeeping. They know nothing about it. All they know is that they have more machinery, guns and bombs than others and they are trained to use them. However, the skills of our Defence Forces include being able to become part of a community in an area where there is conflict and to bring about a peaceful and stable situation. That is what peacekeeping is about. It is about restoring democracy in parts of the world which are experiencing atrocities every year. The comments of the former Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General McMahon, were correct. I had the great privilege of serving with him when I was Minister for Defence. This man has tremendous knowledge about peacekeeping and has served in that capacity in many parts of the world. He was right to say that it is shameful that Ireland is not to the forefront in leading policy in Europe with regard to peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>As has been said previously, this is a voluntary participation. If a country joins Partnership for Peace, it is not dictated to by others. It decides the mission in which it wishes to participate, what skills it has for that mission and what role it will play. The country can be selective. I believe Europe should go further than this, given the current situation. When there was conflict in the past, a UN resolution was passed and the Secretary General sought troops from various parts of the world to participate in a UN mission. In those days, when a country participated, the UN paid the costs. What is happening now? Due to the lack of proper funding for the United Nations, each participant in a mission must now pay its own costs.</P>
    <P>This country is fortunate to be going through a period of great wealth. However, 15 or 17 years ago, when it was on its knees, how could it have afforded to pay for a military contingent to participate in a mission in some other part of the world? We would have been obliged to opt out. It is important, therefore, for Ireland to be at the forefront in European politics in encouraging the proper funding of the United Nations in order to return it to the days when it had the resources to fund such missions.</P>
    <P>Take a look at some of the poorer countries, such as Ghana and Fiji, which also have a great tradition in peacekeeping and whose troops have served alongside Irish troops in Lebanon and other areas. These countries do not have the wealth we have and they can no longer partici<Col N="1407" /> pate under the new rules in peacekeeping missions. They cannot afford it. The United Nations is losing its peacekeeping skills. I have always argued that instead of being afraid of participating fully in discussions and debates in Europe, Ireland should be leading the way as a small country with a proud tradition. It has no axe to grind with anybody and does not have a history of aggression.</P>
    <P>We should be leading the way and ensuring that Europe, as a body, contributes to the United Nations along with the US, Russia and the world's other major groupings. We should ensure that Europe contributes a percentage of GDP or uses some other vehicle as a funding mechanism. If that is done, it will be possible to reintroduce a number of the smaller countries which do not have the wealth to participate at present.</P>
    <P>I was in Somalia during the troubles there. It was obvious lunacy &ndash; I do not profess to be an expert in these matters &ndash; to have US troops in Somalia on a long-term basis. They did not know the culture; neither do we for that matter. Other African states who understand the culture, the history and the people were needed. They should be able to participate in peacekeeping missions in these parts of the world. Bringing people from the United States or Europe into that situation can often be the wrong course of action.</P>
    <P>This is the first step, to get involved and show that we are not afraid to play our part in peacekeeping and peace enforcement throughout the world. The next step should be that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence participate fully in the Western European Union and bring about a debate in which we should insist that Europe takes a stance on peacekeeping. Then we will know where we are going and we will not be hopping and trotting, waiting for the US or some other powerful group of countries to make a decision. Why does the European Union, for argument's sake, not have a seat on the Security Council? That body needs to be radically reformed. We should be involved as a European voice, expressing our concerns and taking positions.</P>
    <P>This motion is a most important step. I was delighted Ireland decided to participate in the UN mission to deal with the aftermath of the East Timor slaughter. Although we are sending a small number of troops, it is a sign that we are concerned and have a role to play. I am sure our troops will play a most important role. Unless one sees what can be done on the ground through peacekeeping and sees the skills of the people who are trained in this area, it is difficult to explain them. The fact that various countries send military experts to learn from our military personnel in the peacekeeping college in the Curragh Camp is a sign that Ireland has a high reputation in peacekeeping throughout the world. It is, therefore, only right and proper that we should be to the forefront in joining Partnership for Peace. We should move away from scare<Col N="1408" /> mongering and misleading people and tell them the truth &ndash; we cannot stand back and say someone else can deal with the slaughter of people in a civilised society and because little Ireland wants to remain neutral we cannot become involved. Such a view is hypocritical. When we were in trouble we needed help from other people and we still need help. George Mitchell is trying to negotiate a final peace settlement in the north-eastern part of this island. We should, therefore, be able to understand how important it is to play a role in peacekeeping throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In supporting this motion and the Fine Gael amendment to it, which I understand will be accepted by the Government, I look forward to this motion being passed and to our marching forward to take our rightful place as a member of Partnership for Peace and I hope we will not be afraid to play a leading role in developing a European policy on peacekeeping and peacemaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue. Ireland has a proud record in maintaining European and world peace. As the previous speaker said, we have a proud record in peacekeeping, which we have justified, and we should not be afraid to move forward and join Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>Given the commitment by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the last general election to hold a referendum on joining Partnership for Peace, their subsequent U-turn has a serious consequence for politics. Fianna Fáil's cynical U-turn on this issue has caused anger and frustration. Fine Gael made its case clear two and a half years ago before the last general election so that people knew exactly what they were voting for. I am proud our party leader and our party in general is committed to maintaining that stance and has not just changed its stance because it has moved to this side of the House. In January 1998 the Fine Gael motion put by Deputy Gay Mitchell forced the Taoiseach to restate his position when he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a positive statement in favour of joining Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>I have great admiration for the strong stance adopted by Deputies Fox and Blaney against the Government on this major issue, but their stance on behalf of the nurses in recent weeks was not as moral or as strong. If there is a vote on this motion tonight, I wonder which lobby they will walk through. I understand they will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The only reason they will do so is because they have a clear indication from the Fine Gael Party that it will vote with the Government, so they have nothing to lose. There will be a discussion later tonight and tomorrow night on agriculture on which there will be a vote and I wonder if their stance on behalf of the sheep farmers of Kerry, Donegal and Wicklow, who are not enjoying the benefits of the Celtic tiger but experiencing great difficulties, will be as strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army and the Garda, are eager to become involved in peacekeeping missions across Europe <Col N="1409" /> and further afield. The Army has a high reputation and it was made clear by some of its personnel that they believe our joining Partnership for Peace will not endanger our neutrality in any way.</P>
    <P>Why did so few people turn out to vote last week in the by-election? We need only consider the subject of this motion to realise why people can be so cynical. Before the last general election an absolute guarantee was given by the leader of Fianna Fáil that a referendum would be held on joining Partnership for Peace, and that was not the only guarantee he gave. He also gave a guarantee, and leaflets on it were circulated around my home area, that if Army barracks were to be closed, full and open consultation would take place. A meeting was called, but it was called to announce the closures and as yet the £1 million promised that day has not come to Castleblayney.</P>
    <P>Promises were also made to farmers. The Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, and Ministers, Deputies Walsh and Cowen, and others promised farmers that if they got into Government they would fly out immediately to Libya, Iran and anywhere else that was required to open up markets for our beef. They guaranteed the nurses that if they got into office they would give them whatever they wanted. They said that all that was required was a change of Government. Apart from the other issues, such as shirts and meals, their failure to keep those promises is the reason people are so cynical about politicians. Fianna Fáil has been cynical about the way it has dealt with the issue of Partnership for Peace, promising one thing in Opposition but doing something else in Government.</P>
    <P>I recall the Taoiseach, when Leader of the Opposition, in a debate on a White Paper in 1996, stating that Partnership for Peace involves joint exercises with NATO on sea or land. He questioned whether they would take place in Ireland. He also questioned whether we would be able to choose the NATO countries with which we would wish to have exercises? He asked if we would have British troops back in the Curragh, the French back in Bantry Bay, the Germans on Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle. He asked whether we would take part in exercises under NATO command. He did not mention French tailors on Inisvickillane. The Taoiseach also said in 1996 that he would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in the Western European Union tasks through the House by resolution without reference to the people who, under the Constitution, have the right to final decision on all such questions of national policy, as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also said that Partnership for Peace is a backdoor to NATO. He said that the association between Partnership for Peace and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is too close for comfort in the context of our military non-alliance and we <Col N="1410" /> need to preserve our neutrality. Those comments in 1996 do not sit consistently with what the Minister said in this debate.</P>
    <P>I am aware Fianna Fáil's arguments that things have changed are nonsense, unless it means that was what it said in Opposition but it has changed now it is in Government. Fianna Fáil's cynicism and U-turns must not blind us to the fact that Partnership for Peace is a flexible programme of military and security co-operation between NATO and non-NATO states. Partnership for Peace does not present any participation with any commitments other than voluntary participation in Partnership for Peace programmes. It is not a treaty in any sense and Partnership for Peace does not imply mutual defence commitments, membership of NATO or any commitment to it. It is because Partnership for Peace is a voluntary agreement that even Switzerland, a country which will not join the UN and which holds referenda several times a year, joined Partnership for Peace without a referendum. A referendum would be nothing more than a costly political exercise. It is interesting to note that in 1996 the then Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, stated it would cost £3 million.</P>
    <P>The presentation document sets out clearly the proposed areas in which Ireland will seek to work in Partnership for Peace, such as co-operation and peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, protection of the environment and co-operation in marine matters. It states that Ireland's decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is in full accordance with Ireland's policy of military neutrality which was always being pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security based in international law. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expanded at length on what the presentation document states about what Irish membership of Partnership for Peace will mean. I welcome that clarity, although the Minister was against joining Partnership for Peace not too long ago.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on NATO membership is clear. In a joint statement prior to the Maastricht referendum in June 1992 the leaders of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats gave a commitment that there would be no change in Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality without first holding a referendum. That was in section 4 of the 1996 White Paper on Foreign Policy and it makes it clear there is no danger of Ireland joining NATO.</P>
    <P>Europe is moving ahead on security co-operation and Ireland will face crucial decisions about its role. As someone who was involved in farming organisations at European level, I saw how countries which fought each other in two world wars found ways of working together. We should be able to do this through Partnership for Peace. The time has come for Ireland to join Partnership for Peace. We have debated this issue inside and outside this House for more than four years and we have had public consultations since March 1996 on the White Paper on Foreign Policy. The time has come to send a signal to our partners in <Col N="1411" /> Europe that we are willing to work together in Partnership for Peace. If we wish to influence the future shape of Europe's security and not leave it to others to decide, we must join other European neutrals in having our voice heard. I welcome the decision to join Partnership for Peace which is the next vital step in Ireland's continuing search for a coherent foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to be more careful in the promises it makes when it is in Opposition. This might mean people will be less cynical when the next general election is held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell set out this party's position on Partnership for Peace. I recall the words of the former German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, whose grandparents and parents suffered family losses in the Great War and in the Second World War. His involvement in politics and his roles as Chancellor and as one of the principal architects of the union of West and East Germany helped to ensure that war and decimation of human life in Europe could not happen again. As a politician and leader, he was not afraid to proclaim that objective.</P>
      <P>As a small country which has drawn down substantial funding from Europe and which has played an international peacekeeping role, we should, as we approach the end of this century and the start of a new millennium, examine our position and make a decision to continue to play a leadership role through active participation in Partnership for Peace. It has been said over the centuries that this country has decided many tribal battles and fought the wars of other countries except our own. The young men and women who want to participate in the Army know we will not invade another country because we do not have the resources or the capacity to do so. They want to meet the challenge of participating in Partnership for Peace because it will give them the opportunity to travel abroad, to become acquainted with other cultures, nations and peoples and to help prevent the loss of life. It is a fallacy to suggest that if we join Partnership for Peace our young men and women will be forced to participate in wars of which they do not want to be part.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Oireachtas have an important decision-making role to play. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the next five or ten years. People face uncertainty in every walk of life. People are uncertain about their jobs or those of their children and about financial security. We do not know when a scandal, a <i>coup d'état</i> or an eruption of hostilities anywhere on the planet could cause mayhem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Government should be ashamed of their <Col N="1413" /> stewardship in light of the sorry state of agriculture. Agriculture, as one of the most important sectors of the Irish economy, should not be in such a depression at a time when virtually every other sector is booming. I wish to record in this debate the tremendous anxiety many farming families have about their very existence and the great uncertainties they have about future successors to their farms.</P>
      <P>Many commentators outside farming will say that I am an alarmist, that these are over the top comments and this is the same old rural rant of looking for more. Whatever about the validity of that argument in the past there are very strong signals of a difficult economic situation for many farmers and, unfortunately, the future does not look rosy. Over 4,000 families leave the land each year but what is almost as alarming are the huge numbers who are forced to take a job outside the farm to earn a half decent living. Another damning indicator is the falling number of young men and women who attend our agricultural colleges. This year saw the closure of St. Patrick's College in Monaghan and a number of others must be feeling very insecure at the moment. However, on the ground, the lack of income is the greatest factor and will dictate whether a farmer can rear a family on the land.</P>
      <P>No meeting of farmers held anywhere in Ireland takes place without reference to the serious state of the industry and the huge uncertainties around the corner. Another indicator is the inability of many small to medium sized farmers to secure loans, even for working capital, from the banks. This will come as quite a shock to many people given the booming economy. This week I received a telephone call from a 60 acre suckler farmer who needed working capital and a small loan to build a slatted house. This house is a central part of his REPS plan and if it cannot be built he will either have to change his REPS plan or pay back the money he owes. This man is an average small farmer with approximately 30 suckler cows. He receives some farm assist and would be regarded as being a thrifty small farmer. The future does not look good for him.</P>
      <P>Many sectors in Irish agriculture are going through a horrendous time, despite the spend of the Minister and the Department elsewhere. For example, store cattle farmers never had it as bad with animal values having more than halved in two years &ndash; this applies to 70 or 80 per cent of the cattle. Sheep farmers' incomes have collapsed since last July with an all-time price disaster this autumn. The hill sheep farmers were gutted this year. Pig farmers are haunted by the present market prices. Their trouble has lasted for much longer than the experts predicted. To my knowledge, there are no pig farmers actually breaking even. They have lost £15 per pig over the past 12 to 18 months. It appears the family-owned and managed pig enterprise is doomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this year's grain harvest was excellent all the signs are that as a result of Agenda 2000 many <Col N="1414" /> smaller grain growers will be pushed out. Small dairy farmers with small to medium sized quotas firmly believed they would get a reasonable share of the much publicised Agenda 2000 extra milk quota. They were disappointed when it was divided and they received no more than 700 gallons each, which will not be of any help. Farming need not necessarily have such a depressing future. There are hopeful signals, especially if there is a political will to make structural changes that will improve farm incomes and keep farming families on the land.</P>
    <P>Any Government worth its salt must have the capacity to see beyond today in its vision for rural Ireland. It must be obvious to everybody, even outside farming, that farmers are the custodians of the countryside. The very existence of the rural landscape in keeping with best environmental standards can only be safe if there are enough farmers, particularly young farmers, who produce wholesome food in an acceptable environmental context which is the rightful demand of consumers everywhere. However, there is one major <i>caveat</i> in this &ndash; farmers must be provided with an opportunity to make a decent living from the land. Their hands cannot be forever tied behind their backs. This places a great responsibility on the European Union, the Minister and the farming community.</P>
    <P>The parameters were set in Agenda 2000 for the next six years for production targets, intervention levels, the cheque in the post system etc. We have little alternative but to work inside these parameters with the understanding that we must be vigilant in the upcoming world trade talks so there will be no further constraints placed on our farmers. Great negotiation skills will be required by the European Union to fight its corner in those world trade talks.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers have proved time and time again that they will respond to the changing circumstances but if there are no clear achievable targets and planned action mapped out over the next six or seven years there will be nothing but uncertainty and indecision. Even in the midst of a very poor cattle trade with factory prices no more than 82p to 84p, there are chinks of light in the export weanling trade. We have proved that the best Irish continental weanlings are much sought after in Spain and Italy and are making good money. This type of outlet should inspire the Minister to provide as much leeway and support as possible for the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation to dramatically upgrade the quality of our cattle.</P>
    <P>A point that is not often made is that we probably have too many cattle in our eight million herd. We definitely have far too many inferior animals. We must get our act together. There is as much as £150 difference per head in cattle of the same weight but the world of difference in quality. If continental farmers can purchase our best weanlings for a good price and still make a profit, it should surely be possible for us to do so, if the beef industry is properly organised. Flat pricing should be discontinued in factories. We <Col N="1415" /> should introduce a mechanical grading system with great haste that will remove the subjectivity from grading. On the cattle breeding side, there is a place for synchronisation so that cows may be brought in heat and inseminated to give greater managerial capacity to farmers. This service should be provided by the AI service and done under their strict supervision of the station veterinary office, as is the case in France. There should be no need for local vets to be involved. This would help reduce costs significantly.</P>
    <P>There is an important role for An Bord Bia in the identification of new markets and in the difficult task of regaining our market share on continental markets. In fairness, the quality assurance scheme organised by An Bord Bia is widely regarded as one of the best in Europe. However, a market for meat and live cattle should receive assistance from An Bord Bia as this undoubtedly creates better competition at home and in the long run is good for the industry. As regards meat processing, there should be a case for EU Structural Fund investment in processing plants but only with strict conditions attached. This funding should be accessible to processors who can prove they will market their product in the highly priced EU markets. Under no circumstances should this funding be made available to a processor whose primary orientation is towards third country markets.</P>
    <P>No sector of Irish agriculture was treated as shamefully as the sheep sector by the Minister when he allowed himself to be outmanoeuvred at the Agenda 2000 talks. The Minister came out with the white flag of surrender raised high in the air in so far as our 45,000 sheep farmers are concerned and he has continued to totally ignore them. It is well accepted that the sheep regime did not form part of the Agenda 2000 talks, but let nobody tell me that certain commitments could not have been sought which would help sheep farmers considerably over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister always seems to have a blind spot for sheep farmers. How could any Minister accept a situation where sheep would be calculated for extensification purposes but not paid for? Any farmer who carries cattle and sheep will have little difficulty in determining what system he should stay in to maximise his income. Sheep farmers are selling off ewes at an alarming rate for prices as low as 18p per lb. At present there is no live store lamb trade in Ireland. If extensification cannot be obtained by the Minister, at least he should ensure that sheep are taken out of the equation altogether so that it will not be a minus factor.</P>
    <P>Sheep farmers have another huge anti-competitive factor working against them. Farmers in France and Belgium receive the same ewe premium as we do, but the continental price for lamb is much higher than here, at £1.50 compared to 84p or 85p. The removal of the so-called 7 per cent stabiliser would help sheep farmers to the <Col N="1416" /> tune of £4.30 per ewe. Since 1992 Irish sheep farmers have been denied a total of £244 million because of that miscalculation of the ewe premium scheme, yet nothing has been done about it. One way or another an all out political and diplomatic attack will have to be made on behalf of sheep farmers or else they will be wiped out. About 700,000 sheep will be taken off the hills while another one million sheep will leave the lowlands next year unless something is done.</P>
    <P>This debate is intended to heighten awareness of the problems in this sector, and when Deputies are voting tomorrow I hope they will remember this fact. I spoke earlier about the reluctance of young people to go into farming. This is a subject I keep returning to. The State does not give a positive signal to young people to enter farming. We have an installation aid scheme which was introduced in the mid-1980s at £5,600 per participant. If it was considered to be a realistic start-up grant, surely in 1999 it should be much higher. Fine Gael is giving a commitment that, in Government, we will provide £12,000 for suitably qualified young farmers on taking over the land. It will be paid on the basis of £8,000 on installation and £4,000 after five years farming.</P>
    <P>To provide further help to young people starting up who may have a huge asset base but very low credit rating because of their age, Fine Gael proposes a very low interest rate loan over ten years to a maximum of £30,000 for farm development purposes. Fine Gael believes that stamp duty should be abolished for this category, and I hope that will happen. Those measures can be justified economically. It costs the State almost £75,000 to train a vet and, according to Forfás, it now costs £11,700 to create a sustainable industrial job. On those facts alone, young people entering farming are entitled to what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>Nowhere will the Government's commitment to agriculture be tested more than by its financial contribution through the national development plan towards agriculture in the areas of REPS, early retirement, disadvantaged areas and forestry. It now appears that the Government is basically matching pound for pound the funding made available under those headings by Brussels, and that is a good thing. I want to sound a note of caution, however. From the figures I have seen, not enough headroom has been made available over the next six years to take into account either the increased numbers in REPS or those in the retirement pension scheme. Should the increased numbers come onstream, which we all hope for, because of the financial ceiling that has been imposed over the period, the Government might have to look to other farming sectors to cut expenditure. That is something we certainly do not want. I want to ensure the Minister is fully aware that the agriculture industry is very worried about this matter. It is vitally necessary there should be no interference with headage payments, I put down a marker on that point right now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> I now turn to the debacle in Libya, Egypt and many other Third World countries where the Minister has failed miserably to get the all important breakthrough on live cattle exports. There is nothing this country wants more than an opportunity to sell the type of cattle that can be sold on those markets and to clear the backlog. The Minister had all the answers two and a half years ago before he went into Government, but on this issue, barring one or two trips abroad, he has been extraordinarily quiet.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about rural development. I fully understand that in the future there will be many people other than farmers living in rural areas and this is to be welcomed. It is very important that we create the necessary job opportunities in those areas, both for farmers and people who have nothing to do with farming but who like to live and work in rural areas. I am extremely concerned by what I have heard concerning expenditure cuts for the Leader groups. They have shown great leadership in recent years in demonstrating how such integrated work can occur where jobs are created. If what I hear is true, it would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>On the question of breaking the land-milk quota link, I hope it will be done in a controlled and imaginative way which will lead to a milk restructuring scheme. I hope the many people who worked hard and financed the purchase and leasing of milk over the years will be given priority when this share-out occurs. Furthermore, every effort must be made to give young people an opportunity to make a decent start in life. I hope they will get a chance to make a decent living through the restructuring scheme.</P>
    <P>Backbench Fianna Fáil TDs, who are getting a great deal of stick from the farming community at meetings around their constituencies, should reflect on what I have said tonight. Leaving politics aside, what I have been speaking about is what is actually happening on the ground. The Government will have to do more. We have problems with the TB scheme, offal collection and fallen animals. A man in Galway rang me this morning to say he was being charged £60 for a dead animal, yet he cannot obtain a licence to bury it on his own land. Can the Minister imagine the costs involved in those circumstances? </P>
    <P>I wish to address the famous Independent Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox, Gildea and Blaney. Incidentally, all four come from areas with severe problems, particularly in the sheep sector. There has not been a bleat out of them this year, despite the fact that some of them openly stated when they arrived in the House that it was the small sheep farmers who provided the support necessary to get them elected. When they vote tomorrow they should frighten the Government which has displayed such complacency. The Government clings to good news but it turns its back on the old reliable agricultural sector. As a result, many members of the farming community will be waiting in the bushes at the next election and they <Col N="1418" /> will remember how the Minister turned his back on old friends.</P>
    <P>The Minister has become so complacent that he genuinely believes nothing can be done. That is the worst possible attitude one can have at this stage in the development of the agriculture industry. If the Independents want to be seen to make a positive impact in their areas, they will certainly send the Government a message tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, for tabling this motion because the agriculture issue needs to be debated, not avoided. The sector is still in crisis. Last year, all the Minister was willing to do was blame the weather conditions. He was not prepared to devise legitimate and imaginative policies to try to alleviate the serious financial difficulties in which many farmers found themselves. The store lamb trade in the counties I represent, Leitrim and Sligo, is on its knees. Prices as low as £15 and £16 are being paid for lambs. This is worse than at this time last year. What action does the Minister propose to take to resolve this problem? Last year one could use poor weather, lack of fodder and other issues to explain poor prices. This year there was a good summer and there is plenty of fodder for the winter, yet prices continue to tumble.</P>
      <P>Another problem the Minister refuses to do anything about is the culling scheme for ewes which was initiated without any dialogue last year. Many farmers in my county and constituency are still awaiting payments under that scheme. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is using excuses such as lack of folio numbers and commonage areas. This attitude is causing great distress in many areas. Many farmers provided information on folio numbers and other details last year to the Department but the same chestnut is being used again this year to delay payments to a sector which is in crisis. Farmers are urgently in need of payments to provide for their families, but the Minister is standing over that situation in his Department. It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beef producers are also suffering greatly. The Minister has failed to take on the meat plants and the amount of money they are paying to farmers. Beef prices are between 80p and 85p a pound for beef. This is unjust and barely covers the costs of beef producers. Many farmers look in disbelief at their European counterparts who are receiving more than £1 a pound for beef. They wonder why the Minister is unwilling to take any action against the meat plants to try to resolve this problem. If the beef sector dies, many farmers in my area, who provide weanlings to the sector at this time of year, will not survive. This typifies the policy of Fianna Fáil in Government. It is unwilling to take into consideration small family farms and the people who are finding it extremely difficult to survive in these harsh financial times. The Minister has turned his back on them. It is amazing that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government is <Col N="1419" /> turning its back on the people who supported it and elected it to Government over the years. When they are most in need of some action, the party looks on and does nothing. It is horrendous that the Government has allowed this to continue.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been the backbone of our society for many years. The Minister is presiding over the destruction of this once proud industry. He has little time to turn the ship around but if he does not act urgently, he will be remembered as the only Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who failed to fight for the future of agriculture at Cabinet and European levels. He has much work to do and I hope he does it. When he was in Opposition, he said he would be the great saviour. He was like John Wayne in the House, blaming this side for not taking action. The Minister has been in office for two and a half years but the agriculture industry has continuously deteriorated. It is time for the Minister to react to the problem. If he does not do so, he should consider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, for tabling the motion. The Minister has turned his back on the 34,000 sheep farmers in Ireland. He is acting as if they do not exist. However, if he keeps going as he is, they will not exist in a year or 18 months. The Minister has put the final nail in the coffin of sheep farmers. He has ignored calls for reform of the EU sheepmeat policy. The price of lamb over the past six months has collapsed to less than 50 per cent of the price last Easter. Farmers have lost confidence in sheep production and its future because the Minister left sheep producers out in the cold during Agenda 2000 negotiations by failing to ensure that sheep were removed from the extensification calculation and by failing to reform the ewe premium system which has short-changed farmers by £30 million per annum in premium payments or £6.27 per ewe.</P>
      <P>It is time for the Minister to take his head out of the sand and face reality. At a time when the sheepmeat trade is collapsing, why are New Zealand producers allowed to export prime cuts of lamb to the European Union? When the WTO agreement comes up for discussion, it is crucially important that it is restructured and that only carcase meat and no additional tonnage are allowed into the EU. Why are French lamb producers getting prices which are almost 50 per cent higher than those of their Irish colleagues, particularly as French farmers are entitled to the same ewe premium? Is this in keeping with the EU principle of equality of treatment for all farmers? Why are consumers being charged up to £90 per lamb but farmers are failing to get even half that amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The store lamb trade in Ireland has collapsed. Farmers are bringing store lambs to the mart but they are not even receiving bids for them at present. Farmers are getting out of the sheep <Col N="1420" /> trade and are not breeding ewes because they have no confidence. Prices have collapsed and farmers see no future for sheep farming. They are moving to purchase suckler cows because of the new system of extensification which ignores sheep producers. Although there is overproduction in the European Union at present, they are also moving into beef production. This will intensify the problem in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>When was the Minister last abroad to promote Irish lamb and beef? When he was in Opposition, we thought a new airline company, Air Walsh, would be established if he was in Government. The Minister and the Taoiseach were going to fly here, there and everywhere hand in hand. The Minister has failed to promote Irish beef and lamb. He has failed to travel abroad and he has failed to bring the Taoiseach with him as he promised when he was in Opposition. It is time to shape up or ship out.</P>
    <P>Teagasc is inviting companies such as Boston Scientific and Thermo King to open agricultural events because it sees no future in farming, particularly for young people. The Minister has ignored the agricultural crisis, especially in the sheepmeat sector. It is time he ensured a fairer ewe premium is put in place which is equal for all farmers throughout the European Union. He must ensure that the extensification clause is changed and that if sheep are included, farmers are paid. Otherwise, sheep should be removed altogether. Either way, a decision must be made. The Minister must also ensure that lowland sheep producers get a proper headage payment and that any new headage funds are targeted at such producers. The Minister has buried his head in the sand for long enough. It is time to realise there is a crisis and ensure the sheepmeat sector becomes viable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank Deputy Connaughton for giving us this opportunity to debate the serious crisis in agriculture. I will deal first with the serious crisis in the pig industry in the Border region. I welcome the presence of the Minister for this debate because when I raised this matter two weeks ago, none of the three Ministers with responsibility for this area were present and it was dealt with by the Minister with responsibility for housing. I am glad there is an improvement in that this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take seriously the problems of the pig industry in the Border region. In the last week or so a number of young farmers went out of business. In 1998 pigs in the Border region were 12p a kilo less than in the Minister's area of Cork and Tipperary. In 1999, the difference was approximately 8p in the first quarter. Farmers in the Border region have, with the full support of Fianna Fáil and Independent Members, put forward a case to the Minister &ndash; I appreciate that he met the delegation last <Col N="1421" /> Wednesday &ndash; for a once off payment of approximately £4.8 million to try to salvage the remaining operations and ensure those involved stay in business.</P>
    <P>A letter from the Minister's office was read at a meeting of Monaghan County Council yesterday. It stated that there was a 23 per cent increase in pig prices this year. That indicates how far his office is out of touch because, once again, the price of pigs has collapsed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton said there was a good market for weanlings in Europe. Good quality weanlings are leaving the country. This will create serious problem for the beef industry, including the possibility of creating long-term beef markets. However, given the crisis at farm level, I welcome any opportunity that arises.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was on this side of the House he said the Libyan and Iranian markets would be opened up. Indeed the visit of three members of his party to Iran had the effect of stopping the unloading of a boat; it held up the opening up of that market for a period. At the time, an attempt was made to claim responsibility for something the Fine Gael led Government was doing. At present there is no market for Fresian cattle, Holsteins or culled cows.</P>
    <P>Young farmers are facing a crisis and I invite the Minister to visit my county to see how serious it is. The county has a high reputation for intensive farming in poultry, mushrooms and in County Cavan, at the other end of the constituency, in pigs. Thirteen young farmers applied to attend St. Patrick's Agriculture College, yet that college has now closed. Is that any reason for the Minister to be worried? Seemingly not. Unless steps are taken to give realistic help to young farmers there is no future for them.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, has submitted a question about the areas of severe handicap that are no longer included under Objective One. My parish and the surrounding area in County Monaghan has the most difficult land in the country, yet it has been omitted from inclusion as a severely handicapped area. I implore the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to remove this anomaly and include it in the severely handicapped areas so that it can qualify for Objective One status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion calls on the Government to provide adequate financing for the REP scheme, the farm retirement scheme, for on-farm investment, for the young farmer installation aid scheme and for the control of pollution grant scheme over the period of the next national development plan. These schemes are all essential to the maintenance and development of the economic contribution of agriculture and the food industry. In addition, they are essential if agriculture is to make its proper contribution to promoting the drive towards sustainable development, which is the stated policy of this Government and its predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REP scheme and the control of pollution <Col N="1422" /> grant scheme are central parts of sustainable development in agriculture. Looking to the future, something like the model of the REP scheme is bound to become the overall framework of a sustainable agricultural development policy. It is time we recognised that, not only in this country but also in the EU. We must anticipate its arrival and position ourselves to get the benefits of being the first in the field.</P>
    <P>With every day that passes the control of pollution grant scheme becomes increasingly important as we become more conscious of the extent and sources of low grade pollution of our water courses. The young farmers installation aid scheme has suffered from the scandal of the &ldquo;on again, off again&rdquo; approach of the Government. At a time when fewer members of farm families are showing a willingness to make a career and livelihood in farming, we should be removing obstacles from their path rather than increasing them.</P>
    <P>The construction of this scheme, and its operation in practice, have both become excessively bureaucratic and remote from the real needs of ensuring well qualified successors for farm operators. The scheme must be simplified and streamlined and made far more effective if it is to play any substantial role in contributing to the quality and innovativeness of a new generation of farm operators, because these people in their turn will have to deal with ever more severe economic pressures and ever more restrictive environmental demands. Deputy Connaughton outlined our proposals for making that scheme work.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the early farm retirement scheme needs major rationalisation and simplification. Time and again, Members come across applicants for the scheme who are ruled out of benefit because of bureaucratic considerations that are largely irrelevant to the principal objective of the scheme, which is to mobilise land into the hands of progressive young farmers while providing reasonable conditions of retirement for their predecessors. In what other walk of life would one's behaviour ten years before one makes a decision determine whether one is eligible for a pension? We must not let bureaucratic requirements prevail over the basic objectives of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming millennium round of world trade talks is another area requiring close attention if we are to ensure that agriculture and the food sector remain dynamic sources of growth in the economy. The EU was comprehensively out-manoeuvred on agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round. Since the conclusion of that round we have seen the systematic withdrawal of the EU from many of its former markets around the world. In each case EU exports have been replaced by exports from some or all of the Cairns Group &ndash; the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. As a result of an agreement in which the EU was obliged to curtail its exports supports and increase access to its market, some of these countries have moved into markets vacated by the EU with the assistance, either <Col N="1423" /> overt or covert, of export support programmes. We must not allow that to happen in the forthcoming round because we paid far too heavy a price on the last occasion.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The fact that so many Members from many diverse constituency backgrounds &ndash; Galway, Leitrim, Roscommon-Longford, Cavan-Monaghan, Kildare and Mayo &ndash; have contributed to this debate speaks volumes. The attendance by so many to speak with such passion in support of the motion moved by Deputy Connaughton indicates the anger, anxiety and frustration felt on all sides in all counties at the catastrophe unfolding before us but the most annoying aspect is the Government's seeming acceptance of it as inevitable.</P>
      <P>When we left the 19th century the main items on the political agenda were the Land Acts &ndash; the Gladstone, Balfour, Wyndham and Ashbourne Acts. In the space of approximately ten years there was an agricultural revolution when the land of Ireland changed from land owned by landlords and run by tenant farmers. The aims of the previous years, of fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure now look modest. For the first time, the land of Ireland was handed to the people of Ireland. Davitt must feel betrayed at the manner in which that legacy is being betrayed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves. Before the Dáil went into recess last July I asked the Minister to provide me and the House with information on the number of farmers who had applied for agricultural grants in County Mayo in 1992 and 1998. In 1992, 14,218 farmers were claiming grants. Six years later, in 1998, that had declined to 13,085. This means that in Country Mayo 1,133 fewer farmers were claiming livestock grants in 1998 by comparison with 1992; effectively, it means that 1,300 farmers had gone to the wall. They were non-eligible or they did not think it worth their while to apply. They were non-existent. These figures have been replicated in every county along the western seaboard and throughout the country. What is being said tonight is accurate and valid. It is hard, not harsh. We do not want promises, platitudes or sticking plaster solutions; we need to get agriculture up off its knees now. We need radical solutions, otherwise it will be much too late.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for their continuing support for the agriculture, food and rural development sectors, and their efforts to deal <Col N="1424" /> with the issues currently affecting farmers through:</P>
    <P>the success of the Minister in protecting and enhancing the incomes and prospects of farmers over the medium term through the agreement reached in negotiations on Agenda 2000;</P>
    <P>the success of the Minister in relation to the European Commission's allocation of £1.75 billion  towards the financing of the Rural Development Plan for Ireland;</P>
    <P>the Government's inclusion of substantial funds in the draft National Development Plan to aid farmers and the food and rural development sectors in the years ahead;</P>
    <P>providing very substantial direct income support to farmers involving record direct payments of over £1,000 million to farmers in 1998 and a high level of support to be continued in this year and future years;</P>
    <P>providing very substantial market support for farm produce involving in excess of £500 million expended in 1998 to support the prices of farm produce;</P>
    <P>supporting farmers and the food industry in maintaining high standards of food safety and animal welfare, so essential for the protection of consumers and the development of markets;</P>
    <P>supporting farmers, particularly young farmers, through the restoration of the farm installation scheme and concessions in the taxation and stamp duty regulations;</P>
    <P>the successful programme of improving the efficiency of our farms through continued reform of quota arrangements;</P>
    <P>the continuing and successful efforts of the Minister to aid farmers and the food industry in expanding overseas markets for livestock and food exports;</P>
    <P>the setting up of an agri-food 2010 Committee to develop a strategy for the long-term future of agriculture and the food industry.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, food and rural development are very important topics and it is appropriate that they should be debated in this House. I welcome any opportunity to inform Deputies of the developments taking place in agriculture. For that reason, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for me to welcome this debate. It gives me yet another chance to correct the numerous unfortunate misunderstandings that the Opposition seems to labour under regarding the main issues affecting agriculture. It allows me to address their inexplicable refusal to recognise that this Government has done tremendous work over the past two and a half years in helping Irish farmers through a series of difficulties and in putting the industry on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> By any standard the outcome achieved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations was a tremendous success and secured the medium term future of Irish farmers' incomes and prospects. I make no apology for reminding all concerned of the anxiety caused by these proposals when they were first introduced in March 1998. These proposals would have involved a loss to Irish farmers of £233 million per annum, that is, a loss of £1,386 million over the seven year period. The final outcome involved a gain of £395 over the seven year period. That was a massive turnaround of almost £1,800 million. These gains were hard won after tough negotiations. I was particularly pleased that the Heads of Government of the 15 member states when they met in Berlin last March &ndash; a meeting I attended &ndash; agreed that the decisions adopted regarding the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda 2000 will constitute essential elements in defining the Commission's negotiating mandate for the future multilateral trade negotiations at the world trade round. That round is beginning in Seattle at the end of this month and it is important that the gains won in the Agenda 2000 negotiations will be retained.</P>
    <P>Work is under way on a range of policies from improving the efficiency of Irish farms, through the reform of the milk quota systems, for example, to the highly significant work of planning the strategic direction of the sector's long-term future. The latter is being undertaken by the experts I appointed to the 2010 Committee set up in May following the successful conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. While I am not under any illusion that I can convince the Opposition to voice approval of this Government's significant achievements or of the importance and cohesion in our approach to planning for the future, I can set down for the House the facts and let them speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion refers to support for Irish farmers and their communities. The facts show the true picture. Last year, under my direction, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry spent almost £2 billion supporting Irish farmers, the food sector and rural development. Such large expenditure, equivalent to 4 per cent of GNP, belies the accusation of lack of understanding and support for our 146,000 full time and part time farmers, for rural communities and for the food industry. The total commitment of the Government to support agriculture, food and rural development is beyond doubt, given the ongoing annual level of expenditure of almost £2 billion.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main forms of Government support for the sector. In practical terms the Government's commitment to farming can be seen in the level of direct payments made to farmers. In 1998, direct payments amounted to in excess of £1 billion. This represented 56 per cent of total farm income. Following the successful outcome of Agenda 2000, figures produced by the Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute suggest that by 2007, direct payments will account <Col N="1426" /> for more than 70 per cent of farmers' incomes. In addition to this direct support, substantial indirect subsidies are also provided to Ireland's agri-food sector. For example, expenditure on market support measures such as export refunds and intervention amounted to almost £0.5 billion in 1998. National expenditure on disease eradication, research and training and administration of schemes amounts to almost £400 million.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the past few years were difficult for many farmers. This was due to problems caused by the BSE crisis, poor weather conditions last year and the closure of the Russian markets. In recognition of these difficulties, I introduced a range of measures to alleviate the situation last winter, including a £40 million fodder package. In order to support vulnerable farm households, the Government introduced a new farm assist scheme for which £43 million was provided. This was specifically targeted at low income farm households. To date, 7,404 farmers have been approved for this scheme, receiving average payments of almost £80 per week. Some 1,126 farmers are still in receipt of smallholders assistance with average payments of £74.60 per week. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are in the process of transferring all remaining recipients of smallholders assistance who are eligible, to the farm assist scheme.</P>
    <P>In spite of these difficulties in recent years, we must acknowledge that by comparison with other EU countries, Irish agriculture has performed very well in the 1990s. For example, average income from agricultural activity grew by more than 20 per cent in real terms in Ireland over the 1990s, compared to the average EU growth of only 12 per cent. In the UK, average income fell by almost 20 per cent over the same period. An increasing number of farmers are now supplementing their income through off-farm employment. This has been facilitated by the national economic boom and growth in employment that we are currently experiencing. On average, more than half the farm household income now comes from non-farming activities. I welcome this as a positive development which will ensure the economic viability of many farming families and farming communities in the future. Another benefit to farmers from the current economic climate is that interest rates are at very low levels. This is reflected in the fact that in 1998 interest payments amounted to almost 11 per cent of farm income, compared to almost 30 per cent during the period of the very high interest rates in the early 1980s.</P>
    <P>Having set out the general background, I will now deal with the individual points raised by Deputies in their motion. First, in supporting young farmers, installation aid for young farmers has been restored. The early retirement scheme is also a valuable incentive for young farmers to take over the management of farms. In addition, there is stock relief, the two-thirds reduction in stamp duty, land leasing for farmers over the age of 55 who lease out their land, the first £4,000 of <Col N="1427" /> rental income is exempted from income tax where a lease is for a period of five to six years and the first £6,000 for leases of seven years or more. Similarly, relief under the capital acquisitions tax means that most farm transfers are exempt from this tax. An individual aged 55 years or more is exempt from capital gains tax provided the sales value of the farm is less than £250,000. If the disposal is to the owner's child, then the exemption applies irrespective of the sale price.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan is an exceptionally important plan which will be unveiled around the middle of this month. All the measures mentioned by the Deputies in the motion have been included in this plan. The measures will be financed by structural and guarantee funds. On-farm investment schemes such as the control of farm pollution and the installation aid for young farmers will operate under the Structural Funds. Total public funds for agricultural development under the Productive Investment Inter-Regional Programme will be of the order of £278 million over the seven year period. Allocations for individual schemes have not yet been finalised. In addition, total public funds amounting to £172 million will be available for rural development type measures addressing some of the commitments in the White Paper and alternative enterprises under the two regional programmes. The amount includes national matching funding for Leader Plus and approximately £35 million is expected from the EU for this community initiative.</P>
    <P>All training and research activities under the National Plan are being brought together with a view to ensuring a co-ordinated approach and Departments will receive indicative allocations for their respective areas. The position in relation to the food industry is similar with allocations made across the industry as a whole, but with indicative allocations for the food sector to cover capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and training. Co-financing by the EU in respect of the above measures will be identified in the plan, but it is expected to be very small in comparison to the Exchequer funding being provided.</P>
    <P>A special CAP rural development plan has been drawn up and submitted to the Commission for approval by the end of 1999 to draw down EU funds allocated for REPS, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry. These measures have been alluded to here tonight. As regards financing, very substantial Exchequer funds in the order of £3,405 million are being provided to cover these four measures, with approximately £1,740 million of the full amount coming from the EU. I expect that that substantial amount of money will be adequate to cover those schemes for the term of the plan.</P>
    <P>Further details on the funding arrangements will be contained in the plan which will be published in the middle of this month. Overall, funding for this Department will be increased by <Col N="1428" /> approximately 50 per cent and this should ensure that increased demand can be adequately catered for over the seven years of the plan.</P>
    <P>On 13 October I announced my proposals for the distribution of the additional milk quota and also in relation to quota management measures which are possible following changes in the EU regulations agreed as part of Agenda 2000. The additional quota was relatively small. Nonetheless, it helped to provide additional milk for some of the categories provided for.</P>
    <P>In the distribution of the quota I had regard, on the one hand, to the need of younger farmers already in milk production and, on the other, producers with small or medium size quotas. The amount of milk was not great &ndash; 20 million gallons &ndash; and much more milk will become available under the new management of the milk quota regime.</P>
    <P>I decided in the first instance to set down the rules only for the quota becoming available on 1 April 2000, that is, 20.5 million gallons at this stage, and leave decisions on the 11.5 million gallons becoming available on 1 April 2001 for a later date. On that basis I decided that 15 million gallons would be made available to producers with quotas below 55,000 gallons who meet certain strict criteria. I also decided that five million gallons of milk will be made available to a special scheme for younger active producers who commenced milk production since 1993, again subject to certain strict criteria.</P>
    <P>The balance of 500,000 gallons available from the 20.5 million will be set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution. This is to deal with exceptional cases where particular problems are encountered by some producers in meeting the eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the management of the quota regime. The agreement under Agenda 2000 allowed for a greater degree of flexibility in the application of the quota regime. I have decided to use the opportunity to change the system operating in Ireland to ensure that active committed producers have greater access to quota over the coming years. It is essential that the system should allow for greater certainty to those producers so that the dairy industry, which is highly export dependent, can meet whatever competitive challenges lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I have decided, therefore, that the transfer of quota based on a rigid link between milk and land which has existed since 1984 will be replaced by one which allows for the sale of milk quota based on the existing restructuring scheme which has worked successfully in this country. This will be done in an equitable way aimed at encouraging the best possible development of the milk industry, while recognising the interests of the parties involved. It will facilitate a more orderly arrangement for the distribution of quota and will ensure that a large quota of milk will be available for restructuring.</P>
    <P>Such a move will have several benefits. It will allow quota to be targeted towards priority categ<Col N="1429" /> ories while giving certain access to all producers. It will help to maintain quota within the less advantaged areas. Most importantly, however, it will keep the price of acquiring additional quota within the reach of smaller and medium sized producers. The current system of acquiring quota with land has led, over the years, to increased quota costs adding in turn to production costs. In many cases, producers were taking on the burden of additional land which they did not need and which was of no real help to their enterprise.</P>
    <P>As part of the alternative system of quota transfer, I have decided to restrict the number of times in which dormant quota may be leased into the temporary scheme. It is important that these quotas should be available to active, committed milk producers on a permanent basis. This restriction will be introduced on a gradual basis but the final outcome must be that the milk quota is available to producers on a permanent rather than a year to year basis to enable them plan their production with some degree of certainty.</P>
    <P>I recognise that introducing changes to a system which has been in place for 15 years is a complex and sensitive matter and I am conscious of particular situations, for example, inter-family transfers and cases of existing long-term leases, where some people have a substantial part of their quota on a long-term lease. There are no circumstances in which that can be terminated abruptly and I have no intention of doing that. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has taken up these matters with legal advisers from the Attorney General's office and will also be meeting with the EU Commission in the near future to consider how these and other situations can be accommodated within the regulations.</P>
    <P>The general reaction to my proposals both on the quota allocation and the quota management changes has been positive. It is accepted by most people involved in the industry that the proposals are fair and in the best interests of the dairy sector generally. They will reinforce the position of active milk producers as well as supporting young and smaller scale farmers.</P>
    <P>With regard to expediting the national cattle breeding plan, I am particularly satisfied with the Government's track record on this issue. We recognised some time ago that our cattle breed improvement programmes needed upgrading and to be put on a fully commercial basis. We have to start with proper breeding programmes to breed the correct animals for specific markets. Every day of the week people are paid on quality, particularly for live cattle, and research is being carried out on an objective mechanical grading system which would be put in place shortly. The sooner that happens, the better.</P>
    <P>In relation to Leader groups, the Government is committed to the Leader model of rural development. The Leader concept is particularly suited to Irish conditions with our tradition of self-help and voluntary and community development. There is no doubt that Leader I and Leader <Col N="1430" /> II were highly successful in regenerating rural areas. It is my ambition to ensure that Leader II will continue the good work done under Leader I.</P>
    <P>Leader Plus is the EU community initiative to which the European Commission is committed under Agenda 2000. The Commission has indicated that it will finalise the new community initiative before the end of the year. This will allow new programmes to be presented and approved as early as possible in 2000. I assure Deputies that once the terms and conditions of the new programmes are finalised by the Commission, there will be no delay in implementing the new programme either on my part or that of the Department. We intend to approach the implementation of Leader Plus in a carefully planned manner to ensure that the new programme makes the maximum contribution possible to the development of rural areas.</P>
    <P>The EU has recently announced the allocation to Ireland of £35.4 million for the implementation of Leader Plus. In line with the reduction in the level of funding for community initiatives generally, the funding of Leader Plus is a reduction on the funding provided for Leader II. Nevertheless, the considerable allocation for the next programme is a demonstration of the EU commitment to continue the Leader model of development.</P>
    <P>Provision for the additional State contribution to Leader Plus is being made in the national development plan and consideration is being given to provide funding to enable some of the useful experiences of Leader I and II to be incorporated into national programmes. These funds demonstrate the Government's commitment to the principle of &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; involvement in local development and will allow the momentum built up under Leader I and Leader II to be continued.</P>
    <P>I will summarise the current position in the main market sectors. The level of throughput of finished cattle at meat export plants has increased by 14 per cent and considerable progress is being achieved in clawing our way back onto the EU markets we lost following the BSE problem.</P>
    <P>As regards market access generally, I have gone out of my way in every possible situation to provide access to markets. It is a matter for the industry to make the most of those markets once they are opened up. The Department is continually providing veterinary requirements for Irish cattle and beef to ensure we get into those markets and stay in them.</P>
    <P>I expect Deputies will join me in welcoming the lifting of restrictions on beef exports to Russia from five counties &ndash; Cork, Tipperary, Limerick, Clare and Donegal. Cavan, Meath and Monaghan are still subject to restrictions, a position which will be reviewed again next year. I would like to pay tribute to the veterinary experts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who have built up a tremendous degree of liaison with their Russian counterparts. <Col N="1431" /> That confidence has allowed the ban on those counties to be lifted.</P>
    <P>I now turn to live cattle exports. When I came into office we did not have live cattle exports, we did not even have a ship to provide live exports. I had to go to Government to provide leasing of <i>The Purbeck</i> to resume live exports. I am glad live exports to date this year amount to 325,000 head, more than a ninefold increase on 1997. The trade this year includes almost 260,000 head of younger animals to continental markets and over 55,000 head of adult cattle to Lebanon. While it is unfortunate that the trade with Libya has not yet resumed, the significance of this market has to be viewed against the major improvement in live cattle exports generally.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that agreement was reached with the Libyan Government. We went through the process of signing an agreement and it was ratified by the people's authority in Libya. I visited Libya earlier this year and it is clear that despite the intergovernmental agreement, there remains a blockage to the resumption of trade. We continue to make every possible effort to reopen that market. The Libyans have reneged on a solemn agreement between the two Governments. However, I am glad that 325,000 head of cattle have been exported from Ireland and I intend to maintain that momentum. From a situation where we had no ship on the high seas, we now have 16 dedicated ships and three with roll-on/roll-off facilities.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties facing sheep producers and I am aware that they have been through a tough time. There is over-production here; we have in excess of 8 million sheep. There is also over-production in the UK. We used to sell live sheep to Spain and Portugal but there is also over-production there and they are now exporting. The low price stems from increased supplies of UK lamb to the French market. We supply about 70 per cent of sheep exports to the French market and anything which happens there has a knock-on effect here. Another factor is that French lamb is perceived by French consumers to be superior to imported product and, as a result, they are willing to pay premium prices for domestically produced lamb.</P>
    <P>However, I have taken a number of measures to help address the difficulties in the sector. In response to my representations, the European Commission introduced aids for private storage last month to take 130,000 lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK. There has been strong interest in the scheme in Ireland and it has now been fully taken up. More importantly from our point of view is the fact that 115,000 lambs were taken off the UK market, which can only benefit our market. I am satisfied that this scheme has helped to alleviate the position in the sector to some extent.</P>

      <P>As far as the EU sheepmeat regime is concerned, I have made the strongest representations to Commissioner Fischler over the past number of years to have the regime modified. These matters were raised by Deputy Connaughton and I am well aware of them. One of the deficiencies which has been identified is the failure of the ewe premium system to take account of the fact that prices vary considerably from member state to member state. Another deficiency in the ewe premium is the non-payment of an extensification premium on ewes despite the fact they are included in the calculation of stocking density.  Despite raising this at every possible opportunity, I have received no positive response from the Commission and, worse still, no support from any member state.</P>
      <P>I have been reminded that, in spite of all its defects, the ewe premium system provides important income support to Irish producers amounting to approximately £110 million per annum with a further £22 million coming from the headage payments under the Structural Funds. This is a substantial amount of money and, while I am fully committed to securing improvements in the system, we have to acknowledge that the regime is seen by the Commission and other member states to be relatively expensive.</P>
      <P>There has been a recovery of about 19 per cent in pig producers' incomes since the start of the year. That shows how bad the situation was at the that time. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is plenty of scope for further improvement. The main reason for the drop in market prices for pigmeat is over-production. Following an outbreak of classical swine fever in Europe, supplies shortened and prices rose encouraging increased production which continued long after the disease was eradicated. Another factor which contributed to the difficulties was the under-performance of traditional pigmeat markets in Japan and Russia. In Ireland, further difficulties were encountered in Border areas due to a fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland which created a backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter on some producers' holdings in the Border counties. I took swift action in that regard and ensured that the backlog was dealt with quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level, with my colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, I strongly urged the European Commission to take action to improve the difficult pigmeat market. As a result, the Commission substantially increased export refunds and introduced aids to private storage. In addition, a food aid programme for Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat, was put into operation. To date about 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been sent to Russia under this programme. The European Commission has indicated that pig supplies in the last quarter of 1999 are expected to decrease. This means that market prices should recover further, especially with increased demand over the Christmas period. Nevertheless, I have recently written to Commissioner Fischler, in advance of the next meeting <Col N="1433" /> of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, urging that the food aid programme be concluded as quickly as possible. I have also asked him to urgently bring forward proposals on longer term measures to assist the pigmeat market.</P>
    <P>I asked my senior officials to meet the processors last week to discuss the market. The processors were urged to do everything possible to improve the prices paid to their farmers. My Department has also met representatives from Enterprise Ireland and has asked them to examine the pigmeat sector, including the issue of slaughtering capacity and whether there are other aspects of the industry requiring attention and possible investment. In the Border counties and the north-west especially the level of slaughtering capacity must be addressed. I will meet with Dan Flinter of Enterprise Ireland and Michael Duffy of Bord Bia tomorrow in that regard.</P>
    <P>At a time when the pigmeat sector is experiencing great difficulties, I find it incomprehensible that farmer related organisations import such a high volume of pigmeat. Some 35,000 tonnes were imported this year in a market where about 135,000 tonnes is consumed. It baffles me that 35,000 tonnes is imported when our industry is under such pressure, especially when farmer related organisations are importing that bacon.</P>
    <P>The quality of Irish pigmeat is renowned worldwide. Bord Bia is doing tremendous work in this regard. The board has a statutory function to promote, assist and develop in any manner it considers necessary or desirable the marketing of Irish food and livestock. The board's budget for 1999 is about £21 million with £7 million provided by way of grant-in-aid. I know Bord Bia remains fully alert to the competitive pressures emerging in the marketplace for the Irish food industry and will continue to implement programmes to support and sustain the excellent development of this important industry.</P>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid has been a very important instrument in assisting young farmers embark on their careers. This scheme is a clear indication of my commitment to securing the future of young people in agriculture. I was pleased to reintroduce the scheme in 1998. To date, almost 800 applications have made under the scheme, of which 290 young farmers have been paid a total of £1.6 million. Proposals for the scheme under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 are being formulated by my Department and will take account of young farmers' requirements within the context of the funding available.</P>
    <P>An additional £25 million from Exchequer funds was provided for the reintroduction of on-farm investment schemes. This funding has enabled the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to meet all outstanding commitments under the schemes and to reintroduce nationally funded schemes for the control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes. Both schemes were approved earlier this year by the European Commission and are now in oper<Col N="1434" /> ation. The reintroduction of these on-farm investment schemes has been a high priority for me and the Government. I am keenly aware of the continuing need for structural improvements on many farms to maintain the greatest number of families in farming. The schemes as introduced will provide smaller scale farmers with the necessary support to improve pollution control on their farms, to upgrade or construct new dairy or milking premises, to engage in more sustainable farming practices and to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>I established the Agri Food 2010 Committee in May of this year. Its objective is to map out the future strategy for agriculture and the food industry. With the Agenda 2000 agreement, the Irish food sector now has a favourable framework for development over the next several years. However, our significant achievements in the negotiations on Agenda 2000 should not lead to any sense of complacency about the future. There are challenges ahead and the committee is closely examining every aspect of the agri-food sector to ensure it is sufficiently strong and competitive to meet these challenges and to grow and prosper in the future. In completing its task, the Agri Food 2010 Committee has sought the widest possible input from interested parties. The members of the committee are all leading figures in their own right drawn from throughout the agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>In setting out its task, I made it clear that the committee should adopt a no-holds-barred approach in its deliberations and I have every confidence in its ability to do so and to come up with a guiding strategy for the future of the Irish agriculture food industry. I expect to receive its report early in the new year and I expect it to signpost the way ahead for Irish agriculture and food in the context of an enlarging EU and the next WTO agreement, negotiations for which should commence at the end of this month and should conclude in a few years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on agriculture, especially the future of farming as an industry in Ireland over the next decade. I compliment Deputy Connaughton on tabling this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be clear about the direction in which we want to go because there are numerous ways to progress. From the Labour Party's point of view, they must be predicated on the central, underlying objectives of taking measures to ensure and secure the survival of family farms in rural Ireland. In order to achieve this optimum objective, we must pursue unashamedly focused and targeted policies which will increase the income of farm families and maximise the potential of Irish agriculture. This may well necessitate a fundamental review and analysis of a kind not undertaken heretofore on the agriculture industry at national level. Instead of bemoaning and replaying the litany of disasters which have befallen the farming industry over recent years, we should have the capacity to be proactive in <Col N="1435" /> our response to change and keep pace with the new opportunities and trends emerging in the wider field of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Following the Agenda 2000 proposals and discussions, we now have a settled environment in which it is unlikely that there will be major changes in CAP for the coming eight years or so. However, we must be especially alive to the impact of the changes and competition which will undoubtedly arise from decisions which will be made in the not too distant future by the World Trade Organisation. Policy must be formulated in such a way as to ensure that the Irish farming sector will be profitable. It is important that the Government supports innovation, efficiency and quality but that, in doing so, it does not alienate and further marginalise small farmers who have had to contend in the past with policies, often promoted by organisations of which they were members, which, when followed through, resulted in their numbers being severely depleted.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister to task about the manner in which he decided to allocate the additional milk quota available on foot of the Agenda 2000 agreement where he indulged in the old style Fianna Fáil tactic of trying to assuage everyone. He promoted Gay Byrne's philosophy of providing a little for everyone in the audience rather than taking the difficult decision to target the extra gallonage at those most in need where it would be more effective.</P>
    <P>The number of active milk producers has reduced from 64,000 when the quota regime was originally introduced in 1984 to 31,000 today. Approximately 24,000 producers are producing 35,000 gallons or less, many of whose incomes are just above subsistence level. Some earn very paltry incomes of less than £6,000. The Minister's decision will not assist in achieving the fundamental objectives of preserving the maximum number of farming families on the land. It is expected that the 31,000 figure will decrease by a further 15,000 in the next six years. That is a frightening and damning statistic.</P>
    <P>We all agree with the allocation of the five million gallons for younger agricultural producers who have commenced milk production since 1993. That was a positive decision. There are eligibility criteria relating to attaining the 90 per cent quota usage level, namely, being under 35 years of age at the date of commencement of milk production with the necessary educational qualifications and the holding of a maximum quota of 35,000 gallons. The maximum allocation to producers in this category is in the order of 5,000 gallons which is good as far as it goes. Why did the Minister not target the 15 million gallons available to him on this occasion, bearing in mind he did not deal with the further 11.5 million gallons which will be available in 2001, to a priority category of approximately 5,000 active small and medium milk suppliers, all of whom would have quotas less than 35,000 gallons? Had he done so, the Minister would have used the discretion <Col N="1436" /> afforded to him under Agenda 2000 in the best long-term interest of the dairy sector and would have ensured the attainment of what should be an important national social objective for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to sound overly pessimistic, a great opportunity to be really radical was missed in this case. Having faced down the nonsensical proposal advocating a <i>pro rata</i> allocation of 2.86 per cent to all producers, the Minister should have gone the extra mile. Instead, he bowed to political expediency and attempted to spread the largesse when his overall objective should have been selective and meaningful targeting. The Minister should have learned from the farming organisations. There was no unity in their ranks on this issue, indeed, they were deeply divided on it. The Minister ended up giving eligible applicants less than an additional half cow per annum in production terms when he could have given the targeted group, about which I have spoken, the equivalent of four extra cows per annum. That would have made a considerable difference to the priority group &ndash; from an income perspective, it would have represented the difference between survival and extinction.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge and welcome the decision made by the Minister to deal with the distribution of the national envelope for the beef sector. Any criticisms I make are intended to be constructive. I was extremely concerned that the Minister might have been tempted to top up the deseasonalisation premium which doubtless would have been gobbled up by the factories, as happened in the past. I am glad he resisted that and took on some of the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>I am proud to come into this House on many occasions and advocate policies promoted by the Irish Cattle Traders &amp; Stockowners Association, policies which some IFA people do not like. I am glad the Minister recognised that heifer producers were left out of the equation &ndash; indeed, some people still wanted them left out when the extra money was being allocated &ndash; and I support him every step of the way. I welcome the fact that the £8.2 million will be used to top up the £21 heifer slaughter premium which will be introduced on 1 January 2000. I understand the top-up will be approximately £18 per head and will be confined to beef heifers in line with the requirements of the suckler cow scheme in order to encourage quality heifer beef production.</P>
    <P>The milk quota limit for the suckler cow premium has been increased by 5,000 gallons. Had the Minister not done that, some people who would normally qualify for the suckler cow premium would be disqualified under the extra allocation in the milk envelope. I note he has also increased the 90 head ceiling for the special beef premium to 180 head. When the Minister is replying, perhaps he will outline how that might affect the extensification calculations in regard to some matters I will raise in relation to sheep.</P>
    <P>Irish farming will undoubtedly require substan<Col N="1437" /> tial investment to remain competitive and to meet new requirements, especially in the area of environmental protection. Farmers are now reinvesting approximately one third of their farm incomes in their farms which means that over a five year period, approximately £3 million was invested by farmers in their farming businesses and that approximately £850 million has been invested in farm buildings over the same period. The Minister reintroduced the control of farmyard pollution scheme and has received more than 3,000 applications to date. The average investment cost per farmer is approximately £20,000 while the average grant payable per applicant is approximately £7,900. Has the Minister provided the £24 million required to fund this scheme until the end of the year? </P>
    <P>It is high time, in the context of the forthcoming budget, that the capital allowances for on-farm investment are increased to 100 per cent and that the mechanism of free depreciation are allowed to apply, especially as farmers are upgrading their facilities to ensure compliance with EU milk hygiene and animal welfare regulations. The current grant schemes are somewhat restrictive and may not be adequate to cater for the future level of investment required.</P>
    <P>I strongly advocated the reinstatement of the installation aid scheme for young farmers and I understand that there have been approximately 800 applicants since 1 January. It is taking an average of approximately three months to process these applications. Is it not clear that insufficient money is provided in the Estimates to deal with the number of applications on hand, not to mention the number outstanding prior to the scheme's suspension in August 1997, which I understand was in the order of 350? Some of the applications are being deliberately delayed as adequate finance is not available for all the applicants. Sufficient levels of staff are not available to deal with the administration of the scheme. Although I understand that some of the forms may be incomplete, significant delays are being experienced.</P>
    <P>A 26 year old farmer, who applied under the previous scheme, contacted me today. His father retired after taking up the early retirement scheme. This young lad came back into the scheme and his number was 2001 which meant he was the first farmer in in County Westmeath but, to date, he has not been paid. He has had a plethora of requests from the officer in charge looking for a variety of things. It is high time we ensured this young farmer, who could derive a livelihood from something else, is paid the £5,600 he is due. Indeed, I have a question for the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that a major structural characteristic of Irish agriculture is the unbalanced age structure where about only 12 per cent of farm holders or about 17,000 in total are under the age of 35, while about 22 per cent are aged 65 or over. That means that of the 146,000 farmers, almost 33,000 are now aged 65 years or <Col N="1438" /> over. We spend about £14,000 per job through tax incentives and grants from the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, etc., and we are glad to do so and fully support that policy but surely we are now living in an age of financial affluence which should permit us to pay an equivalent amount by means of the installation aid scheme to each young farmer who is 35 years of age or less and has the necessary educational qualifications to take up the profession of farming. It makes good socio-economic sense to do so and it is important to consider a substantial increase in the amount of grant payable in the forthcoming budget and in the context of the recent White Paper on rural development.</P>
    <P>In common with other EU countries, sheep production in Ireland is mainly in the disadvantaged areas. Over 40 per cent of the flock is on the hills but this proportion is likely to fall due to environmental measures to combat over-grazing. In 1998, 43,341 farmers were paid ewe premium and of these, 80 per cent were located in the disadvantaged areas. Basically, we are reflecting what is going on in EU sheep producing countries where most of their breeding flock is located in the disadvantaged or less favoured areas. There has been a huge and, indeed, complicated change in the extensification system which has recently come into play. We will now take into consideration all animals on the farm over six months of age, regardless of whether they qualify for premium. These animals will obviously include sheep. Farmers may opt for a simplified scheme which will involve making a declaration to remain under their chosen stock and density for the full year and be open to random inspections or apply under the normal scheme which will be extremely complicated and will include up to possibly five census counts a year in order to calculate the average stock and density for the year. The Lord save us and bless us, have we gone mad? There will be five visits to a farm to calculate the average stock and density. More money will be used on bureaucratic administration and travelling costs than will eventually go to the farmer. That is what is wrong with those schemes. Too much money is wasted on administration and too many bureaucratic hurdles are placed in front of farmers rather than trying to get the money into the pockets of the farmers who need it. Let us face reality.</P>
    <P>The fact sheep are still included in next year's extensification calculations without any changes in the ewe premium system following Agenda 2000 will lead to sheep being a non-viable enterprise on the majority of dry stock farms. The fact sheep have been excluded from extensification payments means they are no longer a viable option for the majority of farmers. As Deputy Connaughton said, the method of calculation of the ewe premium is also a problem. If Irish prices were utilised as a basis of calculation of ewe premium, farmers would receive about £8 per ewe more on the premium which would be about £38 million extra to the Irish sheep farmers. As Deputy Connaughton said, this method of cal<Col N="1439" /> culation used since 1992 has cost Irish farmers in the region of £240 million to date. It should also be noted that of every £5 which goes into a sheep farmer's pocket, £4 is spent locally which is important to the local economy, particularly rural shops. I recall that after I became a Member of the Dáil in 1992 sheep farmers were told by the then Minister for Agriculture not to worry as there would be a sheep price convergence across Europe, but this never happened.</P>
    <P>Another matter which impinges on the viability of sheep farmers is the level of imports of lamb from New Zealand amounting to about 227,000 tonnes, which is equivalent to five times the level of our exports. This has helped the EU to become 103 per cent self-sufficient in the process. This is also costing the EU more money in premia. It is vital the Minister fights a strong battle to oppose any further increase in sheep meat imports from New Zealand under the next World Trade Organisation round.</P>
    <P>The breaking of the land quota link has, for the most part, been broadly welcomed. Will new legislation be required to give effect to this proposal? Will it be in place before the start of the milk quota year on 1 April 2000? The fundamental overhaul of the milk quota regime with a proposal to ban private milk quota leases and private land and quota sales will require legislative underpinning. For example, what will happen to land and quota sales entered into between now and 31 March 2000? Has the opinion and the advice of the Attorney General been sought? Since the breaking of the land quota link will have the cumulative effect of putting all available milk quota into the restricting scheme for the redistribution to active milk producers, how will this work? Will the small farmers benefit in the way I proposed above? These and numerous other questions need to be addressed as time is of the essence.</P>
    <P>If we really want to help the farming population, the Minister should ensure that no impediments or obstacles are placed in the way of farmers when they apply for participation in the various schemes. What is happening to many farmers now, particularly elderly farmers, is the equivalent of an administrative nightmare. Farmers, many of them elderly, find they are disproportionately penalised for minor errors of a clerical nature which have clearly no fraudulent intent. The Minister should not tell me about the appeals system. I seek the implementation of a truly independent agricultural grants/ premiums/ subsidies appeals system chaired by an independent person which would facilitate more submissions by the appellant. I will settle for nothing less as the Minister does not appear to be prepared to simplify the forms used for applying for participation in these scheme and to try to reduce the number of forms required.</P>
    <P>Another issue the Minister will have to face up to sooner rather later, otherwise there will be a few wealthy barristers and solicitors, is that raised <Col N="1440" /> by the milk rights group. Those people are entitled to a milk quota and compensation for loss and damage in line by the principles laid down in the Duff case, which has already been decided by the Supreme Court. As the Minister will appreciate, there was a mistake in an Act introduced by the Minister of the day and the Department in the method employed to introduce and implement the 1984 milk quota regulations. I hope that, no more than with any others, the milk rights group will not have the blunt instrument of the Statute of Limitations Act used to deprive them of their just rights and to deny them justice. They based their plans &ndash; I recall it very well being involved in agriculture consultancy &ndash; upon advice proffered by State agencies and had a legitimate expectation, which is an important principle in law at European level and in the European Court of Justice. It is an extremely important and fundamental law and is like Article 40.3 of the Constitution dealing with fundamental rights. They had a legitimate expectation that they would be accommodated from the national reserve but we never created this reserve for the exclusive use of these development farmers, most of whom are members of the milk rights group which has about 1,200 or 1,300 members. They were deprived of what is effectively a legal right. We should own up when we make a mistake which causes hardship and heartache and we should do so immediately. In the new restructuring which will take place under the milk quota scheme as outlined by the Minister earlier, we should ensure their claim is accommodated.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister do something with the farm retirements scheme quickly? We have been waiting a long time for the income criteria and for the enlargement clause to be sorted out. We are still waiting for final Commission approval. Farmers who got £20 extra in disability benefit over a whole year five or six years ago are deprived of participation in the farm retirement scheme. It is absolute nonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am profoundly disappointed at the announcement last week that yet another 190 jobs are to be lost in the peninsula of Inishowen, County Donegal. I offer my sincere sympathy to all those families touched by this news who will inevitably have a very bleak beginning to the new millennium, contrary to the national trend. Many families will be affected not for the first time, and it will not be just one member of a family who will have to bear the brunt of a sore that is tearing away at the very fabric of society within the peninsula. My disappointment has been increased by two factors. The first is that <Col N="1441" /> this is yet another body blow to an area within County Donegal that has seen the loss, in the past year, of a significant number of jobs in Fruit of the Loom, Buncrana, the closure of Fruit of the Loom in Malin, Fingal Shirts in Moville, Jockey Underwear in Fahan, Glenveagh Mushrooms in Newtowncunningham and the list goes on. The second is that there has not been anything to replace these jobs which I have spoken about at various times in the past year.</P>
      <P>We are in an area of high unemployment before one even looks at the job losses in the past 12 months. I accept that the Donegal Task Force Initiative was set up and has reported to Government. I acknowledge the tremendous work put into this, particularly by its chairman, and the work of agencies such as FÁS in dealing with the aftermath of all these announcements. Yet for those people, here we are 12 months on and really at the same point as at last October &ndash; facing these losses without alternative jobs being announced.</P>
      <P>We are glad the long wait for information has been shorter on this occasion and that the Fruit of the Loom has given a projection of how things will progress over the coming months. We have to be optimistic that the redundancy packages will reflect the hard work and loyalty of all those involved. We would like to think, however, that having shed 190 jobs at this point the people remaining in employment will not only be secure in their employment but will have a job that reflects the high level output that these workers yield, so that they will not find themselves with a continually falling wage packet along with the associated blow to morale this brings.</P>
      <P>Despite all that is happening in terms of enterprise throughout the country, I am very disheartened at the results to date in my own county and particularly in Inishowen. When one hears of companies in the South importing workers by the hundred from Scotland while we have a labour force ready and waiting it leaves everyone asking the same questions &ndash; why are our factories not even receiving outsourced work? Why are we not getting small factories that would negate the need for a mass importation of labourers? Why are we continuing to hear of hundreds of new call centre jobs being created in the capital and large towns that are already lost for employees? Why are we not recognised as being near the large urban centre of Derry and its associated port? How many other locations could boast of being half an hour from a regional airport and port and being less than two hours from an international airport and port? Can Dublin say the same? How many investors have been taken into the region through the new London-Derry air service that the Tánaiste's work last year helped to achieve? How many other places could offer the loyal, hardworking labour force that we have on hand? Where else in Ireland do we find the words: &ldquo;We do not want our son or daughter to have to leave for America&rdquo; on the eve of the new millennium? This should be a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> I ask the Tánaiste and Minister of State to look at the immediate difficulties of the support for people to go back to third level education and for the support to go back to work. I ask them both to keep their focus and that of their agencies on us. I ask that the task force report is fully implemented.</P>
    <P>It is recognised by the development agencies that we need both air access to Dublin from Derry and a direct train service. These services cannot be put on the long finger any more. Throughout the country there are regional airports being supported to provide very necessary and valuable social and economic services which may not be very profitable. Similarly, there are rail networks throughout the country except for those of us in the real north. We in north Donegal do not accept that we should be dismissed as peripheral or inaccessable. That is too easy. Large industries like Fruit of the Loom have survived successfully for a number of years. We need aspects of our infrastructure to be given the same priority that all other counties have received down the years, if we are to become closer to Dublin, which is what State agencies based in Dublin seem to require. With the assistance of the Tánaiste and her cabinet colleagues I expect this will be resolved. We are not being greedy. We are asking for what has not reached us &ndash; a rail and air link to Dublin and fair decentralisation of the jobs being created as is the stated policy of the State agencies. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Inishowen Millenium Project will be good news on the jobs front and let us start the millennium now.</P>

      <P>Fruit of the Loom informed its workforce and the unions on 28 October last that the company would implement a number of measures to maintain its competitiveness in the marketplace. Whereas 65 per cent of employees in fabric and sewing operations have been engaged in short time working, the company plans a return to full time working for all employees over the next four weeks. Full time working will resume for all employees subject to phased start-up.</P>
      <P>These adjustment measures will result in the implementation of 190 redundancies in the fabric, sewing and services departments at Buncrana. The redundancies will take place in January 2000. The company has indicated that these measures were decided after continuous revision and assessment of employment levels against requirements for the year 2000. While I regret that these redundancies will take place, the company has explained that they are as a result of aligning its future capacity requirements with its future order book. It is envisaged that the redundancy terms will be as previously agreed, subject to negotiation and employee ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the business will continue to react to challenges in the marketplace, further job losses are not anticipated next year. The effect of these <Col N="1443" /> measures is that the company expects that approximately 1,000 jobs will be maintained at the Buncrana plant through next year. This is a significant improvement on the company's earlier expectations. The company is committed, moreover, to maintaining, at a minimum, an employment level of 600 jobs at the Buncrana plant until at least the year 2006. The IDA continues to actively market the vacant Fruit of the Loom premises in Donegal. In so far as the plant in Malin is concerned, Enterprise Ireland is currently in negotiation with a company in relation to locating a new business there. For reasons of client confidentiality, we are not in a position to give any further details at this stage. I hope projects will be found for all three plants.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Donegal Employment Initiative, the report which has been submitted to me presents a detailed analysis of the development challenge facing the county and recommends a seven year development strategy to implement the investment priorities identified. The timing of the presentation of the report enabled the investment programme which it recommended to be considered in the context of preparing the National Development Plan for the period 2000 to 2006. Sustainable economic and employment growth and the promotion of balanced regional development will be among the key objectives of the National Development Plan. It will also include measures to tackle Ireland's infrastructural deficit as a potential major constraint on competitiveness, economic progress and social development. The report of the Donegal Task Force makes a wide range of recommendations which are consistent with these objectives.</P>
    <P>On the recommendation of my colleague, the Tánaiste, the Government decided that all relevant Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities it proposes in drafting the operational programmes of the National Development Plan. The Tánaiste will meet the chairman and members of the task force shortly to discuss follow-up action on the report. The Government wants to bring the north-west on-line and into the new information society. There are a number of factors critical to the success of this plan: the extension of broadband connectivity, across and throughout the regions; creating the awareness, knowledge and skills necessary, to create and fully exploit the huge opportunities in e-commerce; creating a business and regulatory environment conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship, all essential ingredients in joining the information society. It has been recognised by the Government that Ireland's ability to move quickly to invest in and adapt broadband services would be one of the major influences on future competitiveness in the digital age. In November 1998 the Government authorised negotiations with prospective suppliers of global connectivity. Less than eight months later agreement had been reached with one such supplier, Global Crossing. This new <Col N="1444" /> state of the art telecommunications project will provide city to city broadband access to 24 cities and to the United States. It will involve the construction by the middle of next year of two telecommunications cables to the UK and the potential capacity of the cable will be 15 times the international capacity out of Ireland at the moment.</P>
    <P>In July of this year the Government announced, in conjunction with the international connectivity deal, an agreement of nine contracts for the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to more than 120 centres throughout the country. This includes the installation of a 95 km high capacity fibreoptic cable along the west coast of Donegal from Bunbeg to Donegal Town and from Dunfanaghy to Falcarragh, serving all communities along the route.</P>
    <P>The roll-out of broadband infrastructure to the regions will significantly enhance the attractiveness of these areas from the perspective of attracting quality industry. The improvement in telecommunications infrastructure throughout the country has the potential to create new and varied opportunities for many people across Ireland and especially in the northwest and Donegal in particular.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Tánaiste and I are in constant contact with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise board. We are doing everything we can to ensure that the three vacant factories in Donegal will have new investment sooner rather than later. We are very optimistic about the future and we are confident that we will be able to maintain and sustain the huge skills base which exists for the great people of the Inishowen peninsula who deserve every opportunity as we face the new millennium with confidence.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Great Southern Hotels Group.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity of raising this issue on the Adjournment. The reason I raise this issue is the uncertainty which prevails in relation to the future of the Great Southern Hotels Group. The Great Southern Hotels Group is one of the great anchor points of the Irish tourism and hotel industries. I need not delay the House in talking about its important contribution over several decades and into the modern period. When one looks at those who are in senior positions in other parts of the hotel industry one finds that the training they received, be it at any grade from management to the porter who welcomes the tourist at the door, is due to a commitment to training which is the great contribution of the Great Southern Hotels Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter because I believe it is nothing less than an ideological opposition which stands in the way of acceptance of a development plan for the group. I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister on this matter. If one is changing the existing arrangement and hiving off <Col N="1445" /> the Great Southern Hotels Group from Aer Rianta, one must ask what proportion of training is being carried by the private hotel sector in comparison to that being provided, for example, by the Great Southern Hotels Group. I suspect it is but a tiny percentage. Equally, one must take cognisance of the fact that to sell the group so as to maximise the capital yield for Aer Rianta is dismissive of the role the group plays in relation to the hotel industry and tourism sector. It is simply saying that the group, which was making a loss many years ago and which has been turned around and is now in profit, must be offered for sale so as to maximise the income of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The employees in the Great Southern Hotels Group were comprehensively insulted by a statement by a senior person in Aer Rianta not so long ago who suggested the State should not be involved in the business of making beds and serving food. The Great Southern Hotels Group is the major source of training. It is a flagship in the industry and there are models available that could have enabled the group to continue to make the contribution it has made and is making. For example, its existing revenues and accounts show that it has the capacity to borrow in its own right to provide for its future investment and expand the hotels and employment in them. Yet this is not being seriously considered as an option. At the moment it seems that in an atmosphere of uncertainty the only remaining issue is whether the group will be sold as a block or in bits and pieces.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Minister bears in mind that previous sales of component hotels within the Great Southern Hotels Group have been little less than scandalous. The price at which the hotels were sold has turned out to be a fraction of their value. When we look back we see that these hotels and their sites would have been invaluable assets for the hotel industry.</P>
    <P>One must ask why the group is being offered for sale. Why is the group being broken up? Who will provide training if the group is sold off? Who will provide the quality of service which the Great Southern Hotels Group has provided? Why is a straight &ldquo;No&rdquo; being given to the option that the group could, from its own resources, fund its investment needs into the future and expand and create quality employment?</P>
    <P>Another issue arises in relation to a matter which has been discussed among the staff in the different hotels and at the annual conference of the staff union, SIPTU. The SIPTU conference recently passed a motion asking for the hotels to be retained within public ownership.</P>
    <P>Accepting that it wants to shed the group, why can Aer Rianta not be compensated from, perhaps, the National Treasury Management Agency, thus enabling the group to get on with the business of planning its future?</P>

      <P>For all these reasons &ndash; the group's historic contribution, its importance to training, its ability to provide a self-development model, the views of its workers, the contribution of its staff and its value, particularly in terms of its training contribution into the future &ndash; I plead with the Minister to ask his colleague to make sure that the option of a self-development model is made available to the Great Southern Hotels Group, which can be done by keeping it in public ownership, and that any ideological opposition to this is set aside in the best interests of Ireland and the workers in the Great Southern Hotels Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this important issue. As the House is aware, the board of Aer Rianta submitted a report to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in April this year on the future strategic direction of the company. In that report, the board considered that the Great Southern Hotels Group is not a core activity in the context of its airport management operations and recommended exit from this non-core asset after full consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</P>
      <P>The board of Aer Rianta has retained Arthur Andersen consultants to examine all the options for the future of the Great Southern Hotels Group. They have also appointed Mr. Phil Flynn to act as facilitator with the trade unions as part of the process. This examination, which involves extensive consultations with all the stakeholders, including the management, staff and trade unions, is expected to be completed shortly. The Minister will be examining recommendations very closely before a final decision is made.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise fully recognises and acknowledges the high standing and reputation of the Great Southern Hotels Group and her main consideration is that she wants to find the right future for the group in a way that will also be right for the staff in terms of their employment and other rights, as well as for the Irish tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months the Minister has met and consulted with the staff of all the Great Southern Hotels and advised them that these would be her main considerations in any future decision affecting the hotel group. In the meantime, development of the hotel chain is ongoing and the group is operating successfully. A £10 million extension to the hotel at Dublin Airport is currently under way. This will provide 85 additional bedrooms together with lounge, restaurant, leisure facilities and meeting rooms. Planning permission has also been obtained by the group for a new 81 bedroom hotel at Cork Airport, at an estimated cost of £8.5 million with construction start-up planned before the end of this year. Ongoing investment in the other hotels in the group will total £2.5 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister believes it is right and proper at this time to review the future strategic direction <Col N="1447" /> of the Great Southern Hotels Group, just as it is right and proper to review the future strategic direction of its parent company, Aer Rianta. Long-term strategic planning, which is what this process is all about, is best done when times are good rather than at times of crisis. Planning and decision making under pressure is not to be recommended and should be avoided if at all possible as it runs the risk of failing to take the best long-term strategic interests of the various stakeholders sufficiently into consideration.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance have jointly appointed Warburg Dillon Read-AIB to advise and assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's proposals for its future strategic development. The advisers will also address as part of this work the principle of Aer Rianta's proposal to exit from the hotels activity. Only when the Minister has received their advice and the views of the board of Aer Rianta following the completion of its internal consultation process will she be in a position to report to Government with her recommendations in regard to the Great Southern Hotels Group.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise is confident that any decisions that will be arrived at by Government. when she has put her recommendations to it, will lead to a full and promising future for the hotels of the Great Southern Hotels Group and for its staff, and that it will contribute to the further enhancement of the hotel and tourist sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the foregoing, far from failing to devise a development strategy for the Great Southern Hotels Group, the Minister has on the contrary been actively working on such a strategy in full consultation with all the stakeholders and with a view to securing a vibrant future for the hotels in the years ahead.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The armed raid on the Dublin Airport branch of Bank of Ireland last Friday, 29 October, was not a hit or miss affair. It was a well planned, professional operation carried out with meticulous timing and precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> It began at 5.42 a.m. and was completed at 5.44 a.m. It took a total of 2 minutes 40 seconds, according to the Aer Rianta security footage. Two or possibly three balaclava clad raiders rammed their BMW into the window of the bank while another raider waited outside the bank in a black Toyota sports car stolen from East Wall on 18 October. At least two weapons, a sawn-off shotgun and a hand gun, were used. Approximately £100,000 was taken and the raiders are still at large. This is an extremely serious matter. Irrespective of how the Minister might like to bandy statistics about things getting better or statistics improving, his zero tolerance policy is not working. The Garda statistics, the official statistics, speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>According to the Garda annual report, there were 61 armed robberies in 1998. That is a very large number. We are talking about situations where raiders used lethal firearms on 61 occasions to execute their robberies. Of the 61 armed robberies, only 22 cases were brought before the courts or are currently the subject of proceedings. That is equally worrying.</P>
    <P>This year there has been, what can only be described as, a huge upsurge in armed robberies. Figures for the period up to June this year show there were 92 aggravated burglaries involving the use of firearms and there were 391 aggravated burglaries involving the use of other weapons. It is comforting to read on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent </i>on Monday, 2 August &ldquo;Worried Garda Blitz on Gun Gangs&rdquo;. It was reported that Garda chiefs have ordered special units to target known criminal gangs responsible for a big upsurge in armed robberies. It was also reported that the Garda confirm they are extremely worried that armed robberies have more than doubled in the 12 month period.</P>
    <P>We recall the major paramilitary style raid on a security van in Dalkey last January that netted more than £1 million, which was thwarted only when the get away car broke down, yet those raiders are still at large. Almost immediately afterwards there was a major bank raid in Waterford and those raiders are still at large. Instead of matters improving, they have got worse and the figures testify to that.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Dublin Airport raid, what is particularly worrying is that it was carried out with such ease and facility. Anybody who visits Dublin Airport is struck by what appears to be a heavy security presence. Whenever I visited the airport there was a security guard at the entrance to where motorists drive up the ramp to the Departures level. There is a highly visible presence of security guards as one gets out the driver's side of one's car in set down area for passengers, yet the two raiders were able to drive past security, smash their way into the bank and made a clean get away. Why was the security presence at the airport unable to do anything about this or to prevent what occurred? Surely the purpose of a security presence is to cater for such an eventu<Col N="1451" /> ality. What has happened in the meantime to prevent a recurrence of this? </P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that senior gardaí admitted the Garda has advance intelligence suggesting a number of Dublin criminal gangs were planning armed raids and that memos to this effect were circulated to Garda officers. The Garda assert they did not have specific advance information about the Dublin Airport raid. One must ask why that information was not acted upon and security on banks tightened. Surely the armed presence of paramilitaries visible on an increasing basis should have merited more of a security initiative? </P>
    <P>The Minister must order a security review of banks and all financial institutions, and it must happen on a two-fold basis. First, the banks must tighten their security. They are multimillion pound profit organisations, dependent on security as a key element. They must put their houses in order. Second, the Garda must do what they promised they would on 2 August &ndash; they must mount a massive blitz on what, by any standard, is a growing cause of considerable anxiety from the point of view of public safety. We need a major clampdown on violent crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will appreciate, the question of responsibility for security of aviation facilities is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise. In those circumstances I will confine my comments to the House to the question of the armed raid to which Deputy Higgins referred and not to airport security in general.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that at approximately 5.30 a.m. on 29 October the Bank of Ireland branch at Dublin Airport opened for business with a staff of three present. At 5.45 a.m. approximately, a vehicle reversed through the window of the bank and a number of raiders entered the premises. A quantity of cash made up in various currencies was taken and the raiders fled the scene in a second vehicle. One vehicle was left at the scene and the second one was recovered at 9 a.m. approximately at the Naul, County Dublin in a burnt out condition. Information to date suggests four raiders were involved in the robbery, some of whom were armed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to say, an extensive investigation &ndash; including forensic and technical examination of the scene and vehicles &ndash; under the direction of the chief superintendent in Santry is ongoing. <Col N="1452" /> Thankfully, no one was injured in this incident and I am sure all Members will join me in condemning criminal acts such as these.</P>
    <P>While this crime was a bank robbery, that it took place in Dublin Airport raises other issues of concern. I understand my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, will soon convene a meeting of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee to discuss what lessons, if any, may emerge for improving security arrangements at Dublin Airport. As the House may be aware, membership of the committee includes the Departments of Public Enterprise, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence as well as the Garda Síochána and Aer Rianta. I understand the committee will be very much guided by the Garda as to the timing and substance of these discussions.</P>
    <P>While it would not be appropriate for me to go into the detail of the type of protection afforded by the Garda, I assure the House that the Garda liaise closely with the companies involved in the transit and storage of cash on an ongoing basis to ensure the best possible security arrangements.</P>
    <P>With regard to crime trends in general, armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries have shown a strong and sustained decrease in recent years. The latest figures published show that Garda statistics for these offences indicate that in 1998 there were 68 per cent fewer armed crimes reported than in 1994&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 61, 80, 81 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Since I last described the situation in East Timor to the House on 29 September there have been a number of important developments. In this regard, I welcome in particular the completion of the Indonesian military withdrawal from East Timor over the weekend.</P>
      <P>On 4 October, I met the East Timorese leaders, Mr. Xanana Gusmao and Mr. Ramos Horta in Dublin when they expressed their appreciation for the support that Ireland had already given. They briefed the Taoiseach and myself on the challenges facing the people of East Timor, and sought Ireland's continuing support. I assured them of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall situation in East Timor is still a cause for great concern because of the humanitarian catastrophe and the wholesale and wanton destruction there. Nonetheless, considerable progress has been achieved, largely due to the pressure which the international community has maintained on the Indonesian authorities, and to the work of the INTERFET in restoring security and <Col N="1454" /> of the international humanitarian agencies in providing emergency assistance.</P>
    <P>The multinational force &ndash; INTERFET &ndash; has continued to expand its deployment in East Timor, and with more than 8,000 troops now deployed has almost reached its full strength. The Irish contingent has been deployed in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Although INTERFET has improved security in many areas, this is not the case throughout East Timor. There have been a number of attacks on INTERFET by the pro-Indonesian militias, particularly in those areas bordering West Timor. I condemn these attacks and call on the Indonesian authorities to co-operate fully in bringing them to an end.</P>
    <P>Improved security conditions have made it possible for a number of internally displaced persons to return home. However, many are still unable to do so. In addition to the internally displaced persons, a further cause of concern is the situation of refugees and deportees in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities are now granting access by the international agencies to the camps in West Timor. A programme of voluntary return, by air and sea, has also started. Bearing in mind that the overall number involved could be between 150,000 and 200,000, further transport and secure land routes have to be made available. The full implementation of this programme could last for several weeks, even in satisfactory conditions. Careful international monitoring will be required.</P>
    <P>Improved security conditions have also allowed the humanitarian relief agencies to expand their delivery of aid. This aid includes seeds which have to be sown before the start of the rainy season, which is due in the middle of November, if large parts of the population are to be minimally self-sufficient in terms of food next year. Shelter must be provided as a matter of urgency, and the essential infrastructure rebuilt. Parallel with this is the need to provide urgent medical and other services to save the highly vulnerable population and to prevent the spread of contagious disease.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware the Government has approved a grant package of £1 million pounds to help meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the Timorese people. I want to reiterate the Government's commitment to support the people of East Timor in their efforts to rebuild their lives and communities and, over the coming months and years, to make the transition to independence.</P>
    <P>An assessment team from the Department of Foreign Affairs will visit the region in the next few days with a view to making recommendations for further support and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, intends to visit shortly.</P>
    <P>A further urgent priority is the investigation of violations of human rights and crimes against humanity, as demanded by Security Council Resolution 1264. The House will be aware that the Special Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, chaired by Ireland from 23 to 27 September, adopted a resolution calling for the <Col N="1455" /> establishment of a Commission of Inquiry. At the request of the UN Secretary General, the UN High Commissioner has just appointed the members of the Commission of Inquiry. This commission is starting work immediately so that it can report to the Secretary General by the end of December. Information for use by the Commission of Inquiry is being compiled by a number of parties, including the UN civilian mission in East Timor &ndash; UNAMET. INTERFET is also assisting in this task, by identifying and helping to preserve sites of reported atrocities.</P>
    <P>I discussed the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations at length with Mr. Gusmao and Mr. Horta in Dublin. I informed them of consultations which we were conducting in respect of the Genocide Convention and sought their views on how best the international community might now proceed. They stressed the immediate need to follow up the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry with firm action to ensure that the perpetrators of crimes against humanity be brought to justice on the basis of existing UN decisions. This of course does not preclude further consideration of the Genocide Convention at a later stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the next steps towards independence, the Indonesian Parliament ratified, on 20 October, the result of the 30 August referendum. I welcome this decision, which has enabled Phase 3 of the 5 May Agreement process to commence.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General submitted a report on 4 October to the Security Council setting out his detailed plans for Phase 3. These envisage the establishment of a UN interim administration &ndash; to be known as UNTAET, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor &ndash; which will have a comprehensive mandate to restore the functioning of the country, to establish a legal and security system and to prepare the people of East Timor to assume these functions and responsibilities themselves. Discussions are now taking place at the UN on the organisation of the international contribution to this task. It will be substantial and at least of two to three years' duration. Considerable resources will be needed. The UNAMET mission will provide the core of the larger and longer-term UNTAET mission. INTERFET will be replaced by a further UN military peacekeeping force. Security will also be provided by an armed police component. The Security Council adopted Resolution 1272 on 25 October which now provides the legal basis for the implementation of the Phase 3 plans.</P>
    <P>As regards the recognition of East Timor, the EU announced on 13 September that its member states looked forward to recognising East Timor as soon as the process towards independence had been completed. The Government hopes that the installation of the UN interim administration will now proceed smoothly and that its work will pave the way for recognition of East Timor as an independent state at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the &ldquo;Western Europe and Others&rdquo; group of states for the two-year term 2001-2002. The election will take place in the 188-member UN General Assembly in October 2000. The election is being contested by three other candidates: Norway, Turkey and Italy. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 125 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. Since September last, I have personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with the Foreign Ministers or Prime Ministers of approximately 100 member states of the United Nations. Recently, I attended the 54th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York where, in addition to participating in the general debate, I had bilateral contact with Foreign Ministers or Prime Ministers from around 60 UN member states. These contacts were productive, both in terms of promoting our Security Council candidacy among the broad UN membership, and in terms of discussing important issues of bilateral and international concern.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government, as well as a number of Ministers of State, have also promoted the Irish candidacy in their contacts with other administrations, where this was appropriate.</P>
      <P>In September last, before the campaign entered a more intense phase, we had around 30 commitments. This level of support has been built on and the Government is determined that by October 2000 when the election takes place we will have the necessary number of votes to secure election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated previously, this is a contested election. I am reluctant, therefore, to indicate the precise details of the contacts that I and my colleagues in Government have had with other Governments relating to Ireland's candi<Col N="1457" /> dacy as well as the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. The Government is gratified by the broad support our candidacy has attracted.</P>

      <P>The Government has conveyed its views about the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities under OAU mediation directly to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities, and I again raised our concerns about the situation at meetings in September at the United Nations. With our EU partners, we have urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to end all hostilities, proceed to the signature of a ceasefire agreement, subscribe immediately to the modalities, and fully implement the OAU framework agreement.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support all international efforts, notably those of the OAU and UN, to pursue vigorously the peace process and to achieve a comprehensive settlement to this futile conflict, the political and economic costs of which neither country can afford.

      <P>No representations about this matter were made to me or to the Department of Foreign Affairs and we were unaware of it until the Deputy asked this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10 September 1999 two members of a three-man TG4 television crew going to film a documentary programme were told by an immigration officer on arrival at the airport in St. John's that they were required to have employment authorisation and to pay $150 each. When <Col N="1458" /> the reasons for this were explained to the two people concerned they paid the fees and authorisation was granted but they were delayed two hours.</P>
    <P>The Opposition spokesperson on tourism and culture in Newfoundland subsequently expressed disapproval of this decision, maintained that the crew fulfilled conditions for exemption from &ldquo;employment validation&rdquo; and called on the Canadian and Newfoundland governments to apologise to the television crew.</P>
    <P>I have requested the embassy in Ottawa to ask the authorities there whether the immigration officer was justified in requiring two members of the crew to have employment authorisation or validation and to pay fees of $150, whether they should have been exempted or whether the immigration officer had authority to exercise discretion in the matter. As soon as there is a response from the Canadian authorities I will contact the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has long operated a system whereby a diplomatic duty officer is on call outside of normal office hours each day to deal with urgent matters, including the issuing of passports of restricted validity in cases of genuine emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since June 1999 there is an additional specific passport duty officer service at Iveagh House in Dublin on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Sundays and public holidays, except on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. This new service is intended to facilitate persons travelling at weekends or on public holidays who have either mislaid their passports or who find at the last moment that they are out of date and who are willing to pay the extra £50 fee that is charged. Persons in genuine emergency situations availing of this service are not charged that fee. The Department's diplomatic duty officer continues to attend to applications for passports after office hours outside of these <Col N="1459" /> hours, but only in situations of genuine emergency.</P>
    <P>I wrote to all Members of the Oireachtas on 25 June 1999 notifying them of the new arrangements. The Irish Travel Agents Association and the Garda Síochána were also informed about the new service.</P>
    <P>The Passport Office in Cork, which caters for persons living in Munster and deals with about 26 per cent of passport applications from within the State, has a permanent staff of 22 but up to 30 additional temporary officers are employed at busy periods. The number of passports issued by that office in the year 31 October 1999 was 89,570.</P>
    <P>I am disposed to having a separate duty officer after-hours service at the Cork Passport Office if it can be provided without compromising the security of staff or of the premises. That will require careful consideration and I have asked the Department for proposals.</P>

Ón bhliain 1987, maraíodh níos mó ná 2 mhilliún leanbh i gcogaí éagsúla, agus gortaíodh go géar 6 mhilliún diobh.

Ach d'ainneoin sin, deireann alt 38 an chonartha gurb é 15 an aois is ísle le dul ag troid. Tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh tacaíocht a thabairt don <i>Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights</i><Col N="1460" /> le dréachtchonradh roghnach a chur ar bun a ardóidh an aois sin.</P>
    <P>I rith an 55ú séisiún den <i>UN Commission on Human Rights,</i> glacadh mar comhaontú le rún ar leanaí i gcoimhlint. Thug an tír seo tacaíocht buan don rún sin.

Chuir an rún chuile bhall den UN faoi ghealltanas scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an dochar a dhéantar do leanaí a bhíonn ag troid.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's views on the proposed cancellation of Third World debt as sought by the Jubilee 2000 campaign.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The burden of debt on developing countries, especially the poorest, is a serious challenge to the international community. The levels of debt repayment required of many heavily indebted poor countries far exceed flows of development assistance. It is not acceptable that the efforts of many of the most impoverished countries to achieve sustainable development are so constrained by the debt overhang.</P>
      <P>I have taken a close interest in the issue of the debt burden in the developing world and I am aware of the very high level of public support for the Jubilee 2000 campaign for debt cancellation. For this reason, the debt issue was a particular focus in my address to the United Nations General Assembly last month, in which I stated: </P>
      <P>We recognise the strength of international concern about the debt of poor countries including the urgent demands for debt forgiveness. The Irish Government decided last year to direct resources to both bilateral and multilateral debt relief, and also to make it integral to Ireland's overall development co-operation strategy.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that real action be taken to deal with the debt problem in the shortest possible term. The HIPC debt initiative launched by the World Bank and IMF in 1996, while well-intentioned, failed to make much impact in the vast majority of the heavily indebted poor countries. Recent months have brought encouraging progress on the debt front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AGM of the World Bank and IMF in Washington in September witnessed agreement on an enhanced HIPC initiative which is expected to double the amount of debt relief available under the initiative and increase the number of <Col N="1461" /> eligible countries from 29 to 36. The enhanced HIPC is another step in the process which must provide a permanent exit from the debt burden. It will be essential to ensure that the enhanced HIPC receives the finance it requires as soon as possible. Ireland strongly supports the most generous possible EU support for the enhanced HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the strengthening of the link between debt relief and poverty alleviation in the new framework, which was one of the key issues raised in our own national submission to the HIPC review. As part of the new initiative, each recipient country will draw up a poverty reduction strategy paper, designed to ensure that the resources freed by debt relief will directly benefit those in the greatest need.</P>
    <P>Full and absolute debt cancellation poses difficult and complex questions of both finance and policy. Many heavily indebted poor countries have made strenuous efforts to reform their economies to qualify for debt relief. Under the enhanced HIPC the debt of these countries should fall to levels which are sustainable and which do not drain resources from key social sectors such as health and education. This will be of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>The creditor governments who will be called on to pay very substantial amounts in support of debt relief want to ensure that the money is used to alleviate poverty. Issues such as internal conflict, corruption and human rights abuses are also relevant in assessing debt alleviation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries. We strongly welcome measures, whether through debt relief or debt cancellation, which help relieve the burden. On a national level we have agreed to contribute funds of over £31 million to help ease the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries. Bilaterally we have already contributed £9.5 million to debt relief in Tanzania and Mozambique, two priority countries of Irish aid. We are also contributing £22 million through the World Bank and the IMF to the financing of the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government has also adopted a number of guiding principles on developing country debt. In addition to supporting reform of the HIPC initiative, the Government agreed to encourage the international community, including bilateral creditors, to take a generous and flexible approach to the heavily indebted poor countries. Both the Minister for Finance and I in our discussions in the EU and at the World Bank fully endorse this principle. Together with other like minded countries we continue to press for greater efforts to be made, by whatever means, to resolve once and for all this challenge to development.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this month, the UN's finance and budgetary committee was informed that arrears due to the UN currently totalled $2,510 million, including $1,831 million for peacekeeping. Ireland is owed approximately £9.5 million for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. Since 1 January 1999, the UN has repaid arrears of approximately £3 million owed to Ireland, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. The Department, through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations Headquarters for the recovery of the moneys paid out, generally by the Department of Defence. During the visit in January to Ireland by the UN Secretary General, I raised the issue of UN arrears in respect of our participation in UN peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day-to-day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
      <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears situation would ease the situation considerably. Discussions are currently under way between the US administration and congressional leaders on redressing this situation and we are hopeful that progress can be made during the current session of Congress. During my recent visit to the General Assembly, I joined my EU colleagues in raising the matter with Secretary of State Albright.</P>
      <P>We hope that efforts to resolve the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries. Ireland's permanent mission to the UN in New York will pursue actively this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, by decision of 28 September 1999, approved the establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. It is the intention that the ambassador to Mexico will also be accredited to Cuba; the Cuban Ambassador to London will be accredited to Dublin. The Cuban Foreign Minister, Felipe Perez Roque, was in Dublin on Wednesday, 27 October to mark the establishment of relations between our two countries. These formal ties will enable us to deepen the friendly relations which already exist between us. It will also provide an important impetus for the further development of economic, social and cultural links.</P>
      <P>While here, Minister Perez Roque met the Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee for an exchange of views. He also met the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid. He also discussed economic questions in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government on the US embargo against Cuba remains that set out in my reply of 29 September to Question No. 118 &ndash; we wish to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners, all of whom share the same position, and we have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo, most recently at the General Assembly last year.</P>
      <P>The US Administration and its diplomatic representatives have been made fully aware of our position.</P>
      <P>There has been some progress. On 4 August the US Senate &ndash; partly prompted by pressure from agribusiness interests &ndash; voted by 70 to 28 in favour of exempting food and medicine from the embargo, but the proposal did not prosper in the House of Representatives. Earlier this year restrictions were eased on the delivery of food and medicine to non-governmental organisations, though this was not welcomed by the Cuban authorities as it was seen as circumventing state control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the EU Common Position on Cuba, adopted in December 1996, our aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from <Col N="1464" /> there. But the Common Position also makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country.</P>
    <P>After the Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 there had been a certain easing of repressive measures against political dissidents and a reduction in the number of political prisoners. However, subsequently the situation deteriorated again. In January 1999 the criminal law was amended to introduce new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing dissidence.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, four members of the Internal Dissidence Group were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In a statement issued on 17 March, the EU expressed its deep regret at the sentences passed. It pointed out that the people convicted had exercised a freedom of expression which is recognised universally as a human right and that the EU could not accept that citizens exercising such a right should be criminalised by State authorities. The EU also rejected judicial proceedings of a political nature and expressed deep concern about the amendments to the criminal law further curtailing the exercise of the rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the EU reiterated its continuing objective of encouraging a peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the Common Position.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights, including at this year's session. With all of our EU partners, we once again called on Cuba to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>

      <P>Although the situation in Algeria remains difficult, there are some more positive signs that it is starting to emerge from the years of violence and beginning to make progress towards national reconciliation and reconstruction.</P>
      <P>On 6 June, the Islamic Salvation Army, the AIS, confirmed that its campaign of violence had ended. The Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, which is still outlawed, endorsed the announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Bouteflika introduced legislation to grant an amnesty to the AIS militants and their supporters who renounce violence, which the National Assembly has enacted. On 5 July, the 37th anniversary of Algerian independence, the first stage of the amnesty, which is expected to lead to the release of 5,000 detainees, was put into effect. On 16 September, an overwhelming <Col N="1465" /> majority approved the referendum on the President's proposals which are aimed at achieving peace and civil concord. These are positive steps which I earnestly hope will soon bring an end to the suffering which has been inflicted upon the Algerian people for most of this decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply, I propose to address economic developments in the region first, before turning to human rights developments in Asia.</P>
      <P>The economic upheaval in a number of Asian economies in 1997 and 1998, coming on top of other adverse developments, such as the Russian and Brazilian economic crises, had a ripple effect worldwide.</P>
      <P>World output growth in 1998, at just over 2 per cent, was only half what it was before the economic crisis in Asia broke and is expected to rebound only moderately in 1999. The crises in Asia and elsewhere have underscored the vulnerability of economies with policy shortcomings to abrupt shifts in capital flows and unmasked weaknesses in policies and institutions in the affected economies. However, economic analysts are now less concerned at the possibility of a wider downturn being triggered by the ongoing difficulties in Asia, Russia and in South America. In recent months the turmoil in financial markets has subsided and global macroeconomic conditions have improved following a period of great uncertainty in the second half of 1998.</P>
      <P>There has recently been a marked improvement in financial market conditions and most of the affected economies in Asia have begun to recover. In south east Asia, where the first crises occurred, the countries most directly affected &ndash; the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand &ndash; are all showing signs of recovery. But despite the signs of progress, many challenges remain. Continuing recovery will depend on sound policies at national level and also on a healthy global economic environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> In an update of the Asian development bank's outlook for 1999, which was issued in September, the bank raised its growth forecasts for most countries in the region. In the case of the newly industrialised economies of Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, it now suggests that the growth rate for 1999 will be 5.2 per cent. The report pointed to the rise in industrial production and exports in most of the crisis-affected economies and the fact that in many cases capital outflows have reversed. It added that while risks to the recovery outlook for Asia were lower than at this time last year they had not disappeared; it pointed also to the debt and structural problems still facing a number of countries in the region.</P>
    <P>Where co-operation between the European Union and the countries of Asia is concerned, ASEM, or the Asia-Europe Meeting, provides a framework for economic, political, social and cultural exchanges and contacts. ASEM comprises the 15 EU states and members of the ASEAN group, as well as Japan, China and the Republic of Korea. The first ASEM summit was held in Bangkok on 1-2 March 1996 and the second summit &ndash; ASEM II &ndash; took place in London on 2-4 April 1998. The third summit meeting will be held in Seoul, Republic of Korea next year, while the fourth is scheduled to take place in Denmark in 2002.</P>
    <P>The second ASEM economic Ministers' meeting took place in Berlin on 9 and 10 October 1999. Ireland was represented at this meeting by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt. The Ministers had a very useful exchange of views on matters of mutual interest. I am arranging to place in the Oireachtas library a copy of the statement issued following that meeting, in which the Ministers participating noted the increasingly positive signals indicating that the recent economic and financial crisis had been overcome.</P>
    <P>Despite the recent economic turmoil the economies of east and south east Asia are likely to remain major engines of world output and economic growth over the next half century. Ireland will not ignore the foreign earnings opportunities in the region. The Deputy may be aware that the Government recently adopted a strategy for the development of foreign earnings in Asia with the objective of increasing trade and investment levels and raising awareness of Ireland in the region as an investment location and source of high quality goods and services.</P>
    <P>Turning to the other element of this question, it is our belief that human rights have a direct impact on, and close relationship with, issues of peace, security and, indeed, economic development and prosperity. Therefore, when examining both the economic developments in a particular region and the potential for deepening our economic contacts there, it is important that we do not lose sight of human rights issues as well.</P>
    <P>In addressing current human rights developments in the Asian region, it is appropriate to note both positive and negative aspects. <Col N="1467" /> Undoubtedly, the horrific events of the past few months in East Timor must rank among the most grave human rights situations in the world today. Likewise, events in Afghanistan, Burma-Myanmar and China, among other countries in the region, also give cause for serious concern. Efforts are being made, however, to engage in a dialogue on human rights questions with certain Asian countries in a number of different fora. For example, an informal seminar on human rights was held in Beijing in June under the auspices of ASEM which brought together official, academic and NGO representatives from the ASEM countries. We strongly encourage and support such endeavours.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken in some detail today about current developments in East Timor and I would not propose to do so again. I would like, however, to welcome the recent appointment of members to the International Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate human rights violations which have taken place in the territory. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, announced these appointments on 15 October last and the Commission is due to report to the UN Secretary General by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I have also addressed the human rights situation in China on a number of occasions in the House, most recently on 29 September last. Since then, a formal round of the EU-China human rights dialogue took place in Beijing on 19 October. Among the issues addressed were the death penalty, administrative detention, and co-operation with UN mechanisms. A list of individual cases of concern was also handed over by the Presidency to the Chinese authorities prior to the meeting itself. The EU Presidency sought to focus on these particular issues and to press for concrete results. We are awaiting a report on this round of the dialogue.</P>
    <P>Together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland continues to monitor a number of worrying human rights situations in Asia. We have raised our concerns about these situations at the UN and other appropriate fora and we will do so again at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, currently meeting in New York.</P>
    <P>Through such combined efforts, through dialogue and through concerted action at the multilateral level, we will continue to work for positive developments in the field of human rights in Asia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Ireland this week assumes the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I am glad to have the <Col N="1468" /> opportunity to address the Deputy's question on the future of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>The fundamental aim of the Council of Europe is to establish peace and prosperity, through reconciliation and co-operation between states, on the basis of shared fundamental values and common principles. This remains as valid today as it was when the organisation was established in the aftermath of World War II. Its principal objectives today are to protect and promote human rights; to develop democratic stability throughout Europe; to ensure observance of the rule of law; and to promote tolerance and social cohesion. To achieve these objectives the council works through both intergovernmental co-operation and parliamentary action.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe remains the key institution enshrining human rights standards in international law. The European Court of Human Rights, which has ultimate judicial authority, has established universal standards throughout Europe. The European Convention on Human Rights and related judicial instruments strengthen and secure democracy and the rule of law. They constitute the foundation for the development of a democratic Europe in which the rights and fundamental freedoms of all citizens can be upheld.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has played a major role in the development of Ireland's national understanding of human rights. In our view, what has and will continue to make the Council of Europe special and to mark it out from other international organisations is its concern for values &ndash; at the centre of which is concern for the individual human being. Ireland will continue to work to ensure that the council remains the essential standard-setting reference point for the protection of human rights in greater Europe. The organisation is unique in that it not only monitors compliance by member states with its standards but provides practical assistance to ensure that they can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Since 1989 the council has evolved into an important pan-European political forum which, given adequate political will by its member states, has the potential of bringing together, on an equal footing, all the countries of greater Europe. Its rapid enlargement to 41 states has played a major role in the reconstruction of Europe based on democratic institutions and human rights. The council is well placed to serve as a forum to complement the enlargement processes of other organisations, notably that of the EU itself. Its parliamentary assembly is playing a key role in bringing new member states into the fold of European democracies and monitoring their compliance with their commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changing role of the Council of Europe inevitably poses considerable challenges and problems. Foremost among these is the need to maintain the validity of its basic principles through respect by all its enlarged membership with their obligations; second, the need to develop coherence and complementarity between the council's aims and activities and those of <Col N="1469" /> other organisations, particularly the OSCE and the EU; third, the need to prioritise the functioning of the organisation and cover the gap between its tasks and the resources which member states are willing to provide.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches importance to the council's continuing role in finding common solutions for many shared problems covering a broad range of issues that affect the daily lives of our citizens. These issues include public health; children's rights; drug abuse; racism and intolerance; protecting minorities and legal co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Government agrees with the priorities for the future work of the Council of Europe as outlined recently by the new Secretary General. These are to ensure compliance with obligations; to foster assistance and dialogue; and to develop the council's operational presence in the areas of greatest need. I held detailed discussions with the Secretary-General when he visited Dublin last week, outlining to him the Irish Presidency programme that I will present to the Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg this week. We agreed a joint approach to the immediate issues on the council's agenda. The Government looks forward to co-operating closely with the Secretary General in working towards our shared objectives during Ireland's Presidency of the Committee of Ministers.</P>

      <P>The circumstances surrounding the deaths of the six individuals whose deaths in 1982 were the subject of the Stalker-Sampson inquiry have been a matter of deep concern to the Government. Six unarmed men were shot dead and one seriously injured by members of the RUC in three separate shooting incidents in Co. Armagh in the period November-December 1982. The circumstances surrounding the shootings led to allegations that the police were operating a shoot-to-kill policy. The decision not to prosecute anyone as a result of the Stalker-Sampson inquiry was the subject of a special Anglo-Irish conference in 1988, and the issue has been raised on many occasions through the framework of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of Mr. Stalker has never been made public, although the Government has repeatedly called for its publication. The Government considers that the investigation of such cases should <Col N="1470" /> be fully transparent and open. This equally applies in the case of Rosemary Nelson. The Government is remaining closely in contact with interested parties about the Nelson case and the conduct of the investigation into her heinous murder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the delays in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement which was signed in Lusaka on 10 July by the governments of the six countries involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo &ndash; Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The MLC &ndash; Movement for the Liberation of Congo &ndash; signed the ceasefire agreement on 1 August while a dispute within the RCD &ndash; Congolese Rally for Democracy &ndash; delayed its signature until 31 August.</P>
      <P>I regret to report that the essential requirements for implementation of the agreement have not been fulfilled. For example, the selection of the representatives for the Joint Military Commission has not been completed and the facilitator for the national dialogue has not been agreed upon by all the parties. With our EU partners we have urged all parties to fully abide by the contents and timetable of the agreement and we continue to encourage the UN and the OAU to make all necessary efforts to support the implementation of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with its EU partners, considers the Lusaka agreement crucial for the restoration of peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the entire Central African region. We have pledged our support to its implementations; to national reconciliation, rehabilitation and democratisation in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and to the process of reintegration of displaced people in the Great Lakes region into their countries of origin. The Government will, with its EU partners, be offering practical support to the implementation of the agreement through EU joint action. We have also underlined our readiness to support the UN and the OAU in the implementation of the peace agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will, of course, continue to support the work of the EU Special Envoy to the Great <Col N="1471" /> Lakes Region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who is actively pursuing the Union's objectives through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures. The EU continues to support the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region as a means of ensuring lasting stability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the situation in Chechnya. On 7 August Islamic militants, supported by armed incursions from Chechnya, proclaimed the independence of Dagestan, a multi-ethnic autonomous republic in Russia's north Caucasus region. The rebels failed to get local support in Dagestan, and were forced to withdraw to Chechnya. A number of apartment block bomb blasts in Moscow and other Russian cities in September, which claimed almost 300 lives, were blamed by Russia on Chechnya-based guerrillas. Russian Prime Minister Putin took a firm line, which has widespread Russian public support. Russia has been bombing alleged rebel bases in Chechnya since 5 September. It has occupied a &ldquo;security zone&rdquo; covering the northern third of Chechnya, and has recently crossed the Terek river and encircled the Chechen capital, Grozny. Russia has also withdrawn its recognition of Chechen President Maskhadov, and has moved to set up a pro-Moscow government-in-exile in the northern third of Chechnya which its forces control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September, more than 350,000 people have fled their homes in Chechnya. Of these, 175,000 have moved to seek security and shelter in Ingushetia. According to reliable UN sources, <Col N="1472" /> almost a similar number of displaced people remain trapped in Chechnya. While there seems to be no immediate danger of widespread starvation, malnutrition is a real and present threat to children and others who are especially vulnerable. Insanitary conditions in the IDP camps may lead to outbreaks of epidemics. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has sent convoys of food supplies, tents and blankets to the area. The European Union has agreed to channel significant amounts of aid to the region through the international aid agencies such as the UNHCR. However, the aid agencies continue to meet with obstacles and delays on the ground. Within Chechnya there are reports of continuing civilian casualties due to Russian air and artillery attacks, including a report of a Russian attack on a market and a maternity hospital and of attacks on refugee convoys. Russia has claimed that the market was trading in arms and that the convoys were transporting Chechen rebels.</P>
    <P>On 30 October the Finnish Foreign Minister, Ms Tarja Halonen, representing the Presidency of the European Union, visited Ingushetia on a fact-finding humanitarian mission. The mission was undertaken after consultations with Mr Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations. In Ingushetia, Foreign Minister Halonen met with President Ruslan Aushev and visited the refugee camps Sputnik and Severnyi Gorodok in eastern Ingushetia. In her discussions with Russian federal and local authorities, Foreign Minister Halonen emphasised that those seeking to leave the conflict zone should be allowed to do so and the road to Ingushetia should be opened forthwith. She deplored recent accounts of displaced persons being harassed and attacked as they have attempted to flee the conflict. She stressed the urgent need for a concerted national and international aid effort to alleviate the crisis and pointed out that victims of internal armed conflicts have the right to receive humanitarian assistance. The Russian government has repeatedly expressed its readiness to accept humanitarian relief operations in the region, and should accordingly remove all obstacles that delay them.</P>
    <P>The European Union recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, which includes Chechnya and Dagestan and the Union strongly condemns terrorism. However, the Union is deeply concerned at the plight of civilians in the conflict area. The focus of EU action since the beginning of the conflict has been to make clear to the Russian authorities the unacceptability of civilian casualties and human rights abuses and to work as constructively as possible to try to persuade the Russian authorities to use dialogue to resolve the situation.</P>
    <P>A high level EU troika met with Russian authorities on 30 September and on 7 October the EU External Relations Commissioner, Chris Patten, together with the Finnish and Portuguese Foreign Ministers met with Foreign Minister Ivanov. At the EU General Affairs Council on 11 October, <Col N="1473" /> Ministers adopted conclusions expressing deep concern over the situation in the northern Caucasus and underlined the need for political dialogue. In discussions of the issue at the European Council in Tampere on 15-16 October there was concern that efforts must be made to search for a political solution. The issue was raised with Russian Prime Minister Putin at the EU-Russia summit in Helsinki on 22 October, and the EU Presidency called on the Russian Government &ldquo;immediately to engage in negotiations to reach a political settlement; to seek a dialogue with all the legitimate leaders of the North Caucasus and to consider availing itself of the good offices of the OSCE&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Foreign Minister Halonen has, during the last week, spoken twice on the phone with her colleague, Mr. Igor Ivanov, the Foreign Minister of Russia. She made clear that the European Union is deeply worried about the deteriorating situation in the northern Caucasus and its implications for the whole of the Caucasus. The EU holds the Russian Government to its word that it is not seeking a military solution. A military solution to a problem that is basically political is neither acceptable nor attainable. The European Union expects the Russian Government to explain its intentions and underlines the need for a rapid de-escalation of the conflict. The European Union calls upon the Russian Government to immediately engage in negotiations to reach a political settlement and to avail itself of the good offices of the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the views expressed to Foreign Minister Ivanov by Foreign Minister Halonen representing the Presidency of the European Union. Together with EU partners the Government is concerned to see an urgent political solution to the situation in Chechnya. The Government fully condemns all acts of terrorism including the recent bombing attacks in Russian cities. It recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and need for the federal authorities to take measures to deal with terrorism. However the loss of civilian life reported to be taking place in Chechnya is totally unacceptable and the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict zone is of the utmost concern.  The Government's concerns regarding reports of attacks on civilians have been made known directly to the Russian authorities, and we will continue to press our view, both directly and through EU contacts, that there can be no military solution to the Chechnya conflict. The Government continues to work bilaterally and with EU partners to promote a peaceful negotiated settlement to the conflict and urgent access to the vulnerable population by the international aid agencies.</P>

      <Quest>the role, if any, he envisages for Ireland in participating in strategies to prevent humani tarian disasters, including genocide, as outlined in his speech to the UN on 25 September 1999.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for effective conflict prevention strategies is one of the greatest challenges facing the international community today. As I said in my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September, we are all haunted by the collective failure to prevent humanitarian disasters &ndash; including genocide &ndash; as well as the outbreak of conflict in many regions. In the light of the slowness in responding to crisis situations and potential humanitarian disasters, notably in Kosovo earlier this year and in a number of conflict situations in Africa, there is a growing debate on how the international community can most effectively react.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has spoken of what he calls the core challenge facing the UN in the next century; to forge unity behind the principle that massive and systematic violations of human rights, wherever they may take place, should not be allowed to stand. He wishes that the international community move from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. The benefits of such a fundamental change of approach are obvious.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the Secretary General in his efforts to develop better prevention strategies and to foster a strong sense of deterrence. If states engaged in crimes against their own population know that the Security Council can and will take effective action, they may be deterred from such brutalities. Even the costliest policy of prevention is far cheaper, in lives and resources, than the least expensive use of armed force.</P>
      <P>Another effective deterrent to violations of international humanitarian law, including genocide, will be provided by the International Criminal Court which will address the scandal of impunity. Ireland looks forward to the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. To that end, Ireland participates in the preparatory commission set up to make the necessary arrangements to ensure the effective operation of the court upon the entry into force of the statute. Ratification of the statute by Ireland is a matter of priority for my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent United Nations General Assembly debate showed clearly that these issues are now, thanks to the leadership of the Secretary-General, firmly on the international agenda. Much of the current consideration of this crucial issue is focusing on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for external intervention. In this regard, there is an evident need to reconcile the requirements of international human rights provisions with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN Charter. Ireland is actively involved in this debate and is currently engaged in discussions with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the human <Col N="1475" /> security network, which meets under the joint chairmanship of Canada and Norway. I attended the most recent meeting of this group which took place in New York during my visit to the UN General Assembly last month.</P>
    <P>A renewed, reformed and re-energised UN is essential if our aspirations in the area of conflict prevention and humanitarian assistance are to be realised. As part of the Secretary General's ongoing reform programme, the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs has replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office. Its mandate is to co-ordinate the international response to humanitarian crises, to assist in developing humanitarian policies and to act as advocate for the victims of crises and ensure that the humanitarian perspective is taken into account in overall peace-building efforts. The improvement in the past two years in the overall response capacity of the international community has been notable.</P>
    <P>However, the question of resources is central to everything that the United Nations is attempting to achieve. The UN must be given the resources to address these issues in the way outlined so effectively by Secretary General Annan. Ireland, together with its partners in the European Union, stresses at every opportunity the obligation on every member state of the UN to pay its assessed contributions in full and on time together with all outstanding arrears, if applicable. This is essential for the development and implementation of enhanced conflict prevention strategies.</P>

      <P>The organisations and frameworks listed by the Deputy differ from each other in many respects, including objectives, membership and geographical scope. What they have in common, however, is that they all touch on the security of Europe in different ways.</P>
      <P>The UN remains the primary international security organisation, and the only global organisation. The UN imposes mandatory obligations on member states, including in the military area under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The OSCE is a repository of norms and principles for the conduct of international relations in the Euro-Atlantic area. The European Union is in many ways a project for security, since its basic purpose was to make war impossible between its members, and to bring stability to the continent as a whole. The EU is developing its capacity to play an active role for peace and security in Europe, through the Petersberg tasks, under the Amsterdam Treaty, in co-operation with other institutions as appropriate.</P>
      <P>NATO and the Western European Union, two organisations of which Ireland does not seek to become a member, came into being as alliances incorporating mutual defence commitments on the basis of the right of collective self defence set out in Article 51 of the UN Charter. However, both of these organisations, and NATO in particular, while still alliances, have adapted themselves to play peacekeeping roles in support of the UN. PfP, and its political framework, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), constitute a voluntary co-operation framework which has developed into an important mechanism for co-operation on peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe is active in the area of democratisation and the rule of law, particularly as regards the former communist countries of eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Each of these organisations fulfils a different role, and each offers comparative advantages in its own area of competence and expertise. Their existence reflects the successful transition of a continent which, in the last 55 years, has moved from the devastation of war, to the mutual fear of ideological confrontation, to a new era based on co-operation and mutual respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OSCE has rightly placed emphasis, not on reducing the number of institutions, but on the adaptation of these institutions to meet the new <Col N="1477" /> challenges of the post Cold War era. The OSCE has also emphasised the importance of promoting effective and mutually reinforcing co-operation between institutions with a role to play in the search for stability and security in Europe. A clear example of this is the effective co-operation between these institutions which has proved so important in the former Yugoslavia.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 6 October last to a question on the status of the investigation into the murder of Robert Hamill, I outlined in detail the background to the case.</P>
      <P>Robert Hamill died following a vicious attack in Portadown on 27 April 1997. RUC officers were in the vicinity at the time. Six people were charged in 1997 with his murder. Only one was convicted on 25 March 1999, but of causing an affray and not of murder. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints supervised the RUC investigation into the actions of the RUC officers on the night in question, following which a report was sent to the DPP. On 30 September the DPP decided not to proceed with the prosecution of any RUC officer.</P>
      <P>The RUC file on the case remains open.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the case has been actively pursued with the British authorities both at official and at ministerial level. Following the DPP's decision of 30 September not to prosecute any RUC officer, an urgent report was requested through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast. They received a detailed oral report on 19 October and a written report on 22 October, both of which emphasised that an internal RUC disciplinary investigation was ongoing, and that no option, including a public inquiry, had been ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday 19 October, I conveyed, at a meeting with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, the Government's disappointment at the DPP's decision and the wide<Col N="1478" /> spread and deep concern that exists about this case, which is fully shared by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is grave dissatisfaction throughout the Nationalist community, among human rights groups and among many colleagues in this House about the case, and this has led, understandably, to a mounting number of calls for a public inquiry. I conveyed to the new Secretary of State that, in the light of decent developments, I was giving the most serious consideration to supporting the case for a public inquiry, and would make a decision on the matter in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to support efforts aimed at securing lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone. The eight years of civil war in Sierra Leone have caused untold suffering to the people there. I welcome the ceasefire agreed in July and call on all parties to the agreement to fully implement its provisions and to fully observe human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>
      <P>As part of our ongoing bilateral support for the peace process in Sierra Leone, Ireland has taken an active interest in proceedings of the Sierra Leone contact group, and was represented at the most recent meeting of the group which took place in London in July.</P>
      <P>This was attended by representatives of 22 countries, including Sierra Leone and its neighbours, the UN, ECOWAS, the European Commission and others.</P>
      <P>We are also seeking to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the suffering civilian population. Ireland has been consistent in its support for the people of Sierra Leone, and continues to commit significant funds to the international humanitarian effort. Last year, when the conflict was at its height, the Government provided emergency aid totalling £379,000. This aid was distributed <i>via</i> the International Red Cross, the UNHCR and the Irish NGOs, Concern and Trócaire. In response to the ongoing crisis, Irish aid has this year provided £350,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance. This aid is being channelled via the World Food programme and the Irish NGOs Concern and GOAL for their respective programmes. In addition, the European Union, through the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), has provided almost 19 million euros in emergency humanitarian assistance over the last 12 months. A further package of 5 million euros is currently being planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with our EU and UN partners, the Government will continue to support diplomatic efforts aimed at consolidating a lasting and peaceful resolution to the conflict, and to provide <Col N="1479" /> appropriate humanitarian relief to the vulnerable civilian population, in addition to maintaining pressure on all parties to fully observe human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 89 states have signed the statute and, of these, four have ratified it.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Indeed, Ireland was anxious to sign the statute at an early date in order to signal our strong political support for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
      <P>A time-lapse is normal between signature and ratification. The purpose of this time-lapse is to allow each signatory state to consider what measures need to be taken in their domestic legal systems prior to ratification. The measures required prior to ratification and the time-frame involved will vary from state to state.</P>
      <P>At the international level, this is one of the issues being discussed by delegations at the preparatory commission established after the Rome conference to address matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force. The aim of these discussions is to ensure that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
      <P>As with all signatories, Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. A careful and detailed examination of the statute by my Department, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary in order to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and all other member states of the <Col N="1480" /> European Union have committed themselves to take whatever measures are required within their respective domestic legal systems to enable them to ratify the statute expeditiously. In addition, they have called on all states to sign and ratify the statute as a matter of priority so that its entry into force can be secured at an early date. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I can assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement established a new institutional framework for North-South co-operation. Once in operation, this framework will provide a context in which North-South co-operation can be developed to mutual benefit, in a new, enhanced way.</P>
      <P>My Department was actively involved in the negotiation of that agreement and in the practical work which has been ongoing since 10 April last year, in preparation for the establishment of the new North-South institutions.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, legislation is in place since March providing for the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies. Funding and staffing issues have also been considered and financial provision for the establishment of the bodies has been made.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy will know, the implementation of the institutional elements of the agreement is currently stalled because of the difficulties surrounding the formation of the Northern Executive and decommissioning. A review of the implementation of the agreement, with Senator George Mitchell as facilitator, has been under way since 6 September.</P>
      <P>If the difficulties being addressed in the review are resolved, we will be able to proceed with the formal establishment of the new institutions, including those relating to North-South matters. My Department will have an important role to play in the development of North-South co-operation in that new context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, co-operation on ongoing projects and initiatives is continuing under existing <Col N="1481" /> arrangements. These arrangements include the role played by the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, for which my Department has day to day responsibility. That ongoing work will continue to be taken forward in this way, pending the coming into being of the new institutional arrangements provided for in the agreement.</P>
    <P>In regard to specific projects directly involving my Department, I want to point out that, it has, in co-operation with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, responsibility for the implementation of a programme of cross-Border co-operation between public bodies and the European Union Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Thirty projects involving grants of approximately £7.5 million have been approved during 1999, fully committing all funding available under the programme. These involve projects in a wide range of sectors including health, education, tourism, training, sport and fisheries. A table giving details of the projects and grants approved by my Department is being provided to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, which this year was increased eightfold to £2 million. The fund, which was established in 1982, is administered by my Department and provides assistance to organisations involved in reconciliation work in both parts of this island and between Ireland and Britain. A wide variety of cross-Border projects have been approved this year under the fund, with applications being processed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>In relation to the investigation into the murder of Robert Hamill, I would refer the Deputy to my comprehensive answer to Questions Nos. 64 and 84 &ndash; ref. nos. 20885/99 and 20879/99).</P>
      <P>The Government's policy, as has been expressed consistently since the horrific killing of Lurgan solicitor Rosemary Nelson in a car-bomb attack last March, is that the investigation into her murder must be &ndash; and be seen to be &ndash; thorough, transparent and independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains ongoing and close contact with the British auth<Col N="1482" /> orities on a broad range of issues relating to the investigation of Ms Nelson's murder and indeed of other cases. The role of the RUC in the investigation into Ms Nelson's murder has, of course, been an issue of deep concern to the Nationalist community and to human rights organisations, both at home and abroad. The investigation is now led by Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port, of the Norfolk police, and the establishment and use of a non-RUC confidential telephone line is one of a number of issues on which progress has been made. I would encourage all those with relevant information to assist the investigation into this horrendous murder in every appropriate way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 70, 79, 89, 157 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>The enlargement process in which the EU is currently engaged is the most important, the largest, and the most complex exercise which the EU has faced to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the process is governed by the Copenhagen criteria which provide the objective determinants by which judgment is made as to the state of preparedness of the candidate countries to enter into enlargement nego<Col N="1483" /> tiations with the EU and the readiness of the EU to open negotiations with the candidate countries.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these criteria, the European Council in Luxembourg in December 1997 opened negotiations with a group of countries most often termed the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; or the 5+1, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus. At this stage, a number of the more easy chapters have been opened with this group of countries, and, in each case, several numbers of these chapters have been provisionally set aside.</P>
    <P>Central to the enlargement process and providing it with direction are the Commission's regular reports on the state of the process itself and the condition of readiness of the candidate countries. In its most recent reports which became available on 13 October the Commission proposes that it would be appropriate now for the European Council in Helsinki in December to declare the EU's readiness to open negotiations with the group of countries known as the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;. These are Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta. There are some conditions laid down which must be met before negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria can be opened. In the case of Bulgaria, the Commission has asserted that the opening of negotiations should be conditional upon a decision by the Bulgarian authorities, before the end of 1999, on acceptable closure dates for Units 1-4 in Kozloduy nuclear power plant, and upon a confirmation of the significant progress accomplished in the economic reform process. In the case of Romania, and in line with human rights criteria, the opening of negotiations should be conditional on the confirmation of effective action announced by the Romanian authorities to provide adequate budgetary resources and to implement structural reform of child care institutions before the end of 1999; it is also conditional upon further assessment of the economic situation before negotiations are formally opened, in the expectation that appropriate measures will have been taken to address the macro-economic situation.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary for all the candidate countries to fully comply with the Copenhagen criteria which encompass high standards in the field of human rights before they can Join the EU.</P>
    <P>I have said above that negotiations so far with the &ldquo;Ins&rdquo; have covered some of the easier chapters of the acquis. Negotiations on more difficult chapters of the acquis such as agriculture will begin next year and most likely in the first six months of the year under the Portuguese Presidency. I have been asked about agriculture and Poland. I am in no doubt that negotiations on this chapter will be sensitive and difficult and I am very conscious of the size of the agriculture sector in Poland. At present, agriculture accounts for only 5 per cent of GDP, but for a quarter of total employment, reflecting low productivity. Trade in agricultural and food products between the EU and Poland is quite substantial at present, with <Col N="1484" /> EU imports and EU exports accounting for 1.04 billion euros and 1.7 billion euros respectively.</P>
    <P>It is because of the importance of this question and of this sector that Agenda 2000 negotiations agreed the financing for the pre-accession instrument in the agriculture area which is known as SAPARD, an instrument established by the Council regulations of 21 June. The aid comes within the context of financial perspectives for 2000-2006, which provide for a maximum annual amount of 520 million euros for aid to agriculture. The objective of this instrument is to help the candidate countries to restructure and modernise their agriculture sectors in advance of EU membership.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I expect that there will be difficult and complex negotiations with the applicant states in chapters such as agriculture and free movement of persons. These negotiations will involve experts from Ireland and our EU partners together with the relevant experts from the candidate countries and, no doubt, there will be a need to face up to some difficult questions and find appropriate and acceptable answers and compromises.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the question of Turkey. Turkey's application for EU membership was tabled in 1987. In its recent report the Commission proposes that the time may now be right for the EU to formally endorse this candidature. Ireland broadly supports the position put forward by the Commission. However, no formal negotiations will begin with Turkey until that country fulfils the requirements of the Copenhagen criteria.</P>
    <P>With regard to the situation in Cyprus, the European Union, and indeed the wider international community, wish to see an agreed political solution and a united Cyprus, within the bi-zonal bi-communal framework proposed by the United Nations. The EU recognises that Turkey has a positive role to play in contributing to a solution and has urged Turkey to be constructive on this issue. However, with regard to the issue of Turkey's eligibility for accession to the EU, the European Council at Luxembourg confirmed that Turkey will be judged on the same basis as that applied to the other applicant states.</P>
    <P>As regards the application of Cyprus for EU membership, Cyprus is already engaged in detailed accession negotiations with the European Union and is one of the leading countries, at this stage, in respect of its state of preparedness for membership.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly believes in the political importance and relevance of moving forward, in full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, with the enlargement project.</P>

      <P>Human rights are at the centre of the peace plan launched by the President of Colombia, Mr. Andrés Pastrana. who addressed the European Parliament on Tuesday, 26 October to explain that plan and to seek European support. President Pastrana also met Commissioner Chris Patten and indicated that when the peace process had got properly under way he would spell out the details of the support Colombia would wish the European Union to provide.</P>
      <P>I believe the European Union must be ready to respond positively to President Pastrana at that time. Indeed the entire international community must do more to help the legitimate, elected Government of Colombia to advance the peace process there, and to deal with the numerous tribulations which afflict that country, including the lethal activities of private armies and drugs barons. I understand that the UN General Secretary. Kofi Annan, is considering appointing a special envoy to Colombia.</P>
      <P>The peace process was stalled for some time but, happily, talks resumed on Sunday 24 October. On the same day, millions of Colombians took part in marches all over the country in support of peace, and in protest against violence, kidnapping, extortion and drug-trafficking. As was demonstrated in last year's presidential elections, when there was a very high turnout, there is a groundswell of support for the peace process.</P>
      <P>The people of Colombia have suffered too much from all sides. The violence of the left-wing insurgents in Colombia is matched by that of the right-wing paramilitaries, often associated with the official security forces. And both sides seem to be equally indifferent to the plight of the civilian population to whom no immunity is extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breaches of human rights by agents of the state are especially abhorrent. The Colombian government is aware of the particular concern expressed by the Irish government and its EU partners on <Col N="1486" /> that score. President Pastrana has established a special committee to expedite investigations into human rights violations as part of a new, integrated human rights strategy. He has also accepted the help of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, in establishing a national plan for human rights.</P>
    <P>President Pastrana has dismissed two Army Generals for paramilitary involvement; and charged four more, as well as dozens of other senior officers.</P>

      <P>The plight of those who have been forced into exile as a result of paramilitary threats or intimidation, and of their families, is a cause of serious concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>Such threats are not only in direct contravention of the law, but they are also breaches of the human rights of those involved. The Government fully endorse the wish of those concerned to have the threats against them lifted and to return home.</P>
      <P>The Government has, at all times, in its communications with parties with influence on paramilitary groups, emphasised the need to adhere to the principles of non-violence and democracy which are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. The  issue is also regularly raised with the British Government through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. In recent discussions on the issue, the British authorities have again indicated that statistics specifically relating to expulsions are not available.</P>

      <P>The Government has expressed its total opposition to the use of the death penalty on a number of occasions over the past number of years, most recently in this House on 29 September last. With regard to the use of capital punishment in the United States in particular, I would refer the Deputy to the statement I made in the Seanad on 17 February last in which I expressed regret at the executions which continued to take place there.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, I noted the commitment of the Government to avail of every suitable opportunity to press for the abolition of capital punishment. I also stated the Government's view that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. These guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where individual cases violate basic minimum standards, the Union will consider making a specific intervention. It is our strongly-held belief that an EU intervention carries greater force than individual bilateral approaches by national Governments.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of these guidelines, the Union's collective efforts have continued to focus on promoting universal abolition of the death penalty. We have pressed for abolition and have issued demarches on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including the United States.</P>
      <P>For the past three years, a Resolution on the Question of the Death Penalty has been adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights with a growing number of co-sponsors. Ireland has been to the fore in building support for this resolution and we strongly supported the decision of the European Union to take the lead in tabling this resolution at this year's session of the Commission.</P>
      <P>In order to take this policy on the abolition of the death penalty a step further, to consolidate the achievements at the Commission on Human Rights and to establish the issue of the death penalty on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, we have decided, in conjunction with our European partners, to introduce a resolution on this question in the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, currently taking place in New York. Ireland will work to ensure maximum support and co-sponsorship for this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government. I raised it most recently in my address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN Development Assistance Framework under which UN agencies involved in development <Col N="1490" /> assistance will co-operate more closely at country level in an effort to avoid duplication. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office.</P>
    <P>The Track II reform proposals on which progress has been made include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General and the creation of a new post of Deputy Secretary-General with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998. A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of Security Council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a Working Group &ndash; open to all UN member states &ndash; to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the Council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged Council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the Council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the Council for 2001-2.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the Council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary-General, and, in peace- keeping matters, with troop-contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the Council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that the working group has been <Col N="1491" /> unable to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, the overall pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We very much hope that the Millennium Summit and Assembly in 2000 will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action-oriented outcome which will strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>

Portugal, which will hold the EU Presidency in the first half of next year, has indicated that it intends to launch the conference at the European Council in Lisbon on 23-24 March.</P>
      <P>The Cologne European Council confirmed that the purpose of the Intergovernmental Conference would be to resolve the institutional issues left open in Amsterdam that need to be settled before enlargement. It stipulated accordingly that the conference would cover the following topics: the size and composition of the Commission; the weighting of votes in the Council &ndash; that is re-weighting, introduction of a dual majority and the threshold for qualified majority decision-making &ndash; and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council.</P>
      <P>The Cologne conclusions added, however, that other necessary amendments to the Treaties arising as regards the European institutions in connection with the above issues and in implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam could also be discussed. The precise scope of the Conference remains to be determined, with some, including the European Commission and the European Parliament, pressing for a more extensive agenda. The Finnish Presidency was invited to draw up, on its own responsibility, for the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December this year, &ldquo;a comprehensive report explaining and taking stock of options for resolving the issues to be settled&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preparatory process, involving a technical examination of the specific issues identified in the Cologne conclusions, is taking place at the level of Permanent Representatives in Brussels.

      <P>Over the past years it has become abundantly clear that the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons has had devastating consequences in areas of conflict around the world. The ready availability of small arms and light weapons often leads to violent clashes where peaceful conflict resolution might otherwise be possible. In turn, the growing violence tends to increase the demand for weapons. The horrendous consequences of this vicious spiral are all too often seen.</P>
      <P>I have recently been engaged with a number of like-minded Foreign Ministers in developing strategies for the pursuit of human security. This is a security that is people centred rather than state-centred, an approach we consider necessary when dealing with small arms which affect the lives of civilians in so many parts of the globe.</P>
      <P>Our activities are currently focused on the forthcoming small arms conference to be held in 2001, the outcome of which will, we hope, achieve a radical review of the issues associated with the spread of small arms and light weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year guidelines on practical <Col N="1493" /> measures to remove small arms and light weapons from circulation in post-conflict situations were adopted by the UN Disarmament Commission under Irish chairmanship.</P>
    <P>Within the EU, we have also been active in bringing about the Programme for Combating Illicit Trafficking in Arms, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and the Joint Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons. These include commitments to tackling this problem from three angles: ensuring responsibility in the transfer of weapons, preventing destabilising accumulations of weapons from occurring and removing such accumulations where they exist.</P>

      <P>At that time, I informed the House that the Ambassador in London had raised these allegations at a very senior level in the British Foreign Office, and had emphasised the public concern, and that of the Government, at allegations contained in a programme broadcast on Channel 4 on 15 July. The Ambassador was informed that it is British Government policy neither to confirm nor deny allegations of specific intelligence activities. His interlocutor was therefore not in a position to comment on the detailed points raised in the Channel 4 report. However, he informed the Ambassador that the interception of telecommunications by British authorities was carried out in accordance with the British Interception of Communications Act 1985.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador had a further meeting in the Foreign Office on 12 October and emphasised the concerns of Members about these allegations.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Office official whom the Ambassador met said that he could not go beyond what he had said on the previous occasion &ndash; the British Government never comments on specific allegations of intelligence activities. He could not confirm or deny the original Channel Four report; nor could he respond to the specific questions raised by the Ambassador. He repeated his description of the operation of the Interception of Communications Act 1985, and confirmed that intercepts could only be carried out under its terms.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the Ambassador's report of his second meeting, a meeting of relevant Departments, as well as representatives of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, was convened in the Department of Foreign Affairs on 15 October 1999. The purpose of the meeting was to enable the participants to assess the situation to date, and to address the issue of improved telecommunications security for the future.</P>
      <P>As requested by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, a detailed report has now been submitted to the Committee.</P>

      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam sets as an objective the progressive establishment of the Union as an area of freedom, justice and security. However, it will be recalled that in the negotiation of the Treaty it did not prove possible to reach agreement on provisions relating to the abolition of border controls at points of entry. While proposals to this effect were acceptable to 13 of the member states, who had been operating for some time within the Schengen framework, the UK insisted on its right to maintain checks and controls at points of entry. Because of our concern to maintain the Common Travel Area with Britain, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of travel to and from this jurisdiction, Ireland was obliged to exercise its right to opt out of the relevant section of the Treaty. Having regard to the fact therefore that controls remain in effect for persons travelling into the Common Travel Area, the Treaty specifically provides for the operation of reciprocal controls for persons travelling from the UK, or Ireland, to other member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland has repeatedly signalled, including in a Declaration attached to the Treaty, that it is committed to the promotion of freedom of movement within the Union, and has taken the decision to avail of the relevant exemptions only because of the necessity of maintaining the Common Travel Area. While I am not aware that these circumstances are likely to change in the foreseeable future, Ireland has availed of the opportunity provided by the Treaty to opt in to certain measures proposed under Title IV of the Treaty dealing with freedom of movement and related matters. We will continue to adopt a positive approach to proposals arising in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is one of the cornerstones in the nuclear disarma<Col N="1496" /> ment process. Together with a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty it lays a necessary foundation for all further steps in nuclear disarmament. In the absence of a test ban the prospects for early progress on nuclear disarmament are considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Treaty is to prevent any further testing by the nuclear weapon states, and thereby to contribute to halting the further development of nuclear weapons. It stands at the beginning of the process leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The CTBT is thus a fundamental building block in the step-by-step approach to nuclear</P>
    <P>disarmament, that I have proposed with my colleagues from Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden in the New Agenda initiative.</P>
    <P>The rejection of this Treaty by the legislature in one of the five nuclear weapon states is a cause for grave concern. Ireland and its EU partners have expressed, most recently at the meeting of the European Council in Tampere, our deep regret at the failure of the US Senate to ratify the Treaty. The Treaty cannot enter into force without the ratification of the US. It would in fact be an empty treaty without American adherence.</P>
    <P>This action gives a wrong signal in the wake of nuclear testing by India and Pakistan, two non-signatories of the Treaty. Furthermore, the argumentation used to reject the Treaty casts doubts on the prospects for the eventual ratification of other disarmament measures, such as the Protocol to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, which is currently in the course of negotiation in Geneva. It also augurs poorly for the Fissile Materials Cut-off Treaty, negotiations on which will take place at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.</P>
    <P>I welcome President Clinton's re-statement of the US government's commitment to ratify the Treaty as well as his announcement that the United States will abide by the moratorium on nuclear testing in place since 1992.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware that there is public concern about the exact circumstances in which the person named met his death in the course of a raid by British police officers on the house where he was staying in London. A number of <Col N="1497" /> persons arrested at the same address were subsequently convicted on explosive-related charges.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of the death were investigated under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority in Britain, which stated, in November 1998, that the matter had been investigated to its satisfaction, although it recognised that the investigation had been delayed and that statements had not been obtained from two key witnesses. The PCA report and evidence were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service and to the coroner. On 26 April 1999, the CPS stated that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the officer involved in the fatal shooting, on the basis of insufficient evidence and in the belief that there was no realistic prospect of obtaining a conviction.</P>
      <P>It is now over three years since this person was killed and concern about the circumstances of his death has not been allayed. I note that the coroner has requested the Home Secretary to agree to the holding of a judicial inquiry and I believe that, if acceded to, this would be a positive and helpful development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Priority Question No. 35 on Pakistan today, the Government is gravely concerned at the situation there, not least because of the resulting increase in tensions in the region. Kashmir is one of the primary causes of such tension, given the history of conflict with India over it, and the military clashes provoked by Pakistan earlier this year. This tension is further compounded by the nuclear capability which both India and Pakistan demonstrated last year.</P>
      <P>The clashes in Kashmir this year occurred despite the promise of dialogue in the earlier Lahore declaration by both countries. Although some prospect of further dialogue with India remained while the Government of Mr. Sharif was still in power, the overthrow of his Government by the Pakistani military last week now places a serious question mark over this.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned at reports suggesting that the fact that Mr Sharif had withdrawn the military from Kashmir after these clashes may have been one of the reasons for the military coup. I further note with concern that the announcement by the Pakistani military of their intention to withdraw troops along the border with India does not include the &ldquo;line of separation&rdquo; in Kashmir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The declaration on Pakistan which the Special European Council issued in Tampere, underlined the need for continuing dialogue with India in <Col N="1498" /> order to resolve the tensions of the sub-continent, and also the need for both countries to adhere to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I and my EU colleagues will be following developments in this region very closely.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a candidate for non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for the two-year period commencing on 1 January 2001. The Deputy will be aware that the election will take place 12 months from now.</P>
      <P>Under the Charter of the United Nations, the member states of the UN confer on the security council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Accordingly, the agenda of the security council consists of those issues of current concern to the international community and, at this juncture, it is not possible to predict precisely what issues will be before the security council in 2001-02.</P>
      <P>However, certain principles will guide Ireland if elected to membership of the security council. Ireland will be fully committed to contributing in a constructive manner to the work of the council and in assisting it in fulfilment of its charter mandate. It is particularly important that, in the council, we should participate fully in formulating and overseeing implementation of Security Council policy decisions on the full range of international issues. We will be mindful of and responsive to the concerns of those member states which elected us. In this context, our participation in UN peacekeeping operations over almost 40 years will inform our approach as will our active contribution in other areas of UN activity.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Security Council, Ireland would be well positioned to contribute more effectively to the promotion of reform of the council itself. In particular, Ireland is committed to seeking greater transparency in the conduct of the council's business.</P>
      <P>We have always affirmed that small states as well as large states should have the opportunity to bring their perspectives to issues of international peace and security. We look forward to bringing to the council our track record of commitment to the work of the United Nations. Our objective is to make a full and positive contribution to the dynamic and effective role required of the organisation.</P>

      <P>The European Union has an active role in encouraging and strengthening the Middle East Peace Process and has appointed a special envoy to assist in this.</P>
      <P>The European Union affords political and economic support for a negotiated settlement in the Middle East, to reflect the principles of land for peace and ensure the security, both collective and individual, of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. It does so on the political level through public statements, its meetings with leaders of the various parties involved in the peace process, and its activities in relevant international organisations, in particular the United Nations.</P>
      <P>On 13 September, the General Affairs Council in a statement welcoming the signature of the Sharm-el-Sheikh Memorandum reiterated the Union's readiness to be associated with the implementation of the agreement and, if the parties so wished, to contribute to issues to be dealt with under the resumed Final Status Negotiations.</P>
      <P>The union is exploring with parties in and outside the region how, against the background of progress on the Palestinian Track, early progress can be achieved on the Multilateral, the Syrian and the Lebanese Tracks.</P>
      <P>On the economic level, the European Union also provides significant financial and technical support. The Union and its member states are the largest donors of international aid to the region in support of the peace process. The Union also provides technical assistance in critically important areas such as water and refugees.</P>
      <P>Although the European Union is not a participant at the talks currently taking place in Oslo between President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak, in which President Clinton is involved, we hope that the outcome of these talks will be to inject new momentum into the peace process. The European Union will continue to play an active role in this regard.</P>

I saw the situation for myself when I visited Sudan last year at the height of the crisis.</P>
      <P>Humanitarian assistance is not, of course, a substitute for political action.

In addition, together with our international partners, Ireland continues to support actively the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) process, in an effort to advance a peaceful resolution to the conflict at an early date.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the decision of the Israeli Government, conveyed to the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv on 19 October, to refuse to allow a group of 25 peaceable pilgrims from Ireland, 18 of them Irish citizens, to travel to the Holy Land. I raised the matter directly with Foreign Minister Levy whom I met in Luxembourg on 11 October and had hoped that further information about the standing of this group, provided through the Irish Embassy, would have assured the Israeli authorities that they are neither a sect nor a cult, that they are totally committed to non-violence and that they are therefore no threat to anybody. The reasons given by the Israeli authorities for this refusal are that their immigration rules do not allow tourists to stay for eight months, that they suspected that the group might want to stay in the country indefinitely and that the consent of the natural parents was required in the case of adopted children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ambassador in Tel Aviv protested to the Israeli authorities about the physical mistreatment of members of the group in Haifa on 10 <Col N="1501" /> October when they were forced by police to re-board the ship on which they had arrived. The embassy has since presented to the Israeli Foreign Ministry copies of written statements by ten members of the group detailing that mistreatment, has told the Foreign Ministry that we are not satisfied that the situation justified the heavy-handed action that was taken and has sought an explanation of the conduct of the police.</P>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Athens has impressed on the group of pilgrims, now in Greece, that Israel has a sovereign right to refuse them entry and that the Irish Government is disappointed with that decision but that we have to accept it. While we understand their feelings, particularly about the misleading press coverage which surrounded the decision, we have strongly advised them also to accept it.</P>

      <P>No proposals were submitted to the Tampere European Council in respect of the extension of either qualified majority voting or the co-decision powers of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>There was a brief informal discussion over dinner at Tampere of the preparation of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference in the context of the anticipated publication of the Dehaene Report to the European Commission on the institutional implications of enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council at Cologne in June con<Col N="1502" /> firmed its intention to convene an Intergovernmental Conference early in the year 2000. The question of the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the council was identified as one of the topics for consideration by the conference. It is possible that the extension of co-decision will also be amongst the items for consideration. Most member states favour a relatively limited agenda. However, the precise scope of the conference remains to be determined. The European Commission and the European Parliament have been pressing for a more extensive agenda.</P>
    <P>The Dehaene Report, which was drawn up at the invitation of Mr Prodi in his capacity as President-Designate of the Commission, was presented to the commission on 18 October, shortly after the Tampere European Council. The report, which does not bind the member states in any way, argues that qualified majority voting should be the rule in an enlarged Union and that, whenever qualified majority voting applies in legislative matters in the first pillar, the European Parliament should have the power of co-decision.</P>
    <P>A preparatory process, involving a technical examination of the specific issues already identified in the Cologne conclusions, is taking place at the level of Permanent Representatives in Brussels. The Finnish Presidency has been invited to draw up, on its own responsibility, for the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December, &ldquo;a comprehensive report explaining and taking stock of options for resolving the issues to be settled&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference is at an early stage. Ireland's negotiating approach will be developed as the agenda for the conference becomes clearer. In general, the Government would be prepared to give constructive consideration to any reasonable proposals for the extension of qualified majority voting in respect of community business. However, like other member states, there are certain areas in which we attach particular importance to the retention of the unanimity requirement. In our case, taxation would be one such area. We would also be prepared to consider the further appropriate extension of the co-decision procedure.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, was to establish a range of rights for all employees in relation to the payment of wages, including the right to a readily negotiable mode of wage payment, the right to a written statement of wages and deductions and protection from unlawful deductions. In this context, &ldquo;wages&rdquo; are defined in the Act as any sums of money payable by an employer to an employee in respect of employment. This definition covers all amounts that would commonly be regarded as wages or remuneration including fees, bonuses, commission, and sick, holiday and maternity pay.</P>
      <P>Certain other payments which may be made by an employer but which are not usually regarded as wages or remuneration are specifically excluded from the coverage of the Act. These include pensions and any other allowances paid to an employee on account of retirement, death, resignation or loss of office. This is in line with other legislation &ndash; such as the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 1990 &ndash; where the definition of an employee or worker also excludes pensioners.</P>

      <P>Following a restructuring of the community employment (CE) programme, approved by Government in July 1999, the dependent spouses of long-term unemployed persons &ndash; qualified adults &ndash; and widows are now eligible to participate in CE. <Col N="1506" /> These categories of women were added as I believe it was anomalous that women who had spent most of their lives as carers in the family home should be excluded from eligibility for CE at a time when they need to have access to the labour market.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to further expand the eligibility conditions for women for CE or associated programmes. However, a working group, representative of the social partners, is currently considering the issue of women's access to labour market opportunities and is expected to report to Government shortly. Any further changes in eligibility conditions to active labour market programmes will be considered in the light of the recommendations of this group.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that any woman wishing to return to the workforce can avail of the services of FÁS, either for employment placement or for training, and such supports can frequently be more appropriate than going onto programmes such as CE. The return to work programme, for which there is no live register requirement, is particularly suited to women returning in that it helps participants to develop the confidence necessary to re-enter the labour force, and is also an important bridging programme for progression onto other FÁS programmes. The programme is delivered on a part-time basis within local communities and in 1998 was completed by 1,065 women. Others move directly into skills training programmes and into enterprise training and from there directly into employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>It is also important to note that more than half of the participants on CE in 1998 were women and women accounted for 54 per cent of trainees on FÁS training programmes that year. I believe that this clearly demonstrates the emphasis placed by FÁS on the issue of facilitating women's access to FÁS programmes as a route to reintegration to the open labour market.</P>

      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluation of community employment was published in October 1998 and was the subject of extensive discussions with the social partners thereafter. It set a framework for a reform of this programme for the period ahead, in a context which has seen significant employment growth and unemployment reductions. It recommended that there should be a reduction in participation <Col N="1508" /> on the programme over time as well as a range of other reforms aimed at enhancing its effectiveness. Following due deliberation and consultation, I brought a series of proposals to Government to implement many of the reforms put forward. The Government decision was the subject of a press release in July of this year. There was no question therefore of any information being withheld from the public.</P>
      <P>Since then I have held further discussions with the INOU and the ICTU to clarify some aspects of the Government decision. I was happy to clarify that the average level of places on CE schemes for 1999 will be maintained at 37,500 as previously agreed. In this context and given that the participation level at the beginning of 1999 was some 40,000, the projected outturn participation at the end of the year will be in the order of 37,000; there will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of social economy jobs and reductions of CE places. Social economy jobs will, in general, be full-time jobs so there will not be a direct one-for-one ratio; there will be consultations with the social partners within the P2000 Committee on Labour Market Issues on how best to allocate any medium-term resources freed up by the restructuring of CE to fit the needs of long-term unemployed; there will be consultations with the social partners at a central level on the proper funding and provision of essential services currently delivered through CE; and I indicated that the re-focusing of resources towards alternative programmes already agreed with the social partners earlier this year is already operational. The Government decision to reduce the number of CE places by 4,500 over a five year period, and transfer the resources for 5000 places to a dedicated social economy programme, remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the Government has fulfilled by a factor of three the commitment to 10,000 additional active labour market programme places in paragraph 4.24 of partnership 2000. All of these places are for unemployed and socially excluded persons and most of them are targeted at the long-term unemployed. There will of course be further consultations on the provision of support to the unemployed in the context of the post Partnership 2000 negotiations.</P>

      <P>EMPLOYMENT is an EU human resources initiative which operates for the period 94-99. The initiative operates under four strands &ndash; NOW, Integra, Youthstart and Horizon, each strand catering for a different target group. EMPLOYMENT seeks to combat exclusion, disadvantage and inequality in the labour market by funding innovative pilot projects which respond to the personal and labour market circumstances of each of the four target groups. The initiative is implemented in two phases, phase one projects ran from 1996 to 1997 and phase two projects started in 1998 and will continue until end of 1999 to early 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department established a mainstreaming forum in 1997 to identify and extract the important lessons from the EMPLOYMENT pilot projects and to transfer these lessons to the <Col N="1510" /> mainstream of policy and practise. The forum consists of representatives from eight Departments and four agencies as well as the five administrative structures of the EMPLOYMENT initiative.</P>
    <P>Through participation in the forum, policymakers have gained access to and familiarity with the work undertaken in the pilot projects with a view to the application of this learning in their own spheres. The work of the mainstreaming forum is ongoing and will continue into 2000 in order to look at the learning from the EMPLOYMENT initiative and in particular the currently funded phase two projects.</P>
    <P>The best practices and learning from the four strands of the EMPLOYMENT initiative have also fed into Ireland's national employment action plan. The plan gives examples of specific projects and positions them in their policy context. The new human resource operational programme, which will form part of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, is based around the national employment action plan and thus will also reflect the learning from EMPLOYMENT.</P>
    <P>Examples of where particular successes in mainstreaming were achieved are as follows: project work under Youthstart on integrated local approaches to counter early school leaving assisted the definition of the Department of Education and Science's current initiative for the prevention of early school leaving, a Horizon project led to the establishment of a university accredited course in training and education relating to people in supported employment while another developed and piloted peer counselling training for the disabled which has been endorsed by many regional health authorities.</P>
    <P>Further pilot projects will be funded under the new human resources initiative EQUAL which will run from 2000 to 2006. This initiative aims to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market by way of innovative projects involving local consortia and transnational partners. EQUAL will address selected themes and is again centred around the four pillars of the employment action plans of the member states encompassing employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities between women and men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands administers, recognises the value of hedgerows for nesting birds and provides protection during the critical nesting period of 15 April to 31 August against cutting and burning of hedgerows. Regulations transposing the habitats directive into Irish law restrict damaging hedgerows in special areas of conservation. The rural environment protection scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, also promotes the conservation and maintenance of existing hedgerows.</P>
      <P>I do not have any plans, therefore, to introduce financial incentives for hedgerow management under the forestry programme. In any event, it would appear that hedgerow management programmes would not be eligible for support under the FEOGA guarantee schemes for the promotion of forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 124, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, under the Harbours Act, 1996, Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company is statutorily responsible for the management, control, direction and development of the harbour and its environs within jurisdictional limits.</P>
      <P>The company requires a foreshore lease and licence for the works to be undertaken. I will consider all objections lodged under the public consultation process including those relating to loss of moorings before any licensing decision is made by me.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of dividends, the position is that no decision has been taken on dividends from the nine State port companies, including Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance on the question of ports' dividend policy. This will take into account the need for continuing investment by the ports to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to handle increasing volumes of tourism and trade and maintain competitiveness.</P>
      <P>On the question of State and Exchequer assistance, the position is that there is a long-standing commitment to an Exchequer grant of £3 million as well as £850,000 grant assistance under the EU Wales-Ireland Maritime Interreg Initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the projected gross income from the marina development which will accrue to Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company, I am advised by the company that this can only be definitively calculated on completion of the tender process for the marina construction. I am further advised that <Col N="1513" /> the marina is expected to operate at a loss for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In relation to marine recreational investment generally, I can inform the Deputies that I am seeking funds to allow me to respond positively to requests for support for specific access infrastructural projects. It is not possible at this stage to say when, and if, such a scheme can be put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the person in question originally applied for approval for grant aid for afforestation of two plantations in 1998. Approval was not given as it was deemed that the lands in question were not capable of producing economic commercial crops of timber. A subsequent appeal by the applicant resulted in a reassessment of the applications by two senior forestry inspectors and a senior administrative official of my Department. However, the areas were again found not to be capable of producing economic commercial crops of timber. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that a further reassessment of the case would not be warranted.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>and Natural Resources his views on whether lands designated as not capable of producing a commercial crop of wood by Department officials should be reassessed by an independent body rather than officials within his Department, particularly in cases where the landowner disputes the designation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present procedure in a case where a forestry inspector from my Department deems an area of land as not capable of producing a commercial crop of timber, is that the case may be reconsidered, on appeal, to two senior departmental forestry inspectors and a senior administrative officer. I am not satisfied that this procedure is fair and reasonable, in that the final responsibility for approving EU supported grant aid must rest with my Department.</P>
      <P>The applicant is, of course, entitled to submit whatever supporting evidence, including the opinion of a professional forester, as it felt warranted and such evidence will be taken into consideration by the personnel handling the appeal. In addition any applicant who feels that an incorrect or unfair decision has been taken by my Department can have recourse to the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>

      <QRef>[21554/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): In addition to the general provisions on fishing in freshwater contained in primary legislation there are three main regulations in force in relation to coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>The Conservation of Pike By-law 667 of 1990 sets a bag limit of one pike per angler per day. It also prohibits the killing of any pike over 6.6 lbs in weight with the exception of the retention of a &ldquo;specimen pike&rdquo;. The Control of Fishing for <Col N="1523" /> Coarse Fish in Fresh Water By-law 595 of 1977 restricts to two the number of rods which an angler can use. It also prohibits all means of fishing for coarse fish in fresh water other than rod and line. As exceptions to the application of these two by-laws netting for coarse fish is permitted in the waters of certain loughs in the Shannon catchment during specified period of the year.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Live Roach By-law 561 of 1973 prohibits the transfer of live roach from any waters to any other waters.</P>
    <P>The central and regional fisheries boards have primary responsibility for the enforcement of these regulations. The effectiveness of these measures is kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The implementation of many of the elements of the Good Friday Agreement is continuing; clearly, in several instances this is, and will continue to be, a phased and gradual process.</P>
      <P>However, the continuing failure to find an agreed basis among the participants for the formation of an inclusive executive has blocked the implementation of the core institutional and constitutional aspects of the agreement. Powers have not been devolved to Northern Ireland. Consequently and additionally, it has not been possible for the two Governments to bring into force the British-Irish Agreement, which provides for the establishment of the North/South ministerial council, the six implementation bodies as agreed last March, the British-Irish council and the British-Irish intergovernmental conference. The entry into effect of the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution, and of new British constitutional legislation, would also take place simultaneously with devolution and the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>Whether, and if so when, it may be possible to unblock this impasse is the subject of the continuing review of the implementation of the agreement, and in that regard I would refer the Deputy to my reply today to Priority Question No. 34.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Paris Peace Accord in 1991 brought an end to many years of conflict in Cambodia and led to a UN peacekeeping operation in that country. A coalition government formed after the 1993 elections did not last and violent confrontations took place between supporters of both parties. In 1998, however, a peace settlement mediated by Japan was followed by elections. These took place with UN and EU assistance and were overseen by 80 EU observers, including four from Ireland. Five members of the Oireachtas also acted as nationally-funded observers. Violent disturbances which took place when each side rejected the outcome of the election were halted by the intervention of King Norodom Sihanouk, and both parties agreed to work together in the interest of national unity.</P>
      <P>This arrangement appears to be working well so far. However, in view of the legacy of bitterness and division, the process of national reconciliation in Cambodia can be expected to face some difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main issues which remains to be addressed is the trial of a number of Khmer Rouge leaders who are at present in custody. The Government of Cambodia sees it as essential, in the context of the need for the Cambodian people to come to terms with the Khmer Rouge period, <Col N="1526" /> that any trials take place on Cambodian soil, in Cambodian courts and under Cambodian law. The UN Secretary General and others favour the establishment of an international tribunal. The Cambodian Government has recently expressed its openness to foreign legal and judicial participation in the trials. It is important that the most appropriate mechanism is found so that both goals, national reconciliation and accountability for Khmer Rouge crimes, can be achieved.</P>

      <P>The current humanitarian situation in Kosovo is extremely complex and involves a number of components including emergency relief, democratisation and economic reconstruction. The UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating all of these areas. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has been tasked with leading the relief effort.</P>
      <P>The principal challenge for relief organisations is to prepare for the onset of winter, which in the Balkans can be very harsh. UNHCR, ECHO and OFDA (USA) are cooperating to provide the necessary materials to fully winterise at least one room of each house that is damaged but repairable. In addition, work is continuing on preparing community shelters for the most vulnerable people. In urban areas heating is also a major problem and the EU is funding basic repairs to the electricity supply. These activities are well organised and are proceeding with significant support from the Kosovars themselves.</P>
      <P>Overall there is not a major problem concerning food security. Immediately after the return of Kosovars from neighbouring countries, food distributions were carried out to the entire population. However, due to improving food security, food is now distributed to a much smaller number of more vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>As with any operation of its size, the work of international relief organisations is not without some difficulties. But the results to date have been marked by a good degree of coordination and the most urgent needs would appear to be addressed. A recent monitoring visit by officials from this Department confirmed this view.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>Insufficient international attention for the very serious situation in East Timor was one of the main reasons why, through my visit there last April, I sought to highlight the urgent need for an adequate response in both the EC and the United Nations. Despite the activities of Portugal and the UN Secretary General, going back in both cases over many years, there was inadequate support from the international community. Following my visit, I informed the UN Secretary General, and also a number of other Governments, including our EU partners, of my grave concerns.</P>
      <P>The agreement of 5 May between Indonesia, Portugal and the UN provided the basis for the referendum of 30 August and the subsequent steps towards independence which are now taking place. Under the terms of that agreement the Indonesian authorities were obliged to provide security and their failure to do so has still to be explained by them.</P>
      <P>My designation by the Finnish Presidency of the EU as its special representative helped to raise the profile of the union generally, and also its team of monitors during the referendum. On behalf of the EU, I urged the Indonesian authorities at the highest level to respect the referendum process and to honour their commitments on security. When violence later escalated, I appealed to a number of my counterparts and also to the UN Security Council to take urgent action.</P>
      <P>As a result of my reporting to my EU colleagues at their meeting in Finland on 5 September, the Union was better placed to react swiftly to the crisis and that this was reflected also in the efforts of the EU members of the security council to urge action by that body. A number of EU member states are now participating in INTERFET, and the Union and its member states have been contributing a considerable amount of emergency assistance.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Union fully supported the actions being taken, by Portugal and Ireland, before, during and after the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the response of the United Nations to the crisis, I would distinguish between the efforts of the Secretary General together with the courageous and dedicated work of the members of UNAMET, on the one hand, and the belated response of the Security Council, on the other. I have already indicated my regret that the United <Col N="1528" /> Nations was not able to respond more quickly to the developing crisis. However, I welcomed the adoption of Resolution 1264 on 15 September, and I believe that the subsequent action by Australia and other Governments participating in INTERFET helped to avert an even greater tragedy for the people of East Timor.</P>

      <P>Almost 40 per cent of Irish aid is channelled through multilateral development assistance agencies. A significant part of these funds take the form of mandatory contributions to the EU's development activities, the World Bank Group and UN agriculture and food agencies.</P>
      <P>Ireland also makes voluntary contributions to a wide variety of UN agencies. Such donations have increased very substantially in recent years &ndash; from £2.5 million in 1993 to £8.4 million this year. The number of UN programmes receiving such funding has also substantially increased, although the three major recipients &ndash; the UN Development Programme, UN High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF between them receive about 60 per cent of available funds. Irish Aid would hope to continue steady increases in such voluntary contributions.</P>
      <P>Contributions to multilateral bodies are designed to accord as closely as possible with the focus of Irish aid on poverty reduction. Our funding of UN bodies also takes into account their record in implementing reform and enhancing cooperation with other agencies.</P>
      <P>Funds are directed where possible towards programmes designed to address basic needs in food and livelihood security, clean water, access to primary health and education services. Ireland is working through the EU, UN and international financial institutions to develop and implement programmes which enhance the development prospects of poor countries, including, in the case of the EU, through a successor arrangement to the Lomé Convention.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed in September 1998 that priority was to be given to the issue of debt in developing countries and that funds of £31.5 million would be devoted to this purpose. Most of this money has been allocated to multilateral debt relief directed through the heavily indebted poor countries initiative administered by the World Bank and IMF.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland operates programmes of aid in six designated priority countries in Africa with whom we have signed technical co-operation agreements. These countries are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. These six number among the poorest in the world and are considered to be countries where our efforts can make maximum impact to help the poor. The combined allocation of Ireland aid funds to these countries in 1999 amounts to £41.7 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, we are contributing to smaller programmes of assistance in two other countries &ndash; South Africa and Zimbabwe. Our programmes in these countries are intended to be of shorter duration and they are focused on a more limited specific range of problems. The combined value of the 1999 allocation for these countries is £3.4 million.</P>
      <P>We are committed to continued expansion of our programme of aid and with this expansion the question of adding to the number of our priority countries naturally arises. It is our view that we should indeed extend our programme of assistance to one or two more priority countries. We have been studying options and specific proposals will shortly be presented to Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Government on the US embargo against Cuba remains that set out in my reply of 29 September to another question  &ndash;  we wish to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners, all of whom share the same position, and we have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General <Col N="1530" /> Assembly calling for an end to the embargo, most recently at the general assembly last year.</P>
    <P>The US Administration and its diplomatic representatives have been made fully aware of our position.</P>
    <P>There has been some progress. On 4 August the US Senate &ndash; partly prompted by pressure from agribusiness interests &ndash; voted by 70 to 28 in favour of exempting food and medicine from the embargo, but the proposal did not prosper in the House of Representatives. Earlier this year restrictions were eased on the delivery of food and medicine to non-governmental organisations, though this was not welcomed by the Cuban authorities as it was seen as circumventing state control.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the EU Common Position on Cuba, adopted in December 1996, our aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from there. However, the Common Position also makes clear that wholehearted cooperation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country.</P>
    <P>After the Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 there had been a certain easing of repressive measures against political dissidents and a reduction in the number of political prisoners. However, subsequently the situation deteriorated again. In January 1999, the criminal law was amended to introduce new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing dissidence.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, four members of the Internal Dissidence Group were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In a statement issued on 17 March, the EU expressed its deep regret at the sentences passed. It pointed out that the people convicted had exercised a freedom of expression which is recognised universally as a human right and that the EU could not accept that citizens exercising such a right should be criminalised by state authorities. The EU also rejected judicial proceedings of a political nature and expressed deep concern about the amendments to the criminal law further curtailing the exercise of the rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the EU reiterated its continuing objective of encouraging a peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the Common Position.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights, including at this year's session. With all of our EU partners, we once again called on Cuba to cooperate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>
    <P>The Government, by decision of 28 September 1999, approved the establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. It is the intention that the ambassador to Mexico will also be accredited to Cuba; the Cuban ambassador to London will be accredited to Dublin. The Cuban Foreign Minister, Felipe Perez Roque, was in Dublin on <Col N="1531" /> Wednesday 27 October to mark the establishment of relations between our two countries. These formal ties will enable us to deepen the friendly relation which already exist between us. It will also provide an important impetus for the further development of economic, social and cultural links.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> Mo Mowlam has been a most wonderful colleague and friend and she takes with her our deepest gratitude for the extraordinary dedication with which she filled the post of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Her tenure covered a period that saw developments and progress of a truly historic character in Northern Ireland, developments for which Mo herself can rightly take real pride and a large measure of credit. In particular, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its endorsement by the people last year will stand as an enduring monument to her term of office.</P>
    <P>Mo Mowlam brought to the role of Secretary of State a distinctive mix of skills that were extremely suited to the needs of the time &ndash; a deep humanity, an extraordinary empathy with people at all levels, personal courage and determination of the highest order, and an unquenchable belief in the power of politics to change people's lives for the better.</P>
    <P>It was a great honour to have had her as a colleague and personal friend during this momentous time, a time when the level of co-operation between the British and Irish Governments was brought to unprecedented levels, for the benefit of all our people. We worked together closely on all issues, but most particularly on the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement. Mo Mowlam can leave Northern Ireland in the knowledge that she has made a profound contribution to the building of a new future, a future based on the qualities at the heart of the Agreement itself, namely partnership, equality and mutual respect.</P>
    <P>We send Mo our warmest good wishes in her new position, to which we know she will bring the same dedication, skill and commitment.</P>

      <P>Montenegro, which is the smaller of the two Republics which make up the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), has become the target of destabilising activities orchestrated from Belgrade, of which the latest has been described as economic terrorism. Since the elections of 1998, when Milo Djukanovic was elected President in the face of opposition from Belgrade, the Government in Podgorica has been pursuing a radically different policy from that pursued by the Milosevic regime. While Milosevic has defied the international community firstly over Kosovo and latterly over democratic reform in Serbia, Dju<Col N="1533" /> kanovic has sought to broaden his contacts with the international community and pursued a policy of reform at home.</P>
      <P>Following the Kosovo crisis and the NATO air strikes against FRY the crisis in the FRY economy, which was already severe due to the effect of international sanctions, has taken a marked turn for the worse, with an accompanying plunge in the value of the Yugoslav dinar. As it is part of FRY, Montenegro's currency is the Yugoslav dinar, and monetary policy in FRY is a matter for the Federal Government in Belgrade. The loss in value of the dinar, caused mainly by Belgrade's policy of printing money, has caused hyperinflation in FRY. This hyperinflation threatens the political and economic stability of Montenegro, and is being used to bring pressure to bear on the Government of President Djukanovic. It is possible that Belgrade's ultimate objective is to bring about a situation in Montenegro which will provide a pretext for military action by the Federal Government in Belgrade against the Montenegrin Government.</P>
      <P>The Montenegro authorities are planning to move away from reliance on the Yugoslav dinar. They plan to introduce the deutschmark as a parallel currency from early November. Establishing a parallel currency, however, raises many important and complex issues. It is evident that in order to do this they will need external support.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its EU partners have been supportive of the Montenegrin Government since the election of President Djukanovic. Sanctions which apply to the rest of the FRY are being lifted in the case of Montenegro and the Republic is invited to participate in the stability pact for south-east Europe. It is clear, however, that the Government of President Djukanovic will require practical as well as political support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and its EU partners believe that Montenegro could act as a catalyst for political change within FRY as a whole, and therefore benefit the wider region. For this reason Ireland and the EU believe that efforts must be made by the international community to aid the Government of Montenegro in its current difficulties. The EU is in contact with the Montenegrin authorities with <Col N="1534" /> a view to working out practical ways to help. Ireland supports these efforts, and the Government is ready to participate in any EU and international action in this regard.</P>

      <P>Ireland makes a large number of payments to a broad variety of organizations under our multilateral assistance programme. These are of two types: mandatory payments, notably to the EU, the World Bank Group, the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and UN agricultural and food agencies; voluntary contributions to UN funds and programmes such as the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UNICEF and UN High Commission for Refugees.</P>
      <P>A full list of our multilateral contributions, from the Irish Aid Annual Report for 1998, follows.</P>
      <P>Our voluntary contributions to the UN system for development-related activities have been steadily increasing over recent years, from £2.5 million in 1993 to £8.4 million this year. The number of UN programmes receiving such funding has also substantially increased, although the three major recipients &ndash; the UN Development Programme, UN High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF between them receive about 60 per cent of available funds.</P>
      <P>While Irish aid will aim to increase its funding of multilateral development agencies in the future, this will not necessarily mean an increase in the number of organizations receiving such assistance. Instead, we will aim to direct increased funds at those bodies which have shown a commitment to reform and efficiency in the delivery of aid and in particular those whose activities accord best with the core aim of our bilateral aid programme, i.e. poverty alleviation.</P>

      <P>Civilian personnel seconded by national Governments to the OSCE mission in Kosovo are in receipt of a daily allowance from the OSCE of US$128 or £97 approximately. Irish personnel seconded receive this plus a top up allowance <Col N="1538" /> which is paid monthly at my discretion. The amount of the top up depends on the level of the job which they are doing. The lowest top up paid to Irish civilian personnel in Kosovo will be the equivalent of $1000 monthly which is broadly equivalent to the salary received by a P2 grade official in the OSCE. Based on a month of 31 days this makes a monthly income of $4,968. Irish personnel in positions carrying a greater level of responsibility would receive a somewhat larger top up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that this is out of line with what is paid by other EU Governments to their nationals serving in OSCE missions. I have instructed my officials to keep the matter <Col N="1539" /> under review and, should an increase be warranted, I will make the necessary arrangements to have it paid.</P>

      <Quest>the position concerning the proposed changes to the Working Time Directive; her views on whether the proposals of the EU Commission would have a very serious impact on Irish industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the road transport industry in relation to the proposed Working Time Directive have been conveyed to me by the various industry associations, particularly the Irish Road Haulage Association, IBEC and the Irish Concrete Federation. The issues raised include concerns about possible increased costs, the need for additional vehicles and drivers, and the inclusion of self employed drivers within the scope of the directive. These are being taken into account in determining Ireland's negotiating position.</P>
      <P>The position is that there are already rules about working time for most workers under Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November, 1993. The aim of that directive was &ldquo;to guarantee the protection of workers against the adverse effects on their health and safety arising from excessive working time, insufficient rest or irregular work patterns&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>However the directive did not cover sailors, junior doctors or employees in any form of transport. They were left out because it was felt at the time that different rules would be needed for them because of the complexities attached to each occupation.</P>
      <P>The Social Affairs Council has now reached political agreement on rules for sailors, junior doctors and transport workers other than those engaged in road transport.</P>
      <P>In October 1997, the social partners in the road transport sector established a joint committee at community level to explore how the Working Time Directive could best be adapted taking account of the particular circumstances of their sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31 March 1998, the Commission issued a consultation document to the social partners. <Col N="1540" /> While sufficient points of convergence were reached by the social partners to draw up the text of a draft joint agreement, they failed to reach agreement by 30 September 1998. The Commission had informed the social partners that, in the absence of agreement by that date, the Commission would come forward with proposals for the sector. This is what it has done.</P>
    <P>This Commission proposal has been debated at length at the transport questions working group. Many member states have had difficulty with these initial proposals and political agreement has not yet been reached. The Finnish Presidency is continuing the discussion of the Commission proposal with the objective of achieving an acceptable compromise package. Ireland's objective in this regard is to negotiate a package which provides flexibility for the industry while protecting the health and safety of workers.</P>
    <P>The driving hours of mobile workers in transport are currently regulated by the tachograph legislation but other activities such as loading and unloading, cleaning the vehicle, performing safety checks on the vehicle and paperwork are not included in the calculation of driving time. In fact, time which may appear to be a break on a tachograph chart could in fact be occupied with other strenuous activity. Although road transport workers are only permitted to drive for 45 hours a week, they may in fact work in excess of this. The health and welfare of these workers is as important as for workers in any other industry.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the proposed Working Time Directive may have an impact on the industry. However this has to be balanced with the protection of health and safety of the workforce on which the industry depends.</P>
    <P>I and my Department will remain in regular contact with the various representative associations to ensure that Ireland's negotiating position is informed by their concerns. However, whatever provisions are finally adopted will have to take account of the differing views of member states and the position of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>The rules governing the establishment of telecommunications masts, including the requirements, if any, regarding notification and consultation, are matters for planning legislation which is the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <Quest>the number of new carriages for the DART service currently on order; the additional seating capacity that will be available when these go into service; the expected date of delivery of these carriages; and the extent of her longer term plans to invest in additional rolling stock for this service as it develops and is extended to serve new stations.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of DART carriages currently on order is 26. Ten of the carriages, co-funded under the EU Operational Programme for Transport (1994-99), (OPT), will be delivered in early November 1999.</P>
      <P>In February 1999, a contract was placed for a further 16 carriages which will be delivered during October/November 2000. These carriages are being funded by the EU under the OPT and by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Following delivery, commissioning of the carriages takes approximately eight weeks and they will then be introduced into service immediately.</P>
      <P>The 26 new carriages will be used to enhance existing services and to operate six car train sets. They will also help to cater for the extended DART network to Malahide and Greystones. They will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 106 carriages which will result in an increase in passenger seating capacity of 1,040 and total passenger carrying capacity of 5,200 places.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-06, prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office proposes the phased purchase of an additional 46 DART carriages. This proposal is currently being considered as part of the preparatory work for the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Further measures to improve suburban rail services in addition to DART have also been identified in the DTO Blueprint and will also be considered in the NDP context. Moreover, on my instructions, CIE has also commissioned a consultancy team to undertake a strategic review of the Dublin suburban rail network in the longer term. I expect the final report to be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The key project which relates specifically to increasing track capacity on the Arrow line is set out in the DTO's Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-06. It involves doubling the existing two track line between Hazelhatch and Sallins and providing associated signalling. In addition it proposes bringing the Heuston to Connolly line via the Phoenix Park tunnel, into oper<Col N="1544" /> ation. The estimated cost is £28 million, comprising £18 for the Kildare line works and £10 million for the Heuston to Connolly section.</P>
      <P>The DTO Transportation Blueprint 2000-06 also identified the need for additional rolling stock to meet increased passenger demand and recommended the phased purchase of 58 additional diesel railcars.  A proportion of these will be allocated to the Arrow service and help to increase capacity.</P>
      <P>These projects and additional investment proposals for the Heuston to Portlaoise line are being considered for inclusion in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>CIE, on my instructions, has commissioned a consultancy team to undertake a strategic review of the Dublin suburban rail network in the longer term. The results of this study are expected by the end of 1999 and may have implications for the proposals on the Kildare line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the ESB is currently responsible for the provision of adequate electricity capacity, the gradual liberalisation of the market is changing the situation. I am aware of several proposals for projects to build independent generating stations over the coming years. The Commission for Electricity Regulation will license suitable projects.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 a report was published by the ESB, in consultation with my Department, entitled Generation Capacity Requirements to 2005. That report foresees a need for additional capacity arising in late 2001-early 2002, and a total of 800MW of generating capacity being needed in the period up to 2005. While there are projects in the pipeline by the ESB and others for the provision of this capacity, the ESB is successfully managing the increasing demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>Section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, provides for the preparation by the ESB of an annual forecast statement covering both generation and transmission. This will be in a form to be approved by the Commission for Electricity Regulation. The forecast statement will cover seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further legislation to implement the balance of the EU electricity directive currently under preparation will require that an independent transmission system operator will have the ultimate <Col N="1545" /> duty to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the electricity system to meet customer demand.</P>
    <P>The ESB assures me that there is adequate capacity to meet demand this winter. The projects known to be in gestation at present give grounds for confidence that there will not be a supply constraint in the long term.</P>

      <Quest>if the approximate 1,300 civilian personnel employed by him within the Defence Forces are covered by the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997; his views on whether it is reasonable that military members of the Defence Forces are excluded and civilian personnel are covered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The civilian employees referred to are covered by the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, which provides for the implementation of a European directive on certain aspects of the organisation of working time. Section 3 of the Act provides for its non-application to, among others, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Defence Act, military personnel are liable at all times to render military service.  Therefore, the application to the Defence Forces of legislation relating to the organisation of working time would be contrary to the principle of military service and would have fundamental organisational and operational implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces are given adequate rest periods following or during occasions when long hours of duty may be necessary. In this regard, rest periods and sleep periods are often availed of during periods of extended hours of duty. In addition, the Defence Forces have a very flexible and generous system of leave granting, time-off and &ldquo;days resting off&rdquo; which reflects and caters for the uniqueness of military life.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that existing arrangements and conditions relating to time off and monetary compensation take full cognisance of the nature and requirements of military service and that application of the Organisation of Working Time Act to the Defence Forces would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to Coolmoney House. Reports by military engineering and safety personnel in recent years indicated that the house was structurally unsound and a major hazard and demolition was accordingly recom<Col N="1550" /> mended. The cost of restoring the house was assessed by the corps of engineers as in the region of £1 million. I was satisfied that the expenditure of such an amount from public funds would not be justifiable. The house was not a listed building and was not subject to preservation on a statutory basis. Accordingly, arrangements were initiated with a view to the placing of a contract to demolish the property.</P>
      <P>An Taisce and The Irish Landmark Trust were each afforded an opportunity to visit the site in March last and assess for themselves the circumstances surrounding the Department's proposal to undertake the demolition of the property. On completion of the consultation process to the satisfaction of both bodies the demolition contract was proceeded with and the work was completed in August last.</P>

I am advised by the military authorities that such equipment is adequate to provide protection from any specific DU threat.</P>
      <P>With regard to the implications for Defence Forces personnel serving overseas, standard operational procedures are in place in Kosovo which specifically prohibit members of the Irish contingent serving with KFOR from approaching any armoured fighting vehicles which have been destroyed by NATO forces and the action to be taken is &ldquo;Log, Report and Stay Away&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan (1996-98) &ndash; which was approved by Government in March 1996 &ndash; provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the first line reserve made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Force, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian/military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process, the chief of staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task. The steering group has completed its examination and on 2 September 1999 submitted a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of consideration of the draft report I do not intend to make any comment on the findings or recommendations contained in the report. As I have indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197, 208, 209, 210 and 243 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Trade Organisation's ministerial conference in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999 aims to take the decisions necessary to launch a new round of trade negotiations, including agriculture. Ireland will participate in the Seattle conference and in the subsequent negotiations as a member of the European Union. The EU has been preparing its overall position for the Seattle Conference for some time. In so far as agriculture is concerned, the General Affairs Council confirmed the position adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 that the negotiations on agriculture will be based on the mandate provided in Article 20 of the Uruguay Round Agreement on agriculture which conditions the long-term objectives of trade liberalisation by other concerns, notably the experience and effects of implementing the commitments agreed in 1994, non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system; the EU position will be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999; the EU will be prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided the concept of the &ldquo;blue and green&rdquo; boxes will continue; similar instruments to the peace clause and the special safeguard clause will be needed in the future; the EU will take forward the multifunctional role of agriculture, food safety, food quality and animal welfare, and the EU will actively promote special and differen<Col N="1553" /> tial treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries.</P>
    <P>The current GATT Agreement represented the culmination of an extremely long and complex series of negotiations and in effect was the first to contain a detailed agreement on agriculture. That agreement permitted the continuation of supports for agricultural products although providing for a gradual reduction over six years in export subsidies and certain other supports. These supports form an integral part of the Common Agricultural Policy and are essential to the maintenance of a reasonable income for Irish farmers and of the fabric of Irish rural life.</P>
    <P>The EU grants preferential access to its markets for a wide range of agricultural products from developing countries mainly through its generalised scheme of preferences and the Lomé Convention. The EU development Ministers adopted in June 1997 a resolution on the issue of coherence between the community's development co-operation and its other policies. The areas covered by this resolution include food security. In the food security area, the resolution emphasises the need to ensure that agricultural exports and food aid in kind do not damage the production and marketing capacity of developing countries. The EU also operates a code of practice, adopted in 1997, in relation to food aid, which aims to avoid any harmful effects of food aid on local production and marketing structures.</P>
    <P>I outlined my position in relation to the majority world issues, including the establishment of consultative mechanisms, in my reply to Questions Nos. 70-75 on Thursday 7 October 1999.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation at Seattle will be led by Mr. Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for international trade. My Department will be represented on the delegation.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>I understand the assessment by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs of the value of mountain ewes for the determination of eligibility for schemes operated by that Department includes both the market value of the ewe and the income from ewe premium, rural world premium and headage payments. The value of these direct payments alone are estimated at £33 for this year.</P>
      <P>I will provide any assistance which the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs may require on the question of the assessment of the value of mountain ewes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with EU and national legislation cattle born since 1996 must be properly identified, <i>inter alia</i>, by an eartag in each ear. The basis for this legislation was to provide customer assurance in regard to the traceability of an animal from birth and to ensure consumer confidence in the beef industry. It was decided at that time that an animal bearing only one plastic eartag did not provide sufficient security of identification and that an EU wide system of double tagging, each tag bearing the same unique identification number, would be used to identify every bovine animal. The legislation requires that animals presented for sale must be properly identified at all times and an animal, which is not properly identified, should not be moved from a holding. In these circumstances my Department has no alternative but to require animals presented for sale at marts which are not properly identified to be returned to the holdings of origin.</P>
      <P>Exceptionally, and in a small number of circumstances where cattle are presented for immediate slaughter at a factory and where the animal has lost a tag in transit, a veterinary inspector may permit slaughter and certification of the end product. However, this will only occur in circumstances where the other pillars of identification, namely a valid passport, birth registration presence in the on-farm herd register and a check on my Department's on-line database have been verified to ensure traceability.</P>
      <P>A recent survey carried out by my Department disclosed that the loss rate of the jumbo sized tag was less than 4 per cent. I have not been provided with any evidence to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that the test requirement for sale of bovine animals is a TB test within the previous 12 months plus a brucellosis test for female animals or bulls over one year old within the previous 30 days. Thus there should rarely be a need to retest an animal which has required a replacement tag.</P>

      <P>The applicant in question submitted 22.55 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application only 16.84 hectares were found. This represents a difference of 5.71 hectares or 33.91 per cent between the area claimed and that found on inspection. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied. Consequently a 100 per cent penalty has been applied and the herdowner has been so informed.</P>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, payment of a pension can only be authorised from the date of receipt of a valid application. The date of receipt of a valid application is the date on which all core documentation is lodged with the local farm development service office.</P>
      <P>In this case, the application for the person named was lodged in the local farm development service office on December 20 1995. On examination of the file a query arose. The officer examining the file wrote to the applicant's solicitors requesting further details in relation to this query. The requested information was sent back to the Department's inspector on 15 January 1996 and this date therefore is deemed to be the date of valid application. In the circumstances, there are no grounds for backdating the payment of the pension to the original date of application.</P>
      <P>Payments under the scheme were reduced by approximately 5.055 per cent when the Irish Punt was revalued against the EURO on 1 January this year. The Council of EU Ministers have agreed that full compensation, with 100 per cent funding by the EU, will be payable for the reduction in 1999 pensions to participants who joined the scheme prior to 1998. Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid. It is hoped that the Commission will give the necessary approval by the end of November, and once such a decision is received payment will issue as soon as possible. Two further tranches of compensation at reduced levels will be paid.</P>

      <P>Regulation 4(4) of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, provides that in the case of a sale of land to which milk quota attaches, where that sale takes place after the 31 March 1994, the milk quota so acquired shall remain attached to such land until the 31 March 2000.

      <P>The position in relation to milk quota clawback is that apart from certain specified exceptions including family transactions, inheritance, renewal of leases and certain sales clawback is applied at the rate of 20 per cent on all leases and sales.

      <P>It is a provision laid down in the EU regulations governing the scheme of early retirement from farming that an applicant be aged between 55 and 66 years on the date he or she ceases farming and must have practiced farming as a main occupation for the ten years prior to retirement. As the person named signed the legal transfer documents before his 55th birthday he could not meet these requirements. The provisions of the scheme are unambiguous in this regard and it is not possible to accept applications where they have not been met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pig producers in Ireland and throughout the EU have experienced difficulties in the past year or so mainly due to overproduction following a classical swine fever outbreak in Europe. Other contributory factors were the underperformance of traditional pigmeat markets in Japan and Russia. All of these events combined, led to lower prices for pig producers.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficulties in pig production, information available to my Department indicates that only a very small number of pig farmers have actually gone out of business. These were in the category of less than 100 sows.</P>
      <P>To alleviate the difficulties being experienced by Irish pig producers, I took a number of important initiatives. Together with my colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, I sought and obtained generous increases in export refunds from the EU Commission on a number of occasions in 1998 and in 1999, and the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme for pigmeat. This scheme, which recently concluded, removed over 420,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market. The Commisssion also introduced a food aid programme for Russia which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. To date 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been exported from the EU under the programme to Russia.</P>
      <P>While the above measures have improved market prices since the beginning of this year, there is still a need for further improvement. In that regard, last week I wrote to the EU Commission urgently seeking the restoration of high refund rates to Russia and the speedy conclusion of the food aid programme. I also requested the Commission to introduce proposals for long-term measures to assist the pigmeat sector, such as supply control, something which the Commission was asked by Council to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> Recently, a meeting was held between my Department and the major pig processors to discuss the market situation. The processors were urged to do everything possible to improve the prices currently being paid to their producers. My Department has also met with representatives from Enterprise Ireland and has asked them to examine the issue of slaughtering capacity and whether there were other aspects of the industry requiring attention and possible investment. An Bord Bia recently launched the autumn campaign of its quality assured bacon scheme. This will no doubt lead to an increase in consumption and thus help market prices to rise.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the pigmeat market is good. The EU Commission is forecasting a drop in supplies in the last quarter of this year, and this coupled with increased demand for the Christmas period should help to give pig producers a much needed boost in prices. I will continue to use every means at my disposal to ensure that everything possible is done at EU level to bring this about in a way which improves the situation for pig producers.</P>

This represents a difference of 0.44 hectares or 4.52 per cent between the area claimed and that found on inspection. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied.

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255, 256, 257, 259 and 260 together.</P>
    <P>The number of transactions, broken down between sales and leases which have been subject to clawback since 1996 are set out as follows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> My Department does not maintain records in relation to clawback in such form which would provide a breakdown of the cases in which clawback was applied based on quota size. All milk quota acquired through the application of the clawback measure is added to the national reserve. Allocations from that reserve are made from the total pool and are not related in any way to how these quantities were taken into the reserve.</P>
    <P>Apart from family transactions exemption from clawback is provided for in cases of inheritance, renewals of existing land leases and certain sales. No clawback applies in the case of any sale of land where a lease of that land has not yet expired and where the purchaser of that land is either the original lessee and where there is no change in the operation/possession of the land in question or a person who has become entitled to the lessee's interest by way of inheritance.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>when payment of area aid in respect of 1998 and 1999 will be made to a person (details supplied) in County Mayo.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21630/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a problem on the area aid application of the person named in 1998 because two parcels claimed by this person were also being claimed by another herdowner. Maps issued to both herdowners and the person named confirmed that he was not entitled to claim the parcel concerned. The result was that an eligible area of 40.01 hectares was found, and not the 45.25 hectares that the applicant had claimed. This represents a difference of 5.24 hectares or 13.10 per cent between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 <Col N="1575" /> per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied. Therefore, payments were calculated on an area of 29.53 hectares.</P>
    <P>The applicant in question submitted 45.14 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application only 41.14 hectares were determined. This represents a difference of 4.00 hectares or 9.72 per cent between the area claimed and that found on inspection. In this case, therefore, the area determined is 33.14 hectares.</P>
    <P>The person named was paid £2,856 under the 1998 cattle headage scheme on 10 December 1998. He received an advance of £3,702.07 under the 1998 suckler cow scheme on 3 December 1998, and the balance of £925.52 on 3 February 1999. Payment of £950.23 under the 1998 extensification scheme was made to him on 8 June 1999. Because of the overclaim of 5.24 hectares or 13.10 per cent between the area claimed on his 1998 area aid application, and that found at inspection, his area was reduced by twice the difference found, and his forage area for the purposes of calculating his livestock payments is 29.53 hectares. His 1998 cattle headage grant of £2,856 was based on a forage area of 44.01 hectares. In accordance with clause 27 of the terms and conditions governing the 1998 cattle headage scheme, an applicant qualifying for headage grants may not receive in respect of such grants more than £89.62 per forage hectare. As the person named now has 29.53 hectares eligible forage area, the most he can be paid is £2,646.47 under 1998 cattle headage grants. Consequently he was overpaid £209.52, and my Department will be writing to him shortly in this regard.</P>
    <P>The person named applied on 34 cows under the 1999 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes. At an inspection carried out on 30 July 1999, one of the animals was found to have lost its eartags, another animal was absent, and four of the animals applied on as cows were found to be maiden heifers. As maiden heifers are not eligible under the suckler cow premium scheme, and are not eligible for high rate of grant under the cattle headage scheme, he was written to on 22 October 1999 advising him that he would not be receiving payment under the 1999 cattle headage or the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme. He has been given the opportunity to appeal this decision by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wishes to put forward to support his case. Any such appeal will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Payment of the 1999 cattle headage grant was made to the person named on 30 September 1999. Grants under the sheep headage scheme are based, <i>inter alia</i>, on the forage area and classification of grazings available in the disadvantaged area as indicated on an applicant's 1999 area aid form. In this case the person named applied on 68 mountain ewes and according to area aid records the forage area available is classified as lowland grazings only. Therefore, the person named is not eligible for any payment under the scheme. Payment of the first and second advance of the 1999 ewe premium scheme was made to the person named on 11 June 1999 and 20 October 1999 respectively. The person named was not an applicant under the 1999 suckler cow scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if a framework document has been finalised for a particular commonage in County Mayo in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; if so, the stocking requirement in this regard; and if the herd owners affected will be individually notified in particular in relation to the case of a person (details supplied).</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The commonage framework plan for the particular commonage referred to has been finalised. The detailed plan has established that a destocking requirement of 81 per cent is necessary to allow for the regeneration of the commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that cross-compliance will apply when detailed framework plans are completed in respect of all commonages in the six western counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. It is the Department's intention to notify farmers in due course that in order to be entitled to ewe premium or sheep headage those with commonage land in the counties concerned must join REPS or the national scheme to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In the meantime, under the provisions of a national interim commonage framework plan, a 30 per cent reduction in sheep is required. As detailed framework plans are completed for individual commonages the destocking levels required <Col N="1577" /> under those plans are applicable to farmers who apply to join REPS. Farmers already participating in REPS will have their existing REPS plans revised to reflect the destocking required under completed detailed commonage framework plans.</P>

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will qualify for the proposed payment of £35 per ewe for the cull ewe scheme, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in spite of the fact he is a REP scheme applicant and he disposed of his ewes before joining the REP scheme.</Quest>

      <P>As the person named was not participating in the REP scheme at the time of the introduction of the ewe supplementary measure in 1998 he was obliged to cull 30 per cent of his flock under the latter scheme. He should therefore be entitled to compensatory payments under a scheme proposed by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. That Department is currently awaiting approval for this scheme by the EU Commission following which it hopes to make payments at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <P>The definitive legal test for bovine tuberculosis under EU legislation is the single intradermal tuberculin test and animals that fail this test are punched and tagged as reactor animals and removed for slaughter. The fact that an animal does not show visible lesions on slaughter does not mean that TB is not present. Research has shown that if detailed post-mortem procedures, including histopathological examination and culture of multiple glands and organs, were carried out, most reactors would be confirmed with tuberculosis. However, the expense of these extra tests would far exceed the benefit of the knowledge obtained.</P>

      <P>The person named applied under the 1999 sheep headage and ewe premium schemes. At an inspection carried out on 7 April 1999, part of the flock was found at undeclared grazings, the person named failed when requested by the inspector to provide documentary evidence of sales and purchases, and the sheep register was not kept up-to-date. He was written to on 1 October 1999 and advised that under clauses 9(v) and 15(c) of the 1999 sheep headage scheme and clause 3(v) and 3(vi) of the 1999 ewe premium scheme he would not receive any payments under those schemes. He has been given the opportunity to appeal this decision by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wishes to put forward to support his case. Any such appeal will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 295 together.</P>
      <P>As required under EU Directives and in accordance with national procurement guidelines, a tender competition for the printing of the new primary school curriculum and teacher guidelines was advertised in the EU Journal on Wednesday 30 March 1999 and in the national newspapers on the same day. Six valid tenders were received, four from within the State, one from Northern Ireland and one from Italy.</P>
      <P>All these tenders were assessed by the Government Supplies Agency on the basis of the award criteria which were published in the tender documentation. The tender from Mozzon-Giuntina SPA, Italy proved to be the most economically advantageous and, accordingly, the print contract was awarded to them.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all EU and national procurement competition requirements were adhered to in this case and that the best value for money outcome was achieved.</P>

      <P>Environmental taxes include taxes on energy and I assume the Deputy is mainly referring to the proposed EU Directive on the Taxation of Energy Products, which continues to be the subject of EU discussion. If this is the case, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 4 on 24 June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has expressed concerns on a number of occasions about the proposed directive. Our <Col N="1584" /> concerns relate to our peripheral status, the greater dispersal of population which adds to transport costs and the need to maintain competitiveness in the EU versus third countries. My particular concern as Minister for Finance is to ensure that any measures advanced to promote energy saving does not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have very low taxes on energy. I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of any such energy tax would have on the consumer price index and how increased tax and new taxes would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>
    <P>However, I have also made it clear that Ireland does not wish to hold back the remainder of the community. Therefore, we will be working with the Finnish Presidency to make every effort to reach some agreement on this issue, bearing in mind my previous comments with regard to competitiveness and any adverse effects on the consumer price index and the less well off. The proposed directive has been discussed on a number of occasions at ECOFIN, but no measure of agreement has been reached.</P>
    <P>Ireland has for several years sought to develop tax measures which are environmentally driven, including the new higher rate of vehicle registration tax introduced last year. As I said in my December 1998 Budget Statement, we need to put in place an agreed indirect tax policy which will assist us in formulating a green tax policy. Such a policy needs the support of all sections of the community as represented by the social partners. The formulation of such agreed policy, in my view, would be part of the discussions on the successor to Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The person in question was a member of the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees. As in the case of the generality of public sector occupational pension schemes whose members pay the full rate of PRSI and are therefore entitled to the full range of social welfare benefits, the non-established pension scheme specifically provides for the integration of the occupational pension with social welfare benefits. The effect of integration in the case of a person with full service is to provide that the sum of the scheme pension and the person's social welfare entitlement corresponds to the pension payable under a non-integrated pension scheme to a public servant in modified PRSI retiring on the same day.</P>
      <P>Since the person in question retired before the age of 65 years at which he could qualify for a social welfare retirement pension, the initial rate of occupational pension awarded under the non-established scheme was greater than that which would have been payable to him if he had attained age 65 on the date of retirement. Accordingly, when the person concerned reached 65 years, the rate of scheme pension was changed to take account of the fact that he was now entitled to a higher rate of social welfare payment. I would point out that, if the scheme did not provide for such adjustments, a person retiring at age 65 would receive lesser total benefits than a person with the same service who retires before that age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances and, because of this, an interdepartmental working group was set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. This group has recently published its report and was, as a whole, sympathetic in principle, to changes in tax legislation to address certain issues relating to cohabiting couples. In this regard the report of the group outlines a number of options relating to cohabiting couples for the Government to consider in the context of the forthcoming budget 2000 deliberations.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the treatment of cohabiting couples within the capital acquisitions tax code, I indicated to the Dáil, earlier in the year in the course of the Finance Bill debate, that I appreciate the concerns which have been raised. I am aware of the tax burden facing certain individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the family home. At that stage, I undertook in the Dáil that prior to the next budget, I would examine the capital acquisitions tax code in some detail. This examination is currently taking place.</P>
      <P>The forecasted yield for 1999 from inheritance tax alone is about £83 million. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the tax must be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing, <Col N="1589" /> is for a period of not less than seven years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, qualifying lessee specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendent. The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale. For all these reasons, I do not propose to provide an exemption from income tax from a farm land lease entered into between related persons whether for the purposes of the early retirement scheme or generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>A milk quota is viewed as a non-wasting capital asset, subject to the capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax codes. If expenditure on the purchase of milk quotas was allowed as a deductible expense for income tax purposes, the logical outcome would be that the proceeds from the sale of a quota should be treated as income and therefore liable for income tax. At present, the proceeds are treated as a capital receipt and are subject to capital gains tax which can give much more favourable tax treatment because of indexation relief and other reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals before me to change this tax position. However, arising from the recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development my Department will meet officials from that Department to see if <Col N="1591" /> there are any tax implications from the changes to the management of the quota regime.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the sense of grievance of many workers who have a vehicle supplied by their employers for their work and have to pay benefit-in-kind as a result; the plans, if any, he has to reduce this tax imposition on such workers; and the reason Government Ministers and others with State cars do not have to pay benefit-in-kind.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law governing benefit-in-kind in respect of company cars is set out in section 121 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Where an employee is given a car by his or her employer the availability of the car for private use is regarded as a benefit-in-kind and is subject to taxation as such. The value of the benefit is assessed and charged to income tax at the taxpayer's marginal rate as if the amount of the assessment were paid by the employer in cash. Reliefs are available where the employee pays certain expenses relating to the car. In addition, where business mileage exceeds 15,000 miles per annum, the value of the benefit is reduced by the tapering relief for business mileage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefit of a car for private use can be considerable. I consider that it would be unfair on taxpayers who do not receive this benefit from <Col N="1592" /> their employer to charge the benefit to tax at less than its full value.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that in the case of State cars for Ministers and others no benefit for private use is charged as they are obliged to travel in such cars for security reasons.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the extreme difficulties being experienced by people running small business or sole traders as a result of the demands from the Revenue Commissioners for tax to be paid up to April 2000 in view of the fact their earnings only relate to nine months work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the payment of income tax by the self-employed, under the self assessment system. Basically, the system involves the payment of preliminary tax by 1 November each year; the filing of the return of income by 31 January after the end of the relevant tax year; and the payment of any balance of tax due &ndash; over and above preliminary tax &ndash; by 30 April following the return filing date.</P>
      <P>The self-employed taxpayer has three options as regards how much preliminary tax he or she should pay without being exposed to an interest charge.</P>
      <P>Under the first option, a payment equal to at least 90 per cent the estimated tax for the current year. Under the second option, a payment equal to 100 per cent of the previous year's liability. This is the most frequently used option. The third option involves payment by direct debit, where the payments are spread in equal instalments from May to the following April. Total payments equal to 105 per cent of the preceding years liability can be used as an additional payment option when paying by direct debit.</P>
      <P>If the correct amount of preliminary tax is not paid or is paid late, the taxpayer is liable to an interest charge of 1 per cent per month or 12 per cent per annum. This rate of interest is set at a level to encourage the highest degree of compliance. The charging of interest on late payment or insufficient payment of preliminary tax also ensures equity with the PAYE sector and avoids a situation where the taxpayer who fails to meet their preliminary tax obligations enjoy an advantage in their trading activities over the majority of self-employed taxpayers who pay the correct amount of tax on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the preliminary tax requirements are extensively published and that each taxpayer under the self-assessment system is advised of those requirements. I am satisfied that the criteria for the payment of preliminary tax is reasonable and <Col N="1593" /> is discharged in an effective manner by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309, 337 and 348 together.</P>
      <P>Statistical information on the number of people with an intellectual disability in Ireland is provided by the National Intellectual Disability Database. The first report of the database was published in 1996, at which time the total number of people on the database was 26,664.</P>
      <P>The preliminary 1998 data has identified an increase of 1,346 persons, from 26,664 in 1996 to 28,040, in the overall number of persons on the database. The data also indicates an increase in the numbers of persons who have been identified as requiring residential and-or day services. Some 2,530 persons in total will require a major element of service over the next five years. This represents an increase of 171 persons over similar data in 1996.</P>
      <P>The number of additional places required over the period in question, 1999 to 2003, to meet these needs are 1,673 residential places and 952 day places. When the additional placements coming on stream in 1999 have been taken into account, there is a balance of approximately 1,353 residential and 752 day places to be provided.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, was provided for these services. This funding is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>While the additional services which have been put in place have made a significant difference, their impact on the waiting lists has been reduced because of the numbers of emergency admissions which have been and continue to be made to the residential services.</P>
      <P>In allocating the additional funding provided for new services last year, I asked health boards to begin to put in place measures to enable them to manage emergency cases. The boards were requested to develop these measures even further this year. Most health boards have now set aside funding to assist with the cost of emergency admissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence of both my commitment, and that of the Government, to the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability is clearly demonstrated by the level of additional funding, £53 million up to the end of 1999, increasing to £59 million in 2000, which has been <Col N="1595" /> made available to these services since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>While as I have already stated, this additional funding has made a significant impact, the accelerated provision of further additional resources for these services remains one of my priorities. I am currently pursuing the provision of this funding in the context of the Estimates process for 2000 and the national development plan. I am confident that the Government's budgetary measures for the coming year will have due regard to the levels of need which have been identified.</P>

The report contains statistics in relation to foreign adoptions since 1991. There are two distinct arrangements in relation to the adoption of children from outside the State, either they are adopted in the country of origin and their adoptions recognised under the Adoption Act, 1991, in this case, the adoption is entered in the register of foreign adoptions under the Adoption Act, 1991; or alternatively, the children may be placed with the couple in the country of origin and an adoption order is made in Ireland, under either the Adoption Act, 1952 (Principal Act) or the Adoption Act, 1988.</P>

      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been re-evaluated frequently in many international studies since 1950 and I am not aware of any reputable studies, including any studies of recent origin, which suggest that fluoridation of public piped water supplies at optimum level would be inadvisable.</P>
      <P>A report dated October 1999 on water fluoridation and public health prepared by the Faculty of Public Health Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is strongly supportive of the continuation of current water fluoridation policies. My Department continues to monitor ongoing research into the safety of water fluoridation and keeps in touch with discussion in this area at an international level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313, 314, 343, 352, 386 and 391 together.</P>
      <P>Home support services, which include personal assistance services, are part of a range of services provided by health boards to enable people with physical disabilities to achieve the maximum degree of independence. This range of services also includes respite care, day care and therapy services. My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the availability of funding.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the report of the review group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, priorities for the allocation of available funding for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have allocated a total of £38.162 million additional funding for the maintenance and development of services, including personal assistance services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Out of the £3 million provided for development of these services in 1998, £596,000 was allocated by the health boards to home support services, including personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>A personal assistance service is provided by the centres for independent living through the use of the FÁS community employment scheme. FÁS services are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 319 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related support services to schoolgoing children with autism is the responsibility in the first instance of the health boards. I understand this school, although located in the Eastern Health Board region, provides services to children from within the Midland Health Board region. An official from the Eastern Health Board outreach team has attended the school on a number of occasions to assist in an individual case. At a meeting with representatives of the Midland Health Board on 17 September 1999, the co-ordinator of the Eastern Health Board's services discussed the model of service provision used within that board. It was also agreed that the Midland Health Board would be responsible for the provision of health related support services for the children attending Scoil Mhichil Naofa from their region.</P>
      <P>Fifty thousand pounds was allocated to the Midland Health Board in 1999, with a full year cost of £150,000 in 2000, for the further development of health related support services to school going children with autism. The board is in the process of expanding the level of multi-disciplinary support available to children with autism arising from the allocation of this additional funding. The further development of these services in 2000 by the board will be examined in the context of the level of funding which may be made available to it next year.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.

The operation of the scheme is primarily a matter for the relevant health board and information on the operation of the scheme with regard to the provision of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension arising from diabetes has been sought from each health board. I will communicate directly with the Deputies when comprehensive information is to hand from all health board areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317, 318, 333, 338, 355, 357, 373, 378, 388 and 394 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland.</P>
      <P>EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions. The directive does not make any distinction between conventional medicines and those medicinal products containing ingredients which may be described as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;herbal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, in its recent guidelines on the interpretation of the EU definition of a medicinal product, has revised and updated the similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. The policy in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products, including &lsquo;natural' medicinal products, has not changed in any significant way.</P>
      <P>If a product placed on the market includes a medicinal claim, the product concerned becomes a medicinal product and should be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board under the Medicinal Product (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998. These regulations give effect in this country to the EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC. Before the board may grant an authorisation, it must first be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. In the case of unlicensed products that may be available on the market, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Products containing the herb hypericum perforatum, St. John's Wort, are medicinal products and, as such, must be the subject of product authorisations from the Irish Medicines Board in order that they may be lawfully placed on the market in this country. The decision by the board to recommend that products containing St. John's Wort should be placed on medical prescription was taken following appropriate medical assessment by the board. This was subsequently advised <Col N="1602" /> to my Department. A number of reasons has been given by the board for its recommendation. These include the fact that the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs. These products must, therefore, be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients, therefore, may be at risk from hypertension, increased blood pressure, if these products were to be taken with certain other antidepressants, over-the-counter cough mixtures, sympathomimetics, and with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. Furthermore, the board has expressed concern at the possible treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self-diagnosis and self-medication are inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The placing of any medicinal product under prescription-only control is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by both consumers and representative organisations regarding the decision to place products containing St. John's Wort under prescription-only control and I would like to assure the Deputies that it is not my intention to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of appropriate medicines which they may wish to use. However, it is generally accepted that in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of &lsquo;alternative medicines' is desirable and this view is supported in principle by the health food and alternative medicines industry. In this respect, the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to &lsquo;health food' products and &lsquo;natural' medicines, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of alternative or traditional medicines, but no definitive proposals have been brought forward at this stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to certain homeopathic medicinal products, the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, also contain provisions for a simplified registration procedure as required by Council Directive 92/73/EEC. Under these simplified arrangements, while quality and safety must be established, evidence of product efficacy is not required in order to obtain registration for placing on the market.</P>

The income guidelines for persons aged 70 to 79 and persons aged 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.   </P>
      <P>People who are not entitled to a medical card can avail of the new drug payment scheme whereby individuals or families need only pay the first £42 per month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. This scheme is not means tested and is open to all non-medical card holders.</P>

Waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are maintained by the health boards and my Department does not have available to it information pertaining to the waiting lists in the detail requested by the Deputy.

    <P>The tables indicate a pure variance based on the original determination. As explained below, the determinations fall to be adjusted due to expenditure incurred on items covered by the Supplementary Estimate. The variances will be removed or significantly reduced by these pending adjustments.</P>
    <P>In relation to the variances recorded by health boards, significant funding is due on foot of those items eligible for adjustment by way of Supplementary Estimate, i.e., demand-led community drug schemes, superannuation and PRSI expenditure. In the case of voluntary hospitals, similar adjustments will be due to agencies. In particular, St James's Hospital is anticipating funding for blood products i.e., Factor VIII and IX recombinant blood.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that each board is obliged to maintain its expenditure within the agreed <Col N="1605" /> determination, under the provisions of the accountability legislation. This legislation is applied to the voluntary hospitals on an administrative basis. It is expected that by the end of the year agencies' budgets and expenditure will be realigned with service plans.</P>

Pressures, which arise as a result of fluctuations in the demand for services or staff shortages, are normally addressed by short periods of overtime.

      <P>The Government has decided to develop a national children's strategy to position child and youth related issues more centrally and more explicitly in public policy development and decision making in a more co-ordinated way. The strategy will also seek to build on the efforts of statutory, voluntary and community agencies in a renewed commitment to develop more child focused services. It will address the needs of children and young people up to the age of 18, with special regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is intended to publish the strategy next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime to improve cross departmental co-operation on child care issues a team, drawn from the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, under the direction of a principal officer from my Department, has been established.</P>
      <P>The issues surrounding child poverty and the provision of services for disadvantaged children are of major concern to this Government which has introduced a range of initiatives to promote the welfare of children and strengthen family support services. These include the launching of the springboard and youth homelessness initiatives, the further development of services under the Child Care Act, 1991, and the introduction of the Children Bill this year.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, the Government established the young people at risk programme, which has at its centre the young people's facilities and services fund. The Exchequer is contributing £30 million to the fund over three years to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas. I was given approval by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion to spend £7.2 million to establish the springboard initiatives under which 15 pilot projects for children at risk have been set up. These projects are designed to strengthen co-ordination and co-operation between statutory and voluntary agencies in providing services for vulnerable children, who are at risk of going into care or engaging in anti-social behaviour, and their families.</P>
      <P>I have also established teenage parenting support projects in Galway, Limerick and Dublin to identify single young parents who are deemed medium risk at ante-natal stage. Once identified, it is proposed to provide a range of necessary support services through pregnancy and beyond for the mother and her child.</P>

    <P>The Government recently announced the development of a strategy to address youth homelessness which will involve the public and private sectors in a joint initiative to develop a more strategic and planned approach to ensure that no child is homeless. In addition, a Forum on Youth Homelessness has now been established in <Col N="1608" /> the Eastern Health Board region with representation from the key voluntary organisations, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million was allocated to the Eastern Health Board this year for a special initiative involving the voluntary sector, to tackle homelessness. The initiative will further develop services such as an after care service; a day reception programme and transitional care for homeless girls. A crash pad facility for homeless young people with serious behavioural or drug problems is also being developed with the co-operation of the public, private and voluntary sector and is due to come on stream in 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition the Government recently published the Children Bill. While this mainly deals with issues concerning juvenile justice, it also provides a statutory basis for the provision of services for children with behavioural difficulties. It provides for the establishment of family welfare conference, which health boards will be obliged to convene where a child in its area may require special care or protection. The conference will provide a system for the early identification of children at risk and a means of providing support and assistance for the child and his or her family through inter-agency intervention.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure including the financing and resourcing implications of its implementation. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. The Government established an interdepartmental committee on childcare chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the Report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. The report of the committee has been noted by Government who have referred the report for consideration to a ministerial group.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.26 million is being provided by the health boards towards the service in 1999. The number of places currently funded is 7,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>Other relevant initiatives include a Social Services Inspectorate which was recently established. Initially the inspectorate will concentrate on the child care area but in the longer term its remit will extend to all the social services. The main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the <Col N="1609" /> development of quality standards in the personal social services. Also, the appointment of an ombudsman for children has been identified as a priority and will be a crucial mechanism in vindicating children's rights in this country.</P>
    <P>The incidence of child poverty is a particular concern of this Government and successive budget measures, along with targeted policy initiatives, have sought to ensure that our children are protected and given the opportunities to break an inter-generational cycle of poverty.</P>
    <P>The latest ESRI figures from the Living in Ireland survey show that the percentage of children experiencing consistent poverty fell from 18-23 per cent in 1994 to 15-17 per cent in 1997, while the numbers living in households below the 50 per cent relative income line fell from 29 per cent in 1994 to 24 per cent in 1997. This reduction in child poverty is largely attributable to falling unemployment levels which have enabled many families to release themselves from dependency on social welfare payments and improve their incomes. Under this Government, there have been further record increases in employment. The unemployment rate for the period March to May 1999, the latest figures available, was 5.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>At the launch of the first annual report of the national anti-poverty strategy's inter-departmental policy committee in June, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs announced that the Government had asked the committee to consider setting targets in relation to particular groups such as children in poverty. Discussions are still at a very early stage and it must be recognised that child poverty is a complex problem, the alleviation of which requires policy responses on a number of fronts. The preparation of a national children's strategy will form a major input into this process.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs also has a major role in regard to this issue. One of the central means by which child poverty can be tackled is child benefit. The link between the risk of poverty and family size has been firmly established and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affair's provision of income support in respect of children plays a crucial role in combating the incidence of child poverty. Child benefit channels resources directly to families and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is universal, not taxable and not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget provided for child benefit increases of £3 per month to £34.50 for each of the first two children and £4 per month to £46 for the third and all subsequent children. Some 523,000 families with a total of 1.2 million children have benefited from these increases. The full year cost of these increases is £40.76 million and the total projected spend on child benefit in 1999 is £446 million. In addition, the 1999 budget pro<Col N="1610" /> vided for an increase in the family income supplement threshold of £8 per week which, alongside last year's introduction of FIS calculation on a net income basis, means that thousands of families are better off as a result.</P>
    <P>Another key factor in combating the incidence of poverty, including child poverty, relates to the adequacy of the payments made under the various schemes. Increases in the 1999 budget mean that all social welfare payments have now reached or exceeded the minimum level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The range of measures outlined above reflects the Government's multidimensional approach to tackling child poverty. The Government will continue in its efforts in this regard and will bring forward further initiatives and a framework for better co-ordination and integration of services to children in the context of the national children's strategy.</P>

These services are co-ordinated and expanded in consultation with the Regional Intellectual Disability Co-ordinating Committee and the Regional Physical and Sensory Disability Co-ordinating Committee, in line with the priority needs which have been identified for their regions by these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical <Col N="1611" /> And Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.

Additional speech and language therapy posts have been put in place in recent years in both the intellectual disability and physical and sensory disability services as a result of the additional funding allocated in recent years to these services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association's budget 2000 submission calls for additional revenue funding totalling £32 million to be made available for the provision of additional residential respite places, day resource centres, personal assistance services and the introduction of a cost of disability payment scheme.</P>
      <P>Since this Government took office in 1997 a total of £38.162 million additional funding has been provided for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In line with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, this funding has mainly been allocated to address historical deficits in the voluntary sector, to address identified core underfunding of existing services and to develop a number of services such as respite, residential, home support, including personal assistance, day care, therapy services and sheltered employment. Once-off funding has also been provided for the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1997 and 1998, a total of £2.762 million has been provided for respite and residential services; £841,000 for day activity-day resource services and £902,000 for home support services, <Col N="1612" /> including personal assistance services. This year capital funding of £457,000 is being provided for respite and residential services and £1.477 million for day activity, day resource services. The allocation of development funding provided to the health boards in 1999, £3 million, with a full year cost of £6 million in the year 2000, is being finalised by a number of the boards in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Since 1997, an additional 87 respite care places and 46 residential places have been put in place. It is my policy to continue to develop these services in the context of additional funding which may become available for physical and sensory disability services.</P>
    <P>The costs of disability payment is one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The implementation of the commission's recommendations has been under examination by an interdepartmental task force and the costs of disability payment is one of the items under consideration. A progress report is being drawn up by the task force.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of health services, including <Col N="1613" /> equipment such as wheelchairs, in the Kilkenny area is a matter in the first instance for the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has indicated that all requests of this kind are referred to the occupational therapy department where they are dealt with according to the level of risk to the client and carer. Those deemed as very high risk are seen within four to six weeks. The board has indicated that, because of the difficulty in recruiting occupational therapists, it may take some time before those not deemed as high risk are assessed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case to which the Deputy refers, I am advised that a request for a wheelchair was received from the applicant's GP in July 1999 and the referral indicated that the applicant was mobile and did not require a wheelchair full time. In light of this, the applicant was not prioritised for assessment by the occupational therapist. However, if there is any change in the condition of the applicant, she should contact the South-Eastern Health Board directly.</P>

      <P>The matter is also under continuing discussion at the Labour Relations Commission and the Health Service Employers Agency has met with the unions representing the home helps.

      <P>As a first step in this direction, I have facilitated the health boards through additional resources to bring the minimum rate of payment, for all home helps up to £3.00 per hour from 1 April last. This is part of a phased improvement in the rate of payment for home helps, the remaining phases of which I hope to implement as resources permit.</P>

        <Col N="1615" /> While new additional services specifically for persons with autism have been and will continue to be developed, many persons with autism are in receipt of services within the intellectual disability services. These people have benefited generally from the development of new residential, respite and day services which have been substantially enhanced in recent years and which will continue to be developed over the coming years. In 1999, for example, additional funding amounting to £2.5 million was allocated for the further enhancement of health related support services, including early intervention services.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, which includes the £2.5 million mentioned above, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, was provided for services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. This funding is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in my Department's policy document on autism, published in 1994, has been and will continue to be included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with an intellectual disability and autism in their regions.</P>

      <P>I am aware that all of the health boards and the voluntary agencies which provide services to children with disabilities endeavoured to maintain as many of the services as possible open during the recent nurses dispute. To this end they worked in co-operation with the local strike committees, not only to manage those services which continued to operate, but also to monitor the position in relation to those individuals whose access to residential, day or respite services was affected by the dispute.</P>
      <P>I have asked the health boards to let me have details of any additional supports which were provided over the period in question and I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is provided to me.</P>
      <P>On the question of an increase in the domiciliary care allowance, the Deputy will be aware that in June 1999 the DCA was increased from £106.70 to £111.20 per month. I have no plans for a further increase in the allowance in the immediate future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, medical card holders receive their medicines from community pharmacies under the general medical services scheme, GMS. The exception would be medical card holders living in rural areas without a community pharmacy who receive their medicines directly from their general practitioner, known as a dispensing doctor. There have been no changes to the list of medicines available under the general medical services scheme, other than the usual updating on a monthly basis. Medicines available under the GMS scheme are available to medical card holders free of charge. If the Deputy is aware of any situation where a medical card patient has been <Col N="1617" /> charged for a GMS medicine, I would be happy to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that the new drug payment scheme is in place to assist people who are not eligible for a medical card with the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The new scheme replaced the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes on 1 July 1999 and has a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit. The new scheme effectively merges the best elements of the two previous schemes and is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies to meet the needs of patients and is subject to ongoing review and updating on a monthly basis.</P>

      <P>I have indicated in previous replies to questions and to motions on Adjournment debates about domiciliary care allowance, that following receipt of a number of inquiries about the qualifying age for this allowance, I arranged for the matter to be examined. I have provided full information on the findings of this examination in such replies. <Col N="1619" /> The outcome of the examination concluded that best international practice recognises the additional care required for children with a disability under two years of age. Very often it is not simply a matter of care but the kind and intensity of the care required. While the international experience varies in the type of and eligibility for schemes, the underlying trend is to offer some support to children under two years of age.</P>
      <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that I support these conclusions. It is in this context that officials from my department are discussing the possibility of funding being sourced for the extension of DCA in the Estimates for year 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations made pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, allow insurers discretion to impose waiting periods on the payment of benefit in respect of persons taking out insurance cover. This is a normal feature of health insurance business and is of particular relevance to insurers in circumstances where they are obliged to operate on the basis of community rating and open enrolment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the consumer interest, the regulations set down maximum waiting periods which must not be exceeded by insurers. In the normal course, insurers have discretion to apply maximum initial waiting periods of relatively short duration, 26 weeks and 52 weeks, depending on whether the person is under or over 55 years at the time of joining, respectively. However, in relation to any person with a pre-existing medical condition taking out health insurance for the first time, or after a break in membership of 13 weeks or more, insurers are entitled to apply specified waiting periods in relation to claims arising from that particular condition. The maximum waiting periods are five years under age 55, seven years from age 55 to under age 60 and ten years from age 60 to under age 65. My Department has ascertained from the VHI that when a member breaks his or her cover for a significant period, he or she is subject to the standard waiting periods on rejoining. It is understood that the VHI does, however, look at each case on an individual basis and that a number of factors are taken into consideration when decisions are made to alter the standard waiting periods. In the case raised by the Deputy the VHI decided to impose a three year waiting <Col N="1620" /> period rather than the permitted maximum of five years.</P>
    <P>It is entirely up to individual insurers as to the waiting periods, if any, they decide to impose, subject to the maximum periods set out in the regulations. These regulations apply to all health insurers operating here and it would not be appropriate for me to dictate to any particular insurer either the rules they should make generally in this area of activity or the waiting periods that should apply in the case of any individual.</P>
    <P>All persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are entitled to avail of health services as public patients. It is therefore open to the person referred to by the Deputy to obtain treatment as a public patient.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to extend the national breast screening programme to cover the entire country; and details of this programme undertaken to date.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, my predecessor announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two central units located at St. Vincent's Hospital and at the Mater Hospital, where <Col N="1624" /> the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the national breast screening board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas. My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and the importance of ensuring that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. I am very aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors, the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population, the ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and the availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, I announced the start up date of the programme as October 1999 and I am pleased to say that this target date has been met. The planning and design of both centres is almost complete and I understand that consent letters will be issued to women shortly on a batch basis. The essential staff to commence the high quality programme have now been recruited. State of the art equipment and an information technology system have also been purchased. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>My Department is very conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. For this reason, I have requested the National Cancer Forum to undertake a review of symptomatic breast cancer services at national level prior to the commencement of phase I of the national breast screening programme and to report back to the Department as soon as possible in the matter.</P>
    <P>In tandem with this, my Department recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The key concern is <Col N="1625" /> to ensure that all women, irrespective of age or where they live have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mammographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensuring that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>

    <P>In relation to seating for older persons in the garden of Brú Chaoimhín, I am advised that, in the last year an ornamental garden, including a fountain, pathway and seating has been provided in front of the main building for use by the resi<Col N="1627" /> dents and guests. In addition, some individual seating is available in the main grounds of the home for the use of patients and visitors, but due to the inclement weather, is taken inside for storage in the winter months. This seating will be relocated in the grounds in the coming summer when it is planned to augment it with additional bench type seating.</P>
    <P>The board has assured me that, in relation to maintenance and equipment replacement, the management of Brú Chaoimhín is fully committed to maintain and continue the programme of work in the home to ensure that Brú Chaoimhín is a home from home for the older population of south Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the recent report Towards a Standardised Framework of Assessment Procedures in Inter-country Adoption has been part of the Government's recognition of, and response to, the delays being experienced in the provision of adoption assessments for couples throughout the country. I referred in detail in the House on 19 October last to the context of the commissioning of the consultancy study on inter-country adoption assessment; the Government decision following the completion of the report; and the ongoing developments in relation to the inter-country adoption services arising from the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report outlines the increase in interest in inter-country adoption since the late 1980s and the resultant increase in the number of couples <Col N="1629" /> seeking declarations of suitability from the Adoption Board which will allow them to adopt abroad. The number of declarations granted in 1998 was 206 compared with four in 1991. The assessment itself is carried out by the appropriate health board or adoption agency on behalf of the Adoption Board. Clearly, an increase of this magnitude has stretched existing resources in all of the board areas.</P>
    <P>The report also includes details of the levels of <Col N="1630" /> demand and outputs for each health board area. The tables attached have been extracted from the report. It may be seen from these data that demand is greatest in the Eastern and Southern Health Board areas. The implementation group established to plan, prioritise and cost the recommendations contained in the report is currently seeking an update of the waiting list situation in each of the boards. As soon as this detail becomes available I will have it forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>From additional development funding available to the Midland Health Board in 1999 an additional speech and language therapy post was created to provide a service to the unit for hearing impaired in Ballymahon and the senior language class at the Downs primary school in Mullingar. The service to the Downs primary school was provided by the board as the Department of Education and Science had sanctioned the setting up of a senior language class at this location.</P>
    <P>As far as the Midland Health Board is aware no sanction has been given by the Department of Education and Science for a senior language unit in Longford.</P>

      <P>In practice, responsibility for the investigation of such occurrences rests with the clinical director of the service concerned. The clinical director assembles reports from the relevant medical and nursing staff as appropriate. Copies of these reports together with any conclusions reached by the clinical director are forwarded to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Depending on the nature and seriousness of the occurrence, the gardaí and relatives of the patient are informed.</P>

      <P>The Midland Health Board adopted a report in May, 1998 to commence upgrading of facilities at St. Loman's hospital, Mullingar. Detailed plans have been drafted for the upgrading of the male admission unit at St. Loman's hospital and some preparatory work on costing the project has been carried out. In the course of an examination of the male admission side, the necessity to remove asbestos was identified and this work had to be completed before any other work commenced in the male admission unit. It is expected that the main work will proceed on this scheme early next year.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board has committed £1 million from the proceeds of the sale of land at St. Loman's to the refurbishment programme at the hospital and these moneys will be expended when the admission block work proceeds as outlined above. My Department also provided £0.841 million in the last two years for upgrading and minor capital works at the hospital. The allocation also enabled the purchase of beds, lockers and equipment which would be necessary when the planned refurbishment is completed.</P>

      <P>The provision of ambulance services in the Donegal area is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board. The current deployment of ambulance services was agreed and consolidated in 1974. The decisions taken at the time have been subsequently validated with generally few difficulties experienced regarding delays. Delays, which have occurred from time to time, have upon investigation been found to relate to factors other than the location of the ambulance base.</P>
      <P>In terms of ambulances bases, Glenties is covered at present by Donegal base which is 14 miles from Glenties, Killybegs base, 16 miles, and Dungloe base 20 miles. Both Donegal and Dungloe are served by two ambulance crews with three in Killybegs since 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398, 401, 402 and 419 together.</P>
      <P>Roadworthiness testing of private cars will be commenced by the National Car Testing Service Limited on 4 January 2000 at 43 designated test centres countrywide. The new requirement will apply to cars older than four years every two years, but only cars registered before 1 January 1992 will be tested in 2000. Four of the test centres will be located in Dublin with two on Dublin's northside.</P>
      <P>The fee for the test will be £35 with a retest costing £19.80, both inclusive of VAT. Retests which do not require the use of a test lane will be free of charge. The national car test, NCT, has been established on a public-private partnership and self-financing basis. Within this framework, it is envisaged that all users of the NCT should pay for their biennial tests as part of the general costs of private motoring.</P>
      <P>The test procedure and standards are documented in the national car test manual 1999 which has been published by the Government Publications sales office and is available in the Oireachtas Library. Draft regulations are currently being finalised in my Department which will specify in detail the requirements to be met for the issue of a test certificate. Major requirements will be those bearing on vehicle safety in a primary way.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 500,000 vehicles may be required each year to submit to the biennial test. NCTS is required under its contract to provide a quality service to car owners concerned throughout the country, and detailed arrangements and estimates in this regard are a matter for the company.</P>

      <P>I introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled person's grant scheme in December last. The effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was increased by 50 per cent from £8,000 to £12,000 in the case of works commenced on or after 2 December 1998. In addition, the maximum grant payable in respect of private houses was increased to three-quarters of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously. The maximum recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities in respect of each grant was also increased to two-thirds or £8,000 compared to a maximum recoupment of 50 per cent or £4,000 previously. This increase in the recoupment rate allowed local authorities to pay the higher grants now available at no increased cost to the authority.</P>
      <P>My Department makes an annual allocation to each housing authority based on estimates of demand for the scheme provided by the authorities.

      <P>The Council of Environment Ministers of the EU normally meets <Col N="1638" /> in formal session four times a year, in March, June, October and December. Nine such council meetings have taken place since July 1997. A wide range of legislative and policy matters were discussed at each council, in addition, EU positions were developed as appropriate for purposes of participation by institutions of the European Union in relevant international negotiations including, for example, those at UN level relating to climate change, biodiversity, trans-frontier shipment of waste and in the Commission for Sustainable Development. A report on the matters discussed at each meeting is issued by the general secretariat of the council and I am arranging for a copy of each report since July 1997 to be supplied to the Deputy and placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In addition to the formal councils, Environment Ministers held four informal meetings since July 1997. The matters discussed at each meeting were as follows: April 1998 &ndash; chemicals management, environmental integration, environment and transport; July 1998 &ndash; environmental integration, environment and renewable energies; May 1999 &ndash; product-related environmental policy, EU enlargement, review of EU chemicals policy, Presidency report on environmental integration; July 1999 &ndash; main challenges for environmental policy, environment/enlargement with emphasis on climate change and the environmental implications of the Kosovo conflict.</P>

    <P>Standards in relation to private car parking are a matter for individual planning authorities in the context of their development plans.

      <P>Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with Part H of the national building regulations 1997, made under the Building Control Act 1990. The relevant technical guidance document H &ndash; Drainage and Waste Water Disposal &ndash;  calls up the following standards: (1) Septic tanks serving single houses: Irish standard recommendation SR 6 of 1991, formulated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland; (2)Septic tanks serving groups of houses: British Standard B.S. of 6297: 1983, formulated by British Standards Institution.</P>
      <P>The updating of the above standards, and certification of septic tanks to specified national standards, are primarily matters for the relevant standards institutions.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will by the end of the year, issue two new manuals dealing with the design and construction of septic tanks.

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to apply strategic development zone status to motorway proposals as provided for in the Planning Bill, to allow them to benefit from the streamlined planning process.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that strategic development zones as provided for in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, would apply to mainly industrial or other employment generating development of strategic national importance. The concept of strategic development zones is to enable pre-planning to be carried <Col N="1642" /> out in relation to a particular site before individual proposals are identified. This is done by drawing up planning schemes which are subject to full public consultation and adoption by local authority members. Once a scheme is adopted the planning procedure for individual proposals which meet the criteria set down in the planning scheme is shortened. This concept would not offer any benefit in the case of motorway projects as carrying out a pre-planning procedure followed by an additional planning procedure in the case of a known project would not offer any savings in time. The SDZ approach could not also deal with issues such as compulsory land acquisition which are an integral part of major road projects.</P>
      <P>It should be noted however that Part XIV of the Planning and Development Bill contains a number of initiatives aimed at streamlining the provision of public infrastructure, including motorways. For example, decisions on motorway schemes will in future be a matter for An Bord Pleanála which will have a statutory objective to decide on them within 18 weeks.</P>

      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under that Act. It is a matter for authorities to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their area, the staffing resources to be made available, the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. It is, of course, also a matter for authorities to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants.</P>
      <P>The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme and I have no proposals to amend the regulations in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the administration of the rural water programme, including the prioritisation and approval of group water schemes for grant assistance, is a matter for the county councils. In 1999, block grant allocations totalling £14 <Col N="1644" /> million were notified to county councils to finance capital grant expenditure on group water scheme upgrading and development, of which £400,000 was allocated to Kilkenny County Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to this Exchequer provision, European Regional Development Fund co-financing of around £10 million is being provided under the operational programme for environmental services, 1994-99, for the development of certain large scale group water schemes. All available European Regional Development Fund funding has been committed at this stage. However, if and when additional moneys are approved under the current programme, outstanding applications, including those in respect of the Castlewarren and Lacken-Rathmoyle schemes, will be considered for approval.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 59 of 5 October 1999.</P>
      <P>The feasibility studies undertaken in 1998 considered three thermal treatment options &ndash; waste incineration with energy recovery gasification and pyrolysis under a range of criteria. The consultants concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that WTE is a safe, tried and tested technology capable of meeting stringent environmental standards; gasification and pyrolysis are emerging technologies which are continuing to be developed to the scale likely to be appropriate in Irish circumstances; gasification offers environmental advantages over WTE, including lower emissions; gasification does not have the same track record as WTE, but appears to be close to becoming proven as a treatment method for municipal wastes; and pyrolysis may have future potential in certain applications but is not currently suitable as a bulk treatment method for municipal wastes.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the policy approach outlined in Changing our Ways, the strategic waste management planning exercise currently being undertaken by local authorities reflects the requirements of the waste hierarchy and will support the development of an environmentally sustainable and integrated waste management infrastructure, incorporating materials recovery, biological and thermal treatment facilities and landfills for residual wastes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions for the taking in charge of estates do not differentiate between private developers and a local authority carrying out a development outside its functional area. The relevant planning permission sets out the standards for roads and open spaces. There is no statutory obligation on a planning authority to take in charge any housing estate.</P>
      <P>Section 11(1) of the Roads Act, 1993, gives a road authority the power, by order, to declare any road within its functional area over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. The road authority must publish a notice indicating the road that it proposes to be a public road. Under article 5 of the Roads Regulations 1994 &ndash; SI No. 119 of 1994 &ndash; where it is proposed to declare public the roads of a housing estate, this notice must state the name and location of the estate.</P>
      <P>New requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of housing estates are provided in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The Bill provides that where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of the local authority, the authority must take an estate in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so through the procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993. Where an estate is unfinished, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will be obliged to take the estate in charge after seven years. The Bill is currently before the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes and quality bus corridors is to improve the operation of public transport services. Accordingly full access to bus lanes is at present limited to buses, with taxis and pedal cycles being permitted access to &ldquo;with flow&rdquo; bus lanes.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Dublin situation, my Department has been advised by the Dublin Transportation Office against any dispensation at this time which would allow multiple occupancy private cars to use bus lanes. It may however be appropriate to consider such an arrangement when the overall QBC network is operating at optimal efficiency and when the benefits of utilising any residual lane capacity can be properly assessed.</P>

      <Col N="1649" /> The legislative framework through which restrictions and prohibitions may be applied to the parking of vehicles on public roads is contained in sections 35 and 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.

      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, confers a right to retain, as a tenant, possession of a formerly controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act &ndash; 26 July 1982 &ndash; or the lifetime of their spouse. Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession under the 1982 Act expires on 25 July 2002, subject to the tenancy lasting a minimum period of five years.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the implications of the expiry of the protection afforded to successor tenants under the 1982 Act and any necessary decisions will be made well in advance of the expiry of the existing provisions. In addition, it is possible that the deliberations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, which was launched on 22 July 1999 and is expected to report by 1 June 2000, may have some implications for these tenancies.</P>

      <P>An outline proposal was received in my Department in respect of Labasheeda sewerage in the context of an integrated water supply and sewerage scheme for the west Clare area. Schemes such as Labasheeda not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme come within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998, which asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. This scheme is sixteenth in Clare County Council's priority list. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the person in question developed a building for commercial and residential use in an area designated under the 1994 urban renewal scheme. In order to avail of residential tax incentives under that scheme, the relevant legislation requires that the total floor area of a residential unit must not exceed 125 square metres. As the residential unit on this occasion exceeded the floor area requirements, the residential tax incentives do not apply.</P>
      <P>However, the scheme provided a range of incentives for commercial and industrial projects in the designated areas. It is open to the developer to apply for these incentives. No certification is required from my Department prior to seeking such incentives from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>In assessing the means of a farmer for the purposes of farm assist, account is taken of the gross income from farming, including income from sheep farming, and any other self-employment, less any expenses necessarily incurred.</P>
      <P>The assessment is factual and is designed to reflect the actual net income of the applicant. It is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity and market trends. In the case of income from sheep, account is taken of the actual income received from sales together with any premium and/or headage payments received in respect of the flock. In any case where an applicant for farm assist feels that the assessment carried out does not accurately reflect current market trends and prices, it is open to him or her to request a review of the means assessment.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and from last April, free travel is available to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance.</P>
      <P>An unrestricted free travel pass is issued to all visually impaired people under age 18 which enables them to travel during the normal restricted times. In addition, they are also issued with an unrestricted companion free travel pass that allows a person, aged 16 or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
      <P>Visually impaired peopled over 18 years who are attending a full-time long-term rehabilitative course recognised by this Department are also entitled to an unrestricted free travel pass. However, persons in open work situations are subject to the time restrictions of the pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or sub<Col N="1659" /> urban rail services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Time restrictions have been put in place because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been receiving disability benefit since February 1994. In September 1998, he applied for an exemption from the rules for a person receiving disability benefit to enable him to undertake part-time work with a view to rehabilitating himself for full-time work. The exemption was granted for a period of six months, subject to review at the end of that period.</P>
      <P>In the course of the review in April 1999, my Department's medical adviser considered that the rehabilitative potential of the work involved as a means of preparing the person for full-time employment had been fully exploited. The chief medical adviser of my Department has since reviewed the case and he agrees with the view of the medical adviser in the matter. Accordingly, a further period of exemption from the rules of behaviour cannot be given and the person concerned has been informed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 457 and 458 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for farm assist in April 1999.</P>
      <P>Following an examination of his entitlement his income was assessed at £144 per week.  This was based on assessments of £16 from his farm holding plus £128 benefit deriving from his spouse's earnings. In accordance with the rules he was assessed with half the means, namely £72 per week which qualified him for a weekly farm assist payment of £1.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned appealed that decision <Col N="1660" /> to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that the assessment was in accordance with the statutory provisions and was fair and reasonable. All allowable expenses in respect of benefit from his spouses income and from the farming operation had been allowed in the means assessment. The persons appeal was disallowed and he was notified accordingly. In the absence of any new evidence the appeals officer did not consider that an oral hearing is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the contents of the <i>Irish Independent</i> supplement &ndash;&ldquo;Open your eyes to child poverty&rdquo;&ndash; which was published in association with the Combat Poverty Agency in June. There are many issues raised in the supplement which I and my colleagues in Government continue to consider in the context of an overall strategy on social inclusion and in the implementation of social policy.</P>
      <P>Child poverty is a particular concern of the Government and successive budget measures, along with targeted policy initiatives, have sought to ensure that our children are protected and given the opportunities to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty.</P>
      <P>I announced in June, at the launch of the first annual report of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy's Inter-Departmental Policy Committee, that the Government had asked the committee to consider setting targets in relation to particular groups such as children in poverty. Discussions are still at a very early stage and it must be recognised that child poverty is a complex problem, the alleviation of which requires policy responses on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to develop a national children's strategy so as to position child and youth related issues more centrally and more explicitly in public policy development and decision making in a more co-ordinated way. The strategy will also seek to build on the efforts of statutory and voluntary and community agencies in a renewed commitment to develop more child focused services. It will address the needs of children and young people up to the age of 18, with special regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is intended to publish the strategy next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child benefit is acknowledged in the supplement to be &ldquo;the most direct and effective means of assisting low income families irrespective of the source of family income&rdquo;. The link <Col N="1661" /> between the risk of poverty and family size has been firmly established and my Department's provision of income support in respect of children plays a crucial role in combating the incidence of child poverty. The Government agrees that child benefit is one of the most effective means of tackling child poverty and there have been substantial increases in this payment in recent budgets. As child benefit is universal, not taxable and not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc. it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget provided for child benefit increases of £3 per month to £34.50 for each of the first two children and £4 per month to £46 for the third and all subsequent children. Some 513,000 families with a total of 1.2 million children have benefited from these increases. The full year cost of these increases is £40.76 million and the total projected spend on child benefit in 1999 is £446 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, the 1999 budget provided for an increase in the family income supplement threshold of £8 per week which, alongside last year's introduction of FIS calculation on a net income basis, means that thousands of families are better off as a result.</P>
    <P>The latest ESRI figures from the Living in Ireland Survey show that the percentage of children experiencing consistent poverty fell from 18-23 per cent in 1994 to 15-17 per cent in 1997, while the numbers living in households below the 50 per cent relative income line fell from 29 per cent in 1994 to 24 per cent in 1997. This reduction in child poverty is largely attributable to falling unemployment levels which have enabled many families to release themselves from dependency on social welfare payments and improve their incomes. Under this Government, there have been further record increases in employment. The unemployment rate for the period March-May 1999, the latest figures available, was 5.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the needs of children are kept to the fore in the design of policy, a system of poverty proofing of policy proposals &ndash; guidelines for which specifically name children as a target group &ndash; was introduced across Departments in July 1998.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives have also been introduced to promote the welfare of children and strengthen family support services. These include the launch of the springboard and youth homelessness initiatives, the further development of services under the Child Care Act, 1991, and the introduction of the Children Bill this year.</P>
    <P>This Government has attempted to alleviate and reduce the problem of child poverty in Ireland on a number of fronts. It recognises that investment in children will reap dividends &ndash; socially and economically &ndash; both now and in the future and will remain a priority in Government social policy.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last 6 years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. This year a sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
      <P>Fuel price inflation has been much lower than general price inflation. The fuel and light component of the Consumer Price Index rose by 9.6 per cent between August 1985 and August 1999. Increasing the basic allowance by this amount would increase the rate from £5 to £5.48 per week. The additional expenditure for the 1999/2000 fuel season would be £4.4 million.</P>
      <P>The rate payable cannot be viewed in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from the beginning of June 1999.</P>
      <P>Any change in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In assessing the value of capital for the purposes of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy that, arising from difficulties associated with the differ<Col N="1664" /> ent treatment of capital under the various social assistance schemes, it was decided by the previous Government to introduce a standardised method of assessing capital. The introduction of the disability allowance scheme in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment in January 1997 presented the opportunity to commence this process across all social assistance schemes. This standardised method was not extended to unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance at that time. Under the revised capital assessment method, which was introduced by my predecessor, the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, since the standardised method of assessing capital was first introduced in 1996, interest rates available on investments have fallen significantly. In the circumstances, I have arranged for my Department to review the current standardised method of assessing capital.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the original intention had been to extend the standardised method of assessing capital to all social assistance schemes. However, in view of the changed circumstances in relation to interest rates, it would be preferable to await the outcome of the review before making any changes in method of assessing capital for unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance purposes. I should point out that any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 465 and 467 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. The maximum rate of payment is £76.50 per week for a carer caring for one person. A carer caring for more than one person may be entitled to up to £114.80 per week. In addition, a carer in receipt of a carer's allowance is also entitled to a respite care grant of £200 every year. Qualified carers are also entitled to a free travel pass and the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the Review of the Carer's Allowance, which was pub<Col N="1665" /> lished in October 1998, and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million to improve and develop the position of carers.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget introduced some changes in the means test for carer's allowance. From August 1999, a disregard of £75 per week is applied to the income of a single carer and the current disregard of £150 per week is applied to the joint means of a married couple.</P>
    <P>The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. One of the major issues raised by these groups was the removal or easing of the carer's allowance means test.</P>
    <P>The complete abolition of the means test would have substantial cost implications of over £100 million per annum in respect of the 40,000 carers providing full time care and attention.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income. In this regard it should be noted that the only universal social welfare scheme is child benefit. All other schemes are based on either contribution/qualification conditions or are means tested.</P>
    <P>The operation of the means test will be kept under review and any further improvements would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme is generally intended as a short-term payment which is designed to provide immediate assistance for those in need. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by the health boards and the Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Those eligible for assistance under the SWA scheme would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment and would have to satisfy a number of criteria, including a means test. In addition, people with low incomes may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, for example, rent, diet, heating, or a payment to assist with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of SWA payable in all cases is the difference between the person's means and the minimum weekly income prescribed in legislation for the household type in question. Household income is taken into account and will reduce the amount of SWA payable. Any income above the <Col N="1668" /> SWA rate is taken as means unless specific provisions have been made under legislation to disregard certain payments.</P>
    <P>While the carer's allowance is assessed as income for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme it is partially disregarded for the purposes of rent and mortgage interest supplements. The amount disregarded when assessing entitlement is the rate of carer's allowance in payment less the current SWA qualified adult dependant allowance where the carer is one of a couple. If the carer is single, the rate of carer's allowance less the personal rate of SWA is disregarded.</P>
    <P>A review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme has recently commenced as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations. The working group will examine all aspects of the scheme, including the means assessment and the qualifying income limits for the allowance.</P>
    <P>In the assessment of means for the medical card, social welfare and health board payments, including carer's allowance, are disregarded. However, to apply a similar type of disregard in relation to SWA rent supplement would have major cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>the provision, if any, he will make to provide a contributory pension for self-employed people who were born prior to 1927; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The same qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension apply to all insured people &ndash; both employees and self-employed. These qualifying conditions require a person to have entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pensionable age, which is 66; a minimum of 156 contributions paid in line with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board &ndash; this requirement will increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively &ndash; and have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 or the date of entry into social insurance, if later.</P>
      <P>However, in line with this Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions coverage to people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension, last April I introduced special arrangements for a specific group of people. These are self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed. As a result, this group could not qualify for a pension as they did not satisfy the standard requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> A new old age contributory pension is, therefore, now available to those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five years contributions paid since then. The rationale behind this five year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of their careers. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50 per cent of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependents, where applicable.</P>
    <P>I consider these arrangements to be fair, reflecting a certain consistency of commitment to the Social Insurance Fund, over a given period of time.</P>

      <P>To qualify for old age pension, a person must either have been insurably employed and satisfy the contribution conditions for old age contributory pension or, alternatively, qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is subject to a means test. Other payments, such as widow(er)s pensions, continue to be payable after age 66 in lieu of old age pension where this is to the persons advantage.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is receiving a widow's contributory pension at the maximum rate of £82.10 plus a living alone allowance of £6 per week. According to the information available to my Department, she was not insurably employed and would not qualify for an old age contributory pension. If, however, she wishes to have her entitlement formally assessed, she should complete the relevant application form and forward it to my Department.</P>

      <P>In regard to the inland waterways for which I have responsibility, namely the River Shannon navigation which includes the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the Royal and Grand Canals and the River Barrow navigation, by-laws are in force for the control and regulation of the use of these waterways. Two sets of by-laws apply, one governing the use of the River Shannon navigation, the other the use of the canals and River Barrow navigation. Generally speaking, the by-laws provide that a person shall not deposit or leave litter in the navigations or on waterway property nor discharge any water into the navigations, other than water used for the purpose of cooling the engines of boats, or from sinks, wash-hand basins and showers on boats. The canals by-laws further provide that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter the canals, while the River Shannon navigation by-laws provide that a toilet fitted to a vessel shall be so constructed and fitted as to prevent polluting matter from being discharged or passing into the navigation.</P>
      <P>In order to allow the holding tanks on boats to be emptied by users, pump-out facilities were provided along the Shannon-Erne Waterway as part of the restoration of that waterway and the relevant local authorities have provided, and are continuing to provide, pump-out facilities which they operate and maintain at various locations along the River Shannon navigation. Accordingly, as boat traffic on the canals increases, it is intended that local authorities will provide pump-out facilities at appropriate locations.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my response to related Question No. 195 of 1 April 1999, I am keenly aware of the importance of protecting hedgerows and avoiding the disturbance of wildlife during the nesting season. In the absence of native woodlands, hedgerows are extremely important for the maintenance of biological diversity, particularly for birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, provides protection against the cutting, grubbing and burn<Col N="1673" /> ing of hedgerows on uncultivated land during the nesting season from 15 April to 31 August, subject to certain exceptions. This year, as in previous years, Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, wrote to all local authorities requesting that works to hedgerows be undertaken outside that crucial nesting period.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in its guidance notes to local authorities on the Roads Act, 1993, and its road grants memorandum, has underlined the importance of carrying out roadside trimming during the winter season and has emphasised that the timing of trimming work and the manner of its execution should minimise damage to the ecology of hedgerows.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, the rural environment protection scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, also promotes the conservation and maintenance of existing features, such as hedgerows, that make up farmland habitat.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which was published on 1 July 1999, will strengthen the protection afforded to hedgerows under section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976. Protection will extend from the 1 April, rather than 15 April, as is now the case. Furthermore, the existing exemption in respect of works being duly carried out by a Minister of State, or a body established or regulated by or under statute, will be restricted to circumstances where reasons of public health or safety apply.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the national biodiversity plan which I am preparing, some possible measures to improve the conservation of hedgerows have been identified and I intend to afford further consideration to those measures in the context of the finalisation of the plan.</P>

      <P>I understand from Údarás na Gaeltachta that the company in question is a limited company under the Companies Acts; assistance totalling £54,200 in research and development and feasibility grants has been sanctioned for the undertaking in question &ndash; in addition 200sq. mts of factory space was leased to the company rent free for the duration of the research period with the factory to be repaired at a cost of £5,000 to an tÚdarás; no assistance has been paid to date; as the undertaking is at the research and development stage, the emphasis is not on employment at present although training is being provided for 20 persons as part of the research programme and four other persons are employed on a part-time basis; no member of an tÚdarás is personally involved in the undertaking or is a director of it; and it has no knowledge of any member of an tÚdarás deriving any benefit from the undertaking.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 488 agus 489 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The compilation of lists of buildings of architectural merit is being carried out through the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage. This is a systematic survey of the built heritage of the State and it will assist planning authorities in carrying out their function of ensuring the protection of that heritage.</P>
      <P>The most cost effective approach to carrying out surveys under the NIAH is to survey the built heritage in defined geographical areas rather than attempting to carry out thematic surveys. One of the ten urban surveys published last year was for Kilkenny City and it provided a rating of the built heritage in that area, including buildings in public sector ownership. The surveys would not have dealt with detailed condition reports on buildings as the purpose of the exercise is to provide fundamental information on what structures were of heritage value. Work will continue on the NIAH on this basis and priority will be given to interim county surveys over the next two years.</P>
      <P>There is no separate list of buildings in the ownership of public authorities. Given the strategic approach to the compilation of the NIAH, it is not desirable that priority be diverted to such a thematic survey. Nevertheless, I have set up a working group to examine the issues surrounding the protection of buildings of architectural merit in public ownership and will be publishing their findings when I have considered them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise, however, that my role in relation to the protection of the architectural heritage is primarily an advisory one. The NIAH surveys issue as a help to planning authorities who have the main function in relation to the listing and protection of structures. In addition, I will be issuing conservation guidelines to those authorities early next year. The guidelines will affect <Col N="1678" /> all protected structures, be they in public or private ownership.</P>

      <P>The Register of Buildings at Risk is an initiative of the Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995. The register is compiled by the Heritage Council and I understand that only buildings which have been nominated by their owners may be included on it. I have no function in relation to the register, either in the context of deciding which buildings are included on it or which owners should receive grant assistance from the Heritage Council. However, I understand from the council that, to date, some 379 buildings have been listed on the register, including 13 buildings in the ownership of public authorities. These include nine buildings in the ownership of local authorities, three buildings in the ownership of health boards, and one building in the ownership of a Department.</P>
      <P>In general, the Deputy will be aware that, under the terms of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, the primary responsibility for the protection of the architectural heritage rests with the planning authorities. Any owner or occupier of a building which has been included in the list of protected structures compiled by a planning authority will have a duty of care to ensure that the building is not in any way endangered. This applies equally to the public and private sectors. Furthermore, the Heritage Act, 1995, provides the Heritage Council with the authority to consult with public authorities regarding developments which may affect buildings in the ownership of those public authorities and which I have designated as heritage buildings on the advice of the council. This measure provides significant additional legislative protection to buildings of architectural heritage in public authority ownership.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the question of the protection of historic buildings in public authority ownership is being considered by the interdepartmental working group on architectural policy.</P>

RTE state that in excess of 98 per cent of the population nationwide receive good quality RTE television reception. RTE further states that good quality RTE television reception is available generally in County Mayo except in some small pockets, especially Pollatomish, Carrowteige and Porturlin, north of Belmullet. RTE reports that it has encountered difficulties with efforts, over the last three to four years, to provide good quality reception to this area.</P>

      <P>The Habitats Directive requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation and to protect their favourable conservation status. It also requires member states to transmit a list of the proposed areas together with full information on each site to the EU Commission within three years of the date of the notification of the directive, that is by June 1995. The directive specifies scientific criteria for the selection of these areas.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94/97). My Department has publicly advertised 335 proposed candidate SACs and it has formally transmitted 145 of these sites to the European Commission for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network. The Commission has instituted legal proceedings against Ireland for the non-transmission of sites and these proceedings are still in place.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission agrees with me, and with the Government, that the viability of the Natura 2000 network of sites is dependent on the co-operation of the landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. I believe that all those whose lands are proposed for SAC designation must be given an opportunity to object to the proposals, on scientific grounds, before I formally transmit the list to the Commission. To this end I have provided an opportunity to landowners and to land users to have their appeals examined informally by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department. I have also established an appeals board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, and comprising representation from landowners and conservation organisations, to independently assess appeals and to advise me on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commission has been notified of our proposals in relation to SACs and the reasons for the failure to meet the deadline for transmission of the list of sites to the Commission. The Commission is also aware that, while Ireland is techni<Col N="1682" /> cally not in compliance with the Directive, the advertised sites receive full protection under our national legislation.</P>

It must be borne in mind that even when existing craftpersons are recruited, their skills must be adapted to meet the particular needs of the national monuments service. Having regard to the current competitive employment market all realistic options are being considered to fill these vacancies. In order to alleviate the medium to long-term requirements of the service, my Department will, in the coming months, be expanding its apprenticeship programme.</P>

      <P>Magdalen Castle is a tower house in state ownership. It is in good condition following conservation works some years ago by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I have no plans to carry out further works at this time. Dúchas does not publish the tour guide referred to by the Deputy and will actively promote only those sites in State ownership which have visitor facilities through its Heritage Sites booklet. The 1999 booklet lists some 80 such sites throughout the country, including three in County Kilkenny &ndash; Kilkenny Castle, Jerpoint and Dunmore Cave.</P>

      <P>Clara Castle is a national monument in State care and is in good condition. For this reason, I see no need to commission a report on the structure of the castle. The site is accessible to visitors by means of a key which is available from a caretaker who lives nearby. There is a sign to this effect at the castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of women in employment in terms of pay differentials between them and their male counterparts has improved considerably since the establishment of the former Employment Equality Agency in 1977.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the wage differential gap has traditionally been measured by reference to the average hourly earnings of female production workers in manufacturing industry compared with that of their male counterparts. In 1975 the average female wage in this category was 62 per cent of that of their male counterparts. This rose to almost 69 per cent in 1980, and then fluctuated during the early and mid-1980s. The ratio has been gradually improving since then and in 1995 it was over 73 per cent. The latest CSO figures available, which relate to December 1998, show the ratio at 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Partnership 2000, my Department commissioned the ESRI to conduct a follow up study on male/female wage differentials, which was last produced in 1994. The terms of the follow up study include, <i>inter alia</i>, a repeat of the analysis of the 1994 study, an examination of the wage gap, to refine information on the reasons which underlie it and the relative contribution of each underlying reason to the gap, and undertaking comparisons with other EU countries and seeking to identify factors contributing to cross &ndash; country differences in wage differentials. Work on the follow up study is nearing completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, came into operation on 18 October 1999. The Act provides for equal pay for work of equal value, between workers of the opposite sex, where both are employed by the same or an associated employer. While this provision is similar to a provision contained in the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the 1998 Act contains a number of improvements over the 1974 Act. In particular, the requirement that the claimant and the comparator must be employed in the same place has <Col N="1688" /> been removed; a claimant can select as a comparator a person employed within the three years preceding or following the alleged discrimination; employees of associated employers will be able to make an equal pay claim if they have reasonably comparable terms and conditions of employment with a comparator and indirect discrimination is specifically outlawed. As part of its wider functions of working towards the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equality of opportunity in relation to employment, the Equality Authority will provide advice and assistance to people who wish to pursue an equal pay claim under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, requires the Equality Authority to prepare and submit a strategic plan to me for approval, as soon as practicable after the Act comes into operation. I understand that the authority hopes to submit a plan to me before the end of the year. At present, I am unable to say if the plan will include a specific reference to the issue of pay differentials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 183 Garda personnel are engaged in traffic related duties in the Dublin metropolitan area. In addition to traffic corps members, all uniformed gardaí throughout the city are involved in road traffic enforcement as required. I might add that traffic management operations are also assisted by the Garda air support unit which, primarily through the use of the helicopter, maintains direct communication with ground units and co-ordinates Garda operations from the air. I understand that the Garda mounted unit has also been used in specific operations. As the Deputy will appreciate, this represents a considerable level of investment and it is unique in terms of technology and expertise.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the latest phase of Operation Freeflow commenced on 4 December 1998 and concluded on 9 January 1999. The strategy involved the identification and enhanced patrolling by gardaí and traffic wardens of 22 main traffic arteries between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily.</P>
      <P>On completion of Operation Freeflow, Operation Clearway commenced on 9 January 1999 and is scheduled to continue to 6 December 1999. I understand that details of the arrangements for the Christmas/new year period will be announced in the near future. I wish to assure the Deputy that the main artery routes already identified continue to be intensively patrolled, particularly at peak times, primarily using motor cycle patrols. The total Garda commitment to Operation Clearway is 101 members and to bring it up to the levels of Operation Freeflow would necessitate the permanent allocation of an additional 134 Garda members. As the Deputy may be aware, the question of the deployment of gardaí is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, the increase in vehicular traffic in the greater Dublin area in recent years has contributed significantly to the current heavy traffic volumes experienced in the city. In addition to effective enforcement, improved road infrastructure, improvements in public transport and a cultural shift from private car use to public transport <Col N="1690" /> are all required to contribute to improved traffic flow. I should also state that traffic management is being tackled on a united front, with constant liaison both at a strategic level and at operational level between all the parties involved, including the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office, local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the commitment of the Garda Síochána to traffic management and enforcement in recent times has increased significantly. As the Deputy will appreciate responsibility for the preparation and execution of traffic management plans for special events both indoor and outdoor and including VIP visits, parades, sporting fixtures and demonstrations and where public order can sometimes be an issue, for example, all rest firmly with the Garda Síochána. In addition to traffic management functions and enforcement, the Garda can, and do on a regular basis, deploy additional resources to specific problems, for example, accidents and obstructions as they arise.</P>
    <P>The interrelationship between road traffic crime and other crime necessitates, in my opinion, the retention of a unified police structure as it is one of the inherent advantages of our policing system. I would have serious reservations about any move which resulted in the fragmentation of any aspect of policing. Indeed the establishment of separate local authority police forces could be overly bureaucratic and cumbersome given their scale and would not, I believe, be beneficial to the wider community which allows traffic corps members to deal with general crime as well as traffic related crime.</P>
    <P>In addition, for the reasons already indicated, the establishment of separate non-Garda traffic police in the four local authority areas of the Dublin metropolitan area, accompanied by the necessary administrative support, would appear unwarranted and the increased fragmentation which would result would in fact hinder progress in managing traffic on a strategic basis.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware one outstanding aspect of the overall traffic management area is the transfer of the traffic warden service from the Garda Commissioner to Dublin Corporation. The Government decision of 26 July 1995 which gives responsibility for traffic management in Dublin to Dublin Corporation has not yet been fully implemented due to the difficulties in resolving the transfer of the traffic wardens to Dublin Corporation. This was recommended to Government by the then Minister for the Environment as part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative Plan. I assure the Deputy that my Department is keen to resolve this matter and is in contact with Dublin Corporation, the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government and the unions representing traffic wardens with a view to effecting the transfer as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the statutory duty imposed on local authorities by the Registration of Title Act, 1964 to register with the Land Registry all property, including shared ownership dwellings, acquired by them. Section 84(2) of the Act requires that each and every property in respect of which a title is registered in the Land Registry be identified on a map. However, ordnance survey maps do not show floors, or parts of floors, of multi-storey buildings. Consequently, where a title to an apartment is being granted or registered, the map required to identify the apartment will be more complex. It may comprise a series of maps, showing the building and surrounding curtilage on an ordnance survey map and showing the layout of each floor on other maps, drawn by an architect or a mapping technician.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, a requirement for special maps for multi-storey buildings and it applies to all applicants, whether they are individuals, companies or local authorities and whether the title to the building is registered or not.</P>
      <P>In relation to the person referred to by the Deputy, I am informed that there is no record in the Land Registry of any registration of ownership in respect of the person or of any application for registration. It would appear that the local authority involved has not, as yet, lodged the appropriate documentation and maps. I assure the Deputy, however, that when the necessary documentation is lodged in the Land Registry there will be no undue delay on the part of the Land Registry in registering the property involved.</P>

      <P>The new courts service which will be established on 9 November 1999 will have responsibility for future planning and provision of court accommodation throughout the State. I am aware that the chief executive designate and his staff are already examining the capital requirements that will be required over the next five to seven years to bring court accommodation up to a modern acceptable level.</P>
      <P>I am further aware that the chief executive designate has had discussions with the local District Judge and the county manager in Donegal with a view of identifying the most urgent priorities for inclusion in that programme in County Donegal. As the Deputy is aware there are already court sittings in Carndonagh and Buncrana within the lnisowen peninsula. Immediate priorities in Donegal will be the provision of new purpose designed court accommodation in Ballyshannon, Glenties, Killybegs and Falcarragh. In addition, the District Court in Buncrana is currently being refurbished and facilities in Carndonagh courthouse will be addressed subsequently.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to other venues will be considered by the courts service board when the immediate and most urgent priorities have been addressed. These will be to ensure that there is a reasonable spread of courthouses and facilities for the District Court in particular, which are accessible by the public and practitioners within a reasonable distance from their homes.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I received the Helm report on the administrative and management functions of the film censor's office in November 1998. The report makes reference to regulation issues relating to video games. In this respect I would point out to the Deputy that all aspects of censorship legislation are being reviewed at the moment and it is expected that a discussion paper on this area will be available within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> Under the existing provisions of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 video games are exempt from classification and certification by the film censor unless the game in question would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, to stir up hatred against any group of persons, to deprave or corrupt persons by the inclusion of indecent or obscene material or where the game depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans or animals.</P>
    <P>Up until recent years video games on release in the State did not pose any problem as they did not fall into any of the categories mentioned. However, video games now being produced may come within the scope of the provisions of the Video Recordings Act mentioned and, if so, it would be a requirement of the Act for the relevant distributor to submit the video game or games for certification and classification by the film censor.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this dealing refers to an application under section 49, namely, acquisition of title by virtue of long possession of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, which was lodged on 25 April 1997. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. I am further informed that queries issued to the applicant's solicitors on 3 February 1999 and 23 February 1999 and replies are awaited. The queries raised must be satisfactorily discharged before the matter can proceed. I have also been informed that there is an associated application pending and both applications must be dealt with together. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate a completion date for the application concerned at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay on the part of the Land Registry in finalising matters.</P>

      <P>The Department's pro<Col N="1696" /> cedures for processing asylum applications provide that persons who do not come within the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, will be given sufficient opportunity to make submissions to the Minister as to whether there are special reasons why they should be granted leave to remain in the State.</P>
      <P>The procedure in place for considering such applications is in line with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999. Persons whose applications for asylum have been rejected are informed in writing that they have the option of making representations within 15 days to the Minister as to why he should not make a deportation order in respect of them. In considering whether or not to sign a deportation order, the Minister must have regard to a range of factors as set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, including any representations received from or on behalf of the person. The Minister is also bound by the prohibition on refoulement provided for in section 5 of the Refugee Act. If the Minister decides not to sign a deportation order and to grant leave to remain instead, such leave is usually for 12 months initially and may be made subject to a review of the situation in the person's country of origin at the end of that period of time. Persons with such leave to remain are entitled to take up employment without a work permit and to operate a business without the need to obtain business permission.</P>

    <P>There is no set hourly rate for overtime. Overtime is linked to the pay of the officer involved, so the higher an officer is in scale or grade, the higher the hourly amount payable. The rate payable also varies in respect of the accumulated hours per week, namely, the first three hours overtime per week are paid at the rate of time and a quarter, the next five hours at time and a half and the remainder at double time. There are also special rates payable in respect of Sunday and public holiday overtime. It should also be noted that some of the increases from year to year can be ascribed to general increases in pay. Overall, the average amount paid per hour, in the first half of 1999, was approximately £20.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, without expending a disproportionate amount of staff time, to ascertain exactly the extra hours worked by the top ten earners of overtime in the prison service in <Col N="1698" /> the years in question. However, the level of overtime earned by the top officers equates to over 40 basic hours extra per week. That level of extra attendance is, however, not sustainable and is a matter of concern which is being addressed in a strategic way through the work of a dedicated staffing and operations review team. This team is examining the staffing requirements at each institution and has produced seven reports to date. A strategy for the implementation of the findings of these reports is being developed at present. The ultimate aim is to have an attendance system for the prison service which does not rely on overtime to meet its operational needs.</P>

      <P>I take it from the Deputy's question that he is referring to the inquiry recommended by the Victims' Commission in its report, A Place and a Name, into the murder of Mr Seamus Ludlow. As the Deputy is aware the Government decided that an eminent legal person should be appointed to look into the case of Mr Ludlow along the lines contained in the Victims Commission report.</P>
      <P>As the eminent legal person has yet to be appointed it would be premature to suggest when his or her inquiry might be completed. In so far as the publication of the inquiry report is concerned, I would refer the Deputy to recommendation 4.5.3 of the report of the Victim's Commission. I should add that I intend to meet with relatives of Mr Ludlow in the near future to discuss these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1996 was thoroughly examined in my Department to identify appropriate changes which would ensure that it could more effectively meet its objectives, that it would reflect the most modern thinking on juvenile justice and that it took account of comments I made in my contribution, when Opposition spokesperson on Justice, to the Second Stage debate on the 1996 Bill.</P>
      <P>The examination, which was carried out in co-operation with the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. gave rise to the need for a thorough recasting of the 1996 Bill in the form of a new Bill. The following are some of the more significant changes contained in the new Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill will raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven years to 12 years. The 1996 Bill proposed  to raise the age to 10 years. Provision is being made for a family welfare conference. This will be a preventative measure, organised by the health boards, aimed at providing services for children at risk and their families. There will be a greatly expanded role for restorative justice within the statutory Garda diversion programme. This will include: the introduction of restorative cautioning, namely, a more pro-active version, with the victim in attendance, of the present system of administering a formal caution; provision for a person who is not a member of the Garda Síochána to chair the conference which will be an integral part of the diversion programme; and an action plan and a written &ldquo;contract&rdquo; of compliance with the plan.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to further expand the restorative justice provisions by the introduction of a court directed and supervised family conference. This conference will be operated by the probation and welfare service. It is proposed to introduce a special residential services board to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children on whom children detention orders have been imposed &ndash; offenders &ndash;  or in respect of whom special care orders have been made &ndash; out of control non-offenders.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to ensure that any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures an underage child to &ldquo;commit an offence&rdquo; will be guilty of that offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision for a new court imposed parental supervision order. Where the courts are unable to impose detention in a children detention school due to lack of space, they will, as an alternative, be empowered to impose an appropriate community sanction &ndash; to prevent the development of a revolving door. There is pro<Col N="1702" /> vision for a combined detention and supervision in the community order for 16 and 17 year old children.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the operation of places of detention for 16 and 17 year olds found guilty of offences &ndash; provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; under rules separate from those applying to prisons and other places of detention.</P>
    <P>In light of the proposal to introduce a special residential services board, the previous plan for a single board of management for the children detention schools is being replaced by a proposal that each school or natural grouping of schools will have its own statutory management board appointed by the Minister for Education and Science. A new inspection system for the children detention schools is proposed. The leave arrangements in the schools have been totally recast to allow for greater flexibility and to allow for mobility trips and unaccompanied absences for the purpose of seeking employment or gaining work experience, etc.</P>
    <P>The measures dealing with the protection of children are being expanded to provide a more broadly based definition of cruelty. The Child Care Act, 1991, is being amended so that any institution for the care and protection of physically or mentally handicapped children will no longer be excluded from the definition of &ldquo;children's residential centres&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The examination referred to above also identified the need for minor or drafting changes to most sections of the 1996 Bill. These are too numerous to itemise.</P>

      <Quest>the fee income of the Land Registry over each of the past three years; if it operates on a self financing basis; if an application for an increase in staffing levels was made by the registrar; if so, when this application was made; and the reason authorisation for an increase in staffing is required.</Quest>

      <P>The fee income received by the Land Registry during the last three years was as follows: 1996, IR£16,463,544; 1997, IR£18,230,533 and 1998 IR£19,110,517. The total fee receipts of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds have for some years now exceeded the amount expended by the registries, although that expenditure does not cover the costs of items such as rent and superannuation which are met centrally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for an increase in staffing levels <Col N="1704" /> was made by the registrar in April 1998 and has been the subject of ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance. The reason for seeking this authorisation for an increase in staffing levels was to cater for the growth in the number of dealings lodged with the registries. A further request for additional staffing in the context of the Government's decision of December 1998 to convert the registries to commercial semi-state status was submitted to the Department of Finance in July 1999. This further request reflected core staffing requirements in the areas of human resource management, finance and internal audit. The request for all the additional staff is currently under consideration by the Department of Finance and I expect to have a decision shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the number of transactions in arrears and awaiting registration at the end of 1988 and 1998; the length of time on average it takes to register a title or a plot of ground; and the length of time it takes from the time of application to obtain a land certificate.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr.O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will, no doubt, be aware, arising out of the buoyancy in the economy and the current high level of activity in the housing market the number of dealings being lodged with, and the level of business being transacted by, the Land Registry has been increasing steadily for some years now and has been subject to unprecedented increases in recent years. In this light I am pleased to be able to report that significant efficiencies have been generated by the registries. For example, overall output of applications for registration has increased by 20 per cent. This is a significant achievement and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds for their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might be interested to note that my Department has written to the Department of Finance making a strong case for the allocation of additional staff to deal with the increase in the level of business in the Land Registry. Urgent discussions are currently being held between the two Departments in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>That said, the specific data requested by the Deputy is as follows: arrears of dealings, namely, applications for registration, which represent the main category of work of the Land Registry, were at 32,332 and 51,554 at the end of 1988 and &ndash; 1998 respectively; and on average, it currently takes 7.9 months to complete a dealing and register a plot of ground in the Land Registry, and 1.2 months to issue a land certificate.</P>

      <P>A total of 80 community centre based sports and recreation projects were grant aided under the 1999 sports capital programme. Details of grants to projects in this category are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I shall circulate in the Official Report. Such projects will continue to be funded in the future provided they satisfy the terms and conditions of the programme. I expect to be advertising details of the programme for 2000 in the next month and it will be open to clubs and community groups to apply.</P>

      <P>Final Government decisions on the new national development plan are expected shortly. Pending those decisions, it is not possible for me to give any figures on future funding for local development type activities. However, I wish to state that this Government is fully committed to the important task of tackling social exclusion in deprived areas, and of ensuring that the overall objectives of current programmes remain a priority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the area partnerships, the situation is that each area partnership/ADM/ community group carries out its activities under a plan which is prepared by itself and approved by ADM. The current Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development requires that all commitments to funding actions under these plans, are made by the end of 1999. Actual spend can continue until the end of 2001 to ensure the successful completion of the current programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of ADM has made allocations, including some recent extra allocation of ESF funds to partnerships, which should allow activi<Col N="1707" /> ties under current plans to continue into next year, by which stage arrangements for implementation of the upcoming national development plan, including social inclusion measures, should be in place and operational. Therefore, the 2000 Estimates will reflect that position and include provision accordingly for area based partnerships and community groups.</P>
    <P>Until the details of new social inclusion measures have been agreed with the EU Commission, it is difficult to finalise a comprehensive strategy to oversee the transition from the old to the new national development plans, which the Government will endeavour to ensure is as smooth and efficient as possible.</P>

      <P>The two schools of physiotherapy at University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin have a combined annual output of some 70 graduates. With effect from the current academic year, the Royal College of Surgeons has introduced a NUI degree of B.Sc. in physiotherapy.</P>
      <P>I understand that an expert group was established in accordance with Labour Court recommendation 15515 to address the education and training of certain paramedic grades, including physiotherapists. The group commenced hearings in May 1998 and it is expected that they will report by the end of 1999. The issue of the insufficiency of the number of qualified physiotherapists produced annually by the colleges to meet the growing needs of the health services was raised in submissions to the expert group.</P>
      <P>The question of providing additional facilities for the education and training of physiotherapists will be considered in the context of the report of the expert group when available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The House will be aware that the rates of allowances on VTOS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs back to education allowance schemes were equalised in 1998 and that the £25 per week incentive payable to long-term unemployed participants on FÁS courses was applied to VTOS with effect from September 1999. Nevertheless, there are variables which apply in the treatment of individual cases depending on the nature of the FÁS scheme, for example, community employment or FÁS mainline training, the additional allowances payable in respect of a dependent spouse and children and any corresponding adjustments which fall to be made in relation to the other spouse's entitlements, and the treatment of secondary benefits. In relation to such variables, it is normal practice for both FÁS and the vocational education committees to be advised by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as to level of social welfare entitlement which would arise, and to pay a training allowance on the basis of that advice. Accordingly, without an examination of the specific circumstances which arise in this case, it is not possible to state what the precise impact on benefits would be.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunity scheme is open to adults at least 21 years of age who are getting an unemployment payment or signing for credits for at least six months. Periods spent on FÁS or community employment schemes can count towards this qualifying period. VTOS participants retain entitlements to any secondary benefits they already have prior to joining the programme. The basic rate of allowance for an adult with no dependents is £73.50 per week, but additional allowances are payable for dependents, and deductions may come into play in respect of one partner in respect of income exceeding £60 per week. The £25 per week bonus payable to long-term unemployed does not apply to those transferring directly from a FÁS programme, except in the case of transfers from the community employment scheme and the Job Initiative.</P>

      <P>The issues referred to by the Deputy were raised recently by the Union of Students in Ireland in the context of their 1999 pre-budget submission, to which I have previously outlined my response.</P>
      <P>On the issue of student accommodation, the Government has already introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in this year's Finance Act. For the purposes of the scheme, properties qualifying for relief are campus areas of an eligible educational institution or areas within an 8 kilometre radius of the main campus, which are approved by the certifying educational institution as being areas within which a qualifying development may take place. The provision of on-campus accommodation is ongoing in the third level sector. On-campus accommodation for 700 students is expected to be completed well in advance of the next academic year at the Galway campus of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology while approval for on-campus accommodation in respect of 450 bed spaces has been sanctioned by the University of Limerick.</P>
      <P>A number of developers have made initial inquiries or submitted applications to educational institutions in respect of developments which are within 8 kilometres of the eligible institutions and to date four such applications have received approval. With the advent of such developments additional student accommodation will become available over the next number of years.</P>
      <P>The college fees referred to is the standardised charge which the third level colleges levied in the context of the free fees initiative in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge is £278 for the current year and I would point out to the Deputy that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge. The effect of the charge has been to provide a sounder and more secure funding base for the services covered. I am concerned to ensure that the level of the services provided fully reflects the amount charged and my officials are in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities in this regard. I am also concerned that appropriate systems of consultation and accountability in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded apply in all third level colleges. I understand that the Higher Education Authority's review of the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level colleges in this regard, will be finalised shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of maintenance grants, I have indicated previously that my priority is to remove anomalies in the schemes. In particular, I have honoured the commitment in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post-leaving certificate <Col N="1710" /> courses. A maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses was introduced with effect from the 1998/99 academic year.</P>
    <P>I have also addressed the position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular, under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which s/he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant.  With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>

      <P>The first round of the first phase of Partnership 2000 was paid to all retired teachers and spouses of deceased teachers in autumn 1997. It amounted to the benefit in pension, with effect from 1 July 1997, of an increase corresponding to an increase of 2.5 per cent on the first £10,436 of annual pay.</P>
      <P>The second round of the first phase, due on 1 April 1998, was an increase in pension of the balance due under the first phase. Furthermore, under the second phase of Partnership 2000, an increase in pension of 2.25 per cent was due with effect from 1 July 1998 and an increase of 1.5 per cent was due with effect from 1 July 1999; a further increase of 2.0 per cent under the local bargaining clause of Partnership 2000 also fell due with effect from 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the second round of the first phase of Partnership 2000 was related to a fixed amount, based on £10,436 of annual pay, it was necessary to complete the calculations of how much was due under the PCW agreement before the precise amount due under Partnership 2000 could be calculated.</P>
      <P>The PCW agreement as it applies to teachers' pay and pensions is a complex one and its final elements, those concerning in-school management were not agreed until early 1998. As an interim measure, teachers who retired prior to the commencement date of the PCW agreement, 1 July 1994 in the case of teachers, together with spouses to whom a spouses' pension became payable prior to the commencement date of the PCW Agreement, received in January 1998 an increase of 2 per cent in pension backdated to 1 May 1996. Interim payments were also made under Partnership 2000. An interim increase of 3 per cent under Partnership 2000 was paid to all pensioners in December 1998 backdated to 1 July 1998. In August 1999 a further 3.53 per cent under Partnership 2000 was paid effective from 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>During 1998 and 1999 work has continued on the task of applying the full benefits of the increases under PCW and Partnership 2000 to pensioners and paying any balances due in excess of the interim payments. The arrears have now been cleared in the case of the vast majority of the 11,000 pensioners and these pensioners are now on the correct rate of pension. In the case of the remaining pensioners, about 500, it is my Department's aim to complete the work and make payment in full before Christmas 1999.</P>

      <Quest>the number of primary schools currently designated as disadvantaged; the various categories of designation; the initiatives, if any, he has taken since coming into office to assist designated schools; whether administrative principals may be appointed at a lower figure in designated schools; the number of schools in urban and rural areas which have applied for the breaking the cycle and early start schemes but which have not been approved to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 316 primary schools currently have disadvantaged area status. All schools which have been designated disadvantaged are entitled to a staffing allocation which enables them to operate at a maximum class size of 29:1. They also qualify for supplementary capitation funding at a rate of £30 per pupil. These schools are also eligible to benefit from a television licence refund; preferential funding rates under the school books rental scheme; and a 95 per cent grant towards building costs. Prior to 1994, schools which secured disadvantaged status also received a concessionary teacher post as part of their support package. However, in more recent years, available teacher posts have been deployed to support the Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage initiative which is focused on schools with particularly serious levels of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In December, 1998 I announced a major £57 million package of measures to address the issue of educational disadvantage. This included the extension of the home-school-community liaison service to all schools with disadvantaged status with effect from the commencement of the current school year.</P>
      <P>In 1998 also I introduced the eight to 15 year old early school leavers programme. This programme, which is currently operating in 14 disadvantaged areas, is testing models of response to the problem of early school leaving. The objective is to integrate successful models into mainstream policy and practice. A total of £3.68 million is being expended on this programme over the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 school years.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the Education Act makes specific provision for the establishment of a committee on educational disadvantage. The groundwork for the establishment of this committee is at an advanced stage in my Department. This committee will advise me on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The appointment of administrative principals in all ordinary national schools takes place on the appointment of the eighth mainstream class teacher. Schools with disadvantaged status have the benefit of reaching this level of staffing at an earlier stage by virtue of being staffed to operate at a maximum class size of 29:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 221 schools were eligible to apply for inclusion in the urban element of the Breaking the Cycle pilot initiative. Applications were received from 190 of these schools and 33 schools <Col N="1714" /> were selected for inclusion in the scheme. A total of 1,915 schools were eligible to apply for inclusion in the rural element of the Breaking the Cycle pilot initiative. Applications were received from 691 schools and 123 schools were selected for inclusion in the scheme. Information on the number of schools which have sought inclusion in the early start pre-school pilot programme since its introduction in 1994 is not readily available in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if there is evidence of a serious literacy problem among school leavers; whether the evidence indicates that this problem is confined to certain geographical areas; if so, which areas; the steps, if any, he has taken to improve literacy standards, particularly in schools designated disadvantaged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The information available to my Department in relation to literacy standards refers to standards achieved by children who are in attendance at school. It does not inform us about the literacy standards of school leavers.</P>
      <P>In 1991 Irish 14 year-olds participated in the IEA international study of reading literacy. The results of this study indicted that between 6.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent of Irish 14 year olds had serious literacy difficulties. The data collected in this research did not refer to geographical areas.</P>
      <P>In 1997, I published the results of a national adult literacy survey, commissioned by my Department in association with the OECD international adult literacy survey. The results of this survey showed that 16 per cent of the Irish adult population between the ages of 16 to 25 years functioned at the lowest level, indicating serious literacy difficulties. There was evidence that those who do not complete second level education have lower levels of literacy.</P>
      <P>A range of schemes is already in place in disadvantaged areas and these consist of the early start pre-school project, the breaking the cycle pilot project, the home-school community liaison scheme and the new eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative. All of these should have a positive effect on raising standards of literacy in these schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, remedial teaching provision has been extended to all primary and secondary schools. Among the strategies being encouraged are earlier identification and a sharper focus on supporting pupils with learning difficulties and more intensive interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised primary curriculum in English. the new leaving certificate English syllabus and the existing junior certificate English syllabus all emphasise the raising of standards in literacy. School planning guidelines, already issued at first level, stress the importance of a whole-school <Col N="1715" /> approach to literacy development and extension and a whole-school responsibility for raising standards in this area. An introduction to school development planning for second-level schools was published recently by my Department and will be followed in due course by detailed guidelines. Encouraging full participation in the education system is a key factor in ensuring good levels of literacy. The recently established stay in school initiative is designed to improve the retention rates to the end of senior cycle.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable to eligible students at either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate. Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from the college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college each day having regard to the journey and available transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant. The schemes of third level student support, since 1995, provide that the non-adjacent rate would be payable in all circumstances where the student resides more than 15 miles from the college. Any proposal to align the rates of payable at the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant would have significant cost implications and would have to have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously indicated my intention is to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants scheme before dealing with the more general issues of grant levels. In this regard, I have announced that, with effect from the coming academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. I was particularly concerned about mature students and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. With effect from the current academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. <Col N="1716" /> This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>

In this context, I would point out that under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, tax relief is available at the standard rate for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses. Against this background, I have no immediate plans to extend the financial support schemes to part-time students.</P>

      <P>An application for an extension has been received from the board of management of Scoil Áine national school, Raheny. My Department's planning and building unit is currently assessing the future accommodation requirements of the school. When this examination is complete a decision on the matter will be conveyed to the manager of the school. It would appear, however, from documentation recently received from the board of management that the school has already sought planning permission for an extension without reference to my Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of support for a full-time secretary at the school, currently, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. Under the scheme for the employment of secretaries which was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this scheme a number of primary schools qualified for a shared secretary and Scoil Áine, Raheny, is currently involved in a sharing arrangement with another primary school. This scheme is however, being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts which are being shared. Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial services.</P>
      <P>Should the existing post fall vacant, my Department will provide Scoil Áine and the other primary school with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost of secretarial services, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school, in accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>

Until June of this year, the school attended by this child had the services of a resource teacher who was shared with six other schools. The base school of the teacher in question was St. Mura's national school, Tooban, County Donegal. Following a review of the caseload of the resource teacher in question, my Department sanctioned a second resource teacher post with effect from September 1999, to cater for eligible pupils in these schools. This second post is based in Carndonagh national school, County Donegal and the pupil in question is on the caseload of this resource teacher. As a result of this reorganisation, the level of resource teacher support available to the pupil in question has increased from two and a half hours per week in 1998 to between three and four and a half hours per week, on alternate weeks, from September 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently examining whether further resource teacher support and the support of a special needs assistant is required by the school attended by this child.

      <P>The employment community initiative supports a range of innovatory projects under four strandsHorizon, people with disabilities; INTEGRA, disadvantaged and socially excluded; NOW, new opportunities for women, and YOUTHSTART, young people up to 20 who are at risk of social exclusion. Some 132 projects were supported in 1995-97 and a further 126 are now under way with a view to completion in early 2000.</P>
      <P>Mainstreaming of the learning from the projects is being pursued through direct contacts with some project providers, links between my Department and the national support structures established for the initiative strands, submissions received from the support structures in relation to TEASTAS and the Green Paper: Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, participation in thematic working groups established for the projects, participation in the EU monitoring committee for the initiative, and in the mainstreaming forum established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of progress in this area include: the emphasis on a multi-agency partnership adopted as an integral part of the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative and the stay in school initiative, and the investment in additional supports pro<Col N="1720" /> vided for under these measures, and the development of linkages with other agencies as an intrinsic part of the work of programmes such as Youthreach, VTOS and adult literacy services; the provision of a new guidance, counselling and psychological services measure for Youthreach and continuance of the FÁS advocate service, the establishment of a working group to oversee the piloting of an adult guidance service and the work in hand to progress the development of a national educational psychological service; use of the Youthstart initiative supplemented by additional funds to support training in front-line counselling for staff in Youthreach, community training workshop and senior traveller training centres and use of Eurotrain in the delivery of inservice; the development of national certification at foundation level and level 1 by the NCVA in 1997 and 1999 respectively, and the work now under way to bring into effect the establishment of a national qualifications authority on a statutory basis. This will have a key influence of the development of flexible assessment and accreditation arrangements and improvement of progression pathways; integration of programmes such as pathways and bridge and elements of Youthlynx into Youthreach, and of Tramlines into the FASTTrack IT initiative; development of more flexible delivery arrangements envisaged under the back to education initiative, allied with expansion of adult literacy services; continuation of specific third level initiatives in the training of trainers for people with disabilities; continued use of resource materials and programme modules developed under the pilot actions; legislation to establish an educational welfare board to track and support participation in education of children at risk; and the establishment of a women's education initiative. Mainstreaming will be further progressed in the light of the national development plan and the publication of a White Paper on adult education.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that the counselling service referred to is funded from various sources and that a subvention from the South Kerry development partnership has been made available for some years. The counselling service is available to three post-primary schools in Killarney, all of which have an ex-quota guidance counsellor allocated to them by my Department. When students require more specialised coun<Col N="1721" /> selling than can be catered for by the school counsellor, all post primary schools have the services of a psychologist from the national educational psychological service agency attached to my Department. The psychologist may provide the required counselling or, if considered necessary, will refer such students to the relevant health board or to one of the voluntary counselling services funded by the health board.</P>

      <P>I must acknowledge to the Deputy that gaelscoileanna have traditionally enjoyed a more favourable overall pupil teacher ratio than that which applies in all other mainstream primary schools. The rationale for this lies in the desire to cultivate and rejuvenate the Irish language within Irish society. Successive governments have adhered to this policy over the years.</P>

      <Col N="1722" /> I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have recently decided to apply the staffing schedule for the retention of teaching posts in all-Irish schools to schools in Gaeltacht areas where teaching is through the medium of Irish. This took effect from the commencement of the 1999-2000 school year. The managerial authorities of the schools that will benefit from the implementation of this concession in the 1999-2000 school year were notified recently. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the significant improvements which I made earlier this year in the pupil teacher ratio in mainstream primary schools.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department makes every effort to minimise the administrative requirements for schools who are seeking support services for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that requests for assistance in such situations can involve a variety of special needs and can relate to a variety of special support services. All such requests must be supported by relevant assessment reports confirming the needs in question. Where all the necessary supporting data is provided, the special education section of my Department will not require additional submissions from school. However, there are occasions where the data submitted by schools is not adequate to support all the elements of the support services being requested. In such situations, it may be necessary for my Department to revert to the school for additional data.</P>
      <P>The difficulty to which the Deputy refers can particularly arise where, rather than identify all aspects of their needs in one submission, a school makes a number of separate applications over a period, each dealing with a particular element of need. My Department makes every effort to cross-reference such cases and minimise referral back to schools. However, it would be of significant assistance in minimising the difficulties to which the Deputy refers if applications for support in respect of specific children would incorporate the full range of services required and provide adequate supporting data in respect of all those elements as part of the one application.</P>

The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at post-graduate level and accordingly, there is no grant aid available for students pursuing post-graduate studies abroad, irrespective of whether or not that course is available in Ireland. Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses abroad could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector generally.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a proposal to establish a special class for pupils with autism in the Celbridge area.

      <P>I am aware a pupil with autism from the Leixlip area was not able to be accommodated in the special classes in Scoil Mhuire, Leixlip, and that his parents accepted a place in a special class in Kilcullen, County Kildare. It was not possible for my Department to facilitate this pupil with a transport service to Kilcullen. However, my Department has recently sanctioned and enhanced transport grant to the parents concerned to assist with the cost of private transport arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is a need for an independent departmental body whereby teachers who have a complaint against a principal or a board of management can have their case heard in a just and fair way where they are not satisfied that the board of management has dealt with the issue properly.</Quest>

      <P>It is the relevant management authorities of primary and second level schools who are the employers of teachers and not the Department of Education and Science nor the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level a grievance procedure for handling grievances in schools has been agreed <Col N="1732" /> between the INTO and the management bodies and has been in operation for a number of years. The purpose of the procedure is to provide machinery for a resolution of any grievance of a teacher in a primary schools against the board of management in respect of the exercise of any of its responsibilities relating to the governance of the school or the principal teacher in respect of his or her duties and responsibilities for the organisation, conduct and day-to-day activities of the school.</P>
    <P>While the grievance procedure sets out a number of stages which must be followed, including the hearing by a board of management of the grievance, it also provides for the setting up of an independent tribunal to adjudicate on a matter where the teacher is unwilling to accept the decision of the board of management.</P>
    <P>Procedures for dealing with individual grievances are in place in the various sectors at second level. Discussions on a revised conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers, which provides for grievance procedures to be agreed and approved by the Teachers Conciliation Council, were completed at the council in December last. Ratification of the revised C&amp;A scheme requires the consent of all the parties to the scheme.</P>
    <P>A teacher, of course, also has recourse to the normal industrial relations machinery of the State where he-she is dissatisfied at his-her treatment by a board of management. In the circumstances I do not see the need for an independent departmental body to be established to deal with such cases as I am satisfied that there are adequate means in operation to deal with such situations.</P>

      <P>Boards of management are encouraged to pursue a policy of openness and have a positive approach to sharing information with the school community while having due regard to the need for confidentiality to protect against inappropriate disclosure of school business. Section 20 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for the establishment of procedures by boards of management for the dissemination of information to parents and teachers concerning the operation and performance of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level the rules of procedure relating to boards of management are outlined in the booklet Boards of Management of National Schools Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure which were agreed with the partners in education. The procedures in relation to the access of decisions of boards of management would have to have regard to sections 8 and 9 of this booklet, which deal with confidentiality and <Col N="1733" /> board communications and transparency. Boards are advised that, at the closure of each Board meeting, they should determine the information to be conveyed to parents, teachers and the school community, and the manner and terms in which it should be conveyed.</P>
    <P>At second level, it is a requirement of the deed of trust establishing community and comprehensive schools that the business of the board of management is private and no disclosure of the business shall be made without the authority of the board. In relation to boards of management in the VEC and voluntary secondary school sectors, it is a matter for each board to determine its own policy in relation to the disclosure of information concerning board decisions.</P>

      <P>This question concerns my Department's decision not to pay the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996.</P>
      <P>My Department's position in regard to the payment of these allowances is based on the advice of the Department of Finance regarding Government decisions taken over the years regarding public service pensions and on the facts regarding my Department's long standing practice.</P>
      <P>A teacher's pay is made up of incremental salary and of a range of allowances. It is my Department's long standing practice that the benefit of an increase in incremental salary will be reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and that the benefit of an allowance will be reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held that allowance in pay.</P>
      <P>My Department's practice in regard to allowances goes back to at least 1970, when post of responsibility allowances were introduced in the case of vocational teachers. Following further discussions with teachers' unions and school management, they were introduced in the case of secondary teachers in 1971. Although the allowances were payable with retrospective effect, they were not payable to teachers who had retired prior to 1 July 1968, the agreed effective date of establishment of the allowances. The Department of Finance has confirmed that my Department's practice has not been affected by Government decisions made over the years, most recently in 1997, regarding the link between public service pay and pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work that the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances would be payable to teachers with effect from 1 September 1996. In accordance with long stand<Col N="1736" /> ing practice, the revised scales of the allowances are not payable to teachers who retired prior to that date.</P>
    <P>I should add that the allowances in question are related to the numbers of teachers employed in the school and that the scale of the allowances held at retirement continues to be reckoned in the pension irrespective of whether the numbers fall or rise after retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should point out that this school year is seeing the first allocation of additional teachers to second level schools for some years. This year provision was made for 225 additional teachers and this, together with the retention of some 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed, is enabling us to provide a remedial teaching service in every second level school and also to bring all disadvantaged schools into the home school liaison scheme. I have also made improvements in the provisions available for guidance in our schools with a guaranteed minimum allocation now available to every school.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing for additional teachers, I have, this year, introduced a new retention ratio for secondary schools. The impact of this is to retain in schools teachers who would otherwise be liable to be redeployed. In all some 150 teachers have been retained under this initiative and these teachers will continue to be available to improve the quality of education in our schools.</P>
      <P>At second level the issue of disadvantage is closely linked to the incidence of early school leaving. For that reason I have put in place a number of initiatives focused on this difficult and intractable problem. In addition to the eight to 15 initiative, a new stay in school initiative is now commencing.</P>
      <P>The issue of class size in second level schools is very complex. Analysis of this issue conducted by my Department indicates a very varied pattern of class size across the second level sector. In general, senior cycle classes are appreciably smaller than those at junior cycle and the pattern across subjects can vary significantly. It is in the nature of some subjects that they attract a relatively small cohort while traditionally core subjects account for larger classes. It is also the case that schools with like enrolments and resources can have quite different patterns of class size.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the principal concern in relation to class size must be the impact on educational attainment. In this regard, the great body of research indicates that the major impact of class size is to be found in the early years of primary education and for disadvantaged groups in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1998-99 school year the pupil teacher ratio at second level was approximately 15.4 to 1. Allowing for the increase of some 225 teachers <Col N="1739" /> and a projected drop in enrolments, it is expected that the pupil teacher ratio will reduce to approximately 15.1 to 1 in the current school year. This represents a decline in the actual PTR from that which prevailed in the 1970s. Within the current PTR there are a large number of very small classes.</P>
    <P>Approaches to enrolment and redeployment at second level have remained relatively static over many years and one result of this is that there is no necessary link between the allocation of additional teachers and the achievement of key educational priorities such as widening subject and program choice. It is also the case that present redeployment arrangements fail to achieve a balancing of necessary resources among schools. For these reasons, I have recently written to the union and management interests indicating my intention of having these issues examined by a technical or expert group in consultation with the various interests.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I have a strong commitment to continuing to improve the resources available to our schools. It is vitally important that investment in education in all its forms has the ultimate well-being of the pupil at its core and I see the review which I have mentioned as being of considerable value in achieving this objective.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 611 and 612 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. When assessing income from self-employment-farming the amount assessed is the adjusted profit-loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities &ndash; both Irish and foreign &ndash;  whether they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant pur<Col N="1740" /> poses. These means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are of general application.</P>
    <P>Finance lease arrangements are an alternative method of funding the acquisition of fixed assets. The lease payments are comprised of two elements, repayment of the &ldquo;purchase outright&rdquo; cost of the asset and finance charges levied by the lease company. As these two elements are directly related to capital additions, the expenditure is not deductible for higher education grants purposes.</P>
    <P>However, expenditure relating to operating leases is deductible in calculating reckonable income for the purposes of the grant.</P>
    <P>As already stated, these means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and I have no plans to alter the method of computing reckonable income for the purposes of the student support schemes.</P>

      <P>The arrangement whereby students pursuing post-graduate courses at approved courses in Northern Ireland can apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance has historically been a feature of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996-97, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students following full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state. The course must be followed in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. Certain courses, such as those which are subject to quotas on intake in Ireland, are excluded. The extension of the schemes at the <Col N="1741" /> time did not include courses at post-graduate level and accordingly, there is no grant aid available for students pursuing post-graduate studies in England such as that cited by the Deputy in this case.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to extend the current arrangements with effect from the current year and indeed, I should point out that any extension of the current arrangements, to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses in other parts of Britain and to the EU generally, could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.</P>

      <P>The announcement referred to by the Deputy concerns my Department's decision to provide a replacement school in County Leitrim.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, following an inspection of one of the school buildings, a replacement building was considered a matter of urgency on the grounds of health and safety.

However, the site for the new school building was thought to be sufficiently large to accommodate an extension to facilitate rationalisation if agreed in the future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced a major expansion of the remedial teaching service to first and second level schools, and my priority was to ensure that all schools, who were without a remedial teaching service, would have access to one with effect from September 1999. This has resulted in a remedial teacher service now being available to all schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of below 10:1 are free to make a case for such support to my Department.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the expansion of the remedial teacher service, the existing service throughout the country was examined to ascertain if it could be extended to include schools that did not have a service.</P>
      <P>It was considered appropriate that the general criteria for establishing and retaining a remedial post would include pupils who have been identified as being in the bottom 10th percentile on standardised tests in basis literacy and numeracy. This is in line with the recommendation of the Special Education Review Committee report. The caseload of a remedial teacher would comprise of 40 eligible pupils in the case of a single post, this to be reduced by two pupils for each additional school in the cluster subject to a maximum reduction of eight pupils.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the remedial service in the Kells area, including Carnaross national school, is significantly within these guidelines and that I am satisfied that an acceptable standard of service is available to the pupils concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The division of a remedial teacher's time is arranged locally between the schools, in consul<Col N="1743" /> tation with the inspectorate. This is based on the level of established need in each school. I understand that this process has been followed in this case and that the remedial teacher's time is being allocated in line with the remedial needs of the pupils in each school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. When assessing income from self-employment-farming the amount assessed is the adjusted profit-loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities (both Irish and foreign) whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes. These means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are applied nationally.</P>
      <P>Finance lease arrangements are an alternative method of funding the acquisition of fixed assets. The lease payments are comprised of two elements repayment of the &ldquo;purchase outright&rdquo; cost of the asset and finance charges levied by the lease company. As these two elements are directly related to capital additions, the expenditure is not deductible for higher education grants purposes. Expenditure relating to operating leases is deductible in calculating reckonable income for the purposes of the grant.</P>
      <P>Details of the lease documentation, in relation to the case to which the Deputy refers, were submitted to my Department following an appeal to the local authority, and were deemed to be in the nature of finance leases and thus not deductible in computing reckonable income.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the method of computing reckonable income for the purposes of the student support schemes.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Deputy to the results of the poll conducted by the National Youth Council of Ireland in relation to the recent EU and local elections and which were published last week.

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, the reckonable income for the purposes of the award of a grant is gross income from all sources of the candidate and his-her parents or guardians, where applicable, with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. This income would include, as in this case, interest received on deposit accounts.</P>
      <P>The Vocational Education Committees administer the maintenance grants scheme for trainees attending European Social Fund-aided third level courses, which is the relevant scheme in this case. Inquiries have been made and it is understood from County Mayo VEC that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the reckonable income limit for the award of a full maintenance grant. However, the candidate is eligible for a part maintenance grant, at the non-adjacent rate, in respect of his studies at the Cork Institute of Technology. It is further understood that the reckonable income would have exceeded the income limit for the award of a full maintenance grant even if there had been no income from interest on savings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question concerns my Department's decision not to pay the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996 and not to pay the long service allowance to teachers who retired prior to 1 August 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's position in regard to the payment of these allowances is based on the advice of the Department of Finance regarding Govern<Col N="1746" /> ment decisions taken over the years regarding public service pensions and on the facts regarding my Department's longstanding practice.</P>
    <P>A teacher's pay is made up of incremental salary and of a range of allowances. It is my Department's longstanding practice that the benefit of an increase in incremental salary will be reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and that the benefit of an allowance will be reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held that allowance in pay.</P>
    <P>My Department's practice in regard to allowances goes back to at least 1970, when post of responsibility allowances were introduced in the case of vocational teachers. Following further discussions with teachers' unions and school management, they were introduced in the case of secondary teachers in 1971. Although the allowances were payable with retrospective effect, they were not payable to teachers who had retired prior to 1 July 1968, the agreed effective date of establishment of the allowances. The Department of Finance has confirmed that my Department's practice has not been affected by Government decisions made over the years, most recently in 1997, regarding the link between public service pay and pensions.</P>
    <P>It was agreed under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work that the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances would be payable to teachers with effect from 1 September 1996. In accordance with longstanding practice, the revised scales of the allowances are not payable to teachers who retired prior to that date.</P>
    <P>I should add that the allowances in question are related to the numbers of teachers employed in the school and that the scale of the allowances held at retirement continues to be reckoned in the pension irrespective of whether the numbers fall or rise after retirement.</P>
    <P>It is also in accordance with longstanding practice that teachers who retired prior to 1 August 1996 are not eligible to receive the benefits in their pension of the long service allowance which was introduced with effect from that date.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third <Col N="1747" /> level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course. Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that the current exchange rates do not favour grant holders who are studying in Northern Ireland or Britain, I believe that these arrangements are equitable and efficient.</P>
      <P>There is no provision within the student support schemes for the local authorities or vocational education committees to supplement the grant payable to students studying in Northern Ireland. Such a supplement could not be made without giving rise to an anomalous inequity <i>vis-à-vis</i> students studying elsewhere in the EU.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the correspondence referred to by the Deputy was received and acknowledged in my office, but the papers cannot now be traced in my Department. I regret any inconvenience caused to the Deputy as a result. <Col N="1749" /> The information sought by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional <i>per capita </i>grants for primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, and has been in operation since 1 September 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £15 per pupil, to a maximum of £7,500 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no secretarial provision already rather than increase the <i>per capita </i>grant rate of £15 per pupil. In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that with effect from January next, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils will be eligible for a grant of £15 per pupil towards secretarial services under this scheme.</P>
      <P>My officials will be writing to all qualifying schools over the next couple of months confirming their inclusion, and setting out the details of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for these services. The position of schools that are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>In addition to the above, limited funding is also provided to vocational education committees to enable them to subsidise the enrolment of certain categories of disadvantaged participants on courses for which fees are payable. The disbursement of this funding and the establishment of priorities for expenditure are matters for decision by the committee. It operates a scheme for the waiving of fees, where payable, in the case of people who are unemployed, including single parents who are unemployed. Budgetary constraints do not at present allow for the expansion of this arrangement to cover widows or old age pensioners or for a general waiver for all social welfare recipients.

Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre, and a meal allowance of 60 pence a day. The travel and meal allowances are in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>

Special schools are not considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme because they are already in receipt of staffing and funding allocations which are significantly more advantageous than those made available to schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>My Department does not specifically fund extra curricular activities undertaken by special schools. The funding of such activities, including swimming programmes, is a matter for the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The report of the planning group on the establishment of a national educational psychological service recommended that 131 additional psychologists should be recruited on a phased basis over a period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> I have accepted this recommendation and in 1999 a competition to appoint 25 additional psychologists for the National Educational Psychological Agency, NEPS, has been organised by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of these 25 psychologists will increase the capacity of NEPS to provide a service to primary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department provided a grant of £30,000 to the Irish Centre for Talented Youth in November 1996 in recognition of its work with gifted children.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the centre submitted an application to my Department for further funding. This application is currently under consideration and I expect that a decision on the matter will be conveyed to the centre very shortly.</P>
