      <P>It is proposed to take No. 2, Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), and No. 3, Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government satisfied that it has all the powers necessary to deal with threats to public health arising from dioxins found in processed foods? Has the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture and Food raised this matter with their European counterparts or the EU to ensure consumer safety here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this matter last night with the Minister for Agriculture and Food. We hope we have the powers but the Minister is very conscious of what is happening and he has been discussing the regulations on a regular basis in the past few weeks with the Food Safety Authority. There have been many scares recently and it is proper that we keep a close watch on this matter rather than assume everything is in order. There have been some unprecedented scares so rather than give a definitive answer that everything is in order, we should keep examining the situation to make sure there are no problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider a debate on food safety a good idea? The Government could outline its current understanding of the situation. This could be done on an annual basis and the status of our food safety measures could be reviewed on an ongoing basis in light of the advances in science and the increased sophistication in the processes used in the production of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a good idea. The establishment of the Food Safety Authority means we are ahead of many of our European <Col N="670" /> counterparts. This is a crucial area, and given what has happened, tension is increasing. We should be on guard rather than wait for something to happen, so I would welcome a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no news other than what I stated the other day. Over the weekend the republican movement reiterated that it believed the locations given were correct and that group is the only one with information about this matter. The information given was very sketchy, given that it did not pinpoint locations. It referred to sites, some of which are extremely large. The Garda believes the information given was given in good faith. It has not been of much use in pinpointing locations but the gardaí will continue to search.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How long will this go on? What is the timeframe envisaged by the Government for this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should spare no effort in trying to resolve this matter for the families concerned. That is the prime consideration. I am subject to correction but I believe the gardaí have given up on some of the sites while they have intensified their efforts in other locations. They still hope for success in some sites while that looks less likely in other sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he is satisfied the information was given in good faith but he has also said that some of those sites, on which information was given in good faith, have been exhaustively searched and nothing has been found. That seems to contradict his first statement. What is the basis for the Taoiseach's satisfaction that the information was given in good faith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been given no evidence. The Garda believes the information was given in good faith as it believes that those passing information to the intermediaries were involved in this matter. The intermediaries and the gardaí believe the information was given in good faith. Confirmation has been given again in the cases of certain sites while in other cases the information given was too sketchy. Deputy Currie raised this matter with me several times. I have followed it for some time and met the groups involved. I understood that there was definite information in this regard but given the passage of time and other factors, that information has not proved to be very reliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that one must now ask whether that information was given in good <Col N="671" /> faith and whether one atrocity has been compounded by another? In some cases the sites have been exhaustively searched and nothing has been found. What verification in advance of excavation did the intermediaries and the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains seek before raising the hopes of relatives?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy with the application of the regulatory principles of the broadcasting sector? On Friday last, 10 June, Mr. Tom Reddy, the Fianna Fáil press officer, telephoned a television station to instruct it that the carrying of a particular item would be contrary to the moratorium on election coverage.</P>

      <P>The Revised Estimate for the Department of the Environment and Local Government was considered yesterday in committee. No money has been provided for any of the measures recently announced by Government Ministers to deal with the housing crisis. Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to give effect to these measures or will they be implemented?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Yesterday the House adopted a motion ratifying a Council of Europe agreement to establish the Group of States Against Corruption. The purpose of the group is to monitor the performance of participating states. Will the Taoiseach say what progress has been made regarding three Bills on the Government's list of promised legislation: the Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill; the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill; and the Proceeds of Crime Bill, all of which relate to corruption and are languishing at Nos. 10, 15 and 16 on the legislative C list? How can we monitor corruption in other states when we have been so derelict in our duty regarding corruption and fraud in our own country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A High Court recommendation is being considered regarding the Proceeds of Crime Bill. The Criminal Justice (Fraud <Col N="672" /> Offences) Bill will amend and update the law on fraud offences with reference to recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission. That Bill is due in the autumn. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill will also be ready in the autumn.</P>

      <P>When will legislation to provide security of tenure to residential tenants, which was promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, be introduced? The Minister said he would examine the constitutional impediments to such legislation. Does the Taoiseach share my concern at the huge increase in evictions throughout the city of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that a commission would be established to examine this matter, and that is what is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for this debate in the context of an Immigration Bill which is making slow progress in the House and which has been characterised as a deportation Bill. It is important to have this debate before that measure is enacted. Will the Taoiseach consider amendments to the Immigration (No. 2) Bill in the context of the criticisms of Amnesty International?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business on 30 November 1997, responding to an Ombudsman's report which had criticised the way in which elderly people in nursing homes are subvented by the State and the discrimination which occurs in that regard, the Taoiseach said he was examining the regulations with a view to making changes to take account of the Ombudsman's findings. What progress has been made since 1997 in fulfilling his commitment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach confident that the Juvenile Justice Bill will be published during the summer, as promised? It has been found that the provision of Garda clearance for child care workers is contrary to the Data Protection Act and no child care workers can be given such clearance. This is causing great problems. Has the Taoiseach plans to introduce urgent legislation to deal with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A new Juvenile Justice Bill is being prepared and will be published as soon as possible. I have no proposal to introduce legislation on the second matter raised by the Deputy. I suggest the Deputy submit a question to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Approximately a month ago the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced that measures relating to domestic violence would be introduced. These are to include regional family courts, training for judges and changes to barring orders. Is the Family Law Bill, item No. 40 on the Government's list, the legislation to which the Minister of State referred? If so, when will the Bill be introduced? This is a very urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was examined by a working group in the context of the Law Reform Commission report on family courts. The working group's report was published in April and has been referred to the Courts Service Board for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <P>Yesterday at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs the Minister indicated that Ireland would participate in the peacekeeping force in Kosovo, KFOR.

        <b>:</b> I am reminded of the song, &ldquo;Poor Old Joe&rdquo;. Some 13 months ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received a report from an expert group on the law relating to sexual offences. We have heard repeated promises from the Minister that a register of sex offenders would be established and the necessary legislation introduced. Last week the Minister again promised this measure in banner headlines. When will this legislation be introduced and, in the light of the Minister's failure to introduce it, why did the Government not accept the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill which dealt with this matter?</P>

    <Title>Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Bill, 1999: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is primarily about the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the Institute of Technology in Blanchardstown. I welcome the measure and I wish the new institute every success. I specifically want to address a provision in section 11. That deals with the establishment of the Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee and the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, following the current round of local elections.</P>
      <P>As a member of the existing Dún Laoghaire VEC, I am aware of the discussions the VEC has had with the Minister for Education and Science and his officials regarding this matter over the course of the past year. The problem that arises goes back to the breaking up of the old Dublin County Council and the establishment of three new councils in Dublin &ndash; Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</P>
      <P>I recall the debate on the legislation at that time when I proposed specific amendments so that vocational education committees should be established to correspond to the new county councils. At that time I was told it was the Government's intention to introduce separate vocational education legislation which would provide for the reorganisation of the vocational education system. I was also told that the situation of the vocational education committees in Dublin would be addressed in that context. That did not happen, however, and, following the 1999 local elections, we now find ourselves in a situation where before the publication of section 11 of this Bill there was literally no statutory provision for the appointment of the Dún Laoghaire VEC or the County Dublin VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in this Bill the Minister is proposing that the currently elected Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will <Col N="677" /> appoint the Dún Laoghaire VEC. It is also proposed that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council will jointly appoint an enlarged 16-member County Dublin VEC. I understand that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will appoint two members, with seven each being appointed by the other two county councils.</P>
    <P>This is a stop-gap measure. Over the course of the past year or two the case has been put to the Minister that he should at least have provided for the establishment of a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC before the 1999 local elections and before the appointment of new vocational education committees. This would have corresponded to the existing Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county area. I am extremely disappointed that he has not done so.</P>
    <P>I want to explain the kind of difficulties that will now arise from the arrangement which is proposed in the Bill. That is, the appointment by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council of a VEC which will have responsibility for only about half of its administrative area. In addition, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will appoint only a minority of members on the County Dublin VEC which will be responsible for the remainder of the area.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire VEC, which is to be appointed under this arrangement, will correspond in area only to the old Dún Laoghaire borough. The boundary of that borough is now quite outdated. Areas which are naturally contiguous to Dún Laoghaire and part of the wider Dún Laoghaire area are excluded from it. I am referring to areas such as Shankill and Cabinteely as well as parts of Ballybrack, Sallynoggin and Glenageary, all of which consider themselves to be part of the wider Dún Laoghaire area.</P>
    <P>The two VEC schools in Dundrum and the one in Stillorgan, which are part of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county area, will remain part of the Dublin County VEC, even though they are part and parcel of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county. The non-school services provided by the VEC, such as the youth service and adult education, will, strictly speaking, only be provided to those within the Dún Laoghaire borough area by the Dún Laoghaire VEC. I understand, however, that some practical arrangements have been entered into by both vocational education committees whereby some of those services in the old county area will be provided by the Dún Laoghaire VEC.</P>
    <P>A student living in Shankill, for example, who wishes to apply for a scholarship, will have to apply to the Dublin County VEC. If that student wants to see a VEC officer to pursue the scholarship application, he or she will have to travel to Tallaght to do so, rather than to the county town of Dún Laoghaire where the VEC is located. There are all kinds of practical reasons why the arrangement that is being proposed in the Bill is quite <Col N="678" /> unsatisfactory. As we are dealing with Second Stage of this Bill, I ask the Minister to reconsider his position on establishing a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC. I do not know his timetabling arrangements for the Bill, but the annual general meeting of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to which I am pleased to have been re-elected, will take place this day week and there is not, therefore, a great deal of time for this matter to be dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Committee Stage of this Bill will be taken between now and then. I ask the Minister to amend the provisions of the Bill to establish a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC. I appreciate that the establishment of separate vocational education committees corresponding to the Fingal County Council and the South Dublin County Council may be a different matter and there may be other matters that must be considered in that context, and I am not making a case in that regard. As I understand it, there are, however, no practical reasons a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC cannot be established and this Bill amended this week before the AGM of the county council next Thursday so that the county council, when it meets, will be in a position to appoint a VEC for the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area.</P>
      <P>There is also another reason the timing of this Bill is coincidental. The current chief executive officer of the VEC is due to retire shortly and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him for his many years of outstanding work for the people of Dún Laoghaire and the successive vocational education committees he has served. The establishment of a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC would coincide with the appointment of a new VEC by the county council and also with the appointment of a new chief executive officer by the Local Appointments Commission. I ask the Minister to provide for that as it is important to avoid the confusion I described.</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals specifically with the County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire vocational education committees. The range of services provided by the Dún Laoghaire VEC are impressive. There are currently approximately 1,600 students in three colleges, the college in Sallynoggin, the senior college in Dún Laoghaire and the college in Cumberland Street, the majority of whom are pursuing PLC courses. There is a large demand for places in the three schools and a large number of applications have been submitted. In each case there is scope for expansion of the physical facilities that are available to the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VEC put a proposal to the Minister and his Department recently that the old Town Hall in Blackrock should be reconverted into a senior college in Blackrock to cater for a total of 600 students. A range of computer courses are currently being provided in part of the Town Hall building. That proposal was put to the Minister, <Col N="679" /> with the agreement of the county council, which owns the building, and it is prepared to make the building available to the VEC if the Department of Education and Science puts up the necessary funding for its renovation to make it suitable for an educational building. The estimated cost involved is approximately £1.5 million. That building would cater for approximately 600 students in an area where there is a sizeable computer and software industry. It is important to provide such an educational facility, which could provide graduates for that industry and meet the big demand for such course places.</P>
    <P>This proposal is supported by the local community in Blackrock and, in particular, by the Blackrock Chamber of Commerce, which has played a lead role in pressing for the establishment of a specific college based in Blackrock Town Hall. While this does not come under the Minister's specific remit as Minister for Education and Science, I am sure he would be interested to know that such a proposal would also have the added advantage of protecting a fine building and would ensure that part of the building that is in a state of semi-dereliction would be brought into active use as a building, and that would be a matter of great pride for the local community.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the senior college based in Dún Laoghaire at Eblana Avenue has made an application to the Department for an extension of its facility in Eblana Avenue to cater for a further 200 students. The senior college in Dún Laoghaire is currently renting seven rooms across the road in the old Christian Brothers school. The senior college has a site and it is possible to extend the existing VEC building at Eblana Avenue to cater for a further 200 students. It would save the VEC the expense of having to rent accommodation. Apart from the educational advantage of providing additional places and the advantage to the school from a development point of view, it would also be welcomed in the town of Dún Laoghaire. It would contribute to the general upgrading of the town centre, some of which is now under way as a result of other developments which are taking place. This would make a welcome addition to the life of the centre of the town. I ask the Minister to give favourable and speedy consideration to these proposals.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware the Minister is on record as stating he is anxious to increase the number of places that are available for third level students and, in particular, for the post-leaving certification sector. These are specific proposals in an area where there is a high demand for college places and where there would be a good return on investment educationally and physically. I urge the Minister to give it early and urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>The VEC in Dún Laoghaire predominantly deals with the post-leaving certificate sector. In many ways the schools in Dún Laoghaire VEC were pioneers in developing post leaving certifi<Col N="680" /> cate courses and have done so with great enthusiasm, enterprise and efficiency. Great credit is due to the management and staff of those schools for the development of those courses. I must, however, express some personal regret that by and large the second level element of the VEC's role in Dún Laoghaire has virtually petered out at this stage. There are now only a very small number of second level students within the VEC schools in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>That pattern is not unique. Many VEC schools are continuing to develop as PLC colleges and the second level dimension of those schools has been gradually eroded, but that is no fault of the schools. To some extent there has been a drift from second level schooling away from many of the VEC schools. A strategic decision will have to be taken at some point as to whether specific vocational education committees or VEC schools will be involved in second level education. It is undesirable that vocational education committees are involved in second level education but fighting a losing battle to retain student numbers and maintain their presence in the second level sphere. Some thought needs to be given to that area. If it is the view that VEC schools should continue to be involved in second level education, they must be provided with the assistance to enable them to do so. Account will have to be taken of the intake of students to those schools, the educational levels of attainment of those students and the difficulty that poses for many of the schools. If this issue is not addressed, in four or five years' time, a demand may develop for the provision of the kind of second level education which is being, and has been, provided very well by many VEC schools but which is now gradually being lost to the second level education system. Before we reach the stage of having to reinvent the wheel in a few years' time, somebody needs to examine the existing wheel to determine what needs to be done to ensure its retention or disengagement from second level education, if that is the intention.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable to allow the drift, which appears to be taking place, to continue. Many schools involved in second level education at VEC level are unsure about their future in that area. From a policy point of view, the Department and the vocational education committees concerned need to clarify this for schools so they can proceed with a degree of confidence in what they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to focus on the educational needs of regional technical colleges in the greater Dublin area and, more importantly in my case, in the area outside the capital which extends into neighbouring constituencies. This debate provides an opportunity to Members to refer to the educational needs in their respective regions, needs which are changing dramatically and which must provide for the competition likely to arise in the marketplace for future third level graduates. We are fortunate at <Col N="681" /> present that there are ample opportunities for our population although there is no guarantee this will be the case in the future. However, it is timely to reflect on what is happening in the educational arena and how we are responding. For example, to what extent are we responding to those students who do not excel academically and how are we ensuring they manage when they go on to third level? Have we made adequate provision for them to be able to compete in that arena?</P>
      <P>The number of opportunities which arise for students with a technical qualification is far greater than some years ago, and this will continue to be an area of great attraction. It will provide ready access to employment for the foreseeable future. Substantial training is being carried out within industry and regional technical college courses are also preparing students for employment. A great deal needs to be examined in this area in terms of assessing the needs of the various industries being established throughout the country with a view to giving students a high level of competence to cope with competition. It will also give them a much greater chance of gaining access to that employment in the first instance, rather than spending a long period in training. Instead, the firms involved will be able to give a greater preference to those with a propensity to work in technical areas and they will be given a head start.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with current educational needs as opposed to those of a few years ago. There is a need for greater liaison between universities and regional colleges and a great deal of work is taking place in that area. In Maynooth we are fortunate to have a national university which is now responding to the technical requirements obvious to everybody. I do not know if the education system responded quickly enough in that area. For the past five or six years, industry has been identifying technical needs which have not necessarily been responded to in the shortest possible time. If we do not make a reasonably dramatic response to the technical needs of industry, unfortunately it will not invest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been fortunate to inherit a great legacy of investment in education and investors saw this country as a place where they could be assured of high calibre graduates from second and third level. However, as time goes on the standard and degree of competition gets higher. If we want to continue to attract the type of investment we have been fortunate enough to attract in the past few years, we must double our investment in education. The background to this is important. In the past 20 years this country operated on a budget deficit. We now have a budget surplus and it is imperative we recognise that what was sufficient to meet requirements in those days is not sufficient to meet requirements in this era. We need to consider investment in education in a vastly different light. If we do not do that, our population will be disheartened because we will be seen as not responding quickly <Col N="682" /> enough and those who consider this country as a base for investment will see it as an indication that we are not as serious as we should be.</P>
    <P>Our educational needs will change dramatically. The Minister must accept that there must be a greater bias towards technical qualifications and on-course training. Most institutes of technology are conversant with this issue and are establishing contacts with industry. However, the degree to which this has happened so far is minuscule compared to what will be required in the future. A greater emphasis will have to be placed on meeting the requirements of industry. That does not necessarily mean that academic subjects will go by the wayside. An academic grounding will remain a necessity but it should be recognised that, if we are to achieve the degree of employment necessary in the future, we must invest accordingly.</P>
    <P>Our population is increasing, in complete contradiction of the experts' gloom and doom predictions five or ten years ago that all our schools would be closed by now and our population would be further reduced in line with European trends. They forgot we have always exported our new generations and never had to cater for them ourselves until now. In the past four or five years that population has not emigrated but has made a very valuable contribution to our economy because it has had the necessary technical skills and competence to gain employment at home. I know it is a hackneyed expression, but since I entered the Dáil, which was not today or yesterday, we have heard that our greatest investment is our young people. That was all very well, but we did not have them at home. However, they are here now and, as a result, we must provide for them and their descendants. A population cycle occurs over a very short period &ndash; services usually need to be duplicated every 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to look back over what we have done and assess the situation. I saw a prediction that our population is likely to reach 4.2 million by 2004; in fact, it could be even greater. In that environment it will be necessary to redouble our efforts. The 35,000 people who would have left the country every year and are now remaining here will give rise to an accumulated increased demand. We are all grateful for the improvements in our economy, which could continue to grow for quite some time into the future. However, we must recognise the need to provide the structures and parameters required for a good grounding in academic and technical education.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of growth in my constituency in recent years. Many of our secondary schools have been accommodated in prefab accommodation over the past 15 or 16 years. Fortunately, times have changed. Students, parents and teachers should not be expected to accept that standard of accommodation today. Unfortunately, we still have a few prefabs. I hope measures will be put in place to deal with that problem as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> I request the Minister to take on board the ever growing needs of that increasing population. It is a hugely important and pertinent issue. It would be wrong and frivolous of me not to draw attention to it because the population growth in County Kildare is a microcosm of the national population growth. The structural problems arising in Kildare will be replicated throughout the country over the next few years.</P>
    <P>We have not yet come to grips with the necessity to ensure that second level students have an equal opportunity to enter third level institutions. I do not know how the Minister can address that, other than by providing remedial education, reducing pupil-teacher ratios and ensuring a good quality of life is available to families, regardless of their address and environment, although that is a matter for other Departments. We must tackle the issue on a number of levels to ensure that every child has the opportunity to progress from primary to secondary level and on to third level. We should look at the reasons that prevent some children from achieving their best.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous requests for a regional college in north Kildare. We have brought that to the attention of the Minister and his predecessors on several occasions. We have not yet achieved the distinction of a positive response but we hope that will be the case at some stage in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Some people suggest this need can be met by other institutions on the periphery of the area, such as those in Blanchardstown, Carlow, Athlone and Navan. That is not necessarily the case. The regional colleges should be located in the areas in which there has been investment in industries which require high quality technical education, having regard to population trends. It is not a sufficient response to say that adequate means are being provided to institutions in other locations to meet the educational needs of the region. One might conclude the area's needs are being met when one looks at a graph on paper. However, an area's needs are met when an institution is located in that area which can meet the educational requirements of that area which result from the type of growth there. The industrial sector will then have an opportunity to liaise directly with the educationalists and they can co-operate to provide for these needs.</P>
    <P>We have not had a positive response so far. The Minister must take on board the views expressed by many educationalists in Kildare in recent years in regard to the future technical needs arising from the investment in that area. When that is done and the area has a regional college, we will have provided for our students a variety of educational options which will provide long-term benefits for the whole education system and the region. A regional college would be a long-term investment in the education system. It would be of tremendous value to the region and would provide a variety of educational options for students.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> To a large extent we provided for educational needs in the past and we did reasonably well. Before that, however, year in year out our people had to emigrate without the benefit of an education to equip them for the life ahead and consequently many had to take menial jobs. We have the opportunity now to invest in education and we should not fail to provide for it in the future. We have been fortunate to come of age at a time when information technology became readily available. We should ensure that we do not miss that opportunity. We should provide for the projected population in the next 20 years and should not have difficulty in so doing in the present economic climate. If we do that we will have invested well, however, if we fail to do that, future generations will judge us.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the position in the region I represent. The Department of Education and Science has an ongoing method of assessing educational need, however, it does not respond as quickly as I would like it to respond. I would not like the Minister to get the impression that everything is rosy in the garden, because it is not, in particular the provision for second level education. County Kildare is experiencing a dramatic population increase and has a huge requirement in terms of second level education which ultimately will lead to a demand for third level places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents a major stage in the development of an institution which will make a major contribution to developing and supporting educational opportunity in Dublin and the country as a whole. As has been outlined, the institute is already operating and its first intake of students will be on site next September. The Bill will allow the institute to operate on the same statutory basis as other institutes and this will enable the institute to develop fully over the coming years. I acknowledge the very positive support for the institute expressed by Deputies from all sides, particularly recognition of the excellent work carried out by the establishment board's acting director and all the staff working on the project. They have achieved an immense amount in a short period and they will be remembered in the history of higher education for the vision and ability they have brought to realising the ambitious objectives set for them. It was unfortunate that Deputy Higgins on behalf of the Labour Party made a number of comments on the Government's performance in relation to the institute in Blanchardstown, which was somewhat unfair. It took this Government to establish what is now the largest third level building project in the country which is informed by a truly progressive approach to expanding access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the change of Government, there was rhetoric on the Blanchardstown institute of technology but no money was allocated, there was no serious planning, no site was purchased, no building designed, no staff recruited, no courses <Col N="685" /> developed and no community outreach plan for the institute. The rhetoric had been there for a long time, but this Government provided the funding of £20 million, the critical factor. People can rubbish £20 million as if it was nothing but it was provided for an area that sorely needed such an institute. I am a little disappointed at the absurd attacks by the Labour Party on the progress of the institute. At one stage it attacked us in relation to the staff who were not physically working in Blanchardstown because of shortage of accommodation, but we eventually got accommodation. That kind of nit-picking is unfair and unjustified.</P>
    <P>Blanchardstown institute of technology will be a great educational institution and it will be an example to everyone on how one can genuinely commit to expanding access and opportunity to high quality higher education.</P>
    <P>I take on board the comments made by other Deputies. Let me assure Deputy Durkan that investment in capital projects for primary and second level schools in County Kildare is at an unprecedented high level. His constituency colleague, Deputy McCreevy, Minister for Finance, also has a keen interest in the educational needs of County Kildare.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the past few years very strong representations were made to me on behalf of the racegoer by such esteemed Members as Deputy McGahon and the Ministers for Finance and Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputies McCreevy and McDaid. The bookmakers made representations to me that their business was under serious threat and that it would be desirable to improve the position of the Irish racegoer because the Irish horse racing industry and the Irish horse breeding industry is a very important part of our economy. The bookmakers made the point that competitiveness of their business was being seriously threatened by the growth and promotion in the Irish media of offshore tax-free telephone betting services. In order to counteract the effect of these developments on our heretofore buoyant betting market and to best protect the Exchequer revenue from this source into the long-term future the Minister for Finance proposed in last December's Budget Statement that the rate of excise tax to be applied to off-course betting should be reduced from 10 to 5 per cent with effect from 1 July 1999. This change is provided for in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>In the Budget Statement the Minister recognised that the reduction in off-course betting tax would have implications for the on-course betting levy of 5 per cent which the Irish Horseracing Authority, IHA, and Bord na gCon collect on bookmaker betting at racecourses. Both bodies have in recent years, with the help of substantial Exchequer funding, invested in improved facilities to attract new patrons. One way of encouraging punters to attend race meetings to place their bets is the lower rate of tax-levy applied on racecourses. In order to retain the differential and ensure that the increased attendances of recent years are maintained and improved upon, it would be necessary to reduce or preferably eliminate the 5 per cent on-course betting levy. The elimination of the levy would involve the loss of revenue at 1988 levels of more than £4.4 million and £31.1 million annually to the IHA and Bord na gCon respectively.</P>

    <P>Arising from the development work and strategic planning being carried out by these bodies the revenue from this source is increasing year by year and both organisations are confidently predicting continued increases in future years. The <Col N="687" /> proposal to eliminate the 5 per cent on-course betting levy could only be proceeded with if satisfactory alternative arrangements are made to replace the loss in revenue. It is estimated that those arrangements would need to provide for rates of charges which would yield revenue in the order of £6 million at projected 1999 levels of activity. This income would be divided between the IHA and Bord na gCon on a 4:1 basis.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the consultations which took place with industry interests and conclusions reached within the Departments, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I jointly agreed and announced the following new measures. There will be a betting turnover charge of 0.3 per cent to be paid by all bookmakers operating at horse and greyhound race meetings to yield annual revenue of the order of £0.27 million and which will be collected by the IHA and Bord na gCon respectively. Charges will be set by the IHA on bookmakers &ndash; and/or bookmakers' pitches &ndash; or betting shops at horseracing fixtures to yield of the order of £0.37 million and will be collected by the IHA or by the racecourses on behalf of the IHA.</P>
    <P>For off-course bookmakers there will be a betting turnover charge at the rate of 0.3 per cent to be paid by all high street bookmakers which will yield annual revenue of the order of £1.7 million. There will be an additional flat-rate charge of £2,000 levied on all high street betting shops which will yield annual revenue of the order of £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>Both of these charges will be collected on behalf of the IHA and Bord na gCon by the Revenue Commissioners and paid over regular intervals to the IHA who will then forward 20 per cent of the moneys received from these sources to Bord na gCon.  The annual grants-in-aid to the IHA and Bord na gCon will be increased by a sum equivalent to 0.3 per cent of the off-course betting turnover and divided between the two bodies giving, at current levels of betting, an annual increase in the grant-in-aid to the IHA of £1.2 million and to Bord na gCon of £0.5 million. The IHA and Bord na gCon will be asked to reach an agreement with the racecourses and greyhound tracks on a contribution from them which will yield £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the on-course betting levy to 0 per cent and the introduction of turnover and flat-rate charges on off-course and on-course bookmakers require legislation and the relevant provisions amending the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1958, are including in the Bill we are considering today.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give power to the IHA and Bord na gCon to alter the new on-course betting turnover charge from time to time subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and to set and alter the on-course flat-rate bookmaker charges at their own discretion. The new off-course betting turnover and betting shop charges may be amended by the Minister for <Col N="688" /> Agriculture and Food with the consent of the Minister for Finance. There are limits to the increases that will be allowed under the Bill which are 5 per cent maximum on the turnover charges and £5,000 on the flat-rate charges, although I would not envisage any substantive changes for some time.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association put forward proposals for the development of the thoroughbred horse breeding sector and suggested that the cost of the measures could be part financed by a statutory levy on all the foals registered in the approved stud book maintained by Weatherby's Ireland. While it was decided not to proceed with that aspect of the proposal at that time, it is considered prudent to take this opportunity to include in the Irish Horseracing Industry Act an enabling provision to empower the IHA to introduce such a levy in the future if the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>Heads of a Bill to replace completely the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, were approved by the Government in 1996. The drafting of the Bill was delayed pending the resolution of complex legal issues which arose. As the Bill is not now expected to be published for some time, I decided to bring some of the more urgent items which could be drafted quickly and to include them in this Bill. These are to empower Bord na gCon to establish subsidiary companies and allow it or any of its subsidiaries to enter into joint ventures or take shares in or become a member of another company subject to ministerial consent; remove the ban on tote credit betting imposed under section 20 of the 1958 Act; allow for the introduction and regulation of on-course betting shops at greyhound tracks and the collection of levy, turnover and flat-rate charges on the same basis as that being provided for betting shops on horse racecourses; provide general power for Bord na gCon to introduce charges for services etc.; and increase the level of fines which may be applied in respect of offences mentioned in the 1958 Act. Similar measures were introduced for the IHA in the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of minor and technical amendments to Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, and the Betting Act, 1931, as well as a small liberalisation of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, to allow bars at greyhound tracks to stay open for up to two hours after the last race instead of half an hour.</P>
    <P>The only direct charge on the Exchequer in these proposals is the increase in the grants-in-aid to the IHA and Bord na gCon by a sum equivalent to 0.3 per cent of the off-course betting turnover which will cost £1.7 million annually. This measure will be dealt with in the Department's Vote and is not referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The horseracing industry is very important with the horse racing sector providing 25,000 jobs as well as substantial benefits for tourism, rural communities and the economy. The main and most immediately noticeable feature of the recent development of this sector is the creation of the <Col N="689" /> many new and upgraded racecourse facilities. The provision of better facilities and racing for the general public continues to be one of the prime objectives for all racecourses together with improving the working conditions for people working within racing. In 1996 the Irish Horseracing Authority produced its five year strategic plan. The establishment of the capital development fund was the most important element of it. The fund, which has been increased twice since it was set up, will see the investment in racecourses of a total of £60 million over a short period. Grants in the region of £21 million for the upgrading of racecourses have already been approved involving some assistance for almost every race course in the State. Dundalk racecourse will receive assistance in the not too distant future. This substantial investment is working well for the betterment of the industry, as can be seen from its performance over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Irish racing enjoyed another excellent year in 1998. The upward trend in betting, attendance, prize money and sponsorship of recent years continued and in virtually every area of performance the targets set in the strategic plan were surpassed: total betting was up by more than 10 per cent, attendances were up by 5 per cent to well in excess of one million with sponsorship and prize money showing significant increases of 15.3 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>Obviously the industry needs to build further on the performance of recent years if it is to achieve the long-term targets set by the authority in its plan. Much more needs to be done to make the industry more successful commercially. The authority has taken a number of initiatives aimed at improving the returns which owners get from their investment in racing. Last year the prize fund exceeded £16 million, rising to £20 million. I notice some owners in this House who are involved in syndicates. At least one of those syndicates is doing reasonably well but, in general, owners lose money through this hobby.</P>
    <P>Last year was the first year of the new sponsorship incentive scheme which contributed to a growth in sponsorship of more than 15 per cent. The authority intends to expand the scheme this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the Government's commitment to the horseracing industry. This support takes many forms but perhaps the most tangible is the direct Exchequer investment which is channelled through the Irish Horseracing Authority. Over the past five years the Government has invested in excess of £42 million through this route. This year will see the investment of a further £14.85 million of Exchequer funds in the industry &ndash; a considerable sum. Capital investments aimed at upgrading and enhancing facilities at greyhound tracks have resulted in patrons enjoying a level of comfort consistent with Bord na gCon's objective of creating and sustaining a new positive image of the greyhound industry as an attractive and exciting night time <Col N="690" /> entertainment business. The turnaround in the industry started with the development of a modern stadium in Shelbourne Park in 1995 and the introduction in 1996 of a colourful, professional and forward thinking approach to the marketing of greyhound racing. Over the past two years, Shelbourne Park has become well known as the place to go for a fun night out with a difference. There is only one problem for Members, it meets on a Wednesday night and we tend to have a vote here at 8.30 p.m. For anybody who is free on a Wednesday night, it is a nice place to visit and excellent food is available. Thousands of new racegoers have enjoyed the buzz and excitement of Shelbourne Park &ndash; the modern face of greyhound racing in Ireland, offering the highest standards of patron comfort and hospitality available anywhere. The success of the development and marketing campaign is apparent in the continued dramatic increase in attendances and betting figures since 1995.</P>
    <P>Shelbourne Park is only the start of a lengthy process that is needed on the capital development and marketing side of the industry. Similar improvements were achieved at Tralee, Thurles, and Waterford in 1997-98. Work has commenced on a brand new stadium for Cork, where I officially turned the sod for the development just a few months ago. There are plans for developments at other tracks, including Harolds Cross, Dundalk, Limerick, Newbridge, Mullingar, Galway and Kilkenny with the possibility of a further development at Shelbourne Park. The combination of top class facilities, aided by effective marketing, appears to be the key to the successful promotion and development of the greyhound industry in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry began in 1998 in a position of strength with dramatic increases having been achieved in attendances, tote and bookmaker turnover. The strong results of 1997 were surpassed by an exceptional performance in 1998 with all key performance indicators showing significant increases on the previous year. Total betting turnover was up over 10 per cent with tote turnover at almost £10 million, recording a 17 per cent increase, while bookmaker betting turnover at £22 million increased by 8 per cent. Total attendances increased by nearly 10 per cent, to 750,000. These increases augur well for the long-term viability of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply committed to the development of the greyhound industry. This support takes many forms but perhaps the most tangible is the direct Exchequer investment which is channelled through Bord na gCon. In the last five years the Government has invested £17 million through this route. This year will see the investment of almost £5 million of Exchequer funds in the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>This legislation will help to underpin both the horse and greyhound racing industries into the long-term future, and on that basis I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes this Bill. We have no problem with it in principle, but there are matters of detail to which we will return on Committee Stage. I thank the Minister for his speech. We are pleased that initiatives we commenced in Government are coming to fruition and that the horseracing and greyhound industries are thriving. They are important industries from a business, employment and leisure point of view. There is a direct connection between the prosperity in the economy and the number of people anxious to have a night out at the dogs or a day at the races. The 10 per cent increase in betting and the increase in attendances at greyhound meetings and at racecourses is a sign of a thriving industry. Deputy Deenihan, who has a deep interest in and knowledge of the greyhound industry, will share time with me.</P>
      <P>The Irish Horseracing Authority has done an excellent job. It is appropriate that I pay tribute to Noel Ryan whose untimely death deprived the horseracing industry of a key figure. I knew him when he was a principal officer in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I worked closely with him. We were all shocked at his death this year. He and his staff brought forward a new blueprint for racing. That is one of the primary reasons an industry which employs 25,000 people is prospering to such a degree.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has a strong interest in the development of the County Cork race track at Mallow. I have an equally strong interest in the development of Limerick racecourse at Greenmount, Patrickswell. There is no racing in my city or county now because the old track at Greenmount is closed and the new track is not yet ready for opening. I want the Minister to note that the development is going well. The new city ring road by-pass carriageway will skirt the boundary of the new track and access will be easy. After the ground has settled and the track is in a racing condition next year, I have no doubt Limerick will be restored to its rightful place as one of the primary centres of the racing industry.</P>
      <P>From a leisure point of view, the racing and greyhound industries are becoming increasingly important. Not only are increasing numbers of Irish people attending race meetings and greyhound meetings, but many tourists tend to seek out a night at the dogs or a day at the races. That is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, visitors and citizens continue to expect higher standards. People will not accept the tatty old facilities which were available in the tracks sponsored by Bord na gCon. While Shelbourne Park has had a massive upgrade and is in line with the best of facilities in the southern states of America, where they race dogs as well, other tracks are not up to that standard. The track in Limerick city is badly in need of investment. I am pleased the Minister mentioned it as one of the tracks which will be developed, but it seems to be very far down the priority list. Given that the headquarters of Bord na gCon was <Col N="692" /> located in Limerick in the past and that the greyhound industry is strong there and in neighbouring counties, the Limerick track should have a higher priority.</P>
    <P>Turning to the provisions of the Bill, I have some difficulty with the manner in which the Minister has brought forward his proposals. I agree that the availability of facilities to bet overseas by way of the Internet is a major threat to Irish off-course and on-course betting. I agreed with the proposals brought forward by the Minister for Finance in last year's budget. We did not contest those provisions because we realised they were necessary. All of us on this side were lobbied by the industry and the case was valid. We also agreed with the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food that most of the financial shortfall to the Exchequer would be made up in other ways.</P>
    <P>This legislation seeks to implement alternative funding methods for the industry. I have a difficulty with some of them. Before adopting a hard position on them, perhaps the Minister would deal with them in greater detail. As I understand it, off-course betting tax was reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the Finance Act, 1999. To maintain the differential with on-course betting tax, the 5 per cent excise on on-course betting was abolished. This is being replaced by a 0.3 per cent tax on the turnover of the course. I have an occasional bet. As I understood it, one has the option to pay tax on the stake or on the winnings. The Minister has decided to have the best of both worlds because he will put the excise on the turnover. My understanding is that if one wagers £10 one can pay the tax of £1 up front. On the other hand, if a person chooses tax on winnings he will get, say, £100 and pay £10 tax, in addition to receiving £10. However, the Bill proposes that with regard to a £10 wager which returns £100, or a total of £110 to the punter, the excise will not be applied to the stake or the winnings but to both and, in addition, a 0.3 per cent levy will be applied to the turnover of the course. That is onerous, although at 0.3 per cent, it is not too onerous.</P>
    <P>The Bill also introduces an enabling section whereby the 0.3 per cent levy can be increased to up to 5 per cent. It is customary for Bills of this kind to contain enabling sections and it is customary to give some latitude to the Minister of the day to increase such a levy in line with inflation. However, in this instance the Minister seeks a discretion amounting to 1,666 per cent, which is outrageous. The latitude between a turnover tax of 0.3 per cent and 5 per cent is enormous. While a proposed tax of 0.3 per cent is acceptable to all in the House, we could take a different view if the Minster were to advise us that, within a short period he would increase it to 5 per cent. Far too much latitude has been provided here. It is customary in enabling sections of a Bill to perhaps double or treble the charge, but to propose an increase of more than 1,600 per cent calls for a <Col N="693" /> level of tolerance beyond anything which has been sought by way of regulation in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes a new flat rate charge on bookmaker shops, with a suggested threshold of £2,000 per shop. That is fair enough. I presume there were discussions with the industry and that it accepted this measure. However, again, the Minster seeks to increase this sum up to £5,000 by way of regulation, which would be an increase of 150 per cent. That is a more reasonable demand than the proposal on increasing the turnover tax rate. If it is to be negotiated following full consultation with the industry I do not have a problem with it.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for an increase in the annual grant-in-aid fee to the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon. There is a tenuous commitment that a contribution will be sought from racecourses to fund this. People are free to go to the races seven days a week. This includes attending dog races if they can find enough venues. However, I do not see why this leisure activity should be cross subsidised by taxpayers. There is an element here of a charge on taxpayers being introduced without a corresponding commitment to raise a contribution from the racecourses. Will the Minister indicate the discussions he has had with the racecourses to ensure that the contribution he expects from them will materialise?</P>
    <P>I also agree with the provision to empower the IHA to introduce a thoroughbred foal registration levy to fund the development of the thoroughbred horse breeding sector. That is a way of procuring funds and it also provides a mechanism for further strict regulation of that industry. I understand it is the Minster's intention to introduce this at a level of £600 per foal. Is this the maximum imposition or will the Minister apply a fixed levy following the enactment of this legislation, or will he retain power by regulation to increase this?</P>
    <P>I am also pleased the Minister has taken the opportunity to upgrade the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, and to introduce extra flexibility for Bord na gCon. When the Bill is passed the board will be able to get involved in joint ventures and subsidiary companies. It will be able to undertake the kinds of activities the Irish horseracing industry is enabled to do under the Act of 1994. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to liberalise in a small way the Intoxicating Liquor Act. However, given that his colleague, the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has stated his intention to introduce substantive legislation on the licensing laws, the Minister should have left that aspect to him. The Minister proposes to allow bars at greyhound tracks, which may remain open for half an hour after the last race, to remain open for two hours after the last race. That is fair enough as far as it goes, but it appears to be a pre-emptive strike in the face of the impending introduction of substantive legislation on the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> The provision also has implications for pub owners located within the vicinity of tracks. At the track in Limerick there are five pubs which visitors frequent. If facilities are to be upgraded at tracks and if visitors can stay on for two hours there will be a transfer of trade from the local publicans to Bord na gCon, which may or may not be justified. If greyhound racing is being promoted by the industry as being the total night out, where one can bring one's wife, girlfriend or the family, people may want bar facilities afterwards, especially in places such as Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium, where food is served also. If people want to have a meal after the last race the half hour restriction on serving drinks is unreasonable. However, it appears the Bill is being used to implement change without adequate debate. I do not oppose this provision, but the attention of the vintners should be drawn to it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the 0.3 per cent turnover tax on betting. The section also provides for the introduction and regulation of betting offices at greyhound tracks by Bord na gCon and for the equivalent of the new rate high street excise duty of 5 per cent on betting at those offices or off-course type bets in the betting ring to go to the board rather than the Revenue Commissioners. I have no difficulty with providing that the board be obliged to return to the industry rather than the Revenue Commissioners. However, in this instance the Minister appears to be dropping the turnover tax rate of 0.3 per cent in favour of a rate of 5 per cent. This may indicate his intention that the 0.3 per cent rate will not last long and that he will increase it to 5 per cent. The provision is drafted ambiguously so I am not sure if I am interpreting it correctly.</P>
    <P>It is proper to increase the penalties, as proposed under section 11. There is not much point in introducing legislation of this kind and setting obligations on people unless penalties apply to ensure they comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with section 12. There should not be a ban on tote credit betting at tracks and I have no difficulty with the Minster's proposal to remove it.</P>
    <P>In general terms we welcome the Bill. It introduces a number of necessary changes for the protection of the industry. At the same time it introduces proposals for alternative funding arrangements to protect the Exchequer and to ensure that, to a very large degree, the industry continues to be funded by itself. We accept that and welcome the Bill, subject to the reservations to which I have referred and which we will address on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time with me. I also thank the Minister for introducing the Bill. Presumably he had no other option because he had to implement the relevant provisions of the Finance Act. Nevertheless, if affords us the opportunity to take an overview on the horse racing and greyhound indus<Col N="695" /> tries. I will confine my remarks to the greyhound industry. The two officials who are here with the Minister have played an important part in framing legislation relating to the greyhound industry over the past seven or eight years. Both have a deep knowledge of the horse and greyhound racing industries and that is reflected in this Bill and previous legislation which improved both industries.</P>
      <P>I take particular pleasure from the Bill because the provisions which I had hoped to introduce before I left office are included in it. Some provisions had been proposed by Deputy O'Shea when he was in office. They were passed on to me and I added further to them. The reason a major review of the greyhound industry did not take place related to legal advice from the Attorney General's office. I understand that this has been addressed. Will the Minister outline that advice on Committee Stage? It has been done in the past and I would like it to be made available on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, the review did not take place despite the drafting of a Bill. Much of it was based on the horse racing industry Bill. It had been well thought out and a great deal of time was spent on it but the process was disrupted by the legal advice from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I refer to the progress that was made between 1995 and 1997 and I am glad it has been continued. When I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I specifically requested that I take charge of Bord na gCon because at the time the industry was going through a bad period. It was demoralised and the principal actors within it were losing confidence in its structure. There was also a major drift in support for the industry.</P>
      <P>The previous Government had committed itself to an investment in Shelbourne Park, which no doubt was helpful, on the basis that the stadium in Harold's Cross would be sold. However, I ensured that did not happen and time has proven me to be correct because a new stadium is to be built in Harold's Cross and the land attaching to it has been valued much higher than it was a number of years ago. The fact that the Harold's Cross stadium has been retained means that not alone can it be refurbished into a fine venue to service greyhound enthusiasts in that part of Dublin city and those who travel long distances from Westmeath, Kildare etc. and who were always patrons and supporters of the stadium, it will also serve the local community and the property attaching to it is very valuable. If the decision to sell it had been implemented, it would have resulted in a major loss to the greyhound industry and the Exchequer. I am glad that the decision was reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of Shelbourne Park, evidenced by the number of people attending there, is the envy of all national sporting organisations. These organisations use the venue for major fundraising events and this confirms that the decision made <Col N="696" /> on Shelbourne Park was very wise. Last year more than £4.7 million was spent on tote betting there, which represented 47 per cent of tote betting throughout the country. That has been a major success.</P>
    <P>When I, as Minister of State, took over responsibility for the greyhound industry, one of my first actions was to meet the directors of Tralee greyhound stadium. The plan was to invest approximately £150,000 in the stadium and put a roof on the stand there. However, I realised that it would have been of little benefit not only to the greyhound fraternity in Tralee but also to the broader tourism industry. There was a great deal of reluctance among the board members at that time because they felt they may not have been able to obtain the necessary finance. However, the chairman of the board, Seán Collins, totally supported a bigger development, and this resulted in a £1.8 million investment in Tralee. That investment has proven worthwhile since then. Last year betting with bookmakers at the track amounted to £1.5 million while tote betting increased by 57 per cent. It is a critical and integral part of the Kerry tourism industry. During the summer people of all nationalities enjoy greyhound racing at Tralee stadium.</P>
    <P>The change in philosophy in 1995 which led to us looking at greyhound stadiums from a tourism and recreational point of view has driven the entire greyhound industry since. The appointment of Paschal Taggart as chairman of Bord na gCon was inspired and again highlighted the philosophy of that Government. It was a totally non-political decision, which has been proved since. He is a man of tremendous energy, foresight and commercial acumen. He has demonstrated the difference a commercial approach can make to a State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>His predecessor, Kevin Heffernan, began a root and branch review of the operations of Bord na gCon and the administration of the board is more streamlined, focused and effective than it was in the past. Both of them must take credit for what is happening. At one stage there was a leak a week from the board whereas now the board seems to work in harmony, effectively and for the good of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister turned the sod at Cork greyhound stadium some time ago. I am delighted that I first proposed that there should be a new track in Cork. I am also glad that I was part of the negotiations which resulted in the sale of land around the stadium to UCC. A sum of £3.5 million was received for it and it has made a major contribution to the provision of a new track in Cork. The Minister should remember that when he officially opens the track. He might invite me to the opening given that I was not invited to the sod turning ceremony. I was glad that I was able to give something back to the people of Cork after years of taking other things from them. In politics one must be sensitive and sometimes people's achievements in office are not remembered. Their record in office is often attacked <Col N="697" /> while their achievements are forgotten, but that is the reality of politics.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill, which include giving Bord na gCon power to establish subsidiary companies and enter joint ventures. That concept was included in the horse racing industry Bill and I felt that it should have been adopted for the greyhound industry. A subsidiary company should be attached to each track which is representative of the interests of owners, trainers, breeders and others in that community. This is most important and I advise the Minister to do it immediately. However, it should not be done on a political basis but on the basis of what is good for the industry.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with groups such as Kerry Co-Op, Golden Vale and Dairygold in the agri-food industry getting involved and making substantial investments in local tracks. The greyhound industry is still part of the supplementary income of the farming community and the agri-food industry should support the development of tracks and facilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the removal of the ban on tote, credit betting on greyhound racing, the introduction and regulation of on-course betting shops at greyhound tracks, the introduction by Bord na gCon of charges for services and increased fines for offences of non-compliance. All these measures were contained in the proposal and I am delighted that they will be implemented under section 9.</P>
    <P>An issue arises in terms of controls and appeals. Control is most important and recent events in athletics demonstrate that people are much more conscious now of true and genuine performances. I question the application of control in the greyhound industry in terms of its effectiveness and the implementation of procedures. There is a need for manpower to carry out more spot checks. It is most important that the Minister introduces legislation to set up an independent controls board. If he does not do so, I will introduce a Private Members' Bill in an effort to do so because controls are important to the credibility of the greyhound industry. When people are betting, they must feel that they are getting a fair run for their money. The control procedures should be removed from Bord na gCon and put on an independent basis. People with legal and veterinary expertise should be appointed to such a board, which should also be representative of the greyhound industry. This is a most important area and I am sure we will return to it in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding breeding policy and support for the breeding industry, there is a major shortage of good dogs at present. The Minister ensured under the last programme that money was made available for the promotion of breeding and other facilities in the greyhound industry under the heading of alternative farming measures. I ask him to ensure a similar position in the next programme because the measures were most effective in improving the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> Although it is subject to negotiation, placing levies would put much pressure on small tracks such as Listowel in terms of their survival and cashflows. I am delighted to contribute to the debate. I would have liked more time, but I welcome the initiatives and undoubtedly I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss them further. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it. I also acknowledge the work of his fine officials in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to contribute to the debate on behalf of the Labour Party. I confess that I have more than a passing interest in this matter as have some of my colleagues in the House. My area of Mullingar has a colourful background in the racing industry and it would be remiss of me not to remember with affection the late Noel Ryan who was from Mullingar. In conjunction with his colleagues on the Irish Horseracing Authority, he was one of the innovative driving forces behind the introduction of the blueprint for the development of the horseracing industry. We were shocked at his untimely passing because he had much to contribute in that area. I have no doubt that he would have remained an innovative driving force behind the development of the industry in the future. He was successful at everything to which he turned his hand. He had an impeccable track record in the Department of Justice and every other area in which he served with great distinction. We mourn his passing.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently opened what we consider is the finest facility in the country in Kilbeggan. There are now up to seven race meetings at the track and some of my Oireachtas colleagues will attend the event in Kilbeggan on Monday.</P>

      <P>We look forward to Deputy McGahon spending some of his financial largesse on Monday evening. I hope when he leaves he will be a happy punter. Undoubtedly, that will be the case because the facilities there are first class. We are delighted with the Irish Horseracing Authority's investment, which the Minister acknowledged. The track now has fine pavilion and catering areas. Numerous facilities and comforts are available to patrons and there will be further developments in the future under the guiding influence of one of the best race track managers in the country, Mr. Paddy Dunican. We look forward to the support of the Government and the horseracing authority to ensure the further developments take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> The Minister also referred to the greyhound track in Mullingar where developments are taking place. We hope Bord na gCon will continue to support the development in the centre of the town. Tuesday and Saturday nights are important nights in Mullingar and the events attract people from a wide hinterland. In recent years, major point-to-point events have been held in Slanemore and Kilkenny west. The horseracing industry is most important to the area and there were colourful characters in the industry from County Westmeath. They are well known to some Members.</P>

      <P>There are some colourful owners in syndicates which also include Oireachtas colleagues. However, as the Minister said, some of them are not very successful but one's day will come if one stays around long enough.</P>
      <P>We cannot overemphasise the importance of the horseracing and greyhound industries to the creation of employment. Approximately 25,000 people are directly employed and there are other ancillary opportunities. Every direct job creates another job indirectly and up to 50,000 people could be employed directly and indirectly in the industries. They are also important in terms of the earning potential of tourism and recreational and leisure pursuits to which people are devoting more time.</P>
      <P>What impact will the measures in the legislation have on the staff of the Irish Horseracing Authority in terms of the levy? Will it lead to redeployment? Will the provision to allow Bord na gCon establish subsidiary companies have a knock on impact? How will that be effective? Every Bill may have unforeseen consequences in the future and the concerns of staff should always be addressed at an early stage to ensure various aspects, which may not be obvious initially, are taken into account.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the Bill was the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of the reduction in the current off-course tax rate from 10 per cent to 5 per cent and the abolition of the on-course betting tax. Given the internationalisation of betting and the possibility of tax free betting on the Internet or through offshore telephone services, the Minister's decision appears all the more prudent and wise. We must face up to these technological advances. To preserve jobs in the industry and to prevent them being lost to these new services, we support the thrust of this legislation. We hope it will secure and perhaps expand employment in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned, in recent times the Irish market has been targeted by overseas book<Col N="700" /> makers offering tax free or nominal tax betting to Irish punters. Irish bookmakers were feeling the effects of unfair competition, which was placing at risk jobs and tax revenue from the industry. The Minister said 25,000 people are directly employed in the industry and they would suffer adversely were this trend to continue. Off-course betting duty excise receipts, at the current rate of 10 per cent, raised of the order of £52 million for the Exchequer in 1998. In the bad old days it was an important source of revenue which disappeared into central funds, but the Minister indicated that in the past few years the money was paid back through the Irish Horseracing Authority to ensure the upgrading, modernisation and refurbishment of facilities.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said the Minister for Agriculture and Food would arrange for the abolition of the current 5 per cent on-course betting levy, which is the purpose of this Bill. There is no tax on on-course betting at race meetings, although many people think there is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not want to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a 5 per cent levy, payable to the IHA, and there is a 10 per cent levy on away bets and betting in SP shops at racecourses, which is also payable to the IHA. That raised some £4.4 million at horse race meetings and £1.1 million at greyhound race meetings. These levies were significant for the authority.</P>
      <P>Reductions in the current rates will be partially self-financing as they are likely to improve compliance and stimulate extra business. The last reduction, which was in the early 1980s, resulted in a dramatic improvement in revenue. Some of the measures the Minister is imposing in the Bill are levies or taxes by the back door. It is no use removing tax with one hand and putting it back with the other. I will make my points about those measures later. They are not criticisms but they should be raised now to allow the Minister to consider them before Committee Stage. We accept the broad thrust of the Bill, subject to amendments we hope to make. The reduction in the rate of excise duty on off-course betting was provided for in section 117 of the Finance Act, 1999, which will have effect from a date to be appointed by ministerial order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the tax reductions for the reasons I mentioned, I have reservations about the thrust of some provisions of this legislation and their impact. The Bill is heavily weighted in favour of big bookmakers and horse breeders. Perhaps we have a tendency to defend smaller concerns. Years ago a small farmer had 40 or 50 acres but a small farmer today could have up to 150 acres; everything is relative. There is a flat rate charge of £2,000 and a betting turnover charge which varies from 0.3 per cent to 5 per cent. As Deputy Noonan said, this is a huge variation, as wide as the Gap of Dunloe, and it borders on being anti-competitive because book<Col N="701" /> makers on low incomes, operating small offices in rural areas, will eventually disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The punters might disappear more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge of £2,000 would be significant to them. Punters do disappear, the well tends to dry up more quickly for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was somewhat disingenuous in that the measures he announced in the budget have been nullified to some extent by the provisions of this Bill. We jumped for joy when we heard the tax rate was to be halved and the levy was to be reduced, but if the fine print shows that other charges are to be introduced by a circuitous route, how much farther ahead are we? We are introducing what is effectively a new tax collection system which will grant the IHA and Bord na gCon increased powers of taxation. Tax should always be precise and definite, there should be no ambiguity about it. Under the current system it was far too high but people knew the rate. Under the proposed legislation, however, the rates can vary by up to 5 per cent. No doubt this will depend on the exigencies of the industry. Once the tax is introduced, the maximum rather than the minimum will be the norm. The Minister expects the 0.3 per cent rate to operate and I do not doubt his bona fides, but previous experience shows that is an aspiration which may be circumvented.</P>
      <P>Bookmakers, especially small ones, will be far more exposed in their projected incomes than heretofore. The Minister proposes to grant fairly wide-ranging powers to the IHA and there is no in-built protection for small breeders and small town bookmakers. The Minister is not considering exemptions for people below a certain defined threshold or turnover.</P>
      <P>I examine the Bill's provisions as a barrister rather than as a public representative. Section 2 provides that the authority &ldquo;shall have all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to the performance of its functions under the Act&rdquo;. I assume &ldquo;the Act&rdquo; is the 1994 Act. Why is this provision necessary? If it is necessary, why is a retrospective provision necessary to validate the actions of the IHA under the previous Act? The powers granted to any authority, whatever its make up, should always be specific, unambiguous and clearly set out in legislation. Powers should not be so wide-ranging that no one knows what they are based on. This provision constitutes an omnipotent, plenipotentiary power and the Oireachtas should not grant such all-embracing powers to any authority. The term &ldquo;such powers as are necessary&rdquo; should be clearly defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the variation from 0.3 per cent to 5 per cent in the on-course betting levy. This is not consistent with the budget announcement by the Minister for Finance. The public perception was that on-course betting tax would be abolished. Did the Minister for Finance consult the industry prior to his budget announce<Col N="702" /> ment? He may have realised that a significant sum would be missing and that in one fell swoop he had wiped out the IHA's major source of income. It appears the proposed alternative levies in the Bill are an attempt to fill the financial vacuum that has been created. I wonder if there was prior consultation with the industry.</P>
    <P>Section 3 should confirm the rate or such other percentage not exceeding 5 per cent. Obviously the nearer to 0 per cent the better because that was the perception. Perhaps the Minister might take that into account. I realise a wide brief is being allowed in relation to the imposition of the levy, but the maximum always becomes the norm, as opposed to giving an extension to somebody to obtain a sum of money. I would have concerns in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the turnover charges payable by bookmakers on course betting. This represents the introduction of a levy through the back door in that the Minister is trying to create new sources of income to replace the levy. Was this a retrospective swoop? How much better off will people be as a result of this measure? The rate of turnover charge will vary between 0.3 per cent and 5 per cent and can be levied by the Irish Horseracing Authority. This is subject to the approval of the Minister but nevertheless the scope is too wide and gives the IHA more power to levy a tax than it has under the 1994 Act. Tax collection should always be precise but under this provision if the IHA has a bad year, the tax rate will undoubtedly increase. That is the norm. If the bucket is three-quarters empty, it has to be topped up and this is an ideal way of doing it. I am concerned about that.</P>
    <P>Section 55C, a section 4 insertion, deals with the suspension or revocation of a course betting permit if charges are not paid. Section 55C(1) gives power to revoke a permit for failure to pay charges. Section 55C(3) provides for recovery by the IHA of moneys owed under a simple contract debt. This effectively represents two bites of the cherry for the IHA. One of the sections is sufficient. Taking away a permit is a significant power and rules out the potential to earn further income, and being able to sue for the outstanding amount of the levy allows a strike on both fronts and is questionable from a legal viewpoint. I ask the Minister to focus on that area.</P>
    <P>Section 55D, another section 4 insertion, deals with the off course betting turnover tax which will be 0.3 per cent to 5 per cent. That represents another levy on off course bookies who already pay the 5 per cent, although I acknowledge that has been reduced from 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon might not agree but the discrepancy in regard to the annual charge in section 55E on SP offices of £2,000 to £5,000, as the Minister may specify by regulation, is not as wide as in the other section. I have a reservation about small town bookies. The annual charge is only loose change to the big boys, but I have seen many rural shops and other businesses close down and I would not like to think that a measure <Col N="703" /> we implement in this Bill would result in other closures. Many people, including pensioners, enjoy placing bets but they do not all have public transport to get to the major towns. Rural bookies may only open at weekends or for the big races like Cheltenham or the Grand National, and this charge may well be one they cannot carry. That is my thinking on the matter and it is consistent with my line of argument.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the thoroughbred foal levy in section 5. The levy is to be placed on every thoroughbred foal born in Ireland and it is causing angst among small Irish breeders. Nobody has lobbied me about any of the other sections but I have been lobbied in relation to this section by genuine small breeders who are concerned about it. Not every breeder is a member of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association &ndash; there are about 600 members but there are 6,000 breeders. Under this system, however, they will all have to join this private association without having any choice in the matter. Some of the breeders in the area of Mullingar, County Westmeath, are excellent. Deputy McGahon would be aware of one or two of those.</P>
    <P>The ITBA has indicated that the levy which will be placed on every thoroughbred foal born in Ireland is based on a stallion's covering fee. Will the Minister clarify that? Some people are of the view that if the stallion is priced at £500 the covering fee will be £50, or if the stallion is priced at £10,000 the fee might be only £200. Is there any proportionality between the covering fee and the levy likely to be placed on the foal? I realise the maximum amount currently set out in legislation is £600 but the amount in this case should be set out in legislation also because a breeder at the lower end of the market might find it out of proportion. Will the small breeder pay the levy for the large breeder?</P>
    <P>I understand all breeders will now become members of the ITBA, but what will happen if breeders do not want to join? The mandatory levy was sought by the ITBA to replace an existing voluntary levy which was collected at the point of sale. The amount collected from voluntary sales moves up and down annually reflecting the state of the industry and ability to pay, but the mandatory levy will be collected at foal registration and is on a scale basis. It will cost the average national hunt or jump breeder twice as much to register a foal &ndash; it will increase from £70 to over £150. I bow to the Minister's knowledge of horses but that is a bit of a burden, especially on a national hunt foal which may not even make the price for a stallion fee at the sales &ndash; perhaps £400 or £500. Those figures were given to me by breeders who are fairly clued in to what is going on and who are concerned about it. I am reflecting that concern.</P>
    <P>Some people believe the ITBA is regularising their income and will control the distribution of the balance. If there is to be a levy for thoroughbred breeders it should remain on a voluntary <Col N="704" /> rather than a mandatory basis. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that he does not agree to it. I am merely reflecting the concerns expressed to me. Not every breeder knows how this levy will be calculated. It will certainly cost the average small breeder, who breeds a few horses every year, an extra £100 minimum to register a foal. If the foal is not registered it cannot compete, so there is a mandatory requirement involved. Over £500,000 will be raised, so a significant amount of money is involved. People have told me that the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association represents approximately 10 per cent of thoroughbred breeders and the national hunt people fear that it is dominated by flat racers. I am reflecting these concerns so that the Minister can consider them. The point has been made to me that the bloodstock industry traditionally regulates its own affairs and the Labour Party was often accused in the past of wanting to regulate that sector.</P>

      <P>Those days are gone. It has also been suggested to me that one cannot help but compare and contrast the imposition of this levy with the generous exemption tax regime of 1969. Why are we allowing this levy to come in at this stage? The Minister will have considered these points and will probably reply when I raise them again on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 12, which amends the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, to remove the requirement for a ban on tote credit betting. That is an important change to the 1958 Act and is very welcome. If the Minister is giving these organisations the opportunity to regulate their own affairs, as he seems to be doing, the function of regulating betting office and greyhound tax should be carried out by Bord na gCon rather than the Revenue Commissioners. If one is going to bring these matters under the control of the governing body, it should have all the powers to regulate betting offices within its competence.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill. The reservations I have expressed are to provide food for thought for the Minister and are the concerns of those who have served this industry well on a small scale. Most of the measures will have little impact on the larger breeder or bookmaker but I always try to reflect the concerns of the small farmer, the small shopkeeper or the small bookmaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on this Bill. I am a keen supporter of the horseracing and greyhound industries and I take a special interest in this legislation. I acknowledge the wisdom and foresight of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in tackling an obvious and serious defect in the <Col N="705" /> betting and levies area in the horseracing and greyhound sectors.</P>
      <P>People with a superficial knowledge of both sports could identify the black hole which both controlling authorities could not contain. It would be remiss not to pay tribute to a former Minister of State with responsibility for the greyhound industry for the role he played in the preparation of draft legislation for that industry. I refer to Deputy Deenihan who, as Minister of State, prepared widespread draft proposals for the overall amendment to the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958. I acknowledge that some of his proposals are in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The funding mechanism and levy system under which the old Racing Board, the Irish Horse Authority and Bord na gCon were expected to regulate and develop both industries before the introduction of an annual subvention from the Exchequer at budget time was ludicrous. That those organisations were able to achieve substantial progress during these lean and difficult years is a tribute to the successful boards which had to work under this system. Were it not for the foundations that these boards laid by way of racecourse purchase and development, for example, the present boards would have faced substantially greater difficulties.</P>
      <P>Following the reduction in the off-course betting tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent under the Finance Act, 1999, and the related decision to reduce the on-course betting levies at horse and greyhound racing meetings from 5 per cent to zero, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance announced in February 1999 a range of measures to recoup to the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon revenues lost to them by the abolition of the on-course levies. This Bill proposes to implement those parts of that package that require legislative change. Provision is made for a new 0.3 per cent betting turnover charge on all off-course and on-course bookmaker betting which may be increased by regulation up to a maximum of 5 per cent. There is a new flat rate charge of £2,000 on each off-course bookmaker's betting shop, which may be increased to a maximum of £5,000. There is also a flat rate charge for on-course bookmakers, the rate and method of calculation of which will be set by the IHA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not opposed to an annual levy but one aspect of this provision concerns me. The proposal that all bookmakers, irrespective of their size, financial position or annual betting turnover, pay the same annual fee is a possible recipe for inequality, a point made by many speakers. I refer to the needs of small and medium sized Irish bookmakers. My understanding is that this fee, set at £2,000, will be levied on the small and medium sized bookmakers in every town in Ireland at the same level as the larger organisations. We all see larger organisations coming into towns where they see potential and they are taking over small shops. I hate to see that because I believe there is room for the small bookmaker. <Col N="706" /> I support the principle that the larger betting organisations should pay more than small and medium sized bookmakers. The latter have kept horse and dog tracks viable for the last century with the pitch fees they paid and they should be given recognition for their efforts.</P>
    <P>This package also provides for an increase in the annual grant in aid to the IHA and Bord na gCon as well as the contribution to racecourses. There have also been proposals to empower the IHA to introduce a thoroughbred foal registration levy to fund the development of the thoroughbred horse breeding sector. This enabling provision is not connected with the other issues.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the proceeds of any foal levy, which may not exceed £600 per foal in the scale of rates, must be expended on the basis of a programme for the benefit of horse breeders to be decided by the authority after consultation with organisations representing thoroughbred breeders. The opportunity is being taken to update some of the provisions of the Greyhound Act, 1958, by introducing some of the changes that were effected in the horseracing industry by the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994. These include giving Bord na gCon power to establish subsidiary companies and to enter joint ventures. It also provides for the removal of the ban on totalisator credit betting for greyhound racing, the introduction and regulation of on-course betting shops at greyhound tracks, the introduction by Bord na gCon of charges for services and the increase of fines for non-compliance with regulations under the Act. These new provisions are being introduced by means of Section 9.</P>
    <P>The race going public must be protected at all times. The IHA and Bord na gCon should consider introducing codes of practice regarding betting operations for the patron who is supporting these bodies. Bookmakers must be required to open betting in good time before a race, to price all runners in a race and to accept minimum bets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in Section 7 to extend the opening hours for the sale of alcohol at dog tracks but care must be taken that the business enjoyed for many decades by bars adjacent to tracks is protected. Section 6 extends the authorised hours for on-course betting offices from one hour to two hours after the last race. Section 10 provides for the zero rating of the existing 5 per cent on-course bookmaking levy for greyhound racing which is collected by Bord na gCon. It also provides for the imposition of a 0.3 per cent turnover charge for on-course greyhound racing bookmakers and includes an enabling provision to allow the board to introduce flat rate charges for on-course greyhound racing bookmakers or, in the future, betting offices, if it is deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 10 also provides for the introduction and regulation of betting offices at greyhound tracks by Bord na gCon and for the equivalent of the new high street excise duty of 5 per cent on <Col N="707" /> betting at those offices, or off-course type bets in the betting ring to go to the board rather than to the Revenue Commissioners. The latter provision will be commenced separately from other provisions of the Bill on the same date as section 75 of the Finance Act, 1996, removing the actual excise duty, is commenced. Similar enforcement procedures for the new charges that are described for section 4 are repeated here.</P>
    <P>Section 11 increases the range of fines for breaches of regulations under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, from the present range of between £20 and £100 to a range between £500 and £1,500 and includes a minor technical legal amendment of section 6 of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, relating to continuing contraventions of some provisions.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation as an avid supporter of the horse racing and greyhound racing industries. However, the Government must be vigilant in enforcing the legislation and must, at all times, be open to suggestions regarding amendments to it. The interests of the general public must be protected. If they are not the lifeblood of the horseracing and greyhound racing industries will dissipate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Collins for sharing his time with me and I welcome this opportunity to comment on this very important Bill. I too, am an avid supporter of horse racing and greyhound racing. In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance recognised that a reduction in the off-course betting tax would have implications for the on-course betting levy of 5 per cent which the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon collect on betting at race courses. Both bodies have invested heavily on improved facilities to attract new patrons. One of the encouragements given to punters to attend race meetings is the lower rate of tax-levy on on-course betting. To retain this differential and ensure that the increased attendances of recent years are maintained and improved upon, it is essential to eliminate or reduce the 5 per cent on-course betting levy. The elimination of the on-course levy would lead to an annual loss of revenue of more than £4.4 million to the IHA and £1.1 million to Bord na gCon. Accordingly, the proposal to eliminate the 5 per cent on-course betting levy could only be proceeded with if satisfactory alternative arrangements were made to replace the loss of revenue. It is estimated that these arrangements would need to yield revenue of approximately £6 million at projected 1999 levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to introduce a range of new betting turnover and flat rate charges on bookmakers operating at horseracing courses and greyhound tracks and in registered high-street betting premises to replace the revenue which will be lost to the horse racing and <Col N="708" /> greyhound industries by the elimination of the 5 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the total elimination of the 5 per cent on-course levy and the introduction of a 0.3 per cent betting turnover charge on all off-course and on-course bookmaker betting which may be increased, by regulation, to a maximum of 5 per cent. It proposes the introduction of a flat rate charge of £2,000 on each off-course bookmaker's betting shop which may be increased, by regulation, to a maximum of £5,000. This measure concerns me. An individual owner of a bookmaker's shop could not afford to pay this levy and an attempt to do so would put such a person out of business. Chains of bookmakers' shops could pay this amount with no difficulty but the levy should be reduced for single operators who are trying to make a living and give employement.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken to update some of the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, by introducing some of the changes relating to the horseracing industry that were given effect by the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994. The main points are listed in the Memorandum to the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the Government's commitment to horseracing. This support takes many forms but the most tangible is the Exchequer investment which is channelled to the Irish Horseracing Authority. Over the past five years the Government has invested more than £42 million through this route. This year will see the investment of a further £14.8 million of Exchequer funds in the industry.</P>
    <P>Capital investment aimed at upgrading and enhancing facilities at greyhound tracks has resulted in patrons enjoying a level of comfort consistent with Bord na gCon's objective of creating and sustaining a new positive image of greyhound racing as an attractive and exciting evening entertainment business. The turnaround in the industry began with the development of the modern stadium in Shelbourne Park in 1995 and the introduction, in 1996, of a colourful, professional and forward thinking approach to the marketing of greyhound racing. Over the past two years Shelbourne Park has become well known as a place to go for a fun night out with a difference. This now applies to the three greyhound tracks, especially during the summer season when people of many nationalities enjoy the sport. Thousands of new racegoers have enjoyed the excitement of greyhound racing. The success of the development and marketing campaign is apparent in the continued dramatic increase in attendances and betting figures since 1995. The Tralee greyhound track is one of the most successful outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry began 1998 in a position of strength with dramatic increases having been achieved in attendances and in totalisator and bookmaking betting in 1997. The strong results of 1997 were surpassed by an exceptional performance in 1998 with all key performance indicators showing increases on the previous year. <Col N="709" /> Total betting turnover was up by 10 per cent with totalisator turnover, at almost £10 million, recording a 17 per cent increase while bookmaker betting turnover, at £22 million, increased by 8 per cent. Total attendances increased by nearly 10 per cent to 750,000. These increases augur well for the long-term viability of the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to the development of the greyhound industry. This support takes many forms but the most tangible is the direct Exchequer investment which is channeled through Bord na gCon. Over the past five years the Government has invested £17 million through this route. This year we will see the investment of almost £5 million in Exchequer funds in the industry. I appeal to Bord na gCon to consider substantially increasing prize money at greyhound tracks and particularly at the Tralee greyhound track which is very successful, thanks to the support it receives from the owners and breeders association. This support should be acknowledged by increasing prize money to 100 per cent and by introducing grant assistance to breeders and owners. I would also like to see owners and breeders represented on the boards of the various tracks throughout the country as they have expertise which has not yet been tapped and would certainly be a major asset.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the input of my colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to the horse and greyhound industries during his term in office. I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, all three of whom have in-depth knowledge of the horse and greyhound racing industries. I ask them to seriously consider the question of increased prize money for greyhound tracks. If that is not forthcoming, many owners and breeders will go out of business.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on a subject of which I know a certain amount, perhaps too much from a gambling point of view. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, for his genuine commitment to the racing industry. The Minister is a racegoer with a definite commitment, as is the previous Minister, Deputy Yates. Both men have a commitment to, a knowledge of and an interest in the racing industry, which their predecessors did not have. Given that commitment, the Minister's Department should take a wider interest in the horse and greyhound racing industries which over the years have been left to run on their own axis through Bord na gCon, the Turf Club and the Racing Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many disasters during the <Col N="710" /> years when Irish racing was not in a particularly good state. The beautiful metropolitan tracks at Baldoyle and the Phoenix Park were allowed to close down. Whatever about Baldoyle, which was a pleasant seaside track, the closure of the Phoenix Park racecourse was a national tragedy for the people of Dublin and the country generally. It is a national scandal that one of the finest tracks in Europe could have been allowed to close. It is not too late to save the Phoenix Park racecourse from the grasp of greedy housing developers. It should be preserved because Ireland leads the world in horse breeding and racing. I appeal to the Minister to save the Phoenix Park racecourse. If anyone can do it, he can. A lobby is still trying to preserve the course. The track is in such good preservation that race meetings could be held there again within a year. The stands are still there as is the general infrastructure. It is right in the centre of Dublin so let us save it now and not bemoan its absence in 20 years' time. It is like Longchamps in Paris &ndash; it has all the facilities to be a huge success in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to nit-pick about the very necessary changes to betting taxes envisaged in the Bill. It is a long road that has no turning, and that road started for the current Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and myself when 15 years ago we appeared at Naas racetrack and announced to the populace that we would not pay the penal 20 per cent betting tax. I wonder what sort of civil servant mentality produced that unbelievable tax on top of a losing bet.</P>
    <P>Some self-righteous Members of the House wanted measures to be taken against us because of our refusal to pay the tax. The Revenue Commissioners interviewed us, although we had not committed any crime, except in the eyes of Mr. Gene Kerrigan of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> who felt we had. The bookmakers had committed the crime. Subsequently, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, recognised the betting tax was penal and he reduced it to 10 per cent. The Revenue Commissioners thus gained a bounty because more people paid the reduced tax. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who understands the racing business like no one else recognised that the whole fabric of racing, particularly the betting industry, was in danger from offshore installations in the Isle of Man that were ready to start offering tax-free betting.</P>
    <P>The racing industry employs more than 14,000 people. That is more than either the Army or the Garda Síochána. The racing industry will always exist because our climate, bad as it is, is very suitable for horse breeding. The animals thrive here and the industry is a major contributor to the economy. Our race horses and jockeys lead the world, both in national hunt and flat racing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry should be recognised and cherished. The Minister and his <Col N="711" /> immediate predecessor recognise the importance of the racing industry, but the Ministers who went before them did not.</P>
      <P>The Departments of Finance and Agriculture did not really value the industry either. For example, over the past three years evening racing in Britain has been televised here, but the Department of Finance failed to recognise it or to allow betting offices to open in the evenings to cater for it. The Department has done so belatedly this year but not before millions of pounds in unpaid taxes had disappeared, with barroom bookies operating in every public house.</P>
      <P>I echo the misgivings identified by Deputy Penrose who also understands racing. I would like to see him becoming Minister for Agriculture and Food at some future date because he has a commitment to racing. I occasionally accompany him to the races. I will see him at Kilbeggan on Monday night, hopefully with a winner. Deputy Penrose expressed fears about the £2,000 sum that bookmakers must pay. The majority of them have no difficulty with that, but in small rural villages and hamlets there are unique establishments that do not even have the SIS commentary and results service. For such establishments a payment of £2,000 is a bit stiff. Perhaps a sum of £1,000 would have been more appropriate.</P>
      <P>I also echo Deputy Penrose's comments on the £600 registration fee. It is a sad fact of life that while all racehorses look lovely, many of them do not perform particularly well. Only 10 per cent of owners experience a win with their horses. To impose a registration fee of £600 on a national hunt foal &ndash; of which there are hunderds in the country &ndash; which might never be worth £600 and may be sold for use in a cannery is a bit stiff. Some of the high rollers, the sheiks and so on, would not have a difficulty paying that fee, but it is a hefty fee for some small farmers who traditionally like to breed one or two horses.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me in regard to policing at Irish race meetings. A question mark has hung over the cleanliness of Irish racing. I suggested on previous occasions that Irish racing was less than clean and that it was less clean than its British counterpart. It is more than 40 years since a person has been warned off for malpractice on an Irish race track. In England, there are continual inquires in this regard. There was a celebrated case two years ago in which Kieren Fallon was exonerated in a libel charge of pulling a horse. There should be similar transparency here. Inquiries should be made more public. There is always the possibility of horses being pulled or doped. That aspect needs increased surveillance. I would like the Minister to encourage that at his meetings with the Turf Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an open secret that at least ten Irish tracks are in danger of closure over the next ten years. As Deputy Penrose said, one must applaud the efforts of Kilbeggan, which was about to be closed, but the people of Westmeath flocked to it <Col N="712" /> as if to a country fair, with the result that they now have large attendances at race meetings. One must also congratulate Tramore racecourse, which was also about to be closed but is doing well as a result of local investment.</P>
    <P>I want to shed a tear for the racecourse in my native town of Dundalk, which has struggled over the past 30 years due to the war zone on its doorstep, which frightened many racegoers from attending race meetings there.  As Deputy Brady would acknowledge, Navan also felt the impact of being close to the Border but it is now doing well. Dundalk racecourse suffered dreadfully from its geographical location. It requires special assistance but such assistance has not been forthcoming from the Racing Board. One could point a finger at the allocation of lucrative fixtures. The metropolitan track in Leopardstown and the Curragh, which also has a type of metropolitan track, get all the lucrative fixtures. There are also race meetings in Kerry and Galway, but they are only seasonal.</P>
    <P>The Dundalk race track should get significant financial support. There is a proposal to merge it with a new greyhound track but its requires more help than that because it has suffered greatly from its proximity to the Border. Will the Minister use his influence with the Racing Board to support this race track which is struggling to survive. There has been racing in Dowdall's Hill for more than 100 years and we want it to continue well into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his commitment to racing. That is not a platitude. I am not very platitudinous and if I felt he deserved a brickbat, whether he was a member of Fianna Fáil or my party, I would say it. He has a genuine commitment to racing. I do not attribute the present healthy state of the Irish racing industry to his efforts, given that the Celtic tiger has had something to do with it, but he have made a definite impact on it and I hope he will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>My first experience of racing was when I earned a few bob during the school holidays and saved it to attend point to point meetings at Crossakiel or Lloyd. Deputy McGahon will probably remember them. On one occasion I had saved £3, which was a good deal of money at that time, and I lost it to the three card trick boys, not on a horse. That finished me with betting and racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill and compliment the Minister on his interest in the racing industry which is <Col N="713" /> second to none. I compliment the Ministers of State and himself on the marvellous work they are doing in this area.</P>
    <P>Horse racing and greyhound racing are major industries in this country. They provide thousands of jobs and contribute greatly to tourism and to the national economy. The 10 per cent levy on betting tax became an incentive to the betting public to use offshore tax free telephone betting. While the level of that type of betting did not make a major impact on excise revenue, the problem was increasing. Tax on betting brings in £45 million per annum and it is necessary to protect that source of revenue. The best way to do is to reduce the rate of tax here to internationally competitive levels.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1999, provided for a reduction from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in off-course betting tax. The on-course 5 per cent levy was abolished. The proceeds of the 5 per cent on-course betting has being going directly to the Irish Horseracing Authority and to Bord na gGon. To attract new patrons, in recent years these bodies have, with the help of Exchequer funding, invested in improved facilities. This investment is best protected by large attendances. There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers attending race meetings in recent years.</P>
    <P>Punters are enticed to race meetings not only by better facilities but by being able to place their bets at a lower tax rate. It is only reasonable to expect that a reduction in betting tax or its elimination would have a very positive effect on attendance at meetings. However, the elimination of on-course taxes means a revenue loss of £4.4 million and a loss of £1.1 million to the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>Alternative provisions need to be made to compensate for these losses and the Bill proposes to address this. A package of provisions is necessary and the Bill proposes to implement those parts of the package that require legislative change. Provision is being made for a new 0.3 per cent turnover charge on all off-course and on-course betting in bookmakers. It proposes a flat rate charge of £2,000 on each off-course bookmaker's betting shop and a flat rate charge on on-course bookmakers. The Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon will benefit from an increase in annual grant aid and from contributions from racecourses.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to empower the Irish Horseracing Authority to introduce a thoroughbred foul registration levy to fund the development of the thoroughbred horseracing sector. It also provides an opportunity to upgrade some of the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958. These include giving Bord na gCon power to establish subsidiary companies and to enter joint ventures. There is great scope for expansion within these industries. The Government is committed to the future development of the industry and the Bill is a positive step in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of relatively minor technical amendments to the Irish Horse<Col N="714" /> racing Industry Act, 1994, and the Betting Act, 1931, as well as a small liberalisation of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, to allow the bars etc. at greyhound tracks to remain open for up to two hours after the last race instead of half an hour. This is welcome. The only direct charge on the Exchequer in these proposals is the increase in the grants-in-aid to the IHA and Bord na gCon by a sum equivalent to 0.3 per cent of the off-course betting turnover which will cost in the order of £1.7 million annually. This measure will be dealt with in the Department's Vote and is not referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The horse racing industry is very important and provides about 25,000 jobs as well as substantial benefits for tourism, rural communities and the economy in general. The main and most immediately noticeable feature of the recent development of this sector is the creation of the many new and upgraded racecourse facilities. The provision of better facilities and racing for the general public continues to be one of the prime objectives for all racecourses together with improving the working conditions for people working within racing.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the Irish Horseracing Authority produced its five year strategic plan, of which the establishment of the capital development fund was the most important element. The fund, which has been increased twice since it was set up, will see investment in racecourses of a total of £60 million over a relatively short period. Grants in the region of £21 million for the upgrading of racecourses have already been approved involving some assistance for almost every racecourse in the State. I welcome the improvements to the racecourse in Navan which is one of the finest racecourses in the country.</P>
    <P>Irish racing enjoyed another excellent year in 1998. The upward trend in betting, attendance, prize money and sponsorship of recent years continued and in virtually every area of performance the targets set in the strategic plan were surpassed: total betting was up by more than 10 per cent, attendances were up by 5 per cent to well over one million, with sponsorship and prize money showing significant increases of 15.3 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>Obviously the industry needs to build further on the performance of recent years if it is to achieve the long-term targets set by the authority in its plan. Much more needs to be done to make the industry more successful commercially. The authority has taken a number of initiatives aimed at improving the returns which owners get from their investment in racing. Last year the total prize fund exceeded £16 million, rising to £20 million this year. Last year was also the first year of the new sponsorship incentive scheme which contributed to a growth in sponsorship of more than 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on its interest in the horse racing industry. The greyhound racing industry is another very important industry. Navan has a fine greyhound track although unfor<Col N="715" /> tunately I understand it is to close down and move elsewhere. However, it will still be close to Navan, which I welcome. Where I live in north Westmeath we are near very good greyhound tracks in Mullingar and Dundalk. This area has good facilities established by Bord na gCon. I thank the Minister and the Minister for Finance for the work they have done for both these industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brady for sharing his time. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Ministers of State at that Department and the Minister for Finance for introducing this wise and prudent Bill which enacts the provisions of the Finance Act, 1999. This Bill is important because it has become obvious in recent years that the competitiveness of off-course bookmakers is being threatened by the promotion of offshore tax-free telephone betting services. With the development of telecommunications it has become much easier to place bets. This is a real threat.</P>
      <P>As a politician I would be slow to condemn some gambling which is taking place because we are gamblers of a certain type ourselves.  There is such a thing as a compulsive politician as well as a compulsive gambler. There are now many opportunities to place bets, whether on horse racing greyhound racing or any other sporting event. In order to counteract the effect of the new telephone betting services and to protect revenue to the Exchequer, it was important that the Minister for Finance provided in the budget that the rate of excise tax applied to off-course betting would be reduced from 10 to 5 per cent from 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate date as the famous Galway racing festival will take place at the end of July. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for his great interest in the development of the new millennium stand at Galway racecourse of which he turned the sod. The Taoiseach will open the stand on 16 July to be ready for the Galway festival. There is a great deal of talk about the colour of Cheltenham. However, I am biased. The Galway racing festival is one of the great festivals. It has an extra day of racing this year. The management there told me that the new development cost £6.5 to £7 million, with welcome grant aid of £2.2 million. The development of the stand generated employment and it is now one of Galway's showpieces.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the increase in the attendance fee, not only for Galway but for other racecourses. If £400,000 is collected from racecourses, there will be pressure to increase fees further. I would caution against this because I would not like the entrance fee for a traditional festival such as Galway to be increased further because of its popularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Minister for Finance have recognised that there are great opportunities for job creation in this industry. The Irish Horserac<Col N="716" /> ing Authority and Bord na gCon have invested heavily in improved facilities to attract new patrons. Punters are encouraged to attend race meetings and place bets by the lower rate of tax. It is important to reduce or eliminate the 5 per cent on-course betting levy in order to retain the differential and ensure the increased attendances of recent years. I cannot let the occasion pass without referring to the great success of Bobbyjo, which is owned by people from Galway, the Burke family from Mountbellew. It was trained in Deputy Brady's constituency by the great Tommy Carberry and was ridden by his son Paul to win the Aintree Grand National this year and the Irish Grand National in previous years. Tommy Carberry also won a previous Aintree Grand National on L'Escargot. I congratulate all involved in that great win, which was as welcome to us as winning the Sam Maguire last year.</P>
    <P>However, there is always a danger that some bookmakers, particularly the smaller ones, may experience difficulties after a popular local win. I have no great sympathy for bookmakers. However, there are major and smaller operators in all businesses, such as small shops competing against supermarkets. As the Minister said, there is a flat charge of £2,000 on each off-course bookmaker, which might be increased to £5,000. There is always a danger that smaller bookmakers might go out of business, resulting in job losses. If the principles of equity are to be applied, bigger bookmakers should pay higher taxes and levies. I do not know if that can be done but I would make a strong case for it to prevent smaller operators being put out of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated this Bill is introducing a range of new betting turnover and flat rate charges on bookmakers operating at horseracing racecourses and greyhound race tracks. This is very welcome. The proposal to eliminate the 5 per cent on-course levy and introduce a 0.3 per cent betting turnover tax is also welcome. I have already referred to the flat rate charge. I hope the Minister will look at that again for the smaller bookmakers. The introduction of a flat rate charge on on-course bookmakers, the rate of which will be set by the IHA, is also welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's introduction of a plan to improve the greyhound race tracks which he listed. I am very familiar with the one in Galway. There are also plans to develop the tracks in Harold's Cross, Dundalk, Limerick, Newbridge, Mullingar and Kilkenny. It is also hoped to have further development at Shelbourne Park.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry owns the tote, which is a different situation to that of the horseracing industry. The horseracing industry is worried it might be at a disadvantage in that regard. There has been very significant advertising by the greyhound industry of what is known as &ldquo;a night at the dogs&rdquo;. I hope we will continue to promote both the greyhound and horseracing industries.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill are very welcome. I ask the Minister to look again at some of the provisions for smaller bookmakers. We should keep <Col N="717" /> the attendance fee as low as possible. It is a very popular sport and we do not want to restrict it to the realms of big business and the very rich. Horseracing is the sport of kings. It is very popular in my county of Galway and I would like it to continue to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the work he is doing. We must be fair to his predecessors, Deputies Yates and Deenihan, who took a great interest in the development of the horse racing and greyhound industries.</P>
      <P>Irish horses are known throughout the world for their great breeding, etc. The racing industry has become a major business. I am glad the Minister is very much aware of that. His investment of Exchequer funding into the industry must be welcomed. For example, there were 12 or 14 divisions of racing at one point-to-point meeting this year. That is an indication of the number of horses there are and the number of ordinary people who now own point-to-point horses. There is now a large number of jobs in racing. Tourists are now coming to Ireland for summer race meetings.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the location of the headquarters of the auto tote and the Irish Horseracing Authority in Ballymahon, which is beside my home. I know the auto tote people. They were having some problems a few years ago in terms of their survival in Ballymahon and this is a very welcome boost to their business and to County Longford, which needs all the industry and employment it can get. I congratulate the auto tote on winning this contract. I hope it will have a very successful partnership with the tote.</P>
      <P>The Longford greyhound track is one of those that has survived. There has been some development there recently but more must be done. I ask the Minister to make a special note of Longford greyhound track and to give it some funding. It serves the areas of Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo and Cavan. It is a very important centre and any assistance the Minister can give to the track will be extremely welcome.</P>
      <P>Other speakers referred to the £2,000 licence. The Minister should look at that again in terms of the smaller bookmakers who serve areas with small populations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The racetracks of Roscommon and Kilbeggan are a success story. A great deal of development has taken place there and funding has been provided. The track in Sligo is also quite close to my home. It has provided new parking facilities this year but it could do with a further financial boost. The Minister should look at that. Sligo racetrack is very popular and receives a great deal of support from the North. The Minister was recently in <Col N="718" /> Kilbeggan to open its new stand. Kilbeggan and Roscommon are going from strength to strength. It is a great boost to the midlands that the racetracks are doing well. I visited Tramore last summer and I saw the great effort that has been made in the racecourse, with support from the private sector. Our colleague. Deputy Perry, sponsored a race at a recent meeting at Sligo racecourse. The business interests are lending their support to racing and the Minister can further encourage it by providing the necessary funding to the race committees. Now is the time to fund racing when the resources are available.</P>
    <P>The smaller and less well known racetracks &ndash; for example, the dogtrack in Longford and Sligo racecourse &ndash; need support. The private sector will support the racecourses that have been upgraded.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and I encourage the Minister's efforts to improve the racing industry right across the board. Racing is a tourist attraction and people are now taking &ldquo;racing breaks&rdquo; in Ireland. The Minister is doing a good job and I hope he gets a few winners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward. The previous speakers referred to the Minister's personal interest and commitment to the racing industry. He is building on the foundation that he had laid and which had been further developed by Deputies Yates and Deenihan during their term of office.</P>
      <P>Racing may be seen as a minority interest, but it is an industry that employs 25,000 people across the length and breadth of the country. There are not as many employed in the greyhound industry, but hundreds are employed or occupied full time in that industry. We are talking about securing the future of at least 25,000 workers. The workers keep the industry going and what is good for the industry is good for those who work in it.</P>
      <P>Racing may not be the most popular sport and would have to defer to gaelic games, football, hurling, soccer and rugby, but no other sport could claim to have the same employment levels as racing. I fully support measures to develop, protect and expand racing.</P>
      <P>We were all pleased when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, intimated in his Budget Statement last December that he would bring forward changes to be announced at a future date. I welcome the tax and levy changes which can only be for the good of the industry because the money was flowing out of the country and these changes will help to keep the money at home and retain jobs in Ireland. We should support that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Penrose and others questioned the changes and perhaps we can tease them out on Committee Stage. I concur with those who queried the flat rate £2,000 levy on each high street bookmaker's shop, because not all bookmakers do the same level of business as Ladbrokes or Paddy Powers and some operate on a very small <Col N="719" /> scale. People who do not know the racing industry may think that every bookie is a millionaire, but in each given year many small bookies have to close shop. A levy of £2,000 on a small bookmaker is a heavy burden and I ask the Minister to consider a variable levy, hitting harder on those who can afford it most, for example, the bookmaker chains. In the long-term it would be bad if the small town bookmaker had to close because of the levy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in off-course betting tax and this should make a difference. Perhaps only a few were availing of off-shore telephone betting and Internet betting, but it is much better to keep the money in the country.</P>
    <P> We were fixated by the idea of higher taxes but the man on the street knows that when taxation is reduced, extra economic activity is generated which produces more not less for the State coffers. I have no doubt that the tax reduction in off-course betting will significantly increase revenue. The elimination of the on-course levy will be welcomed by all those who attend race meetings.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will think long and hard about devising a mechanism for introducing a levy on the registration of foals. I know the section will not be implemented immediately but within a year or two the levy will be introduced. We have had debates on measures to assist the people engaged in horsebreeding on a small scale because few are at a level with John Magnier of Coolmore Stud. We wish Mr. Magnier and his colleagues well but the majority of horsebreeders run small enterprises and we must try to target assistance at them. The National Hunt foal sales statistics show that hundreds of foals are sold for less than £1,000. I hope these breeders will not face a registration fee of £600. I hope there will be a variable fee so that those who breed foals that sell for under £1,500 will face a minimal registration fee. Without an increase in the numbers attending race meetings, the industry does not have a long-term future. There has been a noticeable improvement in attendance and I trust that the numbers attending greyhound meetings have improved significantly.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, rest on our laurels. There must be more improvements. The promotion of racing is lacking. We restrict our appeal by always attracting the same small pool of people. Almost every man, woman and child would be interested in attending one horse racing meeting or one greyhound meeting during the year if it was better promoted. Many people go to the races but they come from a small pool. More advertising by the racecourses, the Irish Horseracing Authority and the Department is needed. We are not just selling a sport, we are selling an industry. Every other industry is promoted and marketed to a great extent. We should do the same for the horse racing industry. Much more progress could be <Col N="720" /> made in that area. The Minister is aware of the tremendous work at the racecourse track in Mallow. We spoke at a meeting there about the relatively disappointing attendance at some meetings. Much of that stems from the need for more advertising and promotion for every racecourse in the State.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is having discussions with the Irish Horseracing Authority he should ask it to examine admission fees. A fee of £7 or £8 per adult is too high for many people. For those who attend regularly and who are used to paying the charge, it becomes just another expense. For those whom the Minister is attempting to attract to racing for the first time, admission fees of up to £10 could be off-putting. If there was a special month for promotion of Irish racing with cut price admission, it would encourage more people to go racing for the first time. When those people go once, the likelihood is that they will return. On occasions such as derby day a premium is justifiable, but admission may be too high at many tracks and it does not attract punters.</P>
    <P>RTE coverage of Irish racing is a disgrace. When sports such as rugby is promoted to such an extent, the coverage of racing is disgraceful. Those in RTE should remember that this is more than a sport, it is an industry which employs 25,000 people. The more televised coverage racing gets, the better the prospects for increasing the number of people who will attend race meetings and join horse owning syndicates. RTE should provide a better service. We have seen coverage go from bad to worse to non-existent. Some racing journalists have written about this but we are yet to receive a satisfactory explanation from RTE as to why they are almost ignoring Irish racing.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take these points on board. This legislation and the Minister's plans for the horse racing industry will be important for the 25,000 people working in the industry. The Irish horse is our oldest athlete and we should be very proud of the horse racing industry.</P>

        <b>:</b> This Bill is a disgrace. It is an insult to the thousands of men and women who work in the horse racing industry, the tens of thousands who attend racecourses and greyhound tracks and the taxpayers. The Minister proposes to levy a charge on the racecourse and on the taxpayer to fund the Irish horse racing industry. The Minister boasts about the provision of £21 million in grants to subvent racecourses. He then comes into this House to raise further finance for the Irish Horseracing Authority and brazenly ignores the incredible favouritism shown in tax matters to a small cabal of the extremely wealthy people who control the horse racing industry in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that the Minister would come here with such a Bill to impose levies on ordinary people while ignoring those in the industry who earn tens of millions of pounds each year as stud farm owners and do not pay a penny in tax. It is <Col N="721" /> incredible that not only are these people not paying tax but they are frequently lionised by representatives of this and previous Governments and the media.</P>
    <P>A small cartel of tax dodging multimillionaires controls the industry while ordinary people pay the price. Coolmore Stud, owned by some of the foremost millionaires in the State, is like a private mint for those owners, with the money they earn each year absolutely tax free. Their best known stallion, Saddlers Wells, had a covering fee of £100,000 a few years ago. There was a figure for 1997 of 153 coverings by that stallion. Being conservative, perhaps 100 of those covers bore fruit. That amounts to a cool £10 million absolutely tax free for the millionaires who own that stud farm. That is only one of dozens of stallions for which there is a range of fees.</P>
    <P>This is a money printing industry which the Minister ignores in coming here to impose levies with this Bill. I would like the Minister to address why the Government continues to show favouritism to this golden circle which blatantly abuses taxpayers and is entirely protected by law. We have seen a monopolisation of the horse racing industry in recent years. A group of millionaires has been able to gain control of the industry and small people are being frozen out. I believe 70 per cent of all stallion coverings are controlled by Coolmore. At one time small time breeders, trainers and other people could have shares in the stallions and there was a more dispersed interest in the sense of ownership. That has been completely closed off by virtue of the fact that a small group of very wealthy individuals have gained control of the industry and run it as a personal fiefdom for the massive profits they earn. Up to 40 small stud farms have closed in the past 20 years or so, as this powerful monopoly gets a grip on the horseracing industry and effectively takes over.</P>
    <P>Men and women working in the horseracing industry who ride out the horses, help with the training, exercising, cleaning, brushing down, watering and feeding and who are on low wages for the most part are taxed to the hilt in the same way as PAYE workers while their employers who gain tens of millions of pounds in profit each year do not pay one penny. The Minister has some neck to come to the Dáil to raise further levies while being completely silent on this abuse of the taxpayer and the worker in the industry and of the racegoing public. Women in my constituency get up at 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. to do a few hours cleaning jobs to put a few shillings together for their families and are taxed on it. Yet Mr. Magnier and the rest of them do not pay one penny in tax on these dealings amounting to ten of millions of pounds.</P>

        <b>:</b> The people who are leading the taxpayers by the nose should be known. To add further insult to the injury which is there already many of these are tax exiles. One of these people who benefits to the tune of tens of millions of pounds tax free is a tax exile in Barbados. Another person who is closely associated and benefiting from the industry is a tax exile in Switzerland. These are some patriots that are lionized by the Government and the media. The truth has to be told about this matter on behalf of the people who do not have a voice in the Dáil and I will tell it.</P>
      <P>It is hardly any wonder a former Taoiseach who introduced zero tax rating for stud farms had as one of the gifts he asked from a benefactor, a 60 acre stud farm. The former Taoiseach would have known how lucrative that gift would be as an ongoing source of revenue. Another concern that is not addressed in this Bill is that there is no democratic check on the Irish Horseracing Authority, which is under the control of the Minister, to supervise the horseracing industry. There is no democratic input by the tens of thousands of people on whom the industry depends, those who go to the races.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that the Horseracing Authority is top heavy with people who have a vested interest in the horseracing industry. The chairman of the Irish Horseracing Authority owns a stud farm. Other people have lucrative positions in the industry. These are the people who regulated and advised the Government. Is the owner of a stud farm likely to advise the Government that the situation is blatant because of its tax free status and instead of coming in here boasting about providing Exchequer funds to subvent the racecourses that there should be a levy, similar to that paid by PAYE workers, on the stud farm industry which would go to subvent the horseracing courses and the industry? He is unlikely to give that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This blatant situation has led to the scandalous recent rezoning of the Phoenix Park which is now earmarked for housing. The Minister has ignored the appeals of the racing club of Ireland, people who have the genuine interests of horseracing at heart. The Irish Trainers Association appealed that that racecourse be opened as a premier race track which they had no doubt &ndash; they are experts in the matter &ndash; would be a profitable venture and had been a popular location up to the time of its closure in 1990. What happened? Some of the luminaries who control the horseracing industry got their hands on the Phoenix Park racecourse, ran it down and closed it in 1990, allegedly because it was losing money. They sat on it for a number of years so that they could speculate <Col N="723" /> on it, to increase its value, to have it sold off for housing. These people have demonstrated some commitment to the horseracing industry. The housing crisis and the obscene speculation in building land tied in with their plan so that there is a reported £34 million involved in its value if its goes for housing. Another Deputy has asked the Minister to tackle the problem. I also ask the Minister to look carefully at the case put forward by the Phoenix Park Racecourse Preservation Society to have it saved from the grip of the developers and redeveloped as a racecourse. It should be compulsorily purchased, not at the amount speculated but at a reasonable value. After all, those who own it are multi millionaires and have made their money many times over.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get the full story about the Phoenix Park Racecourse Company. One of its directors, last year, was listed as a company: Risorgimento Investment Holdings Limited, East Hill Street, Post Office Box N3024, Nassau, Bahamas. The control is moving out of this country and we have Governments which step aside and are utterly silent on this matter. A whole range of interests are intimately involved with racing and their only interest is to see the sport run in a fair, equitable and democratic way.</P>
    <P>They want to see this disgrace reversed. They also want to see what was a premier and popular race track reopened. It is for the Minister to ensure he assists them in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>There is a contrast between the speed of the Government's response to the needs of vested interests in the racing industry and the way children in working class communities in Dublin, who had, and have, a genuine love for horses, have been treated in recent years. We were all agreed that horses could not wander and create a danger in public streets or parks. We proposed constructive measures by which this passion, the love of horses, which has been part of working class culture in Dublin for generations, could be facilitated, developed and become a positive aspect of this city and other parts of the country. Instead, there was a brutal, smash and grab raid by the local authorities at the instigation of successive Governments to deal with the problem in a crude way instead of addressing it by providing land banks and facilitating clubs and measures by which those involved could be trained in all aspects of horse care to enable many of those involved take up employment in the industry, which cannot fill the vacancies that exist at present. After long and hard work a few clubs are being facilitated by Government, which we welcome. However, it is nothing compared to what could have been done and more is required.</P>
    <P>Working class children do not have many representatives in Dáil Éireann, but when the princes of the horse racing industry and tax exiles deign to return to the country they can meet the powerful representatives of the major political parties in clubs and elsewhere and have whispered in <Col N="724" /> Government ears what they want for the industry. The Minister duly obliges.</P>
    <P>I have to tell a sad tale here today. It is necessary to put a corrective to what the Minster and others have said in this debate in what was more like a chat in a snug among a few stud farm owners after a race meeting, when it should have been a dispassionate and objective look at the industry. In introducing this Bill the Government is standing over the inequalities in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill I am concerned about a couple of the proposed measures. In addition, some issues which have not been included should have been addressed. The Bill is consequent on the measures announced by the Minster for Finance in last year's budget when he signalled changes in the betting tax and the betting levy.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to suggest the Bill has been introduced merely to address the concerns of the wealthy. There have been major changes to the betting industry world-wide. In Europe, Gibraltar and the Isle of Man off-shore tax free telephone betting services are advertised and provided on a regular basis. Many of the bigger punters have availed of them. To protect the revenue to the State and to allow the industry to develop it was important to introduce new measures. The Minster has attempted to deal with the problem in an honest way.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate there was widespread consultation prior to the introduction of the proposed £2,000 charge on off-course betting shops, the measure is unfair and will create unnecessary hardship, especially for some of the smaller operators. Most towns throughout the country have a betting office, but, unfortunately, the bigger firms appear to be taking over and there has been a reduction in the number of betting offices in the country. It has become more expensive to keep a betting office, given the extra costs involved, the need to provide live pictures and to cater to later opening by race tracks. In consequence the proposed charge of £2,000 will be the death knell for some of the smaller operators. Given this, the levy should apply to turnover, which would mean that the bigger shops paying a higher proportion. Given also that the reduction in the betting tax rate from 10 per cent to 5 per cent will significantly increase turnover in the betting shops, the bigger shops should have been asked to shoulder most of the cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposal to apply an 0.3 per cent betting turnover charge on all on-course and off-course betting, I am not clear if the Irish Horseracing Authority is responsible for the on-course aspect or if it will be left to Revenue to monitor the off-course betting. I understand the industry and those directly involved are happy with the measure and believe it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been major investment in the facilities provided by the horse racing and dog racing industries, especially the dog racing industry. At one time many involved in the industry believed it had little or no future. However, there has been <Col N="725" /> major progress, especially at Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium. A number of provincial tracks are making similar progress. They are taking the right course of action and I hope it continues.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Celtic tiger is thriving the horse racing industry is doing exceptionally well. However, stable staff members are often neglected by the industry. For many years they have been correctly referred to as the backbone of the industry and it would not have made the progress it has in recent years without their work. Staff members should be represented on the Irish Horseracing Authority. It would give them a voice and would be a step in the right direction. A number of issues must be tackled in this area. Conditions must be improved and there is room for greater progress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for introducing it. I will comment further on it on Committee Stage.</P>

It is a very important sector of the economy and makes a big contribution to the tourism and leisure industries and the international image of the State, including the role played by local communities. I thank all the leaders of the industry for the contribution they have made over the years, including Denis Brosnan, chairman of the IHA, Paschal Taggart, chairman of Bord na gCon, and his predecessor, Mr. Kevin Heffernan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tackling early school leaving has been a long standing policy priority of successive Governments. As Minister, I am determined that we make a significant impact on this complex problem. This involves action on a wide range of fronts, including legislation, the curriculum and targeted initiatives. It also requires that we have a particular focus on traveller children where the problem is most acute.</P>
      <P>A range of structural supports is in place to assist the education of traveller pupils. My Department employs a national education officer for travellers and has established an internal co-ordinating committee on traveller education. This committee was set up in 1996 to draw up a comprehensive plan for the implementation of those recommendations of the task force on the travelling community, which were approved by Government, and the White Paper proposals relating to travellers.</P>
      <P>The task force report emphasised the need to increase the rate of participation by travellers in formal education. To achieve this it recommended that the visiting teacher service be extended. The number of visiting teachers has been increased from 12 a number of years ago to 20 and I recently sanctioned the appointment of a further ten visiting teachers. This will enable the service to be provided, from the start of the next school year, on a nationwide basis. The service works with schools and traveller families to facilitate travellers' participation in education and, in particular, in second level education.</P>
      <P>The task force also strongly recommended the education of travellers in mainstream schools in an integrated setting. I am happy that, while more needs to be done, we are moving away from segregated provision for travellers and, increasingly, they are educated in age-appropriate classes in an integrated setting. To help schools with this, and in line with the recommendations of the co-ordinating committee, the Department sanctions resource teacher posts in primary schools where a minimum of 14 traveller pupils are enrolled. Additional teaching hours are also sanctioned in second level schools in respect of traveller pupils.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee on traveller education which I set up last July allows traveller representatives to influence directly, decisions made at national level and which impact on their children's education. My Department provides capitation grants at enhanced rates in respect of traveller children enrolled in primary and post-primary schools. The projects strand of the 8 to 15 year old early school leaver initiative was introduced in 14 areas during the current school year. The projects aim to develop models of good practice in the integrated delivery of in-school and out-of-school actions by schools and other statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> The actions are designed to prevent early school leaving and support young people whose behaviour points to them leaving school early. They are also designed to support the return to the formal school system of young people who are not yet 15 years of age and not in school. Information regarding effective models will be disseminated through the system generally and the models will be replicated in areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In addition, I recently announced a major initiative aimed at increasing the number of pupils remaining in school to complete the leaving certificate. A key feature of this initiative is that it encourages schools to take charge of tackling early school leaving. Up to 40 schools will participate in the first phase and receive funding on the basis of plans which they will have developed to deal with the problem. While this initiative is aimed at the school population generally, I am confident that it will impact in a significant way on the retention of traveller pupils in the education system.</P>
    <P>My Department is a partner with Pavee Point in an Integra project which is working to design a strategy for data gathering, data analysis and decision making to facilitate access to education and training and develop a suitable tracking system for young travellers. Second chance education and training for travellers who have left the school system early is provided through a network of senior traveller training centres. Some 700 participants avail of this programme which is co-ordinated, as part of the early schools leavers' provision, by a national co-ordinator and leads to certification from the National Council for Vocational Awards, allied with junior certificate and leaving certificate options.</P>
    <P>There is no room for complacency when dealing with the issue of early school leaving. When it is considered that we are dealing with the life chances of our children, this provides the most powerful impetus to considered and well planned initiatives. We must also be very strong on the review and evaluation of these measures to ensure that objectives are met and real progress is made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the objective of successive Governments has been to reduce the high level of early school leaving by traveller children, yet none has succeeded? Does that not suggest that a much more radical approach is needed than that which he outlined? Should substantial resources be put into localised planning built around individual pupils and their needs as a way of ensuring that they, 80 per cent of whom drop out before the senior cycle, are seriously addressed? The attempt to adapt the existing structure for travellers is not working and it needs to be highly resourced, albeit in an integrated setting. Is more radical thinking needed?</P>

    <Col N="728" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be mindful of the task force recommendations because it represented the distillation of the views of all those involved in traveller issues and, in particular, traveller education. It would be wrong to discard the series of recommendations that were made. However, I accept that successive Governments have identified this as an objective to encourage greater and longer participation in the education system of traveller youths but the resources were not adequate. More resources are needed and I am glad, for example, that the visiting teacher service is available nationwide.</P>
      <P>The resource issue is manageable but there are other more fundamental issues in terms of why, for example, traveller children do not stay longer in second level education. Cultural issues are involved and we must work with the travelling community to identify issues by devising new radical approaches to ensuring participation at second level. The traveller training centres have helped in some regards. I have met the primary school traveller teaching network. It is working reasonably well at primary level but there is a significant reduction in numbers following the transition to second level.</P>
      <P>A worrying feature of the analysis we have carried out thus far is that traveller children tend to overstay in primary education. Many of them stay in primary school until they are 13 or 14 years and for a host of reasons do not continue to second level. It is the priority issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the long standing concern about curriculum material has been overcome?

Is he further satisfied that sufficient effort has been made to adapt curriculum material so that it celebrates the culture of the travelling community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant effort is being made and groups, such as Pavee Point and others, have been particularly helpful in that. It is also a key issue as is integration.

      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was introduced with two distinct strands in 33 urban and 123 rural schools in 1997 to test models of intervention, which would offset the effects of educational disadvantage over a five year period. One of the principle features of the urban dimen<Col N="729" /> sion is the introduction of a maximum class size of 15 pupils in the first four years of the primary school cycle &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and the secondment of a co-ordinator to the Department to support project development in the urban schools.</P>
      <P>The rural dimension of the project features the clustering of small rural schools and the appointment of a co-ordinator in each of 25 clusters. All the schools in the project attract an enhanced capitation payment. They receive grants for the purchase of teaching and learning materials and may apply for funding for local in-school and out-of-school activities. The project schools must develop a five year plan and participate in in-career development for teachers.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, was commissioned to evaluate the pilot project. As a first step, the research centre carried out a programme of testing in English and mathematics in third and sixth class in the schools in 1997 to establish baselines against which future test results would be compared. It is proposed to assess pupils attainment again in May 2000 and the initial impact of the initiative on pupil achievement will be measured in this context.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the principle of objectively evaluating the impact of the pilot should not be interfered with, particularly in light of the fact that the research which was used to design the pilot stressed that teaching and financial resources are not, by themselves, sufficient to significantly improve the achievements of pupils. The challenges for the schools participating in the pilot extends to developing a systematic approach to the challenges faced by the school and its pupils. Any extension of the projects provisions to further schools will be considered in light of proper evaluation of the pilot's impact.</P>
      <P>However, in the meantime, I have taken other steps aimed at alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage. The 8 to 15 early school leaver initiative was introduced in 14 project areas during the current school year. Next September the home school community liaison scheme will be extended to include all designated schools at first and second levels which do not have liaison support at present. Designated schools will form the nucleus of the first phase of schools in the school development planning initiative and I recently announced a major new stay in school initiative for second-level schools. Some 40 schools with high levels of early school leaving will participate in the first phase of the initiative and will implement approved school plans aimed at keeping pupils in school to the end of the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the next school year will see the implementation of a comprehensive remedial service at both primary and second level together with a significant expansion in the home school liaison scheme which will be available to all disadvantaged schools. The Deputy will also be aware that I announced, on February 11 last, the <Col N="730" /> decision by the Government to establish a national educational psychological service agency. A sum of £1.5 million was made available in last December's budget for the initial phase of this measure.</P>
    <P>Expansion of the psychological service has begun. Additional posts for psychologists were advertised last month and it is intended to appoint 25 additional psychologists during 1999 and, in accordance with the implementation plan for the new agency, a further 25 psychologists during 2000. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of the five year period, and it is hoped that the nucleus of a service will be in every county by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill, when enacted, will represent a sea change in our approach to the intractable issue of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Taken together with the range of measures I have mentioned it represents a determined effort to make real progress in this most difficult area.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for Members when a Minister uses time to explain schemes when that explanation is not required and time is wasted in terms of providing the information requested. That has happened in this case. What are the Minister's views on the Breaking the Cycle scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a worthwhile pilot project. I checked the files and those who initiated it stressed that it was a pilot project. Some elements that have been watched over the past 18 months have been effective in terms of school planning. The key issue which the national co-ordinator points out in terms of how schools counteract educational disadvantage is the development of a whole school plan and attitudinal change in terms of dealing with educationally disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>We have extended the concept of whole school planning to all schools which have been designated disadvantaged. This will come into operation from next September following work by the inspectorate and others. In a number of other initiatives, such as Youthstart, whole school planning is considered internationally as an essential element. Breaking the Cycle is a worthwhile pilot project and we must take on board its evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned because it appears that the evaluation process is used as a long fingering exercise in many cases. Under the proposals outlined by the Minister, it will be almost ten years before there is any extension to the scheme, if that happens. Does the Minister agree that while providing whole school plans is valuable in itself, the most urgent need is for more resources in terms of additional staff and grants for materials? Does he accept that in many cases schools are compounding the social and economic disadvantage of children? Does he accept the <Col N="731" /> principle that schools should compensate for social and economic disadvantage and provide significant additional services to those provided by schools in non-disadvantaged areas?</P>

      <P>Deputies mentioned the remedial service. We need to be careful that we do not just throw resources at everything. Nevertheless, there have been significant increases in terms of extra staffing. This is the first time in a decade that a significant number of teaching posts, over 450, have been sanctioned over and above the demographic dividend. For the first time, every disadvantaged school will have a home-school liaison service. A similar position applies in terms of a remedial service and a psychological service is being developed. A national psychological agency with 25 psychologists is being recruited this year.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill is currently before the Oireachtas. This will lead to the establishment of an education welfare service. Fundamental pillars are being put in place by the Government to deal with educational disadvantage. More money is being spent now than was spent in the past decade. A total of £700,000 over and above the demographic dividend in incremental additional funds were given to the breaking the cycle scheme.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the provision, if any, he is making for students to resit examinations in cases where they may have been unable to sit scheduled examinations due to sickness, bereavement or other problems beyond their control.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15521/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress that, within the limitations of our examination system, every possible effort is made to accommodate candidates who suffer illness, bereavement or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations. These arrangements, which are put in place at <Col N="732" /> very short notice, can involve adjustments to examination starting and finishing times, provision of special centres in hospitals and support from the Department's psychological service.</P>
      <P>The nature of our examination system imposes constraints in this area. Essentially, the leaving certificate examination is a terminal examination which is examined by external examiners. This contrasts with other examination systems where assessment is conducted on a continuous basis or takes place at regular intervals and where some of the assessment is conducted by the students' teachers. It is an inevitable consequence of a terminal point in time system of assessment that some students will take particular tests at a time that is far from suitable for them. In contrast, where students are regularly assessed over the entire duration of a course, the final grade awarded can be based on overall performance and, therefore, need not be contingent exclusively on how a student performs on one day alone.</P>
      <P>Each year my Department receives correspondence from candidates and their parents setting out a wide range of difficulties and traumas. It is no exaggeration to say that some of these are heart-rending. As a result of my concern about this issue, I asked the advisory group on examinations, which is chaired by Dr. Tom Kelleghan, to include it in its discussion paper on special arrangements. This paper, which I published recently, makes a number of important observations. In particular, the point is made that a basic difficulty in addressing the situation where a candidate was not able to give his or her best during an examination is the impossibility of establishing objective criteria that would identify cases that merit consideration and of determining the appropriate adjustment to be made in the marking process.</P>
      <P>The group's discussion paper also refers to a range of possible further options including a repeat examination, basing a candidate's grade on a portion of the examination only and moving to a modular system of examinations. As the discussion paper brings out, none of these offer simple or quick fix solutions. In the case of repeat examinations, there are issues of inter candidate equity arising from the use of different test instruments and the fact that the very tight CAO deadlines impose enormous pressure on the timely issue of results from the June examinations.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of comprehensively reviewing our whole approach to special arrangements, the advisory group has invited submissions from interested parties. When these have been carefully considered, I expect to receive a final report from the group in the autumn. It is my intention that any changes in this difficult and complex area will be soundly based and will command full public support. The current review, which is the first such open public discussion of its kind, is designed to meet these key requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the simple proposal of having a set of reserve <Col N="733" /> examination papers which students could sit perhaps six weeks later? This would give them a chance to resit the examination and use similar broad criteria to tests in the original papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I put that view to the examination centre and there have been a number of in-house meetings on this matter about which I am most concerned. However, it involves CAO deadlines and the issue of equity. There must be equity for all students. One only has to consider the commentaries on the papers set last week. If a second geography paper was set and, for example, Italy came up in six weeks' time, people would argue that it was unfair.</P>
      <P>Proposals in that area may emerge or other systems might be copied, such as the British system where compensation is offered in terms of considering the student's track record in the school and combining it with performance in other parts of the examination. Little progress has been made on this matter over the years. We have taken a significant step forward in terms of the discussion document published by the expert examination group, which is outside the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that discussion and working groups are generally particularly effective at coming up with obstacles to simple solutions? Would he consider taking a simple initiative which may be imperfect but which could be reviewed at the end of a certain period?</P>
      <P>The Minister raised the issue of the geography paper, there were similar problems with the history paper. Is he satisfied that those papers were a fair test of the curriculum? There is considerable disquiet about those papers. Will he take action before the point of no return and consider whether they were fair tests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's first question, the proposals of any expert group I establish will be implemented. I mentioned the steering group on the psychological service. It did not create obstacles; it offered a clear, tangible way forward which has allowed for implementation. I want to bring about change before next year's examinations. That is my objective.</P>
      <P>On the second question, I do not propose to comment on the content of particular papers while the leaving certificate is ongoing. The next important stage is the marking conference which is crucial in determining the marking scheme, etc. The issues will be fully thrashed out there and my inspectorate has taken note of comments made generally, as it does every year. I can assure students that the marking scheme will be applied fairly and reasonably to everyone currently taking the examination.</P>

      <P>High quality and appropriate early education can have a positive impact on the future educational and social development of individual children. It can also produce considerable benefits and is an essential part of our efforts to help all children to develop their full potential.</P>
      <P>It is important for everyone to recognise the distinction between education-driven interventions and the general child care debate. While both are intermingled, they are not exactly the same and the design of a comprehensive and effective early education framework in this country requires us to appreciate this. Because of these points, this Government has specifically set out to develop a policy on early education informed by best practice and reinforced by constructive consultation.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I have responsibility for early education. I also liaise closely with a number of my colleagues in Government with regard to the more general child care agenda, with a view to bringing about effective co-ordination of policy development in these areas. In this context, a senior official of my Department is currently participating in the deliberations of the interdepartmental committee on child care, under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>In moving forward on the development of an early education framework there are a wide range of issues to be addressed. These touch fundamental areas such as targeting direct provision, the support of more general provision, regulation, training and duration. One clear lesson from all significant international research is that it is not enough simply to provide early education facilities and expect them to provide concrete results; major work is required on structure and content. These are areas which are particularly important in relation to the existing, school-based provision availed of by approximately 50 per cent of four year olds and almost all five year olds who attend infants classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initial work on the preparation of the White Paper on early childhood education began last year, when I convened the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. The forum provided an opportunity for all those involved in the area of early childhood education to come together to share their views on future policy for early childhood education. Its report was published last November and is an input into the White Paper preparation process. The White Paper will set out Government policy on early childhood education and will provide a blueprint for the development of the sector for the future. Work on the prep<Col N="735" /> aration of the White Paper is continuing in my Department and will be completed as soon as possible.</P>

That is not news, I am not announcing it today; this has been the case since I entered Government. I accept the principle in the Deputy's first question, that the formative years in a child's development &ndash; when he or she will absorb most knowledge, information and data and will require greatest stimulation &ndash; are when the child is aged between zero and six years. The forum covered that age group.</P>
      <P>We need greater Government co-ordination. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is co-ordinating the Partnership 2000 strategic plan for child care. Our early education policy will form a subset of that, as will the report of the Commission on the Family.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned support for youth work is provided under two main headings: first, the youth service grant <Col N="737" /> scheme, a scheme of annual grants to national and major regional voluntary youth work organisations such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Youth Federation, etc.; and second, the grant scheme for projects to assist disadvantaged youth, which supports out of school youth work programmes and services for disadvantaged young people. I realise other significant activities are carried out by many organisations and groups in relation to youth work.</P>
      <P>The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, established under the Youth Work Act, 1997, is undertaking on my behalf the production of a development plan for the provision of youth work services in this country. I understand that the advisory committee has established a sub-committee to prepare terms of reference for this undertaking. It is proposed that the development plan will: first, review the current youth work provision; second, carry out an overview of existing structures, local, regional and national; third, identify strategic objectives based on demonstrated demand; fourth, draw up a planned course of actions and programmes; and fifth, develop a comprehensive youth work development plan. This work would include the preparation of a national inventory of youth services as referred to by the Deputy. It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the committee will be in a position to present its plan to me.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and am glad an inventory is being put in place but why has it taken so long? We have yet to see the Youth Work (Amendment) Bill. Many young people will have nothing to do this summer and services are not being provided. Does the Minister agree that at present there is little co-ordination between many of the organisations, and is he aware that there is even friction between them at national and local level?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the legislation be brought forward as quickly as possible. <i>The raison d'être</i> for it is that the Government did not proceed with the regional education boards and the vocational education committees are to become the vehicle. There will be significant changes in the new youth work Bill. In December 1998, Government approval was given to proceed with the drafting of the new Bill and the draft Bill was subsequently forwarded to the parliamentary draftsman's office. We are expecting publication in the autumn. There is a considerable log jam in the draftsman's office, given Government legislative priorities, but I am anxious that we move forward.</P>
      <P>We have allocated significant additional resources this year, over and above what was allocated last year, to youth services generally and to youth organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I am not directly dealing with this matter in so far as it is being dealt with by my <Col N="738" /> colleague, the Minister of State, my recollections are that there was always tension among youth organisations in different localities throughout the country.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that while additional funding for youth services is welcome, some of those moneys are being spent inappropriately because there is not proper co-ordination among many of the bodies? Will the Minister ensure that a commitment is given regarding the partnership companies which are an integral part of the youth services in many counties, especially in disadvantaged areas? There is a question mark over the staff employed in these companies. Many cannot recruit staff because the partnership companies will cease to operate at the end of the year. The Minister's Department has responsibility for some of the co-ordinators in partnership companies. Will he give a commitment to provide funding next year to ensure these people can be retained in the partnership companies and that we will see the Youth Work (Amendment) Bill this year? The Minister gave me a commitment, and the Taoiseach gave a commitment in this House, that the Bill would be published in a number of months but we still have not seen it.</P>

I am as anxious as he that we have co-ordination and the youth work Bill, once implemented, will help in that regard, although structures are already in place which should facilitate co-ordination.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My comprehensive proposals in relation to the school attendance service are contained in the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, which will replace existing school attendance legislation. The overall objective of the Bill is to refocus resources and operations away from school attendance in the mechanical sense of days out of school and prosecution of parents and towards the general welfare, in an education sense, of children and the provision of support for them, their families and their schools.</P>
      <P>This legislation provides for a comprehensive restructuring of current services relating to school attendance. The Bill includes provision to increase the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years and to establish a new national educational welfare board to co-ordinate and implement services for children who display problems in their interaction with the education system. The board will have responsibility for implementing the Bill when enacted and for ensuring that its objectives are met on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Consultations are continuing with interested parties on the provisions of the Bill, including representatives of the existing school attendance service. The Bill has completed its passage through the Seanad and will be debated in this House after the summer recess. I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and it is my hope that the Bill can be enacted and implemented without delay.</P>
      <P>Key provisions of the Education (Welfare) Bill are designed to ensure the early identification of children who have experienced or are likely to experience school attendance problems and the provision of assistance to these children and their families. The Bill also provides for the rights of parents to educate their children outside the recognised school system while ensuring that the rights of children to receive at least a minimum education are protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have the Bill enacted in the autumn. As the Deputy knows, <Col N="740" /> there is a school attendance service in only four boroughs &ndash; Dublin city, Cork, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire. We have to set up the national educational welfare board which will take responsibility for those services. That can be up and running soon after the passing of the Bill. We intend to set up an establishment group prior to completion of the Bill to get the process ready in terms of establishing the service. We will then secure additional resources to extend the service thereafter. We do not yet have exact figures because the emphasis initially will be in areas of disadvantage. We will extend the educational welfare service to areas where there is acute educational and socio-economic disadvantage. It is not a question of a set number for every area, we will examine the priority of needs as they emerge.</P>

      <P>Will he agree there is a risk that school attendance, which is essentially built around integrated services supporting a child in the community, cannot be well developed by a body which will have a national headquarters and which will see itself as similar to the Department in terms of being far removed from the individual community settings where these issues have to be developed? Should we not have a more devolved approach to educational welfare? Does the Minister envisage such a structure evolving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we have a national educational welfare board. We have given much thought to this because it is important that we have a national fix in terms of the school attendance issue and that we have a national body which can drive research into the issues that lead to school attendance difficulties in children and which has access to international research. In addition to that, we envisage that the educational welfare officers will be based in the regions in areas where there are clusters of schools and that there will be devolved delivery of the educational welfare service on the ground because the Bill also places statutory obligations on other agencies to liaise with the educational welfare board through the educational welfare officers on the ground. The main activity will be on the ground in the various localities but I see merit in the structures we have developed. We are a small country and we need a centre which can co-ordinate best models of practice etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's views on the approach the board should take in relation to non-attendance? The Minister supplied me with figures yesterday on children serving custodial sentences. Does he agree it is simply not acceptable that children are serving two and three year sentences for non-school attendance? What <Col N="741" /> approach would the Minister like to see the service taking other than pursuing the custodial sentence approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuing the custodial sentence approach would be the last resort under the new legislation. That legislation is much more welfare orientated in terms of helping the child, not in terms of prosecuting people. The new Bill is about trying to establish the reason children are in difficulty in the first instance. The educational welfare officer will work to help the child achieve and participate in a programme of education. For too long children have been left out of school with nobody picking them up. That is an indictment on society over the past 30 or 40 years. I would like to think that the Bill is child focused. It places obligations on schools and parents to ensure that the needs of the child are given priority.</P>

      <P>The planning section of my Department has been in correspondence with the boards of management of the two primary schools referred to by the Deputy regarding co-education. As a general rule I am very much in favour of co-educational rather than single sex primary schools and I would be anxious to facilitate the wishes of the schools in this particular case.</P>
      <P>The matter is complicated by the fact that there is one further school in the immediate area and two outlying schools which might be adversely affected by any change in the status of the two schools in question. The full implications of co-education for all the parties involved need to be clearly identified and I wish to ensure that any revised educational arrangements are based on consultation and consensus. My Department is arranging for consultation with all of the parties concerned in order to finalise the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that most of the parties associated with these schools, St. Catherine's and St. Joseph's of Ballyshannon, have already met. A survey of the parents indicated that 95 per cent of them were in favour of a change of status to co-education. There are two patrons because there are two dioceses in Ballyshannon, Raphoe and Clogher, and both bishops seem to be in favour of this proposal. Both boards of management are in favour of the proposal and the teachers are also gener<Col N="742" /> ally in favour of it. They have asked the Department of Education and Science for a number of guarantees. First, what staffing arrangements would apply to the general teaching staff and any special teachers in both schools in the case of a change of status? Would they be guaranteed their jobs for a number of years if the status of both schools changed to become co-educational?</P>

If numbers dropped significantly we could not guarantee the posts. If numbers dropped in the next two years I could not tie my successors to that position.</P>
      <P>It is the practice to grant concessions on staff to schools in the case of amalgamations. We would be in a position to do all the remedial work and I understand that major work is required in St. Catherine's in the very near future. That would not present a difficulty as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area to which the Government has given real priority as can be seen by the pace of recent developments.</P>
      <P>At present my Department provides a psychological service to all second level schools and to approximately 725 primary schools. Each psychologist is assigned a number of schools and aims to divide the available time equitably between them. In the primary sector, particularly, psychologists indicate to school principals the likely number of visits to the school that may be undertaken during the current school year. It can happen, therefore, in some schools, that the number of children being presented for assessment may be too great to be dealt with during the allocated time.</P>
      <P>However, an important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. In this way the psychologist is able to estimate the numbers of students in each school who may need psychological intervention. This may lead to adjustments in the amount of time that is allocated to each.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the assessment of children is only one part of the psychologist's work. Some schools may consider that other needs are more urgent and may prefer to use the psychologist's time in a different way, for example, by their assistance in the development of remedial programmes or anti-bullying programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to psychological assessments is kept under review by the management of the psychological service so that appropriate action may be taken if there is a serious difficulty about meeting the needs. A review of demand this year led to the conclusion that there would not be sufficient time available before the summer break to assess certain students whose <Col N="745" /> needs were urgent. My Department therefore invited tenders from qualified psychologists to carry out a number of psychological assessments. Since mid-May a number of contract psychologists carried out assessments in all areas of the country. It is expected that about 180 additional psychological assessments of students, at primary and second level, who had already been referred to the psychological service, will have been completed by the end of June.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor demand for, and the availability of, psychologists to carry out assessments. However, the Government has decided to make a major commitment to the development of psychological services for our schools. One of my key priorities as Minister has been the establishment of a National Educational Psychological Service Agency, to be available to all schools at both levels. On Thursday, 11 February, I announced Government approval for the establishment of the agency within my Department. It will be solely dedicated to providing an accessible and readily available psychological service to schools at both levels. The Civil Service Commission has begun the process of recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments in the agency during the school year 1999-2000. A further 25 will be recruited during the year 2000. These new appointments will make a significant improvement in the availability of psychological support to school children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many school principals in Dublin are paying privately for four to five assessments and that if one replicates that across the country one is talking about thousands of private assessments? Will he make a budget available for the schools to pay for this rather than mediating everything through the Department, which will inevitably slow matters down?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a school principal should not have to make an impossible choice between two children, both of whom have significant needs, and decide which child will be given the psychological assessment which is the gateway to resources? The Minister should allow schools some freedom rather than perpetuate his present highly centralised approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need more resources. The use of contract psychologists to clear the backlog of cases indicates a different approach. I am conscious that a backlog has arisen and this is unsatisfactory and unacceptable. I accept Deputy Bruton's point regarding the quandary in which many principals find themselves and I do not wish them to be in that position. However, it is necessary to have standardised procedures throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to provide increased funding for measures such as the use of contract psychologists. At this stage, I am not in favour of giving each school a sum of money to spend.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that in the past parents did not wish their children to be stigmatised by being given psychological assessments when no remedial support was available? A remedial service will be provided to every school in the country from September next and this will create an increased demand for psychological assessments. An educational psychologist has not been provided for any primary schools in County Donegal and second level schools in the county share one psychologist with County Sligo. Given that many of my constituents are obliged to go to Northern Ireland to avail of psychological services for their children, will the Minister consider the urgent provision of an adequate psychological assessment service for County Donegal?</P>

I have left it to the inspectorate and the planning group to determine where the 25 additional psychologists will be assigned but I will examine the provision of the psychological assessment service in County Donegal. I anticipate a difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel throughout the country and this difficulty may have an impact on the location of psychologists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 19 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>Through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology, the third level colleges have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for the disadvantaged to third level education. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. Examples of these activities include the Pathways Through Education project, supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring. There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
      <P>For the first time in 1999, results under the LCVP link modules will count for points for entry purposes into the universities. Recognition of results under LCVP link modules has been available for some years in the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>It will take some time for the effect of these initiatives to be reflected in the numbers going on to higher education. Consequently, my Department does not have detailed statistics on student numbers assisted under these initiatives at present. However, the Higher Education Authority is undertaking an evaluation of the initiatives in all the universities and it is hoped the results of this evaluation will be available before the end of the year. In addition, Professor Patrick Clancy is undertaking his fourth national survey of entrants to higher education on behalf of the Higher Education Authority where the social backgrounds of new entrants to higher education are examined. From a comparison of the results of previous surveys it is evident that a significant reduction of inequality of participation of the various socio-economic groups has occurred.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate the multi-faceted nature of the initiatives under way which is indicative of my commitment to tackling educational disadvantage. These initiatives span the first and second level systems as the need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have announced details of a £6.9 million two year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promoting access to third level education among <Col N="748" /> students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disability. A further £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in institutes of technology. Details of the allocation of these additional resources will be announced in due course. The establishment of the Commission on the Points System is also relevant. From the beginning of the next academic year, the full maintenance grant will be paid to all mature students. Until now, the majority of mature students received grants at the adjacent rate. All mature students will now be paid the non-adjacent rate to assist their participation in third level institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his Department's failure to collect detailed statistics on this issue which was one of the few areas for which the White Paper specified targets, is a serious reflection on his own and his Department's interest in this subject? The annual targets were specified in the White Paper. Is it the case that the Department knows the number of people involved in these initiatives but is ashamed to admit what they are? A year ago the Minister admitted that the number of students in this category was 87. We need to see more people taking advantage of Government initiatives. Small scale pilot schemes are not sufficient. The commitments made in the White Paper are not being delivered, or even monitored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would have very little to say. In 1996 and 1997 the amounts given for disadvantaged students in third level were derisory. The 1999 budget was the first in which significant funding was given for the promotion of access to third level education by people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Considerable work has been done visiting various partnerships and examining their schemes and in providing resources for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incredible. The Minister wants to target this area and the White Paper has made it quite clear how the problem should be approached. The Minister is saying, however, that his Department does not collect that information. I find that hard to believe. I urge the Minister to rethink his policy in that regard. How on earth can he evaluate what he is doing, or attempt to reach any targets, if he has no information on progress this year compared to previous years? </P>
      <P>We all accept that this problem is multi-faceted, but what are the Minister's views on the low level of maintenance grants for pupils and also the lack of access to pre-school education? Does he accept these are major factors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined what I am doing, which is providing a significant increase in <Col N="750" /> funding towards initiatives to enable young people to access third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, more than 800 students are studying for the national certificate of manufacturing technology. That is a new concept developed by the Government task force that I established. A majority of those students are from disadvantaged backgrounds and have non-standard entry requirements. Likewise, the summer courses that were run in Dublin City University and were resourced by the Department had a significant number of unemployed people on them. The courses provided them with qualifications. Right across the board we are allocating additional resources to deal with educational disadvantage. As I said in my initial reply, it is important that this process begins at the pre-school and primary stages. It requires the establishment of a pattern of behaviour within communities where young people aspire to attend third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his approach in this area? The present scale is extremely small &ndash; £1.3 million is being spent in this area by the HEA. The Minister is providing funds to increase that sum to £6 million, divided by two because, if one reads the text carefully, he is adding two years together. The Minister is, therefore, doubling the current provision. The existing participation is 87 and the Minister will increase it to 200, but that is just not good enough. Will the Minister arrange for his Department to report to him regularly on the impact these matters are having? The information can be obtained if the Department gathers various data on third level colleges. That information should be gathered so that the Minister can make the issue a priority rather than wheeling rhetoric out on command from a word processor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Deputy was listening to my reply. The Higher Education Authority is undertaking that work and so, as the Deputy knows, is Professor Clancy who is the major authority in this area. He is undertaking a comprehensive national survey on disadvantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Deputy will get results. It is regrettable that the area was neglected for far too long. While the Deputy may not like me saying so, we are targeting resources to the disadvantaged at third level. The improvements for mature students represent a significant additional grant assistance to students who need it most. I found it unbelievable that mature students, in particular, women who have had to make many sacrifices, were denied the full main<Col N="751" /> tenance grant by the previous Government. They were the people who needed the grant more than anybody else, but the previous Government's priorities were wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside mature students for the moment, what about students leaving school who want to go straight into third level education? To what extent does the Minister think the low level of maintenance grants is a factor in precluding them from entering the third level system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A year ago I asked USI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Dublin to provide me with the names of pupils who dropped out because of the low level of maintenance grants. To date, however, no one has come back to me with the information. I have spoken to the partnerships, particularly the Dublin Northside Partnership, which have indicated their approach and methodology in helping young people from families on social welfare to remain in college. It is envisaged that the funding I announced today will go towards that work. We will continue annual funding of the Dublin Northside Partnership's initiative, which is a good model of best practice. We cannot throw money everywhere, we must examine what is going on. Their approach is to help such young people with books and transport costs as well as topping up the maintenance grant. This is not necessarily done financially but, for example, by providing vouchers for books. Through that approach we can help many young people to stay in college.</P>

      <P>My comments were not intended to cast aspersions on any of the organisations concerned. I am trying to develop a targeted approach to the maintenance grant. We could spend millions on providing a basic increase in the maintenance grant for everybody. We could also spend millions on increasing the threshold for eligibility, but that would not necessarily result in one extra person from a disadvantaged background getting to college and staying there for the duration of a course. I am trying to identify and isolate young people who genuinely cannot continue in college because of lack of funding, and I will then be in a position to make funding available.</P>

      <P>&mdash;is one such model that could have a general application throughout the country. It could be done through other organisations in different areas and by setting basic criteria. It might mean a new tier of maintenance grant, for example, in terms of eligibility.</P>
      <P>We must target the resources that are available to us. One does not see much evidence of huge deprivation among college students in some areas. Clearly, however, some young people are struggling to stay in college and I am anxious to help them. I want to target resources for them because a broad sweep approach costs an enormous amount of money and does not necessarily provide the desired yield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has partially clarified the issue of the maintenance grant. There are severe problems. While some students might not drop out directly because of the maintenance grant, does the Minister agree it is a major cause of students dropping out? Students who are spending 30 or 40 hours per week on a course have to spend a further 20 hours a week doing part-time jobs to pay for accommodation. Does the Minister believe that this puts pressure on their academic studies and may encourage them to drop out of college?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If young people work excessively while at college it is certainly a factor in their dropping out. From recent surveys, however, we know that other factors contribute to the drop-out level, including the initial course selection process. The drop-out issue is more complex than simply putting it in monetary terms. Many people from advantaged backgrounds drop out of college courses. The reasons can be more educationally based and relate to the original selection of courses. The maintenance grant is not what I would like it to be, but I must prioritise the allocation of my funding. When I came into Govern<Col N="753" /> ment I said I would prioritise investment in primary education. We have made large gains on capital investment in third level education and we have also introduced a maintenance grant for the first time for more than 24,000 plc students, although all plc students are not eligibility because of the maintenance criteria. There was no maintenance grant for post leaving certificate students until we came into office a year and a half ago. The allocation for those grants utilised the bulk of our resources in the first budget. There are priorities and we have gradually and successfully implemented many of our objectives, the latest is that applying to mature students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that, rather than those who go on to third level and subsequently drop out a more significant figure, which we should examine, is the number of young people who do not consider going on to third level? There are a range of factors as to why young people do not go on to third level education. They include the lack of expectation and the realisation that it is not feasible financially to consider it.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's announcement today about his intentions in relation to additional funding. I agree that the model used in the northside partnership is a very successful one. Will the Minister clarify if it his intention to extend that funding to all partnership companies because it is badly needed?</P>

      <P>It is not intended to do that initially. We are also considering the other partnership companies. The northside partnership has demonstrated its effectiveness, credibility and its strong programmes. It has had a successful number of years. It has shown results and it has a good database in terms of the participants. I would like to support that type of approach elsewhere, but we have not made final decisions on the other partnerships or other similar type schemes. We will be in a position to make announcements on the spending of the money that was provided for in the budget before the end of July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under current arrangements, the <Col N="754" /> work of candidates is assessed by using a uniform test instrument and applying a common marking scheme. Following from this approach all candidates are marked in the same manner and on the basis of what they produce during the examination. In order to ensure that the readability of a candidate's work does not result in a loss of marks, examiners are instructed to refer to the supervising examiner any script where they encounter a difficulty in accessing the material presented.</P>
      <P>At present all examiners are fully briefed in the application of the common marking scheme for their subject and there is no variation in this scheme or the training provided. The Deputy will be, however, aware that I have recently arranged for the publication of a discussion paper on this complex and difficult area. This paper, which was prepared by the Advisory Group on Examinations, under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Kellaghan, brings out very strongly this complexity and deals expressly with issues that arise in the case of students with specific learning difficulties. In particular, it highlights the tension within our examination system between the need for equal treatment and fairness on the one hand and on the other hand the desire to take account of human circumstances.</P>
      <P>One of the possible future approaches identified by the advisory group is the modification of test instruments to cater for the particular needs of students such as those with a specific learning difficulty. If following full public debate and review we adopt this approach, then it will be necessary to have examiners trained to deal with any modifications in assessment.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that the present review is both essential and timely. The challenge is to review our present approach openly and objectively and with a full input from all interested groups. Only by doing this can we introduce changes that will command public acceptance and stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the idea that the Minister is committed to the training of examiners. For good or ill there was a long-standing belief that under the old system examiners were trained in this area and had a special expertise and that the marking system took account of the needs of students with dyslexia or whatever. Will the new approach be in place for the examinations in 2000, according to schedule for decision-making or the critical path to a decision which the Minister has set for himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention. I am determined to put in places changes for next year's examinations. I am not happy with this scenario. I met some parents and I know that this is a heart-rending situation. Under the existing system a college makes an assessment of a pupil. If the pupil or his or her parents wish to appeal it, they bring it to an appeals committee and it makes a decision. An objective process is in place, but I <Col N="755" /> am not satisfied that the balance is correct in our examination system &ndash; it is not humane enough. Resulting from submissions made by the various parties to the group, I have made it clear to all and sundry that I want decisions in place for the examinations in 2000. That is my objective.</P>
      <P>The understanding to which the Deputy alluded, that there were trained markers or that special allowances were made was a myth. I said that before in the House. No special allowances were made in the past for students who are dyslexic or students who have other learning difficulties. The new system that will emerge will have to take account of dyslexia and other learning difficulties that students may have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a good deal of anxiety was caused to students and parents this year because people could not understand how an examiner could distinguish between a student who had poor spelling and poor grammar and a student who had a specific learning difficulty? Is he aware that a number of schools advise pupils to mark at the top of their answer papers that they suffer from dyslexia or had been assessed as having dyslexia? Other schools went to the point of producing stickers for students to use. Will those indications at the top of answer papers make any difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not. The marking scheme, as decided at the marking conference, will be the marking scheme for all students. We have advised all examiners that where legibility and reading are a difficulty they are to forward those scripts to the senior examiners so that they can be very carefully corrected to ensure that where clear difficulties are evident in the paper that the person is not disadvantaged by that. In that sense we are taking great care, but we cannot have an <i>ad hoc </i>system where students can put stickers on a paper and hope to have that taken into account. Stickers of that nature will not have a bearing. There is a clear procedure in place. We must be fair to all students. There must be objective assessment procedures in place.</P>
      <P>A system has been in place for a number of years where schools can apply on behalf of students. A psychologist assesses the student's request for assistance or longer hours, and if the student does not succeed there is an appeal system. As Minister, I cannot interfere in those proceedings. I have even had representations from my constituents and I have spoken to the people involved in the Department and so on and it is very hard to deal with parents on this issue, given the anxiety that has been caused.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify a point made by the Minister. He said &ldquo;longer hours&rdquo; but, if they are lucky enough, students only get extra minutes. Does the Minister agree that the current situation where if the examiner has difficulty reading the scripts that they are forwarded? What <Col N="756" /> is the situation if the student has difficulty reading the paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That position is as outlined. If a student has a difficulty reading a paper, the school makes an application prior to the examinations, a psychologist is called in and he or she makes an assessment. If the psychologist's assessment is in the negative &ndash; that the student does not need a reader &ndash; the student may then appeal to an appeal committee, which will further assess the issue. If the appeal committee's assessment is negative, no further redress can be offered to the student. That is the present position, but I am not happy with it. That is why I established the advisory expert group on examinations, which has published a discussion document on this issue. I asked the advisory group to bring forward with proposals, following submissions from all the interested parties, with a view to having changes in place for the examinations in 2000.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter to express the utter frustration of the people of lnishowen at the unemployment problem we are facing in the peninsula. All Departments, funding agencies, Ministers and individuals eloquently use the trendy phrase &ldquo;socially excluded&rdquo;. We feel excluded and far from trendy when we hear of the great drop in unemployment figures nationally. We feel excluded when we hear of the 1,300 new jobs being created in Dublin and Dundalk and of the call centres for Cork or Waterford &ndash; not that we have anything against Dublin, Dundalk or Waterford. We feel excluded when we hear of the IDA annual report of 1998 citing &ldquo;another year of record job creation and economic impact&rdquo; and then read the small print to see that in actual fact there was a 2.5 per cent decrease in IDA supported companies in 1997-98 and a decrease of 129 in the number of jobs created in 1998 compared to 1994. We feel excluded when we see companies that are operating successfully, with a highly motivated and dedicated workforce, closing down or relo<Col N="758" /> cating out of our area. We do not deserve social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Last week those employed in the Glenveagh mushroom operation in Newtowncunningham were added to the long and growing list of those laid off from Fruit of the Loom, Donegal Shirt Company, Fingal factory, Moville, Jockey underwear etc., not to mention the existing high level of unemployed in the peninsula. Glenveagh Mushrooms employed 17 people full time. It was of benefit to mushroom pickers and growers throughout my area. This, therefore, is not the loss of 17 jobs but yet another catastrophe for a region that does not understand what is taking place around them.</P>
      <P>In this instance, mushrooms picked in lnishowen could be at the packing station within minutes or hours and, by using the port at Larne, could be in the UK shops by the next day. The guarantee of fresh quality produce is surely what any operator would require and this was possible from the location in Newtowncunningham. Now the produce will require significantly more time for transportation as the factory closes its gates in Donegal, which has implications for the entire industry in the county.</P>
      <P>If we were peripheral, if we were not adjacent to the fourth largest city in Ireland, if we were not able to provide a proper service or access international ports and airports and if we did not have a ready work-orientated employment pool, we would sit back and accept that this desertion was warranted. This, however, is not the case, we have all those factors in our favour. What angers me most is that two of the groups who have approached me about creating 25 and 40 jobs &ndash; small numbers in the scheme of what is happening nationally &ndash; when they could be receiving real assistance, seem to be continually encountering hurdles.</P>
      <P>While the task force, under the chairmanship of Michael McLoone, is striving to deal with the problem, the reality is that we have empty factories standing idle. Workers are eager to remain off the dole queues and we need immediate positive action to deliver us from the social exclusion which is unfairly imposed on us. The task force needs to report, its recommendations need to be comprehensively reacted to and the anomalies must be resolved.</P>
      <P>One such problem relates to the back to education allowance. The task force has been keen to encourage people to get extra qualifications to make them more adaptable to possible business opportunities. Many have taken up this challenge but when they get their places on a course and seek an allowance to help them financially they are told that they have not been on the dole for six months and therefore do not qualify for assistance. These individuals do not have the finances to cope with the absence of the wage to which they are used, never mind the extra cost of participating in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were not at fault when the redundancies that were to take place six months ago and which <Col N="759" /> would have left them in a qualifying position were put off for a number of months. Yet they are left to cope with our seemingly endless bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I could go on but I know my time is limited. I ask the Minister, the Tánaiste and other relevant Ministers why they are implementing different initiatives. I implore them for their help in ensuring that we reverse a terrible downward spiral.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this matter. Glenveagh Mushrooms is a subsidiary of the Pleroma group, Monaghan Mushrooms Limited, located in Newtowncunningham, County Donegal. The company has operated as a packhouse for the grading, packaging and consolidation of fresh mushrooms grown in County Donegal and sold in the UK multiple sector.</P>
      <P>The packhouse was established in 1989-90 under a joint venture between Glenveagh Mushrooms Limited and Monaghan Mushrooms Limited, in which the latter company held a 35 per cent shareholding. Pleroma acquired the outright ownership of Glenveagh Mushrooms Limited in 1998. Employment at Glenveagh Mushrooms has varied historically depending on the availability of mushrooms. In 1992 the operation reached a peak in employment of 21 staff but this has varied since between seven and 12. Prior to the announced closure, Glenveagh Mushrooms Limited employed seven permanent and eight part-time staff.</P>
      <P>Pleroma has indicated that due to increasing pressures on profit margins and in an effort to improve efficiencies, it has had to rationalise its packhouse operations with the closure of the Glenveagh operation which is one of its three packhouses in Ireland. This decision has been brought about by the departure of a number of mushroom growers from the Pleroma satellite grower network in Donegal who are now supplying a mushroom marketing company in Northern Ireland. Prior to the departure of these growers, Glenveagh was processing and shipping 120,000 lbs. of mushrooms on average per week, direct to customers in the UK. This is the minimum quantity required for the viable operation of the packhouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pleroma has reiterated to Enterprise Ireland its ongoing commitment to the mushroom industry in Donegal and is hopeful that the closure will be temporary. The reopening of the packhouse will, however, be dependent on new growers coming into the satellite network and former growers returning to Pleroma in order to bring weekly mushroom supplies back to the minimum viable level required. I understand that three new growers are due to commence supplying mushrooms to Pleroma in the coming months. In the meantime, the mushrooms currently supplied by Donegal growers to the Glenveagh packhouse will continue to be collected by Pleroma on a daily basis and will be processed at Tyholland in County <Col N="760" /> Monaghan. The closure of the Glenveagh packhouse will therefore have no impact on mushroom growing in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Regarding the future employment prospects of the staff, four of the permanent staff involved in the collection of mushrooms will continue to be employed by Glenveagh Mushrooms while the remaining three have been offered alternative employment. Grower technical advice and support will continue to be supplied by Pleroma to growers in County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this most urgent issue. Evictions are increasing all over this city and many people in the rented sector feel they could be next.</P>
      <P>For three days a constituent of mine, Karl Byrne, has been boarded up in his flat in Charlemont Street, resisting eviction. Mr. Byrne is not a criminal or a law-breaker, he is a responsible citizen who fears for his future and knows that, once he is evicted, he will be declared homeless. He then faces a bleak future of going from hostel to hostel. His elderly neighbour, Essie Kealing, is also in a very vulnerable situation. Their names will be added to the corporation's housing list, which is already bursting due to similar cases. Yet, the Government sits back and does not appear to believe there is a housing crisis.</P>
      <P>Security of tenure is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He once said in a speech in Templemore that, as a society, we must protect elderly people from being robbed in their homes. I am asking him to protect elderly people from being robbed of their homes.</P>
      <P>The law is on the side of unscrupulous landlords. Currently, the Constitution also appears to be on their side. Compared to tenants in other countries, Irish tenants have few rights. There is no rent control. If one can gets a lease it is for a year at most. Rents can be doubled at a landlord's whim. There is no security of tenure. A tenant can be asked to vacate the premises with one month's notice.</P>
      <P>Even a sitting tenant, who would normally enjoy rights, is now very vulnerable. Section 16 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, is being used by landlords to gain vacant possession of dwellings. I had one such case last week, where a landlord, who had deliberately let a premises in Aungier Street run down, applied to the court to carry out a scheme of works. This necessitated the tenants, all of whom were pensioners, having to leave the house in which they were born. Does the Minister have any idea of the pain, suffering and sheer trauma gone through by these elderly people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's response has been wholly inadequate. It set up the working group on security of tenure in November 1994, following the proposed <Col N="761" /> sale of apartments in the Mespil estate and the threatened eviction of elderly tenants. The report runs to a mere eight pages and concludes that, having examined security of tenure law in other jurisdictions, it did not identify a single system abroad which would be importable. How very convenient for landlords and speculators and how disappointing for tenants.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on 5 May last that the Government had decided, in principle, to establish a commission to look at the issue of security of tenure. Yet another commission and yet another fudge.</P>
    <P>The tragic fact is that this Government does not care about those in the rented sector. It does not care because those who benefit from the current situation &ndash; the ruthless landlords and speculators &ndash; contribute handsomely to Fianna Fáil. I would like the Minister to come clean today and say he has no intention of introducing this legislation, simply because he does not care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be present and has asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The rights of tenants in private rented accommodation and the protection available to them are determined by the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancies are held and the landlord and tenant code which governs the relationship between landlord and tenant. That code is, of course, the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>There have been reports of claims of an increased incidence of evictions from private rented accommodation. Surveys undertaken by representative bodies of auctioneers and estate agents indicate that the overall rate of increase in rents in 1998 was in line, generally speaking, with the rise in house prices. Tenants of private rented accommodation whose means are not sufficient to meet their needs, including their rent payments, may qualify for assistance by way of rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, which is administered by the health boards.</P>
      <P>Security of tenure is a complex matter. There are difficult legal and constitutional issues inherent in the landlord and tenant relationship which have been the subject of High and Supreme Court judgments. There is no point in taking any action which is likely to fall foul of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps even more important, from a practical point of view, we cannot risk taking any action which might result in a negative impact on supply and a worsening of the existing situation. Calls for rent freezes or rent control ignore the potential impact on supply. It is easy to see how such measures would be attractive to those currently in occupation of rented accommodation. However, the resulting consequences for people <Col N="762" /> seeking rented accommodation now and in the future must also be taken into account. A balance must be struck between the rights and obligations of landlords, tenants and those who will require accommodation in the private rented sector in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that a commission should be established to examine issues relating to security of tenure in the private rented sector. The proposed terms of reference, scope of remit and membership of the commission are being considered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office. A great deal of consideration has been given to what is needed from this commission and to ensuring that the terms of reference adequately cover all the relevant items which need to be taken into account and addressed. In addition to examining security of tenure, the Minister intends that the commission will be asked to examine how investment in, and the supply of, residential accommodation for renting can be increased. Naturally, the aim is that any measures implemented as a result of the recommendations of the commission will have a positive overall outcome for the sector and will contribute to achieving a thriving, more diverse and well managed private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister also intends that, as part of its terms of reference, the commission will be asked to make such recommendations for changes to the legislation governing the private rented sector as it considers appropriate and feasible.</P>

    <P>My Adjournment matter raises very serious issues about how we treat visitors to this country and about how the immigration service responds to legitimate inquiries and representations from Members of the Oireachtas. To put it bluntly, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, should hang his head in <Col N="763" /> shame at the treatment meted out this week to a Japanese visitor.</P>
    <P>Ms Tomoko Tsuchiya was treated more like a terrorist than the tourist she was. She arrived from Tokyo, via Amsterdam, on Monday, 14 June, to visit her friend, Albert Rose. Although Albert lives in Hampstead, he is Irish, and they had planned this trip for a year to be here for Bloomsday. When Tomoko arrived at Dublin Airport she was refused entry, apparently because she had previously been turned down for a visa to visit Albert in the UK. Immigration claimed she was using Ireland as a backdoor to get into the UK, although there was no evidence to back this up and much to suggest otherwise. She was held incommunicado for several hours before Albert found out where she was. He was allowed to speak to her on the telephone but only had time to ask her how she was before the call was terminated. He tried to get her released into his care on Monday but no one would talk to him in immigration.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rose contacted my office on Tuesday morning. My office made up to 17 attempts to contact immigration at Dublin Airport, through numbers supplied by the aliens' office and Aer Rianta, without getting a reply over a period of about three hours. The phone was answered four times but was hung up before anything could be said. My office eventually contacted the private office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and asked it to contact immigration, which it did and then told my office that there was nothing that could be done. My office explained that Tomoko was a wealthy professional Japanese woman with a job and a family in Japan. She was here to experience Bloomsday with her friends and had paid for this expensive ten day trip, and requested that she be allowed stay for a few days. The Minister's office said &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  We then asked for a direct phone number to immigration so that Albert Rose could at least talk to Tomoko, and the Minister's office gave two numbers but there was no reply to either number. On my instructions my office contacted a solicitor who agreed to represent Tomoku. He too had great difficult in getting anyone to answer a telephone but when he did make contact he was told nothing could be done. My office again contacted the Minister's office and asked for another telephone number and after three attempts my office eventually got a reply from the number supplied. My secretary talked to a person, whose name I have but to whom I will refer as Official A. He claimed that Tomoko had admitted that she wanted to live in England with her boyfriend Albert. She denies this emphatically and asked why she would say this when her family were expecting her back to return to work in ten days time. Official A said she was not going anywhere except back to Japan. My office then asked if she would be allowed stay if I, as a Deputy and MEP, could guarantee her return, but the response was in the negative. My office then asked if Albert <Col N="764" /> could speak to her and the official agreed to this, however official A could be heard saying to a colleague, &ldquo;keep hold of her, do not let her go up those stairs, keep your eyes on her.&rdquo;  When Tomoko came to the phone, she was confused, frightened and crying. My office asked Official A if Albert could visit her before she was deported, to which he agreed and a brief visit took place. This young Japanese woman who wanted to fulfil a lifelong ambition to visit Ireland for Bloomsday was deported from the land of 100,000 welcomes at 2,30 p.m. on Tuesday.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the men and women who work in immigration are reasonable and decent people but the regime they are operating in the name of the Minister for Justice. Equality and Law Reform is at best secretive, insensitive and at worst cruel and uncaring.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Deputy on this issue and has asked me to set out the facts of a case which has been reported in a somewhat misleading fashion.</P>
      <P>I should begin by pointing out that millions of non-nationals arrive here every year and for most persons immigration clearance is a straightforward matter. However, in a very small proportion of cases further examination is required and in some of those cases the immigration officer may go on to refuse leave to land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Japanese nationals do not require a visa to travel here. However, all persons, whether or not a <Col N="765" /> visa is required, must have leave to land upon arrival, when they come from outside the common travel area formed by the UK and Ireland. The decision on whether to grant leave to land is taken by an immigration officer and the grounds for refusal are set out in the Aliens (No.2) Order, 1999. The grounds for refusal and the system generally has many similarities with the regulations in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The position in this case is that a Japanese national arrived in Dublin Airport on 14 June from Amsterdam. Inquiries made with UK Immigration revealed that she had been refused entry at Heathrow and removed to Japan on 16 July 1998. She had subsequently been refused an entry clearance, which is a form of pre-entry approval for persons intending to remain in the UK for more than a short visit, from the UK authorities in Tokyo on 29 April 1998. Her Irish boyfriend was present to meet her in Dublin, having flown from the UK on the same day to do so.</P>
    <P>The immigration officer, who in common with most immigration officers is a member of the Garda Síochána was satisfied that it was her intention to avail of the absence of immigration control from Ireland to the UK to return there, thereby breaching the common travel area and subverting the UK controls. The Minister has informed me that she admitted to an immigration officer that she intended going to the UK. On this basis the immigration officer refused her leave to land on the grounds of the intention to travel to the UK in circumstances where she would not have been admitted had she arrived there directly and also on grounds of her intention to deceive regarding the purpose of the visit. As I have said, this decision is a matter for the immigration officer and not one in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or his Department has a formal role. However, the Minister has asked me to say that it appears to have been a well-founded decision and one arrived at in a reasonable fashion. It has been suggested that the person was visiting Ireland to celebrate Bloomsday. I understand that, while this claim was first mentioned at an advanced stage in the incident, the Garda immigration officer concluded that her primary purpose was to enter Ireland to enable her to enter the UK more easily.Solicitors acting on behalf of the persons in question as well as Deputy De Rossa's office were in contact with the Minister's Department during the course of these events and the Minister is satisfied that they were kept apprised of developments in the matter. The person's boyfriend was given an opportunity to speak to her on the phone and also to meet her prior to her return.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of the common travel area is a matter of important public policy as the ease of movement it gives to Irish and UK national is essential to interaction between the two jurisdictions. If it is to survive, however, it follows that persons not entitled to avail of it do not use it to evade immigration controls generally. For this reason, immigration officers are empowered to <Col N="766" /> refuse leave to land if they are satisfied that the persons intend to travel whether immediately or not, to the UK and that they are not acceptable to UK immigration. A reciprocal power is available to UK immigration officers to deal with persons who attempt to enter the UK in order to reach Ireland and where such persons would not qualify for admission here.</P>
    <P>While the Minister accepts that the Deputy may be unhappy about the situation which arose in this case, he hopes that he will accept that the matter was handled in a reasonable way in all the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for coming into the House.</P>
      <P>In recent times the Government has placed great emphasis on job creation and job retention, including part-time employment. It is strange that at the same time the application of a social welfare regulation is having the opposite effect. The regulation to which I refer is the &ldquo;substantial loss of employment&rdquo; rule and the people who are affected by it are some of the most vulnerable in the community. I have set out the position and effects of this regulation on both the employer and employee. I ask the Minister to examine the application of this regulation and to consider it in the same way as its effects on unretained firemen and dockers was considered.</P>
      <P>There are many part-time workers in the marts in the west and the application of the &ldquo;substantial loss of employment&rdquo; rule has a determintal effect on their income. The position prior to the imposition of this rule and its implementation was that employees such as the 70 members employed in marts by NCF was as follows: from September to the end of December, the peak period, the employees would work two to three days per week. In January they would work one day per week and by May and June they would work one or two days per month. The employees, having paid the required contributions would then receive unemployment benefit for the days on which they did not have work. The first indication of a problem was when the social welfare office began to refuse the employees' claims and insist they had not suffered a substantial loss and that they did not qualify for benefit or qualified only for the weeks in which they worked one or two days. The members appealed the decision with some success, but their position still fell far short of that which existed before the regulation was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> The effect of this regulation is twofold. First, those with no choice but to stay in the job must try to live on a substantially reduced income with no way of improving it, given that most of the members involved are from a farming background and many own small farms which means they will not qualify for FIS or social welfare assistance. Second, workers will have to leave the employment, creating further recruitment problems for the employer, whose case must also be examined.</P>
    <P>The mart division of NCF Co-operative operates seven livestock marts with a combined turnover of £38 million. The marts are located in Ballymoate, Westport, Banna, Ballinarobe, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis and Swinford. Arising from a combination of reduced throughput and falling prices, losses were incurred in 1998. NCF employs 20 full-time staff and up to 100 part-time staff during the peak periods of autumn and spring. Some staff work in one mart while others work in a number of them. Almost all live in small towns or rural areas where there is little alternative work. Most are elderly people who have worked in marts since the early 1970s. Accordingly they possess few of the skills needed in today's workplace and would find it difficult to retrain.</P>
    <P>Their income pattern has been a combination of the earnings from NCF, which fluctuate throughout the year, peaking in the period September &ndash; December, and social welfare for the days when work is not available. In recent months most employees have been seriously affected by the changes in the qualification criteria for social welfare. This has resulted in a serious loss of income for many of them and has caused many others to leave the employment of NCF. The effect of the changes is clearly emerging with staff leaving because they cannot continue if they are denied legitimate access to social welfare benefits. As an employer, NCF cannot be expected to make up the shortfall in incomes with the cattle industry in its present state.</P>
    <P>Staff have paid PAYE and PRSI on low earnings and now feel discriminated against. It is <Col N="768" /> ironic that this discrimination and severe interpretation of social welfare legislation has the greatest impact on the lowest earners in the most severely disadvantaged areas of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With effect from 4 January 1993, unemployment benefit is payable to a person who has suffered a substantial loss of employment. The regulations provide that a person must have sustained a substantial loss of employment in any period of six consecutive days to be eligible for payment. The regulations also provide that for a loss of employment to have been sustained there must have been a reduction in earnings.</P>
      <P>A claimant is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if he or she has lost at least one day of insurable employment from that which is deemed to be their normal level of employment coupled with a loss of earnings.</P>
      <P>The loss of employment is usually determined by reference to the average number of days worked per week over the 13 weeks prior to the date of the claim. The deciding officer, however, may use a different period if he or she considers it more appropriate. For example, in certain circumstances, it may be more appropriate to take the average number of days worked per week over the previous 26 weeks.</P>
      <P>A person who fails to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition for unemployment may, subject to a means test, qualify for payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Persons who are engaged in casual or systematic short-time employment and who wish to claim unemployment benefit are exempt from satisfying the substantial loss of employment condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In the time available it has not been possible to identify details of particular cases affected by the &ldquo;substantial loss of employment&rdquo; rule in the company concerned. If the Deputy lets me have the details of any cases where difficulties have arisen, I will have them examined and will write to him on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 June 1999.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the Education (Welfare) Bill 1999, which will replace existing school attendance legislation does not envisage a simple extension of existing school attendance services to additional areas.</P>
      <P>Rather, the legislation provides for a comprehensive restructuring of current services in the school attendance area. The Bill includes provision to increase the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years and to establish a new national educational welfare board to co-ordinate and implement services for children in difficulty within the school system. The board will have responsibility for implementing the Bill when enacted and ensuring its objectives are met on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Key provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure the early identification of children who have or who are likely to experience school attendance problems and the provision of assistance to these children and their families. The Bill also provides for the rights of parents to educate their children outside the recognised school system while ensuring that the rights of children to receive at least a minimum education are protected.</P>
      <P>As is the normal procedure in these cases, the Minister for Finance and his Department were consulted on the proposals in the Bill including their resource implications, prior to Government approval for publication of the Bill. Overall the Bill, when enacted, will involve the allocation of additional resources. The precise level of service will be dictated by the level of need. It is difficult to predict with accuracy the amount of additional resources which will be required. This is one of the issues that will be decided upon at implementation stage.</P>

      <P>Currently, my Department's involvement in pre-school provision is largely confined to the early start pre-school pilot programme <Col N="770" /> which is focused on areas of particular disadvantage. The 55 pre-school classes currently in place under this programme operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 15:1.</P>
      <P>There is no specific pupil teacher ratio applicable to infant classes generally in the primary system. The overall pupil teacher ratio in primary schools currently stands at 21:2. This will be further reduced in the next school year arising from the substantial improvements in staffing levels which I recently announced.</P>
      <P>A special reduced pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 is applicable to the junior classes of schools participating in the urban element of the breaking the cycle pilot scheme. Where necessary, additional staffing resources are made available to the schools in question to enable them to operate within this 15:1 ratio. Schools included in the urban element of the breaking the cycle pilot scheme, in common with all schools which have disadvantaged status, are also entitled to operate a maximum class size of 29:1 for classes generally.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I convened a national forum on early childhood education. My objective in holding this forum was to allow all groups with an interest in this area to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of early childhood education services. The question of staff to child ratios was one of the issues addressed in the forum discussions.</P>
      <P>My Department is now preparing a White Paper on early childhood education which will take account of the outcome of the forum. The White Paper will set out my proposals for future development of services in this area. The question of pupil teacher ratios for children in junior classes will be among the issues addressed in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has carried out a detailed analysis of data received from individual schools and this has allowed a more complete picture of the early school leaving issue to be developed than was ever the case in the past. On the basis of this data, the retention rate to completion of senior cycle for boys is some 10 per cent below that for girls. The reasons for the different retention rates for boys and girls have a social and an economic dimension which I intend to have examined further in order to advance policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing the retention rate to completion of senior cycle is a key education priority for this Government. There is already a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving. These include the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the <Col N="771" /> home school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the book grant scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils.</P>
    <P>These measures have been successful but do not represent a complete answer to this complex problem. At present our retention rate to completion of senior cycle remains around 83 per cent and clearly more targeted responses are now needed. The projects strand of the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 14 areas during the current school year. The projects aim to develop models of good practice in the integrated delivery of in-school and out-of-school actions by schools and by other statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The actions are designed to prevent early school leaving and support young people whose behaviours are predictive of leaving school early. The actions are also designed to support the return to the formal school system of young people who are not yet 15 years of age and are not in school. Information regarding effective models will be disseminated through the system generally and the models will be replicated in areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill, which was published recently, is an important plank in the campaign to keep students at school. The recently announced stay in school initiative costing £4.5 million represents a further major step towards alleviating the problem. The core point is that schools themselves need to take charge of tackling early school leaving and under the new scheme these schools will receive the supports they need to make an impact. The underlying objective of the stay in school project is to establish a direct link with individual schools experiencing serious retention problems and agree a programme of action with clear targets which is matched by appropriate resources. Fundamental to the scheme will be a direct link between the continuation of resources and the achievement of agreed targets.</P>
    <P>My Department will be evaluating these measures on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring that the longstanding and entrenched problem of early school leaving is systematically tackled across a range of fronts.</P>

      <P>Since its inception, the youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers has been overseen by an Inter-Departmental Committee on early <Col N="772" /> school leaving representing my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS and the national programme co-ordinators. In early 1996 following the ESF unit evaluation report on early school leavers provision, it was agreed that my Department would assume responsibility for policy in this area, but that delivery would continue to be provided jointly by FÁS and the vocational education committees in order to ensure the optimum range of choices for participants on the programme. It was also agreed in that context that responsibility for all matters relating to the network of senior traveller training centres would transfer to my Department along with the funding role for the payment of training allowances for youthreach participants within the VEC sector.</P>
      <P>Following this agreement, a national co-ordinator for senior traveller training centres was recruited by my Department to co-ordinate a staff development programme, share good practice and report on the effectiveness of the service. It was not found possible to transfer the responsibility for the traveller centres and youthreach allowances in 1997, but a full changeover of these elements took place with effect from 6 April 1998.</P>
      <P>Enhancements to the provision for early school leavers have been implemented on a phased basis including the provision of a FÁS advocate service to assist with initial orientation and assessment and progression opportunities; the development of a district approach under which all initiatives or expansion is prefaced by local meetings of all interested groups to ensure co-ordinated identification of priority needs and integrated area-based planning; the development in co-operation with the juvenile liaison service and the prison service of the copping on programme aimed at developing the skills of staff in challenging the behaviour of participants in a supportive environment in a range of areas covering crime, substance abuse, sexuality and relationships, handling conflict, dealing with peer pressure etc; the expansion of youthreach under the mid-term review of EU Structural Funds by some 2,637 places to meet a shortfall in places and improve progression from the programme; the widening of progression options through the provision of FÁS bridging measures, tailor made level 1 options within the VEC youthreach centres and opportunities to do the leaving certificate applied in a youthreach setting; the provision in 1998 for the first time of a guidance, counselling and psychological service for the programme; the provision of a child care measure for participants for the first time with effect from 1998; and the introduction of national certification by the National Council for Vocational Awards at foundation level in 1997 and at level 1 in 1999, providing a continuous pathway to level 2 PLC courses and from there to third level.</P>
      <P>My Department maintains close contact with a range of interest groups and the youthstart national support structure with a view to ensuring that the quality and delivery of the programme continues to evolve in line with changing needs.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have received correspondence from the board of management of Grangecon national school. The board has asked for the retention of the second mainstream teacher, and has also sought sanction for the appointment of a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with long-standing guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Grangecon national school is a principal and two mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 56 as at 30 September 1997. The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 49 pupils. Unfortunately, this does not meet the retention requirement for the second teacher despite the fact that the retention figures were reduced in the 1999-2000 staffing schedule.</P>
      <P>In relation to the application for a resource teacher, the Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.</P>
      <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of the needs.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Corrandrum national school on 30 September 1998 was 87 pupils. This enrolment warrants a teaching staff of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>This is the same staffing which the school currently has for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that while the pupil-teacher ratio serves a very useful function of indicating the relationship at national level between pupil numbers and teacher numbers, it does not accurately reflect the position in many classrooms. While there are schools which have a pupil teacher ratio which is lower than the national average, I equally accept that there are schools with a ratio which is higher than the national average.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my recent announcement regarding the staffing of national schools that I have introduced an improved staffing schedule for the 1999-2000 school year by allocating an additional 380 teaching posts to the primary sector. This will result in a further substantial reduction in the pupil teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>While the appointment figure for the third assistant teacher has been reduced in the new schedule, this reduction is not sufficient to allow Corrandrum national school to appoint an additional teacher to the school for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has received an application for additional accommodation from the board of management of this school. A member of the technical staff of my Department has inspected the school and arising from this inspection a report was required from a specialist firm concerning repairs to the ceiling. This report was submitted recently and is currently being examined by my Department's technical staff. As soon as the full extent of the repairs and other work has been determined, the necessary building work will be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the substance misuse prevention education programme for primary schools, &ldquo;Walk Tall,&rdquo; has already started. Its introduction commenced last January. It is being introduced to all primary schools on a phased basis during the two years 1999 and 2000. The programme, including detailed educational <Col N="775" /> resource materials for each class level, is being introduced to schools as staff seminars are held for the teachers. To date, &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; has been introduced to 400 primary schools, with a target of having the programme in all primary schools by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>A support team has been put in place for the dissemination process. The support team consists of a national project officer and five teacher trainers at present. Interviews have been held for one further teacher trainer and this additional person will be available from the beginning of the next school year. There is a management group for the project within my Department, including one senior psychologist who is project leader.</P>
      <P>Provision of £1 million for the dissemination of &ldquo;Walk Tall,&rdquo; over the two year period, has been included within the social inclusion funding for the Department of Education and Science announced in the budget statement. The provision in 1999 is £0.5 million. The supporting educational resource materials are being provided free to schools as the programme is introduced. The overall cost of preparation, design and printing of these materials, in the quantities required, was £142,000 in 1998 and this in addition to the £1 million referred to above.</P>
      <P>The administration of the process of dissemination is based in West Dublin education centre which co-operates with education centres in other locations in support of the dissemination.</P>
      <P>As a further support for teachers and schools in implementing the programme, the provision of longer in-service training courses for teachers has commenced, five of these courses have been held since the beginning of 1999 and a further six are planned for the summer months. It is envisaged that these courses will be the beginning of on-going in-career support for teachers in implementing and developing &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; in their schools. In addition, members of the support team have been available to make follow-up visits to local education centres, and to individual schools to the extent possible, to offer further guidance on implementation.</P>

      <Quest>the retention rates at third level he predicts into second year for those who commenced college in autumn 1998.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for drop out are complex and a range of factors operate in all institutions to give varying rates of retention. The detailed research required to enable the development of accurate predictors for progression from first to second year is still at the stage of being undertaken as I have set out below. Pending receipt of the findings of this research it is not possible to make a prediction on the percentage of students <Col N="776" /> who will progress from first year to second year in third level colleges in the autumn of 1999.</P>
      <P>In relation to the overall retention rate in the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The Authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report should be available by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>At my request, the Council of Directors of institutes of technology has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes, which will consist of a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students over a four year period, and a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
      <P>The research project team has visited each of the institutes of technology and is developing a standard format to which institutes of technology can respond to the variables that influence progression or retention for each course.</P>
      <P>Three institutes &ndash; Dundalk, Carlow and Tralee &ndash; have completed a pilot study on retention rates for first year students and the results have been made available to all the institutes. A summary of the report on the pilot study has been made available to the Department. While the estimated non-completion rate of first year students across the three institutes was 37 per cent, no single factor explains this overall rate. A range of academic, social, personal, financial and institutional specific variables seem to contribute to early leaving and/or failure. These findings will inform the National Committee on Retention.</P>
      <P>In addition to this I am supporting and promoting a number of initiatives in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition or drop out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a National Committee on Retention with representatives from each institute to focus on maximising success rates for institutes students. The committee is currently assembling a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile will be made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology continue to introduce a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction and orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of at risk first year students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantaged at third level, I have announced that I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector. This funding will support and complement the programmes already in place and will have <Col N="777" /> regard to the recommendations of the committee in relation to the funding of action projects or programmes both short and long-term based on best practice. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1998 I introduced the eight to 15 year old early school leavers programme which will operate for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. A total of £3.68 million has been committed to this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this programme is to test a range of strategic pilot projects aimed at combating the problem of early school leaving in selected urban and rural areas of disadvantage. Experience gained through the pilot programme will <Col N="778" /> facilitate the development of models of best practice which can be integrated, after evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
    <P>A total of 14 project areas have been selected for inclusion in the present phase of this initiative. Nine of the projects focus on large urban areas. Three projects focus on provincial towns and two on rural areas. The specific detail requested by the Deputy in relation to the location of each project; the numbers of students involved; and the funding allocated in each case, is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month I announced a £4.5 million initiative aimed at keeping pupils in school up to the end of the leaving certificate. The core approach underpinning this initiative is one of empowering schools to take charge of tackling early school leaving. Under this initiative, schools and VEC schemes with retention rates below the national average will be invited to put forward a retention plan for approval. It is expected that up to 40 schools will participate in the first phase of the initiative and each will receive resources to implement the agreed retention plan stay-in-school initiatives. The number of pupils catered for under the initiative will become known when schools are selected and retention plans are agreed with my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments aimed at encouraging children at risk to stay in school, my Department part funds the youthreach programme and a network of senior traveller training centres for those who have already left the system. The 1999 cost for the programme in the VEC sector in 1999 for this is £32.099 million for 3540 places. New developments since 1998 include the expansion of the programme by 2637 places in FÁS and the vocational education committees, the introduction of a guidance, counselling and psychological service, and the provision of child care support.</P>
    <P>Overall policy in this area is focused on the provision of a continuum of supports ranging from preventive actions such as home school liaison, the remedial, guidance and psychological services, additional staff and funds for schools in disadvantaged areas, staff development and curricular reforms and the forging of improved community links, to second chance education provision under programmes such as Youthreach.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will make a provision that the higher capitation afforded to children in special schools will also apply if these children are in an integrated setting.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard annual capitation grant payable to primary schools is £60 per pupil. This payment is made in respect of all children enrolled in ordinary classes in a school and would include any special needs children who are enrolled on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from £263 to £436 per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. Children attending special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools would generally have a level of special need which renders them unable to attend ordinary national schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>The difference in the level of capitation funding attracted by pupils attending special schools or special classes and those attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis arises from the reduced number of pupils involved in each special classroom situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of children per classroom in special schools and special classes will be significantly lower than the number in an ordinary <Col N="780" /> national school classroom. However, the general operating costs arising in both situations, in terms of light, heating etc., will not be reduced because of the lesser number of pupils in attendance.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, the level of funding attracted by each child attending a special class needs to be correspondingly greater than the norm in order to meet the standard operating costs which will continue to be incurred.</P>
    <P>For example, a special class for children with a mild general learning disability will cater for a maximum of 13 children. Such a classroom would give rise to the same ongoing operating costs as an ordinary classroom in a national school that would cater for a significantly higher number of pupils. It is necessary, therefore, that the special class children attract a correspondingly higher rate of capitation funding in order to meet the costs involved.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between arrangements relating to the funding of schools' ongoing operating costs and funding requirements which might arise where, for example, a child with a disability requires a special piece of equipment. Special separate funding arrangements are in place to deal with special equipment needs and any school can make application to my Department for funding towards the purchase of such equipment.</P>
    <P>I can also assure that Deputy that my Department will consider applications from mainstream national schools for the provision of specialised supports for pupils with special needs who have been fully integrated into the mainstream system.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme provides a basic level of service for children, primarily living in rural areas, who might otherwise have difficulty attending their nearest school regularly. Accommodation on school transport is used to maximise the carrying capacity for eligible and fare paying pupils. No provision is made under this scheme for parents to accompany their children to school.</P>
      <P>In urban areas schools are closer to pupils homes and accordingly fewer pupils qualify under the terms of the scheme. Where pupils in cities are eligible under the terms of the scheme and reside within the range of public scheduled transport, they are issued with term tickets on those services. These tickets are for pupils only and do not make provision for accompanying parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing funding arrangements for schools includes provision for the purpose of providing secretarial and caretaking services in schools. The way in which this provision is made reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for primary and second level schools and is consistent with the manner in which financial allocations are made to each type of school.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to primary schools, not already in receipt of clerical and caretaking assistance on a full or part-time basis under a scheme introduced in 1978-79, has been expanded in line with PESP and PCW undertakings. The current position is that all primary schools with 195 or more pupils are eligible for assistance under the scheme, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to second level is as follows. The allocation of caretaking and secretarial posts in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme-wide basis and it is a matter for each committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit. Most schools in this sector have the services of a full-time caretaker and a secretary. Community and comprehensive schools have a full-time secretary and caretaker and schools with an enrolment in excess of 500 pupils have two full-time secretaries. Secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more pupils and not covered by the 1978 scheme, for school secretaries are in receipt of additional <i>per capita</i> grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services, subject to maximum of £8,750 for caretaking and £10,500 in the case of secretarial services.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the level of grant payable to schools, which I increased by £5 per student in 1997 in respect of the secondary school secretarial grant, will be examined in the budgetary context and in light of available resources. I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gap in question arises from the fact that youthreach is currently aimed at unqualified early school leavers in the 15-18 age group,  <Col N="782" /> whereas the vocational training opportunity scheme caters for unemployed adults aged 21 upwards.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on adult education in an era of lifelong learning proposes a back to education initiative aimed at those in the population with less than upper secondary education through an expansion of part time options under youthreach, VTOS and PLC courses.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to lower the age threshold for VTOS below 21, the Green Paper proposes that barriers to progression of youthreach-eligible early school leavers in the 18-20 age group should be removed under the back to education initiative. Under this arrangement, unemployed young people who left school with either minimal or no qualifications, i.e less than five Ds at junior cycle would be facilitated to participate in education and training programmes while retaining an allowance.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that people in the 18-20 age group may re-enter the education system if they wish to pursue either general programmes or PLC courses, but what is at issue under youthreach and VTOS is the payment of a training allowance. Such participants may also avail, under the usual conditions, of a range of programmes provided by FÁS.</P>
      <P>With regard to the back to education initiative, funds of £0.5 million have been provided this year for the introduction of some 900 part time places under youthreach, VTOS and PLC courses. A working group has been set up to progress the initiative. As part of the process, the age barrier to progression for youthreach eligible participants will be removed.</P>

      <P>The junior certificate school programme <Col N="785" /> is an intervention within the junior certificate. It provides a curriculum framework which assists schools and individual teachers in adopting a student-centred approach to the junior certificate specifically aimed at a small but important minority of students whose particular needs are not adequately catered for in the present broadly based junior certificate programme. It provides an opportunity for each of those students to obtain a junior certificate recording his or her level of attainment.</P>
      <P>The junior certificate school programme was introduced in the school year 1996-97 in 44 centres. It was expended in 1997-98 to 60 centres. It is being offered at present in 85 centres. A special support unit was established to provide information on the programme and to assist schools with the implementation of the programme. The support service is located in the curriculum development unit of the City of Dublin VEC.</P>

      <P>At present, two of the educational psychologists employed by my Department provide a psychological service to all second level schools in the city and county of Waterford. I am aware that my Department does not, as yet, provide a psychological service to primary schools in the county and I realise that there is a need for all school children to have access to this service. For this reason, I announced, on February 11 last, the decision by the Government to establish a national educational psychological service agency. The sum of £1.5 million was made available in last December's budget for the initial phase of this measure.</P>
      <P>Expansion of the psychological service of this Department has now begun. Additional posts for psychologists were advertised last month. It is intended to appoint 25 additional psychologists during 1999 and, in accordance with the implementation plan for the new agency, a further 25 psychologists during the year 2000. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five-year period, and it is hoped that there will be the nucleus of a psychological service in every county by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the assignments of the additional psychologists will be made later in the year. Priority for the expansion of the psychological service will be given to those areas with a high incidence of educational disadvantage and with little access to other psychological services. My Department is therefore currently examining the needs and resources in all areas, including the city and county of Waterford, in order to set priorities.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service will be organised in close consultation with the Department of Health and Children, whose clinical services will also continue to provide help for families and children.</P>

Determinants of standards in an examination include the number of subjects taken in the terminal examination and the allocation of marks as between oral, aural and written components. One of the necessary instruments in carrying out any valid comparison will be a common European framework of reference, such as that currently being piloted by the Council of Europe. This framework gives descriptors for scales of proficiency at six different levels ranging from beginner to advanced.

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science reiterates the Government's commitment to the objective of creating a sporting environment that fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by safe, fair and ethical means. In pursuit of this objective and, as a signatory to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, the Government is pledged to take the necessary steps to exclude the use of banned doping agents and doping methods which may influence the performance of participants in sport.</P>
      <P>Within the physical education programme students are taught to plan, prepare for and participate in physical activity in order to develop the essential skills, understanding, attitudes and values which promote informed decision making, encourage participation in physical activity and support the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in the physical education programme is on the enrichment of the student as a</P>
      <P>person. This will be achieved by providing a series of learning experiences designed to contribute, in a holistic way, to individual and collective well being.</P>
      <P>The proposed new leaving certificate programme in physical education, which is planned</P>
      <P>for introduction in 2001 has, as one of its components, the study of the psycho-social aspects of physical activity, A range of issues will be addressed under this heading, including: contemporary trends in physical activity, ethics and competitions, deviance, cultural trends.</P>
      <P>As can be seen from this list the issues of substance misuse in sport can be examined from a number of perspectives.</P>
      <P>It is important to note in this regard that, for the vast majority of young people, participation in sport is a healthy and fulfilling activity, While it is acknowledged that there are certain instances of substance misuse the value of participation must at all times, be recognised and encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question in this area last month, I am very happy with the progress being made by schools in relation to the implementation of relationships and sexuality education. We need, however, to continue our efforts to ensure all children have access to an RSE programme which enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others.</P>
      <P>I also indicated that I attach such importance to RSE that I asked late last year that information be collected on the level of implementation of RSE in schools. To this end the final figures of a national survey on the implementation of relationships and sexuality education are now available. These indicate that 24 per cent of respondent primary schools are already implementing an RSE programme and 57 per cent intend to teach RSE in some or all classes during the current school year. Sixty seven per cent of respondent post-primary schools are implementing RSE in some or all classes and 78 per cent intend to teach RSE in some or all classes during the current school year.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the first step for schools in introducing RSE is to develop a school policy, which involves school management, parents and teachers in a collaborative process. Information seminars have been held for parents at school level and for boards of management/management authorities. Policy development seminars and whole school staff seminars have also been held. In this regard 67 per cent of primary schools and 68 per cent of post-primary schools have established RSE policy committees. The implementation of an RSE programme in schools follows from this process.</P>
      <P>The process of policy formulation through partnership is a relatively new experience for many school communities. Many schools have found this process to be a valuable and rewarding</P>
      <P>experience in so far as it gave them an opportunity to discuss a vision for their children's education, enunciate a school ethos and debate the issues involved.</P>
      <P>I recognise that schools are at different stages in implementing a programme. The information on progress collected from the survey will enable effective targeting of supports. In this regard the RSE training support service, with whom I myself meet regularly, continues to monitor the implementation of RSE in schools and acts as a support to schools in this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the nature of the process involved it is not possible to say when the overall programme will be completed. However, I am satisfied that <Col N="790" /> significant progress has already been made and that this progress will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The preparation of teachers for the introduction of film as a text in leaving certificate English is an integral part of the extensive inservice programme currently being implemented by my Department for the over 4,100 teachers of leaving certificate English. This programme is funded by the in-career development unit and was developed by the inspectorate in collaboration with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and with the trainers for the programme.</P>
      <P>In year one of the in-service programme which started last autumn, a module on film as an element of comparative study formed part of a series of full-day meetings for teachers in local groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the ongoing programme of training of trainers, an intensive three-day programme on film as a text in comparative studies will be given to the group of thirteen trainers in early September 1999. This will prepare them to deliver specific in-service on film to the teachers concerned. This training programme will focus on: the reading of film as text; the semiotics of a film text; classroom methodologies appropriate to the <Col N="791" /> teaching of film; and discussion-writing-skills appropriate to the inclusion of film alongside written text.</P>
    <P>The above programme on the study of film as text will form part of the overall in-service training for teachers in year two. In addition support will be provided for the teachers by means of helplines, the provision of a range of materials, training in the area of information and communication technology and in-service training organised by subject associations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision for training in the area of information and communication technology within the schools IT 2000 programme, the amount of money available for the in-career development of teachers in 1999 is £9.320 million. A further amount of approximately £1 million is also under consideration. The estimated cost of in-service for the revised leaving certificate English curriculum to be met from this provision is £1.26 million; this in-service caters for the film element of the curriculum for which there is not a separate allocation.</P>
    <P>Information on the number of hours and courses, which will be provided in 1999, will not be available until after the end of the year. In 1998, there were 134,527 participants in in-career development who received 848,285 hours training in a wide range of courses. It is expected that numbers will be of the same order in 1999. In addition the national centre for technology in education (NCTE) provided training for 24,000 teachers in 1998. It is expected that 21,000 places will be available on NCTE funded courses this year.</P>
    <P>Twelve hours training is being provided during 1999 for each of the teachers involved in the revised leaving certificate curriculum through local meetings and school visits which will include in-service in the area of film. Further support is being provided by means of helplines, materials, ICT training and training organised by subject associations to which I referred to earlier in the context of film.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a special fund for students with disabilities from which students at third level and in the post leaving certificate sector with disabilities, including deaf and hearing impaired students, may apply for assistance. The 1998 allocation to the fund was £250,000. Grants from the fund are made to students for the purchase of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted interpreters and personal assistants. I understand that of the students assisted last year, 39 deaf-hearing impaired students were allocated funding amounting to £96,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to this the higher education authority makes targeted funding available to the universities for initiatives designed to promote access to and participation in higher education for students with disabilities. In 1998 a sum of £400,000 was made available for this purpose. Examples of initiatives funded to date of particular relevance to deaf and hearing impaired students include installation of loop systems, assistive technologies, counselling and other student support services, special alarm systems and staff training and awareness development.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have announced details of a £6.9 million two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. Details of the allocation of these additional resources will be announced in due course when I have fully considered how best to proceed in these areas. However, I can assure the Deputy that I intend to increase the funding available for students with disabilities. As regards the discretionary nature of the current arrangements which date from 1994, I would prefer to have an entitlement based scheme. Obviously, the financial and other resources associated with such a scheme would have to be clearly established and in this regard, I would mention that the higher education authority is commissioning a detailed survey on the provision for students with disabilities in the third level sector. I understand that this survey will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

My Department participates in a European thematic cluster network led by the youthstart national support structure in Ireland to share best practice and new learning in this area.</P>
      <P>The integration of these concepts into early school leaver programmes is an ongoing feature of the work of Youthreach and senior traveller training centre programmes.

Local referral networks are in place linking the providers of Youthreach with other services including area based partnerships, local employment services, schools, juvenile liaison, probation and welfare, employers, youth services and relevant community groups.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that these are regional averages, and that many individual schools would have average class sizes well in excess of these figures. However, as a result of the substantial improvements which I announced earlier this <Col N="794" /> year, there will be significant reductions in class sizes generally in the 1999-2000 school year. The newly announced staffing schedule has been structured to enable all schools to operate to a maximum class average of 30 pupils. Schools in all areas will benefit from this new schedule.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that, while there is no specific target figure for class sizes, I am committed to implementing further reductions in class sizes over the next number of years which will benefit schools in all locations.</P>

      <P>Second chance education for early school leavers is provided through youthreach and a network of senior traveller training centres. The initiative is overseen by an Interdepartmental Committee on Early School Leaving which includes representation from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS and the national programme co-ordinators. Overall, 7,162 places are provided in over 130 centres by FÁS and the vocational education committees, supported by a guidance, counselling and psychological services initiative and childcare support. National certification is available, and the programme provides progression to a range of further education and training programmes or employment.</P>
      <P>Unemployed adults may avail of a range of FÁS programmes, and some 9,850 people have returned to education under my Department's vocational training opportunity scheme and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs's back to education allowance scheme. However, the Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, recognises that second chance education options for adults generally are under developed in Ireland, and recommends a range of actions to address needs in this area. Top priorities in that context are the development of a national adult literacy programme, a back to education initiative providing part-time options for those with less than upper secondary education, and the development of support services such as guidance and child care. A major consultation process is under way at present which will lead to the development and publication of a White Paper setting out the Government's priorities for the development of the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, provision for adult literacy has increased by £250,000 in 1997, £2 million in 1998, and a further £1.6 million in 1999 and a national adult literacy development fund established to fund a range of strategic projects to inform future practice. An extra £0.5 million has been provided this year to develop some 900 part-<Col N="795" /> time places on VTOS, Youthreach and PLC programmes and a working group has been established to develop a framework for the initiative. This development will be important in facilitating the combination of education with work and-or family responsibilities, in attracting a wider range of clients to programmes, and in promoting the flexibility of the system to respond to emerging needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The measures announced by the Government in response to the needs of people who were victims of abuse in childhood include the establishment of a commission which will provide a forum for victims of abuse and conduct wide-ranging inquiries into the nature, extent and causes of abuse of children in Irish society; the establishment of a countrywide counselling service dedicated for victims of abuse, and changes to the law relating to litigation in child abuse cases and sexual offences against children.</P>
      <P>These measures were the result of work carried out over a number of months and represented a determination by the Government to move away from the inadequate responses which had been seen too often on previous occasions. Substantial progress has been made to-date in implementing the measures.</P>
      <P>The commission has been appointed and includes Ms Justice Mary Laffoy of the High Court as chairperson, Dr. Imelda Ryan, consultant cHild and Adolescent psychiatrist and Mr. Bob Lewis, a former director of social services in Stockport, England. My Department is making arrangements for the appointment of a secretariat to the commission and these arrangements are well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the proposals relating to the provision of counselling for victims of abuse is also at an advanced stage of planning. The management advisory committee of the Department of Health and Children met the chief executive officers of the health boards on 26 May to discuss the establishment of these services. Discussions are continuing and the resolution of all <Col N="796" /> planning and operational issues is being accorded a high priority by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
    <P>As regards proposals for legislation, the Government has given approval for the drafting of a Sex Offenders Bill which will provide for the establishment of a register of sex offenders and deal with the post-release supervision of sex offenders. It will also create an offence for a convicted child sex offender to seek or accept employment involving unsupervised access to children without informing the employer of the conviction.</P>
    <P>As part of the package of measures to assist victims of child abuse, the Government agreed to legislate within the current Dáil session to extend the concept of disability under the Statute of Limitations to victims of child sexual abuse who because of that abuse have been unable to bring civil claims within the normal limitation period, and to refer immediately to the Law Reform Commission the issue of limitation periods as they apply to claims based on non-sexual childhood abuse.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed legislation, the Government has decided to proceed by way of amendment to the Private Members' Bill on the matter moved by Deputy O'Sullivan. The Government supported the principle of the Bill at Second Stage and Government time was made available for that debate.

      <Quest>the total percentage of his budget at primary and post primary levels allocated specifically to schemes which counter socio-economic disadvantage in schools; and the number and proportion of teachers allocated to these schemes at each level.</Quest>

      <P>My Department operates a policy of positive discrimination in favour of all disadvantaged students and schools. Total provision in support of the disadvantaged includes the core funding of these schools, special staffing arrangements, increased capitation grants, favourable arrangements in regard to capital provision, including local contributions, alleviation of examination fees and transport costs, the provision of special curricular programmes, a schools psychological service and a number of student support schemes. As support for the disadvantaged permeates virtually all aspects of education expenditure, it is not feasible to indicate precisely the percentage of budgets devoted to it.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the vital role that education can play in ensuring greater social inclusion. Education is a key ingredient in ensuring that each individual has the opportunity to maximise his or her potential. Education is also crucial in breaking the cycle of inter-generational disadvantage and re-integrating into society and the workforce those at risk of becoming marginalised.</P>
      <P>For these reasons my Department has, as I have stated earlier, a wide range of measures in place, including early intervention measures, to help alleviate the negative impact of socio-economic disadvantage across the education spectrum.</P>
      <P>The primary mechanism for addressing the effects of socio-economic deprivation is the disadvantaged areas schemes which provide special teaching assistance and extra funding to schools in designated areas of disadvantage. At present under these schemes, a total of 318 primary schools and 211 second level schools are in receipt of special support packages. The schools in question serve a total of 72,947 primary pupils and 99,000 second level pupils in disadvantaged areas. There are 294 additional over-quota teaching posts at primary level and 209 additional teaching posts at second level.</P>
      <P>Schools in the disadvantaged areas schemes may also benefit from other initiatives targeted to combat educational disadvantage. These include the home/school/community liaison scheme; the breaking the cycle pilot scheme; the early start pre-school pilot project; and the support teacher pilot scheme, all of which are targeted on primary schools in areas of particular disadvantage. In addition, the recently introduced early school leavers initiative focuses on children in the eight to 15 year age group and involves schools at both first and second-level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other significant initiatives to aid the disadvantaged include the vocational training opportunities scheme for unemployed people over 21 years of age, Youthreach for young people who have left the education system without any qualifications, support for junior and senior traveller training centres and the provision of teaching ser<Col N="798" /> vices to FÁS funded community training workshops. My Department provides significant funding in support of disadvantaged youth outside of the formal education system and contributes also to the alleviation of educational disadvantage among adults.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that some months ago I announced details of a major new initiative to tackle educational disadvantage. This plan commits the Government to targeted expenditure of £57 million over the next two years aimed at addressing educational disadvantage at all levels in the education sector.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month I announced a £4.5 million initiative aimed at keeping pupils in school up to the end of the leaving certificate. Under this initiative, schools and VEC schemes with retention rates below the national average will be invited to put forward a retention plan for approval. It is expected that up to 40 schools will participate in the first phase of the initiative and each will receive almost £40,000 on average to implement their stay-in-school initiatives. The number of pupils catered for under the initiative will become known when schools are selected and retention plans are agreed with my Department.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined in summary here indicate the clear commitment of this Government to tackling disadvantage in all areas of education and I am confident that they will be of major assistance in addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill, which I recently published will provide for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service. The legislation includes specific measures to <Col N="799" /> put in place an effective tracking system to ensure children can be identified and early interventions put in place in support of children who are at risk of dropping out of the school system at all levels, including those at risk of not transferring to second level education.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives of the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative, a two year pilot project which was introduced in September 1998, is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. Among the models being tested are transfer programmes from primary to second level including the tracking of all sixth class pupils of 1998 in the schools involved in this initiative.</P>

      <P>Part-time courses are an essential part of our third level system, offering educational opportunities for those students who are unable to pursue full-time study for a variety of reasons and offer routes for those who wish to update their skills and qualifications. Our third level institutions offer a wide range of part-time options and there were almost 23,000 part-time students enrolled in 1996-97, which is the last year for which complete statistics are available. The numbers of part-time students has remained relatively constant, at around 22,000 to 23,000 over the past few years. While, I concur with the view of the steering committee on the future development of higher education that facilitating students in attending part-time is both highly desirable and cost effective and would encourage third level colleges in this regard, I have no plans to require third level colleges to take any specific steps. The colleges are providing more flexible course options with the increased use of modular courses and distance education options. I expect that these developments will continue and become more widespread, particularly in the context of the strength of the Irish labour market.</P>

      <P>As a first step, the research centre carried out a programme of testing in English and mathematics in third and sixth class in the schools in 1997 to establish baselines against which future test results would be compared.

      <P>My Department is always open to suggestions on improving the existing examination schedule and the examination timetable is finalised every year only after consulting with the education partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While discussions on the timetable for 2000 have yet to take place, the possibility of examining during the Easter period has been considered on a number of previous occasions. There are practical issues which impact on the scheduling of examinations during the Easter break including <Col N="801" /> the availability of students, access to schools, the provision of transport and the recruitment of sufficient suitable examiners. In relation to ensuring an adequate supply of examiners it should be noted that the oral examinations require 6,500 examiner days. As teachers volunteer to act as examiners, scheduling the examinations during what is a vacation period during which the teacher union conferences are held, would prove problematic.</P>
    <P>In relation to the practical examinations it must be borne in mind that the current timing reflects the fact that the leaving certificate is a two year programme. Holding practical examinations over six months prior to the end of the leaving certificate programme raises issues such as student readiness for the examination and pressure on teachers to complete a two year programme in a year and a half. In addition, for many of the subjects that are examined using practical assessment techniques, there is also a requirement to complete projects. The projects start before Christmas, usually in November, and are scheduled for completion by a date that allows for further preparation for the practical examinations.</P>
    <P>Timetable arrangements will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis with interested parties. Our approach is to try to build consensus regarding improvements.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved <Col N="802" /> courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however, a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education. These courses in Ireland are subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the levels of graduate output which would be appropriate to the needs of the Irish economy and society. In this context, it was decided that it would not be appropriate to limit the number of students on such courses in Ireland while at the same time providing maintenance grants to students on similar courses abroad. The question of the continued exclusion of these courses from the higher education grants schemes will be kept under review.</P>

Information is also sought on new entrants to and leavers from special schools and special classes and the origin and destination of such pupils. This information is gathered at school level.</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate statistical data relating to special needs children within the education system, particularly in integrated settings, and the development of mechanisms to address this deficit is one of the key issues currently being considered by a special steering group established in my Department to review overall provision in the special needs area. In considering this issue, the group will have regard to the findings of a recent survey of special needs within the second level system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a major development in special education services under which all special needs children in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs.

My Department recently issued a series of circulars and an information note to advise schools on the procedures to be followed, including the supporting <Col N="803" /> data required, in seeking a special support under this initiative. The data in question will include particulars of the individual special needs children involved; their ages &ndash; and the nature of their disabilities.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Children Act, 1908, responsibility for the inspection of industrial and reformatory schools rests with the Minister for Education and Science and with the chief inspector of schools. Under their direction, inspection of these residential centres is carried out by a designated inspector of industrial and reformatory schools. At present, there are two industrial schools and three reformatory schools. The inspector, and a child care adviser under his direction, have responsibility for monitoring and for reporting and advising on standards of management and on the protection, care, safety and wellbeing of the children. Reports and findings are not published by the inspectorate. The Children Bill, which will replace the Children Act, 1908, will make provision for the inspection of all aspects of residential care in these centres. Special national schools, attached to these centres, are inspected by the primary inspectorate of my Department.</P>
      <P>Because of these developments, I do not believe it is necessary to establish the inspectorate as an independent agency. The inspectorate functions very well as an essential and integral part of the Department and it is my view that, operating in this way, it can make the most worthwhile and effective contribution to the work of the Department and to the development and evaluation of the education system.</P>

      <P>The position is that under regulations in <Col N="804" /> place between 1934 and 1958 female national school teachers were required to resign on marriage. The marriage bar applied to teachers who were appointed for the first time between 1 October 1934 and 30 June 1958.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 July 1958, female teachers were no longer required to resign on marriage. Furthermore female teachers who had resigned on marriage were free to seek appointments and return to the teaching service.</P>
      <P>The effect of the marriage bar was that the pensionable service of female teachers appointed after 30 September 1934 and who married prior to 1 July 1958 was interrupted. Similar provisions were in operation at that time throughout the public service.</P>
      <P>In 1979 it was agreed that teachers who were then in service and who had been in training in 1934 at the time the bar was introduced would be given pensionable credit of up to five years in respect of interruptions in service resulting from the marriage bar. With this sole exception, there are no provisions for making such interruptions in service pensionable. Any further proposals in this regard would have to be considered in a public service wide context and this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Three assessment instruments were used in the recent evaluation of early start children which compared the attainment of children in junior infants with that of children who had not been in early start.</P>
      <P>Early screening profiles designed for use with children aged between two and seven were used to assess cognitive and motor development. Subscales of the test were used to assess verbal concepts, visual discrimination, logical relations, basic school skills, in particular, receptive and expressive language abilities, gross motor development and fine motor development.</P>
      <P>The Drumcondra primary reading test &ndash; Level 2, Form A &ndash; was used to assess pupils' achievement in word analysis, reading vocabulary and reading comprehension. Drumcondra mathematics test &ndash; Level 1, Form B &ndash; was used to assess pupils' achievements in computation, mathematical concepts and problem solving, involving number and measurement. There were no significant differences between the cognitive attainment of the experimental and control groups on the tests.</P>
      <P>Longitudinal literacy and numeracy tests on the first cohort of early start pupils in second class have been carried out in November-December 1998 and tests on the second cohort will be carried out in November-December 1999. Reports on these tests will provide comparisons with the attainment of the children's peers in second class who did not participate in early start. They will also provide comparisons with the attainment levels of pupils who were in second class in the project schools at the start of the scheme in 1994. These reports will be available in early July 1999 and June 2000 respectively.</P>
      <P>The process of in-career development for the teachers and child care workers in early start is ongoing and is under continuing review in light of developments in the project. A core group of early start personnel engaged in innovative professional development during the 1997-98 school year. Through their work with the trainers, a draft working document that identifies structured play activities and the holistic development of the children, including cognitive development, was prepared. This work is being disseminated to a further group of early start personnel in the current school year.</P>
      <P>A White Paper on early childhood education is being prepared by my Department. This paper will take into account the report on the forum on early childhood education and the evaluation report on early start. It is not proposed to make any changes in early childhood education provision until this White Paper is published and considered by all the partners involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that a copy of the evaluation report was not made available to Deputy Shortall as I indicated to her in my reply on 23 March 1999. I have taken measures to ensure that this situation <Col N="806" /> has now been rectified. I am also arranging to forward a copy of the report to Deputy Shatter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Records in my Department indicate that a total of 20,059 days were worked by untrained teachers in the first three months of this year. The corresponding figure for the first three months of 1998 was 14,962 days. There are no similar details available in relation to second level.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary education system. Accordingly, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. Firstly, I have ensured that the intake of trainee teachers to the colleges of education in 1998-99 was increased to over 1,000. This includes 748 students who will pursue the three year B. Ed. Degree programme, while 280 degree holders have been admitted to an 18 month full-time post-graduate training course. There were 500 entrants on the 1996-97 year.</P>
      <P>Additionally, B. Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who either have Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to Grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education are recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service.</P>
      <P>Finally, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Education Awards, are granted recognition as fully trained substitutes since 1 September 1998.</P>
      <P>In all, these initiatives will have a significant impact in reducing the number of untrained substitutes days in our primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> In relation to second level schools there had been some difficulties in finding trained teachers in a number of key subjects. A working group composed of representatives of the universities, my Department and the Higher Education Authority, under the aegis of the authority, was reconvened to undertake an in-depth review of future needs for second level teachers. This review focused both on total needs and on needs by subject grouping, where feasible, and examined all relevant factors such as pupil numbers, pupil teacher ratios, teacher retirements and career breaks. In light of the recommendations of the working group, I agreed to an increase in the number of places, from 800 to 940, on the Higher Diploma in Education courses for the current academic year. Of the 140 additional places, 100 places are specifically for teachers of Irish, religion, Italian, Spanish and key sciences. The further 40 places are for the Higher Diploma in Education course through Irish which has been introduced at National University of Ireland, Galway.</P>

      <P>It is intended to issue the results of the junior certificate examination so that they will be in schools in the week commencing 13 September.</P>
      <P>The result dates for the certificate examinations are a function of the timing of the actual examinations and the time required for marking the scripts and processing the results.</P>
      <P>While my Department makes every effort to issue results as early as possible it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date of the leaving certificate is not to be affected. Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners, my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met. This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides, where necessary, additional time to examiners undertaking the marking of the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that priority must be given to the issue of the leaving certificate results so as to ensure that the CAO college entry process executes in a timely manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1999, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation initiated a consultation process on the question of unbundling the local loop. That process is still under way and I understand the director anticipates issuing a report on the matter next month. It would be inappropriate for me to anticipate the conclusions which that report will draw. I maintain close relations with the trade union interests on a variety of telecommunications issues. I have had an informal meeting and discussion with members of the Communications Workers Union on local loop unbundling.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is no specific legislative requirement in the corpus of current community telecommunications legislation which obliges unbundling of the local loop. However, in common with a number of other European Administrations, I believe this is an issue which should be carefully examined and I look forward to the director's report on the outcome of the consultation process.</P>
      <P>My Department keeps regular contact with the European Commission on a broad range of telecommunications related topics, including unbundling the local loop, and Ireland will contribute as necessary to any review of unbundling carried out by the Commission.</P>
      <P>In other member states, unbundling the local loop is still at an early stage and, while I understand that a number of them are at various stages in its introduction, it is too early to draw concrete conclusions from those efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 Finance Act provided for a new seafarers tax allowance of £5,000 per annum. This allowance is available in respect of seafaring earnings, and is conditional on a seafarer being at sea on a voyage to or from a foreign port for at least 169 days in a tax year on a passenger or cargo ship which is registered in an EU member state's shipping register. The 1998 Finance Act also allowed voyages to offshore servicing installations outside Irish waters to be allowable for the purposes of this seafarers tax allowance. This allowance has now been extended in the 1999 Finance Act to the crews of vessels servicing such rigs within Irish waters.</P>
      <P>Certain long-haul seafarers, who do not meet the requirements outlined above, may qualify under the foreign earnings deduction scheme (FED) which applies generally to any persons working abroad for a substantial part of the year. To qualify for this deduction an employee must spend at least 90 qualifying days abroad in a tax year or 12 month period, and each period of absence must be for a minimum of 14 days at a time. A long-haul seafarer can claim either the seafarer allowance or the FED, but not both.</P>
      <P>The FED does not apply to the UK. However, I did make an exception last year to cater for the special circumstances faced by seafarers on long-haul voyages who happen to make an incidental stop en route at a UK port. This concession is, therefore, consistent with the overall aim of the deduction as already outlined.</P>
      <P>The Irish shipping sector is in a position to avail of an attractive mix of incentives. These incentives cover both employers and employees and include not only the 1998 and 1999 Finance Acts measures outlined above but also the employers' PRSI exemption that currently applies to the Irish maritime transport sector. These provisions are also consistent with the European Commission's guidelines on State aids to the maritime transport sector and I believe that the measures will help improve the competitive position of the Irish shipping sector in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the income tax reliefs for seafarers which were introduced in 1998 and extended in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>

      <P>Under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural <Col N="812" /> land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendent. The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale. For all these reasons, I do not propose to provide an exemption from income tax from a farm land lease entered into between related persons whether for the purposes of the early retirement scheme or generally.</P>

      <P>People who are born with limb deficiencies are entitled to the same range of medical services available to the whole population under the public health services system operated by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The granting of a medical card to any individual is a matter, under statute, for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. The position is that a card may be granted where the chief executive officer is of the view that the person is unable, without undue hardship, to provide health services for themselves or their dependants.</P>
      <P>Where a person is not covered by a medical card, a health board may provide assistance with the cost of items, such as artificial limbs. However, each case is dealt with by the health board on its own merits. If the Deputy is aware of difficulties in a particular case, I will be glad to pass on the details to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for his/her attention and direct reply.</P>

      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 May 1999, the member states of the European Union were informed by the Commission via the rapid alert system of the contamination with dioxin of certain foodstuffs produced in Belgium. Contamination had been discovered in poultry feed, poultry and egg products. Concern was then expressed about the possible contamination of other food products.</P>
      <P>On 3 and 4 June 1999 respectively, the Commission adopted two decisions (1999/363/EC and 1999/368/EC) on protective measures with regard to contamination by dioxins of poultry and egg products and of products intended for human or animal consumption derived from bovine animals and pigs. These decisions require Belgium to prohibit the placing on the market of a range of listed products unless the products are not derived from holdings put under restriction by the Belgian authorities or the results of analysis indicate that the products are not contaminated with dioxin. The Belgian authorities were obliged to inform the Commission of the competent authorities to certify that produce is in compliance with these decisions.</P>
      <P>Because of the possible risk to public health and because of our legal obligation under Commission decisions, the Department of Agriculture and Food detained suspect produce throughout the country and banned further imports. The Department of Health and Children banned the sale of suspect produce and issued an alert to retailers and health boards to withdraw and detain possible contaminated products on retail shelves. Consumers were advised to avoid eating Belgian products until clearance was received from the European Union.</P>
      <P>There were certain delays in the European Commission receiving information from the Belgian authorities on certifying authorities as required under the Commission Decisions. On Friday June 11, the Irish authorities received clarification on this issue and the information was immediately provided to Irish importers and retailers. A certification procedure is now in place for products under veterinary control, as set down in Commission Decision 1999/390/EC and products are being released onto the market as soon as the certification is cleared by the relevant Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Products not under veterinary control and detained last week are being released by this <Col N="815" /> Department on production of appropriate certification. Future import controls of these products are currently being discussed at EU level.</P>
    <P>Ongoing monitoring of the situation is continuing and both Departments and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland are operating in close association. The Deputy will understand that these precautions are necessary in the interest of public health.</P>

      <P>The provision of appropriate GP cover in Shrule is a matter for the Western Health Board. I understand from the board that a general practitioner provides a scheduled clinic in Shrule health centre every Wednesday afternoon. Domiciliary visits are made by the GP on a daily basis as requested and 24 hour emergency cover is provided by the GP seven days a week. The GP has his main centre of practice in Cong with daily morning clinics which patients attend. Cong is nine-ten miles from Shrule, Headford is four miles from Shrule and has four practising GP's and Ballinrobe is ten miles away with two practising GP's. Patients from the Shrule area would also attend GP's in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board is satisfied that adequate GP cover is provided in the Shrule area.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. I understand from the board that an assessment of the needs of the rheumatology service throughout the region is currently under way with a view to preparing a corporate strategic plan for the development of the service over the next five years. Until this review is complete, it would be too early for me to comment on the need for a rheumatologist and a rheumatology service at Mayo General Hospital. I understand however that the board envisages that it is likely that the review will point to a need for an enhancement of the region's rheumatology services. Upon receipt of the completed strategic review my Department will be in a position to consider the case for making further investment in rheumatology services in the western region in consultation with the Western Health Board and having regarding to competing demands on available resources.</P>

      <P>As arthritis is not a notifiable disease and as most cases are treated by general practitioners rather than in hospital, comprehensive information on the number of people suffering from the condition is not available. For persons with the condition who do require hospitalisation, data are available from the hospital in-patient inquiry system which records information on hospitalisation in all publicly funded acute hospitals. For the period 1994 to 1998 the number of persons resident in County Mayo who were hospitalised for either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are provided in the table below. It should be noted that if patients are admitted more than once in a given year, each attendance is recorded separately in HIPE.</P>

    <P>I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher that the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million to services for the older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists and the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
    <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator/bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list. The policy circular reiterates the targets of treating adults in target specialities within 12 months, and of treating children in target specialities within six months.</P>
    <P>Public in-patient waiting lists are maintained by every acute hospital in the country. In its recent policy circular on the operation of the waiting list initiative, my Department has emphasised to <Col N="818" /> agencies the importance of validating these lists so that an accurate and up-to-date picture of the situation can be available at all times.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme &ndash;<Col N="819" /> extension to Kilmaine and Shrule &ndash; were submitted to my Department in 1987 but have not been approved. As the scheme is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme it comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the need for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-2006. The most recent Environmental Protection Agency report on drinking water quality indicates that the existing public water supplies at Shrule and Kilmaine are generally of a satisfactory quality. There are no proposals with my Department for a water supply scheme for the Neale or Cross areas. Rural communities in the Neale and Cross areas are largely supplied by private group water schemes. Under my Department's rural water programme substantial funding is available to local authorities to assist group schemes with the current and capital costs of measures to remedy water quality problems. On 28 May last, the block grant allocation to Mayo County Council for this purpose was increased to £1 million.</P>

      <P>Resource teacher support is allocated to cater for the special needs of children with disabilities who are attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis. The level of support in any particular case will be determined by the number of children involved and the nature and extent of their special needs, as identified by professional assessment. In some instances, a resource teacher post may be allocated to a school on a full-time basis. In other cases, the post may be allocated on a shared basis between schools. Alternatively, a part-time hours allocation may be made where the need is not sufficient to warrant the allocation of a full post.</P>
      <P>All such allocations are set at a level which reflects the degree of disability involved.</P>

      <P>The proposals announced by the Government on 11 May, and drawn up by the sub-committee on child abuse, in response to the needs of people who were victims of abuse in childhood include the establishment of a commission which will provide a forum for victims of abuse and conduct wide-ranging inquiries into the nature, extent and causes of abuse of children in Irish society; the establishment of a countrywide counselling service dedicated for victims of abuse, and changes to the law relating to litigation in child abuse cases and sexual offences against children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Substantial progress has been made to-date in implementing the measures. The commission has been appointed and includes Ms Justice Mary Laffoy of the High Court as chairperson, Dr. Imelda Ryan, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and Mr. Bob Lewis, a former director of social services in Stockport, England. My Department is making arrangements for the appointment of a secretariat to the commission and these arrangements are well advanced.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the proposals relating to the provision of counselling for victims of abuse is also at an advanced stage of planning. The management advisory committee of the Department of Health and Children met the chief executive officers of the health boards on 26 May to discuss the establishment of these services. Discussions are continuing and the resolution of all planning and operational issues is being accorded a high priority by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
    <P>As regards proposals for legislation, the Government has given approval for the drafting of a sex offenders Bill which will provide for the establishment of a register of sex offenders and deal with the post-release supervision of sex offenders. It will also create an offence for a convicted child sex offender to seek or accept employment involving unsupervised access to children without informing the employer of the conviction.</P>
    <P>As part of the package of measures to assist victims of child abuse, the Government agreed; to legislate within the current Dáil session to extend the concept of disability under the Statute of Limitations to victims of child sexual abuse who because of that abuse have been unable to bring civil claims within the normal limitation period, and to refer immediately to the Law Reform Commission the issue of limitation periods as they apply to claims based on non-sexual childhood abuse.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed legislation, the Government has decided to proceed by way of amendment to the Private Members' Bill on the matter moved by Deputy O'Sullivan. The Government supported the principle of the Bill on Second Stage and Government time was made available for that debate. Government amendments will be circulated shortly and will be debated on Committee Stage before the Dáil Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>In relation to the referral to the Law Reform Commission, I am informed that the Attorney General referred the issue of limitation periods in non-sexual child abuse cases to the Law Reform Commission on 25 May.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee will keep the implementation of the procedures under review.</P>

      <P>Within the limitations of our examination system, every possible effort is made to accommodate candidates who suffer illness, bereavement or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations.</P>
      <P>These arrangements, which are put in place at very short notice, can involve adjustments to examination starting and finishing times, provision of special centres in hospitals and support from the Department's psychological service.</P>
      <P>The nature of our examination system imposes very real constraints in this area. Essentially the leaving certificate examination is a terminal examination which is examined by external examiners. This contrasts with other examination systems where assessment is conducted on a continuous basis or where assessment takes place at regular intervals and where some of the assessment is conducted by the student's own teachers. It is an inevitable consequence of a terminal point in time system of assessment that some students will take particular tests at a time that is far from suitable for them. By contrast where students are regularly assessed over the entire duration of a course the final grade awarded can be based on overall performance and therefore need not be contingent exclusively on how a student performs on one day alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that each year my Department receives correspondence from candidates and their parents setting out a wide range of difficulties and traumas. It is no exaggeration to say that some of these are quite heart-rending. I asked the advisory group on examinations, which is chaired by Dr. Tom Kelleghan, to include this area in its discussion paper on special arrangements. This paper, which I arranged to have published <Col N="824" /> recently, makes a number of critical observations. In particular, the point is made that a basic difficulty in addressing the situation where a candidate was not able to give of his or her best during an examination is the impossibility of establishing objective criteria that would identify cases that merit consideration and of determining the appropriate adjustment to be made in the marking process.</P>
    <P>The group's discussion paper also refers to a range of possible further options including a repeat examination, basing a candidate's grade on a portion of the examination only and moving to a modular system of examinations. As the discussion paper brings out, none of these offer simple or quick fix solutions. In the case of repeat examinations there are, of course, issues of inter candidate equity arising from the use of different test instruments and the very real fact that the very tight CAO deadlines impose enormous pressure on the timely issue of results from the June examinations.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of comprehensively reviewing our whole approach to special arrangements, the advisory group has invited submissions from interested parties. When these have been carefully considered, I expect to receive a final report from the group in the autumn. It is my intention that any changes in this difficult and complex area will be soundly based and command full public support. The present review which is the first such open public discussion of its kind, is designed to meet these key requirements.</P>

      <P>When I took up office as Minister for Education and Science, my Department provided a psychological service to all second level schools, to all national schools in County Tipperary, South Riding, and to those national schools in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick designated as disadvantaged. The Department of Health and Children has held the lead responsibility for the provision of a psychological assessment service to national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was aware of the need for all school children to have access to educational psychologists, I made a commitment, on taking up office, that my Department would eventually take on the responsibility of providing an educational psychological service that would be available to all schoolchildren. On 11 February last, I announced the decision by the Government to establish a National Educational Psychological Service <Col N="825" /> Agency. The sum of £1.5 million was made available in last December's budget for the initial phase of this measure.</P>
    <P>This agency will be formally established as and from 1 September 1999 and will begin to provide a service on that date. The process of recruiting additional psychologists for the agency has begun. An advertisement for additional staff has been placed and interviews for the new posts will be held shortly. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five-year period, and it is hoped that there will be the nucleus of a psychological service in every county by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The current situation in Meath is that my Department provides a psychological service to all second level schools in the county. The service has been enhanced within the past year by the assignment of a psychologist to a number of primary schools in the southern half of the county. Eventually, as I have stated, all schools in the county will have access to the national educational psychological service.</P>
    <P>The national educational psychological service will be organised in close consultation with the Department of Health and Children, whose clinical services will also continue to provide help for families and children. It is important that the transfer of responsibility for the provision of a psychological service to schools should be carried out in an orderly and phased manner. Regular discussions will take place between the two Departments in order to avoid situations such as that raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that some months ago I announced a major new funding initiative for the education sector. As a core element of this, a total of 225 new second level teachers will be appointed this year. These new teachers will enable the extension of the home-school-community liaison scheme to all second level schools currently designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, of the 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that <Col N="827" /> disadvantage status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.

As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals at present for designating further schools as disadvantaged, I can assure the Deputy that the position of Bridgetown vocational school will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home-school-community liaison schemes.</P>

      <P>The student in question was assessed as an independent mature student and is in receipt of a full maintenance grant from Dublin Corporation since 1996-97, in respect of his studies in the UK.</P>
      <P>Under the existing terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college. If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which she or he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable. As the student in question lives within 15 miles of the college, the grant has been awarded at the adjacent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> I previously indicated my concern about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable in accordance with the provisions of the schemes. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years. The new arrangements will be provided for in the context of the 1999 student support schemes, which will be available shortly. Dublin Corporation will be in contact with the student in question, in due course, regarding the new rates.</P>
