      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission published a report concerning gazumping. I welcome the fact it was asked to conduct this study on behalf of the Government as a result of Deputy Hayes's anti-gazumping legislation. Does the Government intend to introduce the recommended legislation in the consumer protection area regarding advertising of housing and in the area of deposits on housing to give consumers greater protection against gazumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not yet had an opportunity to consider the report but it is its wish to introduce the type of protection suggested. I am sure proposals will be put to Government in due course along the lines suggested by the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly there are new issues in the review of the programme for Government which were not in the original programme. There are new priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative programme is always published at the beginning of each session. In light of the review of the programme for Government, new legislative proposals will be brought forward shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify matters because the Tánaiste seems unsure. Is she saying it is possible or that she is sure there will be a new legislative programme to give effect to the review, or will it be normal practice to update the programme and publish it in January when the next Dáil session resumes? Is it a new programme to take account of legislative commitments in this document or is it simply an updated programme which will come in the normal course of events in January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the items in the review of the programme for Government do not require legislation but specific decisions which can be made without legislation, as I am sure the Deputy is aware. Much of the review will be dealt with in the budget on 1 December and in the national development plan. In so far as new legislation is required, clearly we will review the legislative programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many items in the new cartoon version of the Government's programme about which I would like to ask questions, but one in particular which is topical and urgent is the measures the Government hints at in the review relating to taxis and hackneys. Has it considered allowing hackneys to use bus lanes, which would require changes in the law or regulations? It is all aspiration; there will be more taxis. How does the Government propose to make that happen?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to measures and legislation. Will legislation or new regulations be introduced to fulfil the aspirations of the Government in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will issue new licences for taxis in the Dublin area quickly and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will bring proposals in that regard to Government shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So as to be orderly, can I take it that, from the point of view of the Ceann Comhairle and the Government, any legislative com<Col N="259" /> mitments contained in the review of the programme for Government will be regarded as promised legislation and can be considered as right and proper for questions on the Order of Business? We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where the aspirations of the review are deemed by the Ceann Comhairle not to be a firm commitment whereas the Government may regard them as such. Perhaps the Tánaiste will clarify that matter so that we do not have this difficulty in future. My understanding is that legislative commitments not yet undertaken are deemed to be firm commitments on which we can ask questions as to when they will be delivered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions on promised legislation and its timing are in order, but the nature and detail of legislation are not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the nodding of the Tánaiste does not appear on the record of the House. Will the Tánaiste clearly indicate to the House that any legislative commitment in this document constitutes promised legislation and that its time and delivery is the orderly subject matter for questions on the Order of Business? That is what I am trying to clarify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Once it is promised inside or outside the House, it is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have an explanation to that effect from the Tánaiste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to decide what is in order. The legislative commitments contained in the programme for Government are relevant to the Order of Business. Deputy Stagg asked me to put that on record &ndash; he certainly put a great deal on the record yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands recently announced a radical review of arts legislation. This was a diversionary tactic to mask the tensions which exist between the Arts Council and the Executive. Is it intended to introduce a new arts Act arising from this radical review?</P>
      <P>In the context of the Broadcasting Bill, which is to be presented to the House after the Order of Business, does the Tánaiste consider that the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is in contempt of the Dáil by closing down&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government appointed a group, headed by the current Attorney General, to consider the establishment of an independent financial regulator. The group produced a report which was discussed by a number of committees of this House as recently as last week. The Minister for Finance and I will bring forward a memorandum to Government in the near future which will make a declaration in that regard.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> On the one hand, we have a picture of a booming, flowering economy with all the glow, aspirations, hopes and ambitions of the programme for the new millennium while, on the other hand, we have a situation where a man in his prime hanged himself in Wheatfield Prison a few hours ago. Why has the prison service Bill not been accorded greater priority? It is crucial from the point of view of sorting out the tragic mess which is our prison system. The Govern<Col N="261" /> ment, on taking up office, inherited an expert group report. The heads of the Bill were actually on the Minister's table, ready to be drafted into legislation. Why has there been a delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the delay but even if one were to have an independent prison service, unfortunately, tragedies of this kind would probably still occur. I do not think we can always prevent tragedies such as the one referred to by Deputy Higgins. The expected date for publication of the legislation is the middle of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to a matter I raised earlier. At present responsibility for the allocation of taxi licences is delegated to local authorities. Does the Government intend, if it is to fulfil the promise made only five minutes ago, that more licences will be issued before Christmas? How is it proposed to do that? Does the Government propose to take the power back from local authorities or does it propose to mandate them to agree with the Government's views in this area?</P>

    <P>
      <b>
      </b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am delighted to initiate the debate on the Broadcasting Bill, 1999. If I were to try to sum up in a few words the purposes of this Bill, they would be as follows: to facilitate the establishment of the physical infrastructure for digital broadcasting and the creation of space in the crowded world of broadcasting for new indigenous and innovative services.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, allows us the opportunity to examine and debate how the legislative basis for broadcasting should be structured as we enter the digital broadcasting era. It is the first major broadcasting legislation since the Radio and Television Act, 1988, when the Independent Radio and Television Commission was established and provision was made for the introduction of independent radio and television broadcasting services. The 1980s were a time of considerable change in broadcasting due in the main to the introduction of satellite broadcasting and the phenomenon which came to be known in Europe as deregulation. However, the past ten years has seen the nature and pace of change accelerate beyond all expectations.</P>
    <P>Such change has been driven largely by technological development and the perceived convergence of broadcasting, information and telecommunications technologies. Indeed, the critical problem with legislating in this area today is that the pace of technological change and development is so fast. The foundation stone of Irish broadcasting legislation is almost 40 years old. It is of passing historical interest to note that the Television Commission set up by the then Government in 1958 reported to the Minister on 8 May 1959, just over 40 years ago. That Commission had been charged with recommending on the practicality of establishing a television service on the basis that no charge should fall on the Exchequer and that effective control of televised programmes must be exercisable by an Irish public authority. In the event, the Government decided on a different structure and method of funding that has served the country well in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which established RTE as the national broadcaster and provided for the introduction of television has only been fundamentally revised once, in 1976. The Radio and Television Act, 1988, which I mentioned earlier provided for the introduction of independent broadcasting, added to, rather than fundamentally changed, the existing legislative basis for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, timely that we examine our existing body of broadcasting law and seek to provide a sound legislative basis for broadcasting in the new millennium in this time of fundamental and rapid change. The application of digital techniques is set to revolutionise broadcasting. The <Col N="267" /> promoters of digital broadcasting claim that the new techniques will significantly improve the quality of television reception. However, by far the most significant effects will be the increased broadcasting capacity and the significantly increased flexibility and sophistication in the number and types of services which can be broadcast. A fundamental change also is that there are now competing platforms. People in many areas will be able to choose the platform from which they receive their services. The same broadcasting and broadcasting type services can be provided across a range of technical platforms, including satellite, cable television, MMDS, digital terrestrial television, DTT, and telecommunications infrastructures. An added dimension now is that infrastructures which up to the present have been perceived as being capable of providing broadcasting services only, for example, terrestrial transmission and cable television systems, can be used in the provision of services for the information society age.</P>
    <P>Consequently, today, broadcasting as such cannot be looked on in isolation. In the past it has been easy to distinguish between broadcasting services and other forms of telecommunications. However, as the technologies associated with the delivery of broadcasting services converge with the technologies associated with other forms of telecommunications and information services, the line between the different types of services becomes blurred. There is an argument that in a world where the technologies are converging, all services should be treated and regulated in the same way as commercial telecommunications services. I do not accept this position. Following extensive debate in Europe, the EU has come to the same conclusion for the time being, at least. The balancing act for me in promoting this new legislation is to try to get right the relationship between the social, cultural and democratic dimensions and the technological and economic dimensions. Broadcast radio and television have become the most powerful mass media ever devised. They have profound cultural and social affects at a local, national and international level. They are powerful tools for the dissemination of information and the education of public opinion. Broadcasting, in its totality, therefore, is much more than a commercial activity where the object of the exercise is to simply deliver the biggest audience at the lowest price.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the introduction of digital television creates the opportunity for a significant increase in the number of services that can be offered to viewers. Digital satellite services are already available in some countries. The Irish cable and MMDS industries have announced plans to upgrade to digital transmission. Digital terrestrial television, or DTT, will enable, at this stage of technological development, the provision of up to 30 channels on a country-wide basis. Cable television, MMDS and satellite systems <Col N="268" /> have the capacity to deliver much more. The delivery of these services will primarily be a commercial activity. The level of access by viewers to additional services on cable, MMDS and satellite platforms will in large measure be determined by the attractiveness of the services on offer and especially by the ability of the viewer to pay for such services. It is not for me to say which is the better platform or look into a crystal ball and try to predict which platforms will be the most profitable.</P>
    <P>That said, it is vitally important that we give some basic guarantees to our citizens. In the first place we must ensure, as far as possible, that all have a guarantee of access to broadcasting services that have a distinctly Irish quality, that reflect Irish values and are relevant, regardless of their economic circumstances. Such services must be provided on a universal basis or as near to that concept as is feasible. I see that the best way of providing that guarantee is the maintenance of a strong public service ethos in broadcasting. Most of the new services that will be made possible through the introduction of digital television will be provided on a commercial basis. It will be possible to have a huge amount of services by today's numbers, vying for commercial survival. Quality popular programming is already at a premium and the costs of producing and acquiring such material will continue to rise. Across Europe some of the more prestigious programmes are disappearing from the schedules and are being replaced by programmes of a more simple nature, reflecting the pressures on scarce resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Some programming that was available on free-to-air channels has migrated to pay-per-view and subscription channels. Niche services, subscription services and pay-per-view services are already with us and are set to grow. There is now a stronger argument than ever for broadcasting services operating to a strong public service remit providing programme schedules of quality and diversity and catering for minority as well as mainstream tastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also try to ensure real diversity and choice between broadcasting services. One of the objectives of this Bill is to put in place a regulatory structure that allows private sector broadcasting and public broadcasters to co-exist satisfactorily. Both sectors have much to bring to viewers and each sector can learn and challenge one another. While they have different ultimate objectives, they both have an important place in the range of broadcasting services that can be offered to viewers. This is why the Bill provides that our existing indigenous broadcasters both public and private will have guaranteed access to the new DTT platform. It is essential that these broadcasters have the opportunity to have their existing services available in digital form and to have the opportunity to develop new services. It is necessary also to provide a regulatory structure <Col N="269" /> in which new indigenous services can be encouraged. To provide for this, a structure in which common basic programme and advertising standards can be applied across all broadcasters on all platforms is necessary. DTT, cable systems and MMDS have the potential to provide services at a local and regional level as well as national services. Cable systems in particular have the capacity to provide community channels which will be part of and be produced by the communities which they serve. This Bill is designed to provide a structure for the introduction and regulation of digital television services from a broadcasting perspective and it deals with a number of broad issues. It is intended to facilitate the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland. It enables me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to designate a company which will be licensed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to construct and operate the DTT infrastructure which shall comprise six transmission systems known as multiplexes. RTE will have a minority partner with a shareholding of up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for correcting the record. The entity will be mandated to build and operate the DTT infrastructure and to promote the development of multimedia services and the information society. RTE's existing transmission function will be separated from RTE as a going concern and RTE's equity contribution to the new entity will be met to the extent required by the value of these assets. Certain obligations will be laid on the designated company through the Bill and through the licences which the director will issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Universal service is a key requirement in the rollout of the digital terrestrial infrastructure. Apart from access to broadcasting services, access to the Internet and other interactive services are important policy objectives. In this regard DTT has the potential to be an important delivery medium for these services, especially in rural areas. The Bill provides for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to be given expanded powers and functions in relation to the regulation of digital broadcasting on all platforms. To reflect this body's increased powers, its name will be changed to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will have the critical function, in addition to the current functions of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, of making arrangements for the provision of broadcasting services in addition to those provided by our existing broadcasters. In carrying out this function, the commission will be required to endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services available in the State best serve the needs of the people of the State, bearing in mind their traditions and cul<Col N="270" /> ture. It is envisaged that the commission will regulate the broadcasting sector with a light touch. However, specifically the commission will draw up codes and rules relating to taste and decency of broadcast programme material, broadcast advertising and a range of other broadcasting related matters and enter into contracts with providers of broadcast content.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not solely concerned with the introduction of digital terrestrial television services and their regulation. Another vital provision is the restatement of the public service broadcasting remit under which RTE operates. The Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty of the EU recognised that the system of public broadcasting in the member states is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society and to the need to preserve media pluralism. The public service remit is currently defined only in a general way in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976. In the light of the significant changes in broadcasting in Ireland and across Europe, the significant increase in broadcasting capacity which will be brought about by the introduction of digital terrestrial television and the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the System of Public Broadcasting in the EU member states, it is appropriate and necessary now to provide greater clarity as to what is expected in fulfillment of the public service broadcasting remit which applies to RTE and to similarly define a public service remit appropriate to the ethos and mandate of Telifís na Gaeilge. The proposal will provide for additional clarity and detail in statute law in respect of the uses to which licence fee revenues and other Exchequer moneys paid to these broadcasters may be put.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the repeal and restatement of the provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and the Radio and Television Act, 1988, in relation to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and extends the powers of investigation of the commission to cover all providers of broadcast content. The Bill also provides that the Minister may establish Teilifís na Gaeilge as a statutory corporate body, the members of which shall be appointed by the Government, that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall draw up a scheme for the disbursement by it of a fund of £500,000 provided from the Exchequer in respect of capital expenditure on transmission infrastructure incurred by local and community radio stations; for the repeal of section 14(4)(b) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, which enables the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose a levy on the income of independent broadcasters; and for the amendment of section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993 to provide that in the financial year 1999 RTE shall make the sum of £16 million available for independent television productions and that in subsequent years this amount shall be adjusted in line with changes in the consumer price index. I intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee <Col N="271" /> Stage which will link the annual increase in the amount to be made available to the increase in the RTE spend on television programme production.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement provisions. Section 2 contains definitions. Section 3 provides for repeal of existing legislative provisions set out in the First Schedule. Section 4 provides for the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 deal with the mechanics of establishing the separate digital transmission entity. Section 5 provides that I, as Minister, may, subject to certain conditions, designate a company formed under the Companies Acts which has as its principal objects the transmission by analogue and digital terrestrial means of television services and sound broadcasting services provided by broadcasters. The designated company will also have the objects of the promotion of the development of multimedia services and electronic information services. Subject to my approval and the approval of the Minister for Finance, RTE shall transfer its existing transmission infrastructure to this company in exchange for a shareholding in the company. Section 6 provides that I, as Minister, shall have the power to transfer to the company the benefits of certain broadcasting and related licences that have been granted to RTE.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, on a date specified by the Minister, shall issue a DTT licence to the company that I have designated under section 5. The licence shall authorise the designated company to operate six digital terrestrial multiplexes. One of these multiplexes will be reserved for use by RTE and one half of one multiplex each will be reserved for Teilifís na Gaeilge and the television programme service contractor, that is, TV3. I shall have the power to direct that a multiplex or part thereof be reserved for terrestrial broadcasting services provided in Northern Ireland. The intention is that this power will be used if the British authorities introduce reciprocal arrangements for the carriage in the North of broadcasters established on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the change of the name of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and section 9 provides that the commission can enter into arrangements for the provision of additional broadcasting services. In performing this function, the commission shall endeavour to ensure that broadcasting services made available under the Bill best serve the needs of the people of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into digital content contracts with broadcasters for the provision of programme material to be transmitted by digital <Col N="272" /> terrestrial means by the company designated under section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the designated company shall enter into arrangements to transmit the analogue or digital free-to-air television services of RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and the television programme service contractor &ndash; TV3 &ndash; and to transmit the sound radio services of RTE and of the independent radio stations, some of which are currently transmitted by RTE on a contractual basis. The designated company may also enter into arrangements to transmit other broadcasting services by digital terrestrial means.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 deal with electronic programme guides, EPGs, which are defined as a means of providing information in relation to the schedule of programme material on a broadcast service. It is expected that EPGs will be essential to allow viewers navigate through the array of services that will be  available by way of digital transmission. Consequently there is a provision requiring ease of access to information regarding the broadcasting services provided by RTE, TG4, the television programme service contractor, TV3, and certain of the services provided in Northern Ireland. The commission may also enter into a contract for the provision of an EPG covering the DTT, cable and MMDS platforms and may direct that this EPG be carried on these platforms. Accordingly, if the commission is not satisfied that viewers are being provided with easily accessible information on indigenous broadcasters, it can bring this provision into effect.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the application, subject to necessary modifications, of certain fundamental existing legislative provisions contained in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, to new broadcasting services provided pursuant to contracts entered into under this Act. These provide for objectivity and impartiality in the broadcast of news and current affairs programmes and prohibit the broadcasting of  material likely to promote crime or tending to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the preparation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of codes and rules to be complied with by broadcasters with respect to programme material. The commission shall, following consultation with RTE, prepare codes in relation to standards of taste and decency in programme material and broadcast advertising and other forms of commercial promotion. The commission will also make rules with respect to maximum daily and hourly times devoted to advertising and teleshopping on broadcast services provided under a contract with it. The commission will also be required to make rules in order to promote the enjoyment of broadcast services by people who are deaf or hard of hearing and people who are blind or partially sighted.</P>
    <P>In relation to the codes of standards for broadcast advertising I intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage designed to relax the existing blanket prohibition on the <Col N="273" /> broadcasting of advertisements directed towards a religious end contained in section 20(4) of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, and section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the co-operation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in the preparation of non-technical codes or standards with respect to the transmission of information by electronic means, including the Internet. Section 17 provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall enforce the provisions of the Bill when enacted and the codes and rules and contracts made thereunder.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 23 provide for matters relating to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Section 18 provides for the appointment, remuneration, resignation and removal of the chairman and members of the commission and provides for gender balance among the members. Section 19 provides for the supply by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of staff, services, accommodation and facilities for the performance of its functions and for the payment of the expenses of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Exceptional expenses of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission may be reimbursed by the Minister to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland from television licence fee revenue. Section 20 provides for the grounds for complaint to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which comprise the existing grounds with the addition of complaints of breaches of the code regarding taste and decency of programme material. The section also provides for the procedures for making complaints and the procedures to be followed by the commission in investigating a complaint.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 to 23 provide for annual reports by the commission, for recording of programme material by holders of content provider contracts and for the completion by the commission of existing investigations.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides additional clarity and detail in respect of the public service character of the national television and sound broadcasting service provided by RTE. The basic requirement is that the service provided by RTE should comprise a comprehensive range of programmes in Irish and English, shall be free-to-air and shall be universally available in so far as it is reasonably practicable. Television licence fee revenue shall be, and commercial revenues may be, used by RTE for the purpose of fulfilling its public service remit.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that in addition to its national service RTE may provide local, community or regional services. Section 26 provides that in addition to its public service broadcasting remit, RTE shall have the power to offer special interest subscription or pay-per-view programme services &ndash; secondary broadcasting services &ndash; and to transmit programmes by electronic means other than broadcasting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> Section 27 provides for the continuation of the current regime in relation to the approval by the Minister of advertising time on RTE broadcasting services, which are not subject to a contract with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, and specifically includes teleshopping within this regime. Section 28 provides for an amendment to section 6 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, under which RTE is required to record every broadcast and to make such a recording available to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission in the event of a complaint. The amendment will require RTE to record visual as well as audio material.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for an amendment to section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, which deals with the annual amounts RTE must make available for independent television productions. Paragraph (b) of the section provides that the amount to be made available in the financial year 1999 shall be £16 million. The other provisions of the section currently provide that, in subsequent years, this amount shall be adjusted in line with changes in the consumer price index. As I indicated earlier, it is my intention to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage that will link the annual increase in this amount to the increase in RTE spend on programme production.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland may authorise the television programme service contractor, that is, TV3, to provide additional broadcasting services by means of a variation made by it to the contract which has been entered into under the Radio and Television Act, 1988, in respect of its existing service. Section 31 provides for the entry by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland into satellite content contracts with persons for the supply of programme material to be transmitted as a broadcasting service by means of a satellite device. The commission may charge fees for such contracts.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for measures in respect of the transmission and retransmission of programme material by means of cable and MMDS systems. Subsection (4) provides for the notification of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in respect of the retransmission of broadcasting services. Subsections (5) to (11) provide for &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status for the television services of RTE, TG4 and the television programme service contractor, TV3, national VHF sound radio services and community channels on cable television systems. TV3's &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on MMDS systems is maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 33 enables the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into local content contracts with persons for the supply of programme material for local interest channels to be transmitted on cable and MMDS systems. Section 34 enables the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into community content contracts with members of local communities for the supply of programme material for community channels to be transmitted on cable and MMDS systems. <Col N="275" /> Section 35 enables the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into cable-MMDS content contracts with persons for the supply of programme material for commercial channels to be transmitted on cable and MMDS systems.</P>
    <P>Sections 36, 37 and 38 provide for the establishment of TG4 as a statutory corporate body on a day which the Minister may appoint. It is the intention that these provisions will be brought into effect at the optimum time. Section 39 provides that the function of TG4 shall be to provide a national television broadcasting service catering for the expectations of those whose preferred spoken language is Irish or who otherwise have an interest in Irish. The service shall have a public service character similar to that to be provided for in the case of RTE in section 24 of the Bill with, of course, special emphasis on the Irish language service.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that the general duty of TG4 shall be similar to that of RTE by virtue of section 17 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by section 13 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976. Section 41 provides a statutory basis for the supply by RTE free of charge to TG4 of one hour per day of Irish language programming. Section 42 provides that the approval of the Minister will be required for the total time per year of broadcasting by TG4. This provides for the continuation of the current regime. Section 43 provides that the approval of the Minister will be required for the daily and hourly times devoted to the broadcast of advertising and teleshopping by TG4. This also provides for the continuation of the current regime.</P>
    <P>Section 44 provides for the application, subject to necessary modifications, of certain fundamental existing legislation provisions contained in the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1993, to TG4 as they apply to RTE under the existing law. By virtue of the application of section 21 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, TG4 shall have the power to appoint advisory committees or advisers. Section 45 provides for the payment by the Minister of Exchequer funding to TG4.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 and 47 provide for transitional provisions in relation to TG4, including the transfer to TG4 of land, property and other rights and liabilities of Seirbhísí Theilifís na Gaeilge Teoranta. This company is the wholly owned subsidiary company of RTE, which currently provides the TG4 service. Section 48 provides for the separation of accounts and moneys in respect of secondary broadcasting services provided by RTE and TG4 in addition to their national public service broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides for general matters relating to content provider contracts entered into by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland under the Bill and section 50 provides for the charging by the commission of fees for applications for contracts. Section 51 provides for offences in relation to the supply of programme material for the pur<Col N="276" /> pose of its being transmitted as a broadcasting service otherwise than in accordance with a content provider contract, offences in relation to the &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; requirements on cable and MMDS systems and offences in relation to the requirements to notify the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of services transmitted or retransmitted on cable and MMDS systems.</P>
    <P>Section 52 provides for the payment by the Minister of Exchequer moneys to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in respect of its expenses. This arises from the repeal provided for in section 3 of the Bill of the power of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose financial levies on independent broadcasters under section 14(4)(b) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988. Section 53 provides for the operation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of a scheme of capital grants to local and community radio stations in respect of their transmission costs to be funded from Exchequer moneys up to a maximum total of £500,000 to be provided to the commission by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 54 provides for an increase from 14 to 30 in the number of days in a period of 12 months for which the commission can licence a temporary sound broadcasting service. Section 55 provides for amendment in respect of the grounds on which the commission can authorise a derogation by a broadcaster from the minimum requirement of 20 per cent of broadcasting time to be devoted to news and current affairs programmes. Section 56 extends the application of an order made by the Minister under section 31(1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, to all new broadcasting services provided under the provisions of the Bill. There is no such order in force at present.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule contains the list of enactments to be repealed by section 3 of the Bill. Sections 18A, 18B and 18C of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, provide for the establishment, functions and duties of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Essentially, the powers of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are being restated for clarity in the new legislation. Section 19 of the Act provides for the hours of broadcasting on RTE radio and television services to be subject to the approval of the Minister. Section 11(3) and (4) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, provide for the extension of the powers of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to the independent radio and television sector.</P>
    <P>Section 14(4)(b) of the Act provides for the payment by independent broadcasters of financial levies to the Independent Radio and Television Commission. This requirement is being dropped. Section 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, provides for the drawing up by the Minister of a code dealing with advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcast services which shall be complied with by RTE and independent broadcasters. This will now be a function of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, provides that the <Col N="277" /> maximum daily and hourly advertising times on RTE broadcasting services shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule provides for standard provisions in relation to the establishment of TG4 as a separate statutory body, including the appointment, remuneration, resignation and removal of the chairman and members of the body and the requirement for gender balance among the members. Provision is made for the employment and devising of a superannuation scheme for staff including a chief executive. Provision is also made for TG4 to present annual reports and accounts.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that the Bill is a major legislative initiative. The introduction of DTT will ensure that digital television services are rolled out to as much of the population of the country as is feasible. It will guarantee that at least our existing indigenous television services will be available in digital form, free at the point of reception on a universal basis or as near to that concept as is feasible.</P>
    <P>In addition, DTT has the capacity to provide information services via television sets to viewers. The company to be designated under the Bill will be required to have, as part of its objectives, the promotion of multimedia services and the development of electronic information services, including those provided by means of the Internet. In this way the Bill will ensure that the maximum opportunity to partake in the information society is provided to as many people as possible. I look forward to hearing Members' contributions during this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably. I welcome publication of the Bill and am glad it has eventually reached Dáil Éireann. The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, sets out to construct a legal edifice to cope with and cater for the digital revolution. It is to be the only Bill to be drafted for some considerable time and is, therefore, expected to cater for legislative needs in this area for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a disappointment. It is weak, lacks imagination, is contradictory in a number of areas and appears to have been cobbled together from a number of different sources.  It is, therefore, incapable of dealing with the complex broadcast<Col N="278" /> ing agenda which has to be addressed and it also fails to deliver on dealing with changes that are driven by rapid technological development and the convergence of these technologies.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not attempt to deal with the rapid convergence, already evident in many homes, of telephony, computing, television, other video and audio services and screen delivered consumer services such as shopping, banking etc.  It does not set out clearly enough the part to be played by the national broadcaster nor does it present for it a secure and well funded independent future.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting, along with general telecommunications, is a business in which only one thing is certain &ndash; uncertainty.  All the media gurus and technological soothsayers can read the signs, peer into the tea leaves, toss the sticks or whatever, but no one can tell us what the market has in store for us beyond the current technological horizon of about 36 months.</P>
    <P>The engineers who work in the field of telecommunications and broadcasting have given up trying to predict where it is going and instead have come up with a technology one might call &ldquo;perfectly neutral&rdquo;, that is, raw digital capacity. We can do whatever we want with it, telecommunication capacity has become a commodity. The Bill does not grasp this fundamental fact. Telecommunication engineering is now concerned with conveying bits from one place to another, regardless of what they represent, be they calls to home, stock prices, baby's photographs, train schedules, &ldquo;Shakespeare in Love&rdquo;&ndash;  all converted to bits, all down the same wire, all down the same optical fibre and all coming from the same transmitter.</P>
    <P>The technology is impartial. Broadband, the Internet and the digital video broadcasting standard are all neutral technologies, but this Bill is not in tune with the convergence that is happening around us. The framers of it fail to recognise that the cable TV companies have become telephone companies, the telephone companies have become cable TV companies and broadcasters, the Internet service providers are now broadcasters and telephone companies and the broadcasters have become Internet service providers. If all these operators are not under the uniform regulatory regime, the alternative is a litigation nightmare.</P>
    <P>We are, however, faced with the fact that this Broadcasting Bill is before us and must, therefore, be dealt with.  I expect the Bill will involve considerable discussion on this Stage and further discussion and amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of areas with which the Bill deals. What are the implications for the national broadcaster? What are the consequences for RTE in the context of its public service broadcasting remit and the future financing structure to deliver on that public service remit? Does RTE assume additional obligations under this Bill? Yes, it does. Is RTE given any additional funding to discharge these additional obligations? No, it is not. Does the Bill present <Col N="279" /> any threats to RTE's existing income streams?  Yes, it does, in providing for a massive increase in indigenous commercial competition. Will the Bill have any inflationary impact upon RTE's core costs? Yes, it will, as RTE will face increasing competition for spots and other rights in the global and domestic marketplace and it will increase its television output by up to 150 per cent. Does the Bill provide for greater resources to be dedicated to independent production? It provides for a maximum transfer, which should be a minimum. If RTE's losses in television production run to £6 million or £7 million on an annual basis with two television stations, this must surely be compounded when having to deal with five stations.</P>
    <P>What index mechanism does the Minister propose to introduce on Committee Stage and how will it be determined in making the annual allocations to the independent sector? The Minister's inept handling of section 481 has resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in the production of feature films. This means the home grown diet of television programmes for Irish people will be swallowed up in the globalisation already reflected in the TV diet generally with programmes from Britain and the USA. So RTE will be enabled with its money from the sale of cable to involve itself in the setting up of the digital system, but it most certainly will not be able to run it without a clear, financial structure in place. Under the Bill, as presented, I predict that within three years RTE will be bankrupt unless some financial structure is put in place for its future.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires RTE to implement a public service broadcasting remit that is defined in a general way in the Bill. This public service remit is based on the fact that RTE receives State aid in the form of a licence fee and from income derived from commercial advertising. The remit definition in the Bill appears to be drafted as a protective mechanism for RTE, which is seen as some sort of a conglomerate monopoly in a localised indigenous market. This can make for poor competition and inactive indigenous programme-making, leading to unimaginative presentation with a subsequent loss of viewers.</P>
    <P>I would like to be proud of RTE. I would like it within its remit to show clearly, and be required to do so, how its licence fee moneys are spent on its public service broadcasting remit.  I want it to be one of Ireland's most creative and imaginative broadcasters. I want it to offer the best value for money and to encourage Ireland's most innovative talents. It should be without question accountable and transparent to the public. This does not show up in the presentation of RTE's accounts annually and causes confusion as a consequence. The public service remit applicable to RTE in this Bill should be much clearer, more specific and more defined. The national broadcaster should be able to set out in advance its statement of intent in terms of category and extent of programmes to be carried. This state<Col N="280" /> ment should be measurable and enforceable, in return for which the national broadcaster receives due protection.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a formula of independence for TnaG or TG4 as it is now known. The public service broadcasting remit is different here &ndash; TG4 is not charged with a requirement to provide a comprehensive range of programmes in Irish and English, merely to provide news and current affairs programmes primarily in the Irish language. Why is this? Surely TG4 should be seen as the television broadcaster for the Irish language which was why it was set up. Does this mean it is to be turned into Channel 4 or some similar structure? Surely it means that TG4, for all the Government's pious intentions, is to be placed firmly in a desert of economic starvation &ndash; alive but being slowly strangled, visible but unable to deliver as it should. Given its remit and lack of financial structure, it is heading down the road to oblivion. Why does this Bill not set out a clear structure of independent funding for RTE and TG4? Given the nature of TG4 and TV3 will the Bill be amended to give &lsquo;must carry status', legally enforced to all Irish TV broadcasters, with primacy of position on all delivery systems &ndash; cable, MMDS, and aerial? This is a fundamental question for the future of all broadcasters in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The financial mechanics surrounding the designated digital carrier Digico, and RTE's involvement in it, require clarification. If the proposal is to privatise the existing transmission systems as the price of obtaining a digital transmission system, it might be best to say so and debate the proposal. How is the digital carrier to generate revenue? It will have powers to charge broadcasters for transmissions which seems anomalous given that cable and relay companies are obliged to carry the signals of our existing broadcasters for free. This does not seem like fair practice and may well be in contravention of EU competition law. Have plans for Digico factored in the cost of massive consumer equipment subvention, which may be as much as £350 per household? If Digico is to succeed it needs to capture as much of the market of 1.1 million homes as it can. Will it have the £300 million or so necessary for this level of subvention? If its partners, yet to be known, make available the finances to build and maintain the transmission system, what are the implications in terms of levies for broadcasters and RTE's participation?</P>
    <P>The very establishment of Digico in this fashion and its granting of all the licences for digital terrestrial television infrastructure is a curious move because there is no distinction between digital terrestrial television and digital cable television except that one uses cable and the other one does not. They both deliver television, internet connections and data broadcasting. They both have set top boxes, tiers of services at different prices, pay per view and a monthly bill. They are and will be healthy businesses in a highly competitive climate. The Minister needs to explain <Col N="281" /> the procedure adopted here and why it is necessary to interfere in this business in this fashion.</P>
    <P>The financial projections in the NERA Smith report presupposed that DTT would be an alternative to cable and MMDS. The decision to broadcast free to air has torn these projections to shreds. Should consideration have been given to a series of licence rounds for DTTV operators as there was for cable and MMDS? If this is in any way capable of being construed as being in contravention of European law then the barristers representing cable and telecommunications companies will have a field day. Perhaps Monsieur Charvet should consider setting up a new outlet outside the Four Courts as this will certainly keep people in shirts for a long time.</P>
    <P>Transmission infrastructure, as any broadcast engineer would be pleased to tell the Minister, is a relatively small part of the cost of television. So, while the marginal cost for a particular operator to deliver a third or fourth multiplex may be small, it is not clear that there would be significant cost impact to have multiple operators &ndash; even in the same region. The real reason for bundling all six multiplexes and deploying them on a nationwide basis is that the new company would have enough combined capacity to compete head-to-head with MMDS in non-cabled areas. With 30 channels, about half the capacity of digital MMDS, DTT would be in the ball park of looking like an MMDS operator, except already neatly consolidated on a nationwide basis. Should it be the Government's responsibility to do this, where the cable companies started out quite naturally as regional operators and are laying down hard cash to bring about consolidation? I can hear the laptops of the barristers humming and what they are typing is as follows:</P>
    <P>Whereas in Commission Directive 90/388/EEC, on Competition in the Markets for Telecommunication Services, recitation 6 makes specific reference to information services providing access to databases, message storing and forwarding services, electronic mail and transaction services; financial transactions, electronic commercial data transfer, teleshopping, and telereservations; and whereas under recitation 17 of the same directive it is stated that &ldquo;The exclusive rights to telecommunication services granted to public undertakings or undertakings to which member states have granted special or exclusive rights for the provision of the network are incompatible with Article 86(l) in conjunction with Article 82 (ex Articles 90(1)/86)&rdquo;; and whereas Article 2 of the same directive stipulates that &ldquo;member states shall withdraw all special and exclusive rights for the supply of telecommunication services and shall take the necessary measures to ensure that any operator is entitled to supply such telecommunication services&rdquo;; and whereas Commission Directive 94/46/EC, which refers specifically to satellite television, makes it clear in recitation 17 that &ldquo;the provision of network <Col N="282" /> services for the conveyance of radio and television programmes is a telecommunications service..&rdquo;; and whereas section 7 of the Broadcasting Act, 1999, grants the licences for six digital terrestrial television multiplexes, including the communication facilities to deliver them to a particular undertaking, without an open and objective licensing process, therefore section 7 of the Act is not in conformance with Commission Directive 90/388/EEC, otherwise known as the &lsquo;Services Directive' which is the cornerstone of telecommunications liberalisation in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The barristers can rest after that.</P>
    <P>In telecommunications licence rounds involving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is interesting that the frequencies are not simply auctioned off to the highest bidder with the money going into the general fund. Such a practice is not actually incompatible with the EU treaty or directives, but it is frowned upon because it is rightly thought that the cost of the licence, inflated by bidding up, would be passed on to the consumer. So the decision as to who gets a particular licence is normally based on proposals and evaluations of the bidder's capabilities, in what is known rather comically as a &ldquo;beauty contest&rdquo;, rather than on who is willing to pay the most and the licence fee, which could still be a considerable sum, is geared to cover the administrative costs. On the other hand, a public holding like the transmission department of RTE, if it is to be sold on the market, has to be sold to the highest bidder. There is a contradiction. The Broadcasting Bill grants the frequency licences to the new transmission company, the licences become part of the market value of the new company, then the new transmission company is sold to the highest bidder. The result is a frequency auction with the inflated value of the licences passed on to the consumer &ndash;  which was to be avoided.</P>
    <P>There is another problem with granting the remaining four licences to the new television transmission company, without an open licence round. These licences already have a certain monetary value. A communications company in possession of such frequency licences is worth more on the market than one without licences. However, the value of the licences derives from State resources in any form whatsoever. The airwaves belong to the State and according to the Constitution the air belongs to the State. Handing over licences to a company without an open and objective process is a State aid, but such aids are not prohibited. Derogations do apply and I would like to know if the Government wishes to apply for a derogation and, if so, on what grounds? Perhaps the Minister will respond to that point in her reply to the debate. The Broadcasting Bill, in its preamble, states:</P>
    <P>.separate provision in relation to the following discrete aspects of broadcasting, namely, the supply of programme material for the purpose of its being transmitted and the <Col N="283" /> transmission of such material that is so supplied.</P>
    <P>In the modern lexicon, this means content providers and transmission providers and the idea is to keep them separate for competition reasons. It is a fairly straightforward concept. An Post is a good example of a transmission provider who is not a content provider. An Post, for instance, does not write letters, it delivers them. The company does not decide who sends the letters and it does not have anything to do with what is inside the envelopes; that is strictly for the content providers. There is no sense in complaining to the postman about the quality of the correspondence.</P>
    <P>The framers of the Broadcasting Bill, however, do not seem to comprehend that this new division of labour also applies to broadcasting. I have examined the Bill in some detail and the best I can figure out is that the transmission provider is the one who decides which broadcaster's programmes will be delivered.</P>
    <P>TV3, whose signal is currently distributed by RTE and would be distributed by the new transmission provider, has expressed some doubts about the arrangements. TV3's misgivings have concerned the involvement of its primary competitor in the delivery of its product. Perhaps TV3 should be more concerned about this new entity instead of RTE, as a potential competitor. The Broadcasting Bill leaves the transmission provider with a lot of room to manoeuvre. It should be borne in mind that the primary responsibility of its board of directors will be to make the most money for its shareholders if that is possible &ndash; an elementary fact of business life &ndash; and, in the absence of rules to limit its remit, that is exactly what it will do.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed as presented, the transmission company will have a great deal of control over the content. There is no provision in the Bill to prevent it from arranging with, for instance, a UK broadcaster for a special compilation of programmes aimed at the Irish market, with schedules specifically planned to compete in this market, or even with advertising specifically targeted at Irish viewers. According to the Bill, the company is equipped with at least 20 non-Irish channels for nation-wide distribution. We can expect some of these channels to be dedicated to films in the higher priced tiers of service offering. What is to prevent the transmission company from purchasing the Irish distribution rights for these films and becoming its own film content provider?</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill, as far as I am aware, to limit the amount of band-width Digico assigns to home shopping or interactive games if they originate in another EU member state, and deriving the premium distribution fees which could be expected. I have looked for the promised &ldquo;separate provision of content and infrastructure&rdquo; but have not found it. Perhaps the Minister can refer to that in her reply.</P>
    <P>The new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is charged with the task of making arrangements <Col N="284" /> for the provision of broadcasting services in the State, additional to the existing services. It will not, however, have any say in the matter of what goes out over the four remaining multiplexes unless they originate in Ireland, which is highly unlikely considering the provisions of the Bill. The digital content contracts do not apply to channels which originate in other member states of the EU, and even where these do apply, the Broadcasting Commission may only exercise a veto. The licences are not to be issued on a must carry basis. There is nothing in the Bill to provide for this, and the transmission company does not have to co-operate with the commission.</P>
    <P>The only way the Broadcasting Commission will be involved with the content of the four remaining multiplexes is as a delivery boy for the edicts of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, when and if she dictates which UK multiplexes should be delivered to Irish viewers. In every other EU member state which has introduced digital television an open licence round has been held to decide which broadcasters should have their programmes delivered over the system. This Bill, however, has no provision for an open licence round.</P>
    <P>Given that the Broadcasting Commission will have no say in the matter of the four remaining multiplexes, the Minister's proposed powers are questionable. Given, also, that the ODTR has been relegated to strictly technical matters, it appears the decision will have to be made here in this forum or handed over to the, as yet unknown, majority owners of the transmission company.</P>
    <P>There are six multiplexes to be assigned in the initial roll-out of DTT. Is that number an arbitrary one? Supposing it were seven, would Digico then acquire all seven multiplexes? If only one of the six multiplexes is set aside for local and regional television, there could be a television station in every city and major town. As it stands, if one wants to tune into a city-based television station, one must live in Derry because it is the only one in the country. Such multiplexes are commonplace in the United States where many cities, such as Boston, have smaller units with three or four TV channels in its own right. This is where the future lies, not just in local or regional content.</P>
    <P>Local and regional television was referred to in discussion document ODTR 99/57, issued on 7 October 1999. On page 9 of that document, the regulator states that &ldquo;she intends that the multiplex licence would provide the framework for any future licensing of regional or local multiplexes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If local and regional can be provided for in the future, is there some reason they cannot be provided for now? Would that make the new transmission company less capable of taking business away from the cable companies? Would RTE, perhaps, find the competition from regional TV a bit tough?</P>
    <P>Can we assume from the absence of a reference to regional or local multiplexes in the Bill, that <Col N="285" /> the Government has no plans to offer local, on air, independent television licences in the foreseeable future? I hope the answer is not confined entirely to the fact that it has made provision for local television on cable and MMDS systems. I would like to address the definition of community content on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of these multiplexes should be set aside for educational purposes. If education is the mother of the Celtic tiger, perhaps we should perceive education as a first priority. It would be much better than transmitting re-runs of &ldquo;Baywatch&rdquo;. A great number of people would avail of such a facility to learn modern languages, including, French, Spanish, German and Portuguese. Although televised courses are not as good as being there in person, they are better than not having any lectures at all, and the interactive features of digital television can help to bring people together. In addition, the encryption feature can be used to preserve privacy.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, <i>The Times</i> of London reported that the British Minister for Education has announced that interactive television will be introduced over the next three years to aid GCSE pupils across the UK. In that way, students will be able to use television and the Internet to pursue their studies. If one takes that idea a bit further, the same multiplex system could be applied to the industrial sector, thus obviating the need for students who work part-time, to travel long distances to attend lectures. This kind of facility is common in the USA, in particular around high-tech areas such as Boston and Silicon Valley where dedicated microwave links are used, operating on frequency bands set aside for this purpose. The courses are taught in the daytime and students attend at the workplace. Anyone who has taught an evening class will know that it is inferior to daytime teaching and it disrupts family households as a consequence. This is an opportunity to expand our educational capacity into the home.</P>
    <P>Why is it not possible to receive BBC Radio 4 here? It used to be available a number of years ago? It is one of the best public service radio stations in the world and, while it used to be available in this part of the country, it can no longer be picked up. It was very handy when driving home from meetings to listen to some decent chat instead of being blasted out of it by some wall-to-wall version of pop music. The Minister should investigate that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the question of deflectors. It is much easier to deflect digital waves than analogue ones. If analogue is to be licensed for a period under the proposed round, why can digital deflectors not also be licensed? There is no method of getting back into the MMDS system from a local area. One has to go back to the city to have it retransmitted. It would be better to have it transmitted by air to include everybody.</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Commission is charged with the task of making arrangements in accordance with the provisions of the Bill for the provision of broadcasting services. What say, if any, will the commission have in respect of the four remaining licences, unless they originate in Ireland? Do digital contracts apply to channels which originate in other member states and, if so, what will be the extent of the commission's influence? Why has consideration not been given to an open licence round to decide which broadcasters should have their programmes delivered over the system? How is uniformity of regulation to be operated and monitored? Is it feasible to have three regulatory authorities attempting to operate across a broad spectrum with no uniformity leading to litigation in many areas? An example is the Paddy Duffy incident before the last election. What are the capacities of a half multiplex and will TG4 and TV3 have capacity for all services such as data transmission, etc. if required? Why have Internet services been excluded from the broadcasting definition, section 2(1), when the remit of Digico includes the promotion of multimedia services and the development of electronic information services, including those provided by means of the Internet in section 5(4)(d) and (e)?</P>
      <P>What capacity exists for the provision of city based television stations or regional television stations as apply in the US or Derry? Is it not a fact that if one multiplex was set aside, there could be a television station in every city and major town in Ireland? How is it proposed that RTE will be accountable for its licence fee and what conditions of transparency are to be applied in its being presented to the Minister? Will the Minister clarify the position regarding costs of set top boxes and will she legislate for must carry status in primary position for all Irish based broadcasters on all systems so that when a person turns on his or her television, channel one is RTE One, channel two is Network 2, channel three is TG4 and channel four is TV3? How will this legislation prevent the coming into existence of a two tier society in this information age and will she clarify her guarantees that this will not happen?</P>
      <P>RTE in its document, The Future Delivery of Television Services in Ireland, which was presented to the Oireachtas committee and on which Deputy Higgins did a fine rapporteur's report, indicated in its conclusion:</P>
      <P>As the UK is introducing DTT and this will overspill into Ireland, we in Ireland need to introduce DTT almost simultaneously with the UK or be faced with a de facto DTT regime imposed from outside the State. This will lead to gradual loss of national control in spectrum management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the Government's assessment of how much we have been damaged in this respect to date as a consequence of not having <Col N="287" /> introduced DTT here yet and how is it proposed to combat and deal with BSkyB which will move into Ireland shortly in this regard? What guarantees are provided by the Bill that independent film producers will be able to play their full part? This area has enormous potential and the youngest, brightest, most innovative and imaginative want to get involved in it. If there is no clear financial structure for RTE and TG4 to buy productions from the independent sector, this wealth of ability and talent will travel elsewhere. In respect of local radio, what conditions will be laid down by the Broadcasting Commission in respect of the dispensing of the £500,000 for transmission costs? How will that be determined?</P>
    <P>The Bill stops at the door of the broadcasting department and does not cross the hall to the telecommunications department. It does not deal with convergence and I regard it as weak, unimaginative and incomplete. It requires substantial amendment on Committee Stage and there is a need for answers to a range of questions. It is the first Bill in this area for many years and it must deal with the long-term future, but it is not sufficiently open ended to cater for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Digital broadcasting is a technological advancement and as such should be welcomed. The Government decision is that digital broadcasting will be by way of aerial, that is, there will be digital terrestrial television. I understand the net effect of digital terrestrial broadcasting will be better quality picture and sound. I further understand that television reception will be clear irrespective of distance from the transmitter. It appears that up to 30 channels will be provided and that they will be grouped into what are known as multiplexes. The Bill provides for six multiplexes. One of these will be for the use of RTE and there will be half a multiplex each for TG4 and TV3. The Minister may also reserve a multiplex or part of a multiplex for terrestrial broadcasting services provided in Northern Ireland. This would leave at least three multiplexes and 15 plus channels available for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into digital content contracts with broadcasters for the provision of programme material to be transmitted by digital terrestrial means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When approaching proposed legislation which would regulate a service being availed of by virtually all, if not all, the people living in the State, the fundamental objective should be the provision of the best quality service at the best possible price. The best possible price in this context means that the price is within the comfortable reach of everybody while the best possible quality service embraces the fundamental requirement that programme quality must be maintained and improved against the background of increasing the quantity of programmes. It is essential that the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland does not result in the opening up of a division in society between the information rich <Col N="288" /> and the information poor. Such a division would further deepen the exclusion of many citizens from the means of escaping the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The free market will inevitably cause the most popular television programmes to become more and more the exclusive preserve of subscription and pay per view television. The Labour Party sees this as the first and foremost issue which must be addressed. It is not an overstatement that the introduction of digital terrestrial television is a defining moment not only in regard to television but also in the context of the information age. Equality of access within the digital revolution must be viewed in regard to the convergence of technologies with all the attendant opportunities and difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Bill should not be rushed, despite the efforts of the Minister to jockey it through on the basis that it must be passed into law by the end of this year so that £16 million can be paid to independent television producers. My legal advice is that this is not the case. RTE has all the powers needed under the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, to make the payment in 1999. It is ironic that in the information age, a community wide debate is not taking place regarding the Broadcasting Bill. It should be further noted that the Bill has not emanated from a notable consumer demand for the introduction of digital terrestrial television. The Government is undoubtedly aware of the low take up of digital terrestrial television in other countries. Will the Minister in replying inform the House whether she expects the take up in digital terrestrial television will be any different in Ireland. Bearing in mind that our population is relatively small, do the economics of the proposal work out? To receive a digital signal with existing television sets, I understand that a set top box will be necessary and that these boxes will cost between £150 and £200. I further understand that the cost of new digital television sets could be as high as £1,000 or as low as £500.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language published its report on broadcasting last January. It requested the Minister to ensure that the indigenous channels as well as the existing BBC and ITV channels, including Channel 4, would remain available under present conditions. By that the committee meant there would be no additional charges to viewers. Will she give an undertaking in this regard?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another aspect of the communication-rich and communication-poor question. Part II is headed &ldquo;Standards in Broadcasting&rdquo;. Section 15(1) deals with the understanding and enjoyment of television by people who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who are blind or partially sighted. The Irish Deaf Society does not accept this provision in the Bill is satisfactory. Essentially, it seeks more specific targets in the legislation because it fears there is too long a timescale for the introduction of specific steps. It seeks 100 per cent subtitling of output within five years and the devotion of 5 per cent of air time <Col N="289" /> to the medium of Irish sign language. I ask the Minister to carefully consider this request. The maximum universal access to television output within the State is not alone desirable but in this day and age should be viewed as a right for all of those who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind or partially sighted.</P>
    <P>Part IV has aroused considerable interest within the broadcasting sector. It is headed &ldquo;Provisions in relation to the Authority&rdquo;. Section 24 deals with the public service character of the authority's national broadcasting service. In effect, it deals with public service broadcasting. In the 1980s the BBC broadcasting research unit in London published a document setting out eight principles of public service broadcasting. These included universality of availability; universality of appeal; provisions for minorities, especially those disadvantaged by physical or social circumstance; servicing the public sphere, that is, the nation speaking to itself; a commitment to the education of the public; public broadcasting should be distanced from all vested interests; broadcasting should be so constructed as to encourage competition in good programming rather than competition for numbers; and the rules of broadcasting should liberate rather than restrict the programme makers.</P>
    <P>Part IV, section 24(1) states: &ldquo;The national television and sound broadcasting service required to be maintained by the Authority under section 16 of the Act of 1960 shall have the character of a public service, continue to be a free-to-air service and be made available, in so far as it is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland and the Authority shall have all powers as are necessary for or incidental to that purpose.&rdquo;  This appears to cover the first principle set down in the BBC document, Universality of Availability.</P>
    <P>Part IV, section 24(2) states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1),</i> the Authority shall ensure that the programme schedules of the broadcasting service referred to in that subsection&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English languages that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and include, both on television and radio (and also, where appropriate, any means of transmission referred to in section 16(2)(<i>bbb</i>) (inserted by this Act) of the Act of 1960) programmes that entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests and which, in every case, respect human dignity;</P>
    <P>(b) provide programmes of news and current affairs in the Irish and English languages, including programmes that provide coverage of proceedings in the Houses of the <Col N="290" /> Oireachtas and the European Parliament; and</P>
    <P>(c) facilitate or assist contemporary cultural expression.</P>
    <P>This subsection appears to cover the third principle of the BBC document dealing with the provision for minorities, but the Bill needs to be strengthened by including a provision dealing specifically with those disadvantaged by physical, sensory, mental or social circumstances. In this regard section 24(2)(b) and (c) are bland and require sharper focus.</P>
    <P>When section 24(2)(b) is set against the fourth principle in the BBC document the deficiency in the language of the Bill becomes more apparent. Public broadcasting should service the public sphere, the nation speaking to itself. Implicit in this principle is a proactive, creative role which stimulates discussion on the issues which are of primary importance to the nation. Indeed, when it is viewed against the eighth principle in the BBC document, which states that the rules of broadcasting should liberate rather than restrict the programme maker, the shortcomings in paragraph (b) are the more apparent.</P>
    <P>Section 24(2)(c) is so bland it must be asked whether there is any merit in including it in its present form. If the paragraph is to have any meaning, there is a need to explain or expand on what is meant by the term &ldquo;contemporary cultural expression&rdquo;. With regard to the provision of programmes in the Irish language by Radio Teilifís Éireann, it is imperative the Minister specifies the minimum number of broadcast hours which must be provided in the Irish language by the authority on each of its services and how they will be constituted.</P>
    <P>The fifth of the BBC principles would appear to be covered under section 24(2)(a), but the sixth and seventh of the BBC principles must be clearly stated. These state that public service broadcasting should be distanced from all vested interests and that broadcasting should be so structured as to encourage competition in good programming rather than in competition for numbers. These are fundamental principles. The important issue is quality of programming with a focus on citizenship rather than consumerism. Being a consumer is only one part of being a citizen.</P>
    <P>Part IV, section 24(3) provides for ministerial power to modify section 24(2) by order. This gives deep cause for concern. It appears to be a wide-ranging provision with the potential to seriously undermine the primary legislation. The Labour Party is totally opposed to this provision and will be putting down an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage. It appears to indicate that the public service broadcasting definition contained in the Act could be completely overturned by ministerial order. I do not suggest the Minister would do this, but the power would be there for future Ministers to act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may establish <Col N="291" /> Teilifís na Gaeilge as a statutory corporate body, the members of which shall be appointed by the Government. However, some of the terminology used in the section which details the functions of Teilifís na Gaeilge makes one wonder what the new body corporate will be mandated to do. For example, section 39(1) states: &ldquo;Teilifís na Gaeilge shall establish and maintain a national television broadcasting service which shall have the character of a public service and be made available, in so far as it is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 39(4), paragraph (a) seeks to ensure that the programme schedules of this broadcasting service provide a comprehensive range of programmes that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and include programmes to entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of those of all age groups in the community whose preferred spoken language is Irish or who otherwise have an interest in Irish. Paragraph (b) seeks to provide programmes, primarily in the Irish language, of news and current affairs.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that this would seem to indicate that the nature of Telefís na Gaeilge will change significantly when the station is set up on a statutory basis, there is a great need for a national debate on the Irish language. A number of basic questions must be asked against a background of continuing decline in the standard and use of the Irish language throughout the country. The first question is, do we as a community wish to achieve a bilingual society and, if so, why do we wish to do so? There is the question of how the Irish language enriches national life. If there is a free open discussion where those with contrary views to what in many ways is the knee-jerk common wisdom can express them without being subjected to ridicule or abuse, then I believe the Irish people at large will renew their commitment to the Irish language, to its revival and to things Irish. Currently, too much of the support stated for the Irish language is unthinking support, not a thought-out position. There is also a need for qualitative and wide-ranging research to establish what the people of Ireland really think regarding the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The language belongs to all the people of Ireland, not to any group or political party. We must face up to this fact. A great deal of State resources have been applied to the Irish language. In the context of revival and increasing the use of Irish as a spoken language, we have singularly failed. We need as a people to have the maturity to engage in a root and branch analysis of the place of the Irish language in the day-to-day life of the citizens of this State. Following that, and the conclusions reached, policies should be implemented which would have the strong and enthusiastic backing of the majority of the people. Without this the Irish language will decline even further. No fundamental changes should be made <Col N="292" /> to Telefís na Gaeilge until the people have been encouraged to state their views in a mature nationwide debate.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill states that the Authority &ndash; meaning Radio Telefís Éireann &ndash; shall ensure that the programme schedules of the broadcasting service facilitate or assist contemporary cultural expression. The functions of Telefís na Gaeilge, or to use its new title TG4, contains an identical clause. However, there is an addition which states, &ldquo;facilitate or assist contemporary expression and encourage or promote innovation and experimentation in broadcasting&rdquo;. Is it to be deduced from that that there is no obligation on RTE to encourage or promote innovation and experimentation in broadcasting?</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that a new entity is to be created in which RTE will be a minority partner with a shareholding of up to 40 per cent. This entity will be mandated to build and operate the DDT infrastructure and promote the development of multi-media services and the information society. RTE's existing transmission function will be separated from RTE as a going concern and RTE's equity contribution to the new entity will be met to the extent required by the value of these assets. Will the Minister tell me whether the decision to separate RTE from its existing transmission function was taken on ideological grounds or on social, economic and democratic grounds? Can the Minister enlighten us as to how this decision is in the national interest, bearing in mind that RTE will be disposing of an asset which has been provided by the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>The Minister has also spoken of a project management group chaired by her Department, including representatives of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Public Enterprise and of RTE in overseeing the management of the project. Has this project group, or any group in which representatives of her Department have been involved, evaluated whether the separation of RTE from its existing transmission function is the correct and prudent course and, if so, how was this conclusion arrived at? Will the Minister further enlighten us as to who the one or more strategic partners with the relevant expertise and finance in respect of the operation are? In what way will this course of action strengthen the position of those who can become the information underclass? Will the Minister further inform us as to why, in what is effectively the privatisation of a national asset, it is considered appropriate for RTE to have a minority shareholding? If RTE is to have any shareholding, why would that shareholding not be a majority one? How will the new entity ensure service in transmission blackspots, particularly in mountainous and remote areas of the south, west and north-west? Will the public interest, as in all the public, be served in this regard? In any event, the Labour Party stands by its previous proposal that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland would set up an agency to maintain the transmission infrastructure of the Authority within the <Col N="293" /> public service. Is the Minister satisfied that TG4 will be able to pay the sort of commercial fees for transmission that the new company would be likely to charge?</P>
    <P>Section (8) of the Second Schedule states that a person shall not be appointed to be a member of the body unless he or she has experience of or shown capacity in media or commercial affairs, radio communications engineering, trade union affairs, administration, or social, cultural, educational or community activities, and he or she is able to speak and write proficiently in the Irish language. Who will adjudicate on the proficiency of any prospective member of Telefís na Gaeilge to speak or write proficiently in the Irish language? Does this mean that a person must have an honour in the Leaving Certificate examination or a further third-level qualification? Who will adjudicate on the experience or capacity shown by a person to be appointed in relation to radio communications engineering? Will the person need to have a craft, a national certificate or a national diploma or degree in radio communications engineering? What is meant by a person must have experience of or shown capacity in media or commercial affairs? I submit that this section is unclear in its terminology and to a strict interpretation could virtually eliminate everyone from being a member of Telefís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>If the situation is reached where 30 channels are available through digital terrestrial television broadcasting, the obvious question is how can all this time be filled with worthwhile programmes? If the whole operation, outside of public service broadcasting, is profit driven, is there not the danger that the Irish public will be exposed to a great deal of rubbish?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the £16 million being made available in 1999 by RTE for independent television productions is sufficient? Is this an imposition RTE will be able to carry without serious restriction on the Authority's public service broadcasting role, and should some or all of this funding come directly from the Exchequer?</P>
      <P>What has the Minister done to ensure sufficient funding is available for the production of high quality indigenous programmes which will continue to enhance the programming that is available free to air to the public? Can the Minister state, in terms of quality of programming, that the existing cable, MMDS and soon to be licensed, albeit in the short-term, deflector multi-channel television services, are not superior in terms of content to that which will or could become available under the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community Media Network sees the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, as offering real progress to community channels, not least by giving legal recognition to them. The Community Media Network fully recognises the positive aspects of the Bill, which it welcomes, but there are some short<Col N="294" /> comings it sees as being detrimental to the development of the best kind of community broadcasting. The point has been made that the Independent Radio and Television Commission definition of community broadcasting should be extended to cover all community media. That definition states:</P>
    <P>A community radio operator is characterised by its ownership and programming and the community it is authorised to serve. It is owned and controlled by a not-for-profit organisation whose structure provides for membership, management, operational programming, primarily by members of the community at large. Its programming should be based on community access and should reflect the special interests and needs of the community it is licensed to serve.</P>
    <P>The second area of concern for the Community Media Network is that community media should be explicitly formed as non-profit entities whose sole aim is to benefit their community in social, cultural and economic terms. That community media should not be restricted to broadcasting but, where possible, should engage in programme production, training, community capacity building and exchanges.</P>
    <P>A third point which concerns the Community Media Network is that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, which is proposed under this Bill, should provide for research into initial community views and needs, and whether the broadcaster is satisfying these, but that this research should be put in place on a participatory basis and should be geared towards the ongoing improvement of services. The fourth issue concerning the Community Media Network is the definition of community which it contends should include community of interest. The fifth issue is that, because of the not-for-profit nature of community media, the Bill should allow for the setting up of a fund of seed finance for community broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The Community Media Network is seeking to have community representation on the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and other statutory and advisory structures. It also seeks a clear statement in the Bill that recognises social, economic and cultural benefits of community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a number of questions. What is the relationship between the Authority, that is RTE, and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland? Is it intended that RTE will be brought under the control of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland? </P>
    <P>Regarding the &ldquo;Additional functions of the Commission&rdquo;, section 9(1) fails to take account of the fact that there are two official languages in this Republic. As the Bill stands, the Commission is charged with performing its function to ensure the number and categories of broadcasting services best serves the needs of the people of the State, bearing in mind their traditions and cul<Col N="295" /> ture. I put it to the Minister that the final phrase should read &ldquo;bearing in mind their traditions, languages and culture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part III, section 5(2), I put it to the Minister that the areas in respect of which the Commission shall make rules should include a code specifying the minimum amount of broadcast hours which must be provided in the Irish language on each broadcasting service and how these hours will be constituted, subject to the approval of the Minister. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission should be empowered to investigate and decide on a complaint that a broadcaster is failing to comply with a provision of this code. The Bill does not provide for an assured index-linked funding mechanism for public broadcasters, RTE and TG4.</P>
    <P>I further ask the Minister to inform us why the Bill is so woolly on convergence and whether she personally supports a situation where the powers and duties in the area of communications are spread over three Departments. More importantly, the Bill is devoid of vision in the context of the convergence of telecommunications broadcasting and the Internet. Essentially, the Bill approaches the highly exciting future of the Information Age with inadequate and outdated concepts and strategies. The Bill does not indicate what we can aspire to in the social, cultural and democratic sense. Instead of enhancing the agenda of informing, educating and entertaining, we run the risk of an overwhelming diet where repetition and rubbish will tend to dominate.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will reserve its position on the Bill until we have heard the Minister's response to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, is to be welcomed. I support the Minister's proposals and her aims in putting the Bill before the House. There is a pressing need to cater for major anticipated future development. We are all aware that in this age of technology explosion change occurs not by the week or by the day, but by the hour and by the minute. In this context, we must have in place a regulatory system that addresses the needs of today's broadcasting services. The Bill amends the Broadcasting Authority Acts of 1960 to 1993, and it is the first major legislation on broadcasting since 1988. The last really comprehensive survey of this medium took place almost 40 years ago. We are now far removed from the magic of our first black and white television and the wonder of our initial contact with colour television. Compared to those far-off happy days, the television scene, even as it stands, offers a choice and a multiplicity of programmes that would have astounded the viewing public of the 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on her perception of the very real need for the presentation of this Bill to the House at this time. Its purpose is to make the necessary preparation to put Ireland's broadcasting infrastructure in place for <Col N="296" /> the next millennium. It will license an authority for digital terrestrial broadcasting. Under this new system hundreds of channels will develop in this new digital TV era. There will be widespread choice on a scale never before envisaged. This is something we all look forward to with great anticipation. I cannot really grasp the possibility of the many uses we will find for DTT. We are limited only by the bounds of our imaginations, and we must ensure the proportion of native Irish programmes provided to the viewing public is not allowed to diminish. We do not want them swamped out of existence by the sheer weight of alternative programmes. It is my belief that all the programmes transmitted on our national network should and must reflect the standards and ethics of the people of all of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Increased powers with regard to the drawing up of codes and rules in the context of all broadcasting are in place. These powers relate to the taste and decency of programme material and advertising. We must ensure this new system caters for those values and the views and beliefs of minority as well as majority groupings. Programmes must reflect our heritage and the rich cultural diversity of our people. They should continue to constitute a large proportion of our network capacity. We all have great expectations of the richness of knowledge and information that will unfold when the new technology is on stream. We must ensure our standards of respect for human dignity and our core values continue to be observed on our national broadcasting system. Following the required consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Bill provides that the Minister may designate a company that will be licensed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to construct and operate the DDT structure. The contract will embody stipulations that material in programmes which contravenes Article 22 or Article 22A of the European Council directive or the provisions of the Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, will result in the loss of the contract. I have asked for copies of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the contract, six transmission systems, known as multiplexes, which will be eligible for DDT licences will also be put in place. The Bill reserves a full multiplex for RTE, which is called the &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; in the Bill, half a multiplex for the television programme service contractor, currently known as TV3, and half a multiplex for TG4. The other four licences will go to designated companies to transmit services. These companies could represent interests in the television, radio, cinema, Internet, telephone and multi-media sectors. The Minister may provide that a multiplex or a part thereof be allocated to a Northern Ireland terrestrial broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>A major change in the Bill is that the Independent Radio and Television Commission will be renamed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. This new body will have greatly expanded powers and functions. It will control and regulate the DDT infrastructure which con<Col N="297" /> trols terrestrial broadcasting, cable and MMDS systems and satellites. The Bill will clarify the remit of RTE and TG4 under the Broadcasting Acts and the establishment of TG4 as a statutory body whose members shall be Government appointees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £500,000 for capital expenditure on transmission infrastructure by local and community radio stations, the removal of the right of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose levies on the income of independent broadcasters, the provision by RTE this year of £16 million to independent television producers and the ongoing provision of such a sum, which will be index-linked, in subsequent years. I compliment the Minister on the breadth and vision embodied in these far-reaching proposals.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade the broadcasting landscape has changed dramatically. The development and expansion of TG4 and TV3 has given a wider choice to television viewers. The enactment of this Bill will provide a statutory basis for the continued successful development of world class standards of broadcasting and transmission. We have a mixture of State and independent broadcasters which provide quality programming that is the envy of other countries. The rapid development of independent radio in line with this progress has been greatly welcomed. This sector has now achieved a 50 per cent market share. Who could have foreseen that a few years ago? </P>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for expected future developments, particularly in the technological areas. It recognises that such advances, combined with a rapidly changing commercial environment, will ensure a climate of ongoing change and expansion. The new technology will fully service the increasingly sophisticated needs of Irish audiences, particularly at local level. It will firmly establish an independent broadcasting sector in which it is hoped all operators will participate successfully and fairly.</P>
    <P>Under the guidance of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, independent radio has been enormously successful. It has developed out of all proportion and it will continue to expand. It is seen as a valued public service and it has become a unique part of communities throughout Ireland, providing quality community access. It sets high standards which will ensure the quality of the independent network will continue at its current high level. The abolition of the broadcast levy, which was long overdue, rightly recognises the public service role independent stations play. The establishment of the £500,000 fund for the improvement of the transmission infrastructure will go some way towards defraying costs incurred by local and community stations.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cork, 96FM has played an invaluable role not only in providing an exceptionally strong entertainment medium but also in providing the only source of hourly local news. Its current affairs programmes also provide the <Col N="298" /> only outlet for Cork people to discuss issues which affect their lives. Cork issues are rarely dealt with by national stations. 96FM allows Cork people to discuss their home place, of which they are proud. This local radio provides a valuable outlet for us, as politicians, to debate current issues and other matters and to explain our actions and points of views to the public. The people will give both negative and positive answers on what they think of what is being done for them by politicians and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local radio also provides us with a valuable forum for feedback. It gives us the public's reaction to national and local politicians and political events and our constituents' views on our performances in that context. Nobody is left under any illusion as to what the public deems to be important and what it feels we should be doing. They are also quick to point out what we are not doing. It is gratifying that the daily broadcasts are provided by local radio professionals without compromising the quality of the service. That is not unique to Cork. A similar first class public service is provided by the majority of local stations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill firmly establishes the future of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. However, the same cannot be said for the future of the independent radio sector and the 1,000 staff it employs. Stations are now reaching the expiry of their current contracts and their renewal cannot be taken for granted. In the aftermath of the demise of Century Radio, many questioned the wisdom of investing in independent radio stations throughout the country. Shareholders, management and staff of independent stations have invested substantial time and finances in their workplaces. They have shown faith in their stations, which has been justified, and a belief in the widespread public demand for independent radio. They have succeeded in developing independent local radio stations to the heights they have now reached. Their listening public now rivals those of the largely subsidised national radio stations.</P>
    <P>Future expenditure in both equipment and staffing in radio stations is being questioned in the light of an unsure future. Clear policy statements regarding the licensing of existing independent radio stations should be issued as a matter of urgency. No business can be expected to operate and thrive in an environment of total uncertainty. It is unfair to the staff who have developed the area and to their families who now face uncertain futures. We must give our full backing to all those who work in the independent radio sector. We must also ensure that stations which operate within the law are not adversely affected by those who work illegally. A large number of pirate broadcasters have begun to emerge. Their broadcasts have, on occasions, interrupted emergency service transmissions. Their existence affects the livelihood of licensed operators. Provision is urgently required to ensure that those <Col N="299" /> who operate legally are subject to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill deals at length with technical issues and the future of digital broadcasting. It is important that all parties play a role in this development and that the independent sector is given a defined role. The Bill provides additional clarity on the public service character of the national television and radio services provided by RTE. This must be closely monitored, particularly in light of the service being provided by independent television and radio. Particular notice must be taken of the 20 per cent quota of news and current affairs under which independent radio stations must operate. We must question whether it is right that independent commercial stations should have more onerous public service requirements than some of our public broadcasting services. I suggest that this Bill incorporates a clear and unambiguous definition of the meaning of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>RTE will continue to receive a licence fee to finance public service broadcasting. It should provide quality Irish programming which would not otherwise be available. Clear and specific conditions should be attached to the distribution of the licence fee. We must monitor in detail the manner in which this money is spent. This must be done in a transparent and accountable fashion. It is unacceptable that the licence fee could be used to subsidise advertising rates to maintain a low cost advertising environment or to encourage anti-competitive practices. I am advised that RTE has used public funding to aggressively outbid TV3 for programming that does not fall within the public service category. I hope this will not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for RTE to operate local, community and regional services. There are some excellent programmes provided under this heading. If the independent sector is already providing the local service, it is manifestly unfair that public funding would be used by RTE to satisfy a need that had already been filled.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides RTE with the power to offer special interests subscriptions or a pay per view service. The introduction or implementation of this type of service must be stringently monitored. We have to ensure that items of national and general public interest can be availed of and viewed free of charge by the entire population. I refer specifically to our national games and sports. They are not to be confined to those who can afford to pay for selective expensive viewing.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with both television and radio broadcasting. It reiterates the national commitment to provide a comprehensive range of services in Irish and English. It gives well merited recognition to the outstanding programmes produced by the independent production sector and to the exceptionally talented individuals who work therein. Why then is there only a commitment to independent television production? On the broader scene, it is unusual in a European <Col N="300" /> context for national broadcasters to be dual funded. I am advised that this does not happen. If this is so, the scene must change. Heavily funded national broadcasters should not be allowed to have an unfair advantage over their competitors in the independent sector.</P>
    <P>It is important that broadcasts from the national system should fully reflect the traditions and values of the people. They must: &ldquo;Provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English language...reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island...cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests...respect human dignity&rdquo;. There must be a balance in what we see and hear on our programmes. People have told me that at times they feel they are being preached to by RTE. Many people express unease as to what they see as a preoccupation by some broadcasters on our national station with minority viewpoints that do not respect our traditional values. Those people are entitled to their beliefs and are entitled to express them.</P>
    <P>Some of our broadcasters seem to be either unaware or uncaring in relation to the guidelines imposed on them when they speak on our national transmission system. We hear vulgar language used with a fair degree of regularity on 2FM and other stations. This may be acceptable to those who use and promote it but the general public is not impressed by it. Its views are relevant, even though some broadcasters may think they are immune to the criticism of listeners. It is important that the opinions of those in the mainstream of Irish life be given a fair hearing proportionate to their numbers. They take serious exception to the perception of some on our networks that it is fashionable and trendy to criticise and show bias against and a disrespect for the cultural and spiritual values of our people. I do not agree with it. Under Article 40.6 of the Constitution, there is a prohibition against the &ldquo;utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter&rdquo;. This does not deter the showing of pornographic material on the national screens. I do not agree with this either. Some may consider my views old fashioned. They may be, but I will not apologise for them. There must be a good number of people who share my views. If one needs an indicator, look at the listener ratings.</P>
    <P>A section dealing with TG4 states that the station must have &ldquo;an awareness of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;special regard for the elements which distinguish the varied elements of our national culture&rdquo;. This seems to imply that only this station needs to be specifically advised as to how it will run its operation in the field of national broadcasting. No one has anything against the sentiments expressed, but where is the public demand that they need to be explicitly expressed in the case of Irish language broadcasting? Is this because it is a station which promotes the Irish language and culture? Its record of first <Col N="301" /> class, well balanced and responsible broadcasting speaks for itself. We have no need to worry.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with teleshopping channels. A constituent advised me that almost 50 per cent of Italian television is devoted to teleshopping. I hope the Minister will ensure this will not happen here. I have also been asked about whether people will have to pay for additional channels with the introduction of digital television. I did a great deal of research on digital television. I cannot speak about it as I have run out of time, but I point out that I am well advised on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>One must give a belated welcome to the Bill. It has been so long in gestation that it came as a shock when it was finally presented to the House. We thought it would never appear. That is not because little preparatory work was done by Members of both Houses on the issue of digital broadcasting. We had committee meetings during which we heard substantial submissions from various interests in the areas in doubt. A sizeable report was published by the rapporteur, Deputy Jim Higgins, in which all the recommendations he put to the committee were accepted. It is regrettable that there was not an opportunity to debate the recommendations in the House when such major legislation as this Bill was imminent. They should have been debated as it would have shown the greater relevance of this House as a debating chamber. It seems there is a desire on the part of Ministers to have their exclusive stand on legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a debate on the recommendations was a missed opportunity, especially given that the study conducted by Deputy Higgins and committee members was substantial and was finalised in January 1999. We found it difficult to get the technical people from the Department to attend our meetings. While they made a submission, there was no discussion about content and we heard nothing from the Department as to its views on content. When the legislation was finalised, only one or two of the recommendations of the report were briefly touched on. There was a long list of them and the first of them laid emphasis on the fact that broadcasting must be seen as an aspect of cultural life, that further broadcasting legislation must affirm that this is an overriding public <Col N="302" /> interest and that decisions about broadcasting must be made in accordance with cultural and democratic criteria. A great opportunity for a democratic exercise was missed through the failure to debate this report in the House, which would have allowed us to see what was behind the Department's thinking.</P>
    <P>Everyone is concerned about the future of RTE, TV3, TG4 and private producers and the significant employment content involved in that. In spite of the increase in the number of channels available to RTE, the station has a problem with costs. In its very fine presentation to the committee, RTE representatives outlined their views on the subject of costs but they do not appear to have been taken on board in the Bill. The financial future of RTE is dealt with in such a trivial manner that one can only conclude that, unless the Minister offers an explanation about its future financing on Committee Stage, the station could be bankrupt in three years' time. That may appear to be an extreme statement but one can only operate on the basis of the limited information available.</P>
    <P>This Bill offered an opportunity to produce a radical system which would operate long into the next century. As we have such a huge pool of advanced technical knowledge among our young people, we should have offered those young people some encouragement. Instead, the Bill serves to dampen people's expectations. It does not really say anything about the future of TG4, an inspired development, primarily generated by the former Minister, Deputy Higgins. While all parties have grappled with TG4, the station's cultural thrust is in danger of being lost. In an attempt to boost its viewing figures, the station did a great public service by broadcasting the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT tax hearings. I suppose the hearings had a certain cultural aspect to them &ndash; they certainly exposed an inordinate level of lack of culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They were an exercise in fantasy illusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed. However, we should give credit where it is due to TG4 for taking its opportunity. There was no forward thinking in the Department to indicate that such initiatives could be expanded upon. We are now wondering how funding will be allocated to the station? Initially, it was to be provided in accordance with the cost of living index but, subsequently, it was to be provided in accordance with RTE's production cost index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE, TG4, TV3 and independent radio operators want to see the development of a transparent financial structure for RTE. However, the Bill does nothing to assist RTE in achieving this objective. I am sure RTE executives are pulling their hair out that this great opportunity has been bypassed, seemingly for the sake of expediency. I regret the Minister did not take advantage of this <Col N="303" /> significant opportunity to develop a real definition of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting services are an element of the fourth estate. A previous speaker referred to minority interests in RTE having an inordinate say and pointed to the fact that they are not controlled. That position seems to vary. The RTE authority should have its own secretariat and should be independent of the RTE company which exists at present.</P>
    <P>One of the Bill's main planks relates to the establishment of a company called Digico, of which RTE will acquire 40 per cent. The remaining 60 per cent will be sold off. Many Members of the committee expressed very definite reservations about allowing Mr. Murdoch and his ilk the opportunity to take up that 60 per cent and run riot over us. Committee members were very angry and disenchanted about this issue.</P>
    <P>I have no confidence in the advice Ministers are receiving at present, certainly in regard to the sale of State assets. One need only look to the Telecom &ndash; now Éircom &ndash; flotation for proof of that. Members of the public were massaged by their own money for a three or four month period. I understand that approximately £6 million was spent in an attempt to seduce the public into buying shares. People were given the impression that the shares were the equivalent of a licence to print money. Only the fly by nights who got out in the very beginning made a profit. I do not think there would be a great degree of confidence among the public about investing in 60 per cent of Digico. If the Minister is going to seek financial advice, she should not ask the Minister for Public Enterprise for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might prove difficult to avoid Deputy O'Rourke's advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. The Telecom flotation was the most sloppy and unprofessional sale of a State asset I ever witnessed. Now we are preparing to sell off the broadcasting abilities of RTE and the shares will hopefully feature on the New York Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>However one looks at it, public service broadcasting is not a matter of right wing versus left wing or conservative versus liberal. It is the right of the public to communicate. It is something which, if not dealt with it in this Bill, will be put on hold for a long time.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny said, broadcasting in the future will involve the Internet and teleshopping and so on. It is necessary that we meet the basic mass communication needs of the majority of the public. That should be the priority of public service broadcasting. We are not demonstrating our ability to communicate in this Bill. I suppose it is the last cry of the older generation in this century. At almost the end of this century, we are not showing much imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the splendid critiques I received from many quarters about this Bill. TV3 provided <Col N="304" /> an executive summary. I am sure the Minister got the same but her response has been rather limited. It spoke about Irish channels for Irish viewers. As Deputy O'Shea said, there is no sense of promotion of indigenous broadcasting services in the Bill. The Minister is not encouraging TV3, TG4 and definitely not the private production aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>Maybe not. It is inhibited. During my short term as Minister of State, I visited many small companies in the Gaeltacht area which were well able to produce outstanding short films. These films provided much employment locally. I did not see any imprint of Údarás na Gaeltachta on this Bill. Did the Minister consult Údarás? Did she ask about these private developers?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny likes to listen to BBC Radio 4 on his way to Mayo but I listen to Radio na Gaeltachta on my way home. There was an interesting interview the other night on the radio about a production unit in the Ring Gaeltacht in which the managing director or manager of the company illustrated the advances it had made but also indicated that it would be dependent on the private film producer and the work RTE or TV3 gives it.  If the Minister had said £16 million was the minimum figure, that would be something but she said £16 million plus. That is a handicap for the private film producer. As Deputy O'Shea asked, who will guarantee the goodwill of the Minister who follows Deputy De Valera, although this Government believes in keeping Ministers in place for a long time? </P>

I hope she will look after the industry and the employment aspect of the industry for which she is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sections of the industry have moved with the times. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language received a submission from Film Makers Ireland on 2 March. We were given a breakdown of the proportion of RTE's total revenue. It is clear RTE is turning its back on independent productions because it does <Col N="305" /> not have the scope. How will the Minister deal with this issue? How will she ensure the confidence of people who are prepared to invest in this area? Will she do so in the hit and miss manner in section 481, to which Deputy Kenny referred? </P>
    <P>The Minister went to Los Angeles or San Francisco a year or two ago and when she came back she had her knuckles rapped by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who said there was no money but decided to extend the section for another year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One never knows. I hope fortune will favour the brave, as they say.</P>
      <P>I am one of those lucky people, lucky beneficiaries in some ways, of the new dispensation in broadcasting which occurred around 1989 when the then Government decided to introduce commercial radio broadcasting and introduce the vital element of competition and choice which we now see flourishing throughout the country. In many ways, it gave counties an enormous sense of self-worth with local radio stations in every county &ndash; sometimes in two county franchise areas &ndash; which was not previously the case. It created greater competition in the large commercial market which existed in Dublin. Next Tuesday, 10 November, I will go to a celebration party for the tenth anniversary of 98FM, a station I worked with for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes which have occurred in broadcasting over the years are remarkable. We have now come through a wave of new licences, specialist licences in the Dublin area concentrating on news-talk and providing a variety of choice for the listener. We are also seeing the development of a community tier in radio and television broadcasting. All of these are very welcome, particularly as we move into the digital era. It is important competition is opened up fully so that the listener-viewer has real choice in terms of the <Col N="306" /> type of programming available. I hope the digital era will lead to greater choice as well as greater competition and that greater choice will allow for a diversity of programming which will be positive and underpin the democratic values of our State and the cultural diversity the term &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; implies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in introducing this Bill to regulate the new and exciting era in broadcasting being ushered in by digital television. The purpose of the Bill is to provide structures and a regulatory framework which will ensure that the broadcast needs of citizens at national and local level are fully met both in terms of information and entertainment, that there will be fair competition among those providing commercial services and that adequate provision will be made for community broadcasting on television, as well as altering the structures of RTE's operation to reflect this new reality. I will deal with these topics in turn.</P>
    <P>The arrival of digital television will greatly increase the number of channels available to consumers. There will consequently be an increase in choices as well as superior picture and sound quality. Areas which now suffer poor quality transmissions due to a variety of geographical and technical factors should benefit significantly from digital television. It is estimated that up to 30 channels, grouped in four multiplexes, can be supplied by digital television, thereby making it possible to provide educational channels, 24 hour news channels, local news channels and additional entertainment channels. This Bill presents an opportunity to foster diversity in programming and to prevent the development, due to commercial pressure, of dumbed down programming, where one channel is virtually indistinguishable from the next.</P>
    <P>There must be some concern at the Bill's proposals regarding the creation of a designated company to transmit the digital television signal. It is proposed that RTE transfer to the new company such parts of its real and personal property as it considers appropriate, subject to the consent of the Minister. This will not be an outright sale or divestment of assets, as it is envisaged that RTE will have a minority stake of 40 per cent in the new company. RTE will, therefore, continue to have a significant interest in and influence on the transmissions market. This cannot be described by any stretch of the imagination as an arm's length relationship. The practice in Britain and Australia has been for the transmission operation to be transferred to a separate private company, with the State maintaining no interest in the transmissions business. If there is a strategic rationale for the proposal as it exists, it should be made explicit so that it can be fully debated on its merits.</P>
    <P>As there are already a variety of established competitors in the marketplace supplying transmission systems, such as cable, MMDS, satellite and deflector systems, great care must be taken that the new purpose-designed company is not <Col N="307" /> conferred under statute with any privileges or advantages which would distort the market. As it stands, it seems the new company will be granted some advantages. It will be the only competitor with the legal right to charge RTE, TV3 and TG4 for carrying their signals. RTE and the other national broadcasters will not pay other competitors for this service and this is in effect a hidden subsidy for the new company, which will artificially lower its operating costs by reference to their competitors. Cable and MMDS companies are required by law to carry RTE but cannot charge for the service. Cable companies also pay royalties for carrying BBC and UTV. The Bill proposes that the new company should be able to charge BBC and other channels and this does not seem to be a level playing field.</P>
    <P>There also seems to be some policy confusion and contradiction in the approach to RTE's participation in the retransmission market. RTE and Telecom Éireann were joint owners of Cablelink until the Government directed in 1998 that they divest themselves of their interests in that operation. The current proposal effectively reverses this decision, as it re-establishes RTE as a player in the retransmissions market by law. The policy consideration underlying this proposal needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I am aware from my background in the media and telecommunications industries that there is considerable concern among those already providing retransmission services that unless the new company is wholly divorced from RTE by way of an arm's length divestment of assets and operations there will be significant market distortions, and fair competition in the retransmission business will not exist. There is also a strong case to be made for subjecting the new company to the same regulatory principles that are currently applicable to the telecommunications and cable networks. The objective should be to ensure fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access for all service providers and to avoid different types of regulation for different distribution platforms. As I indicated earlier, the current treatment of those providing such platforms is far from consistent and the current proposals, if allowed to remain unaltered, look set to increase diversity of treatment and consequential anomalies as a result.</P>
    <P>A single regulator for the entire communications industry is the most logical and simplest proposal. Failing that, the Independent Radio and Television Commission should retain responsibility for regulation of content, while it would seem reasonable to have the distribution network regulated by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The Bill also provides the Minister with the opportunity to set out a clear and specific definition of the public service remit which would involve specific reference to the type or category of public service programmes to be provided, and verifiable, objective targets could be set for these types of pro<Col N="308" /> grammes, for example, in numbers and the time of scheduling.</P>
    <P>There is also a view in the industry that the Bill should carefully circumscribe the ability of RTE to use the licence fees for purposes other than the defined public service remit. This would have the double benefit of ensuring that subscribers get the programming they have paid for and that competitive distortion in the marketplace due to State funding was kept in check to the maximum possible extent. In this context it would also be useful for the purposes of openness, transparency and accountability if the Bill were to require RTE to account separately for its public service and commercial activities, clearly defined by reference to quantifiable criteria.</P>
    <P>RTE was established at a time when, through market failures, there was no alternative to State provision of public broadcasting. Times and circumstances have changed and there are now other players in the field. The requirement for fair competition in all sectors of economic activity is an ongoing contemporary concern. The Minister has the opportunity to address these concerns in the Bill and it would be timely to do so, as this legislation provides the fundamental underpinning for the way broadcasting develops for many years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions relating to the establishment of community television stations, which have been broadly welcomed by community representative organisations. However, the proposals as structured raise a number of issues and it is difficult to see how many community interests would be able to establish a sustainable television station in the absence of some start-up funding from the State, as the start-up costs for television are significantly greater than radio. It is also difficult to see, in the light of restrictions on advertising on community and local interest channels, how many of them would survive in the long-term. This aspect of the Bill seems to require further thought. On the other hand, if the restrictions on advertising are mitigated, it is essential that the commercial and content independence of these stations are maintained, as they could, in time, if subject to takeover, become attractive targets for other media interests. In particular, the acquisition policies of regional and national newspaper groups spring to mind. The Bill, as amended, should contain such measures as will prevent an unhealthy concentration of media power and influence. The objective &ndash; it is a worthy one &ndash; of enabling communities and interest groups to have their own independent voices must be defended. However, they must be given such a measure of commercial freedom that they can become thriving, self-sustaining entities which will not be permitted recourse to the State for ongoing financial support.</P>
    <P>As it stands, the Bill represents a good beginning to provide a solid legislative foundation and framework in the communications industry. I hope the Minister will take the caveats and criti<Col N="309" /> cisms I have voiced as positive and constructive. We are entering a new broadcasting era and we must, to use the old cliché, level the playing field for both commercial and State broadcasters. Essentially, we have now evolved a three pillar system, with the State broadcaster as one pillar, commercial broadcasters as another and community broadcasters as the third pillar. I am slightly disappointed that the putative community broadcasters of the future are not included in the new Broadcasting Commission. The Minister may intend addressing that in future. It is important we maintain the integrity and validity of these three pillars of the broadcasting market. The first pillar is State or public service broadcasters, the second is the commercial sector and the third is the community pillar. All these have a validity and integrity of their own which must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I passionately believe the public service role RTE played over the years has served the country extremely well. It is fashionable for politicians to criticise the media and say it is biased in one way or another. The media here is not as biased as it is in other countries. The public service mandate and role of RTE must be spelled out in a much clearer way than heretofore to give it the integrity and future it deserves. There is a danger that we may go the route of other countries, such as the US, where public service broadcasting has become something of an extreme minority cult and what is offered on television is not greater choice or variety but a kind of dumbed-down info-entertainment presentation. This should be avoided. We must underpin the State broadcaster, but not in a way which is injurious to the many new commercial players which have come into the market and are selling their wares at specialist, local and national levels.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate this should be done tomorrow &ndash; I know there was some ribaldry earlier about privatisation &ndash; but somebody should consider whether 2FM and Network 2 are perhaps worthy candidates for being sold off or floated and put into the commercial market. Both stations have committed staff and have been a tremendous success and, therefore, could weather the storm in the private sector. The presence of these essentially entertainment stations within the RTE network clouds, colours and, to a certain extent, distorts the pursuit by RTE of its public service mandate. They are great stations and are probably great commercial successes. Their establishment and success is a great tribute to the management of RTE. However, their future might lie in the competitive world of the private sector. This might be helpful in terms of helping RTE to fully fulfil its public service mandate.</P>
    <P>Another issue in the Bill is the diversity of programme which will emerge in the digital era. I hope the Minister has in mind the importance of the educational function in the digital era, that what is transmitted becomes genuine access broadcasting and that it provides an opportunity for those who offer access to information, edu<Col N="310" /> cation and cultural matters. I know Deputy Michael Higgins has very strong views on the notion of access to the airwaves for ordinary citizens and I am sure he will develop this in his speech.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on doing a very good job. I know Deputy Carey expressed some disappointment that the Bill is not more definitive or strategic. The world of broadcasting is changing very fast and perhaps this is not the time for definitive or strategic legislation but rather for a Bill which brings us to the new platform. When we see how this pans out, the Minister or her successors, if there are any, will evolve new and more strategic legislation that will set the path well into the next century. We are at a time when things are changing in the world of broadcasting. We do not know in definitive terms to where some of the new technologies and the relationship between the Internet and television and the entertainment industry as it develops globally will lead. It is not clear how this will interact with telecommunications. Perhaps it is to the Minister's credit that she has not produced a definitive, strategic and all-embracing Bill which might put incorrect parameters on the development of broadcasting. A flexible and pragmatic response is necessary.</P>
    <P>We must clarify the public service role of RTE and underpin, develop and enhance it as best we can. We must also provide equal treatment for those new commercial broadcasters who will provide new choices for listeners and viewers of the future.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain how we will provide reciprocal access across the Border and how we will provide for the new political dispensation which arises from the Good Friday Agreement. For instance, how will we give BBC Northern Ireland and UTV the proper reciprocal access in terms of what we would ask for in the Six Counties? This is very important, because television, sometimes by its mere existence, helps change attitudes and gives people access to different sources of information and a diversity of opinion which they might not otherwise see or hear.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation. We are entering an exciting period and what she has done is commendable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill. My colleague, Deputy Kenny, and others have dealt with various issues. Deputy Carey dealt with the nitty-gritty of the Bill and will do so in more depth on Committee Stage. As the Minister said, the Bill aims to facilitate the establishment of physical infrastructure for digital broadcasting and the creation of space in the crowded world of broadcasting for new, indigenous and innovative services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency which I and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle represent has had access to UTV and BBC down through the years. We have been able <Col N="311" /> to get a much broader spectrum in terms of broadcasting in general than our counterparts in Counties Cork and Donegal and in other areas. I do not believe there is any fear a Deputy will be elected for Cavan-Monaghan purely on the basis of the problems associated with cable television or related issues.</P>
    <P>The introduction of digital television creates an opportunity for an increase in the number of services. This will make available all sorts of outside broadcasting, some which will be good and some which may not be so good. It is not fair to blame TV coverage for all our crime, etc., but certainly some of the material broadcast by outside stations, and even on some of our own stations, leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to be given expanded powers and functions. While I appreciate that much good work has been done by the Independent Radio and Television Commission, I wonder if it is wise to give too much power to independent bodies. We must examine many of the bodies set up by the House, for example, the National Roads Authority. Questions to the Minister on issues for which he provides finance are redirected to the NRA and it is very difficult to get the information or to get things done. I have personal fears about all the different powers the House divests to these independent authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates the public service remit under which RTE operates. This is one area I wish to question. RTE gets the licence fee provided by users. Local radio has done a tremendous job since it was initiated some years ago and I welcome the provision of £500,000 in the Bill as a token gesture of Exchequer funding towards capital expenditure for local and community radio. Local radio in my area, namely, Northern Sound, Shannonside Northern Sound and in the south of the county LMFM, provides a tremendous service. It covers the death notices and national issues as well. This is an opportunity for the Minister to give much needed finance to these groups to improve their service further. They give the housebound a valuable opportunity to hear local news. My mother has been blind for some years and this service is particularly important for people in that situation, who cannot read newspapers, to keep up with the news.</P>
    <P>For these reasons local community radio should be given a portion of the licence fee. Local radio competes for personnel with RTE, UTV, BBC and other radio stations. Northern Sound, my nearest local station, has a proud record of providing personnel to the national stations and stations in Northern Ireland. It has been a tremendous training ground but it needs extra finance to employ and retain top quality personnel to give the service the local communities demand and deserve.</P>
    <P>I refer to another issue which arose recently. Most public representatives from Border counties <Col N="312" /> have received representations from UCB Europe, a Christian radio station, and Dublin City Radio, headed by Dr. Cecil Stewart. Both applied to the Independent Radio and Television Commission for licences but were turned down. In fact, UCB asked the churches responsible for rebroadcasting their satellite radio station to cease on 16 February 1999, before the new licences were awarded. Unfortunately, they both failed to secure licences. Deputy Kenny has met with representatives of these organisations and will deal with this matter in greater depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to put before the House the reasons people wanted these stations to be given the opportunity to broadcast. A sample letter from the dozens which I received which was also sent to the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, from Rockcorry Presbyterian Church reads:</P>
    <P>We are writing on behalf of the members of Rockcorry Presbyterian Church to appeal to you to do all in your power to see that United Christian Broadcasters are granted a licence to broadcast or retransmit their programmes on ordinary radio.</P>
    <P>Many of our members are regular listeners to UCB and their programmes are a lifeline especially to the elderly and those who cannot get out and about. Some of our members who are drivers have complained that the UCB programmes are no longer available on 549 medium wave since the station went off the air in February. Some of our children listen in to the children's programmes and the young people in their teens and twenties to &ldquo;Cross Rhythms&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Today in the media, there is any amount of bad language, violence, explicit sex and material which does not help people to live better lives. UCB programmes are healthy, wholesome, positive and help people to live their lives in a way that is positive and constructive.</P>
    <P>I have a personal interest in the case of Dublin City Radio because Dr. Cecil Stewart OBE was born only a few miles from my home in County Monaghan and he headed the group which sought a special broadcast licence. Cecil is a member of the Belfast Cathedrals' Partnership which was set up to encourage cross community relationships and to restore the structure of the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals known as St. Peter's and St. Ann's. He is heavily involved in cross community activities in Belfast at a time when that is most necessary.</P>
    <P>He set up the Sandown Group of nursing homes &ndash; it has since been sold &ndash; which demonstrates his ability to manage a major business. There were approximately 40 homes in Northern Ireland and many people from the South were well looked after in them over the years. He certainly has the wherewithal to manage a first class service. I hope these matters will be taken into account by the Minister and the Independent Radio and Television Commission in future and <Col N="313" /> that these stations will be given an opportunity to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Bill presents an opportunity to examine and debate the future of broadcasting. Major media are covered by the legislation. Virtually everybody watches television and few people do not listen consistently to the radio, particularly when travelling by car. Most people are woken in the morning by the early news on the radio. There is a major onus on the Minister to use the opportunity presented by this Bill not only to proceed with the issues identified in the legislation but to listen to and accept amendments from the Opposition parties. These amendments will seek to make this the best possible Bill to bring broadcasting into the next century.</P>
    <P>This is a unique and sometimes scary time. The Internet and other communication media means people can contact each other across the world in seconds. On the morning after the last general election I arrived home to find a fax congratulating me on my election from a cousin who lives in an isolated village in British Columbia. She had heard about the change of Government and was obviously worried that it might have been a Canadian style change in which many members of parliament lost their seats. That is an indication of how the communication systems have changed. My cousin was able to pick up the election results on her computer screen and find out what was happening in her home country.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity to make the best possible use of broadcasting technology. With some amendments, the Bill will be useful in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It offers an opportunity to discuss an area of rapid and major development throughout the world. This is significant legislation, probably the most significant since RTE first took to the airwaves in the early 1960s.</P>
      <P>The Bill has extensive implications for the future development of broadcasting. However, although it is modern legislation, it will rapidly become dated. As quickly as people debate this issue and legislate for the changes that are taking place, the legislation becomes dated. Whatever structure is put in place as a result of the Bill and whatever decisions are made with regard to how best to move forward in the context of the development of information technology, it will be important for broadcasting organisations to keep abreast of world developments and new demands in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be no harm to look again at the birth of local radio and its emergence from community structured organisations to being the main players in their localities and on the national scene. They now influence how national stations respond to the market. Local radio stations were community driven. They were a response to a need which was discerned by the local communities. The insistence by local communities that they be heard led to the development of the stations. In local radio stations throughout the <Col N="314" /> country there is a daily interaction with people who would otherwise be marginalised.</P>
    <P>Some of these stations are celebrating ten years in business. My local radio station, Radio Kilkenny, has been on the air for ten years and I wish it well. It developed from a community driven initiative and it is still community driven. It is still answering the call of its marketplace, which asks it to analyse main events, broadcast Irish games, interact with politicians and community leaders, give a voice to local communities, assist the development of traditional music and the Irish language and ensure they are given a slot in any activity undertaken by the station. That station is supported generously in doing that.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the various schemes run by local radio stations, the support for them is widespread. In the context of this Bill, we can learn from what happened with local radio and we should also consider what will happen in this area in the future. Television stations will quickly become local television stations, given that the Minister is providing for the multiplexes and other infrastructure in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Recent EU funding for this area was matched by local companies. Such funding was matched by some local companies in Kilkenny. A local service provider is providing fibre optic cable throughout the city and its environs, which will facilitate the broadcasting of local television. It will provide the opportunity for households to interact without requiring people to leave their homes. It will make it possible for households to surf the net and to interact commercially with the world. The provision of a set rate will give them the opportunity to stay on the net for a long time. The provision of a set rate is important for anyone who accesses the Internet from their home, otherwise one would have to bear the cost of outrageously high bills from Eircom.</P>
    <P>Local television would highlight the talent we have locally, the many people who are involved in film-making and those with other talents in the community who could become a part of local television. I believe it will come to pass that local commercial interests will provide shopping on line. There will be a good deal more e-commerce activities. All this will be conducted through fibre optic cable from one's television. Videos will be ordered by way of that new development. Local radio and local television have set that scene and long may it continue.</P>
    <P>Relating this to what happens nationally, there are so many television channels broadcasting into this country that people are almost turned off them or bamboozled by what is on offer. It is incredible that people tend to flick through the stations, particularly at Christmas, because they cannot find any interesting programme to entertain them. When we had only one television station, we were able to entertain ourselves, but now that we have 100 television stations and 100 ways of accessing them, we find the programmes <Col N="315" /> on offer do not entertain us. We found better ways to entertain ourselves in the past.</P>
    <P>Tom Collins of NUI Maynooth in a recent paper stresses that in regard to developing the country in a European context and opening ourselves up to the world, we have almost gone full circle because we are now coming back to the point where we wanted to examine the local scene and the benefits the local scene &ndash; be it on a regional or county basis &ndash; has for us. That will be the area of focus for television in the future.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to ensure that the legislation we introduce will be a clear definition of public service broadcasting because in the initial stages of this development we will have to ensure at national level that our Irishness, our culture and ethos, is protected and reflected through some television channel. We will also have to ensure that Irish performers and producers of Irish programmes and films, such as community producers in Kilkenny, will be given a slot to enable them perform and display their talents and that the public will be able to access such a channel to enable them to judge whether that is the type of channel they want. It is essential to provide that choice. If that choice is given, on the basis of the market research conducted by local radio and local television, many people would switch to the Irish promoted channels, the ones that would give them greatest value for money and a wider view of life on this island.</P>
    <P>As technological advances emerge, the gap between how we interact with one another is widening. The sense of community derived from people visiting each other's houses has been lost. People now sit at home and gain access to information by e-mail and e-commerce and through other facilities. The personal touch has been lost in the process.</P>
    <P>When framing legislation in this area, we must consider the concept of public service broadcasting. While we cannot stop the march in this development, we must be extremely careful. We must learn lessons from the past and take account of what the viewers want to see.</P>
    <P>Investment in digital broadcasting will be enormous. Irrespective of what we provide for in legislation, the pace in this area will be dictated by the BSkyBs of this world. They will set the pace and provide the programmes. They have the money and the backing to influence what happens in the world of technology and television, how people interact with it and the money to be made from such interaction. We must be conscious of that in framing legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a challenge, but it is one that is worthwhile because there are major benefits to be gained from it. Job creation in information technologies presents major opportunities for Ireland. If we set up new bodies to examine television and radio broadcasting, many thousands of people who are involved in information technology can take up jobs in this area. They have shown they have skills in this area that are hard to find or <Col N="316" /> match throughout the world. In terms of software design, we are way ahead of others in this field.</P>
    <P>As well as forming an opinion on how we should move forward and the structures required, we must take logical steps that will ensure such development benefits the country. We must also consider other related issues. Apart from delivering digital television and exposing everyone to e-commerce and the choice of numerous channels, there are ways within the technology to create new jobs and skills. We exported quite a number of people who can now return to this island and participate truly in the revolution that is taking place in information technology. A great deal can be learned from the EU funded project, which is matched by local funds and helps companies provide local television and access channels. While these channels are being provided, some areas which were serviced by the deflector system still have difficulty with access. When the appropriate infrastructure is being provided, the areas without a service should be taken into consideration. We should invest in ensuring that people without a service can participate in the development of this technology.</P>
    <P>I hope people will not be excluded from developments, nationally or locally. Local radio and television has given an opportunity to the disabled to fully participate in the development of information technology. It offers them access to air their views and participate like any other member of the community. Information technology has brought them a step further as they are in a position to interact with the commercial sector and can find jobs whereby they can work from home. However, we are at risk of creating a poverty gap in this regard. We must ensure that the deaf and blind are kept up to speed with this technology and are allowed the freedom to view and understand the world from their homes. The technology should help them surmount these problems so they can fully participate in what we are enjoying.</P>
    <P>Economic prosperity can create a gap. The majority move forward and the minority is left behind. This type of technology has exactly the same result. Many people do not understand what one is talking about when e-commerce, websites or information technology are mentioned. There is a need to reach out to these people and ensure that not only are they included in this revolution but that they understand it. Through this legislation and the education system, we ensure they understand there is a place for them in what we are doing. Schoolgoing children at all levels should be taught about technology so they can bring the information home to their parents. Sometimes we hand the remote control to our sons or daughters to show us how to operate the television.</P>

      <P>What will it be like for those who do not have that type of technology at <Col N="317" /> home? How far will they be left behind in these developments? While I admire the achievements of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, many schoolgoing children are falling out of the system because they are challenged by the technology. They would prefer to walk away because of embarrassment or lack of knowledge. We cannot afford for this to happen. There is a huge commercial value in what we are trying to do. This legislation and the commands and directions for the technological infrastructure it contains are the proper way forward. There must be a link to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science to ensure the legislation caters for others besides those on the fast track who have the money to access technology. Perhaps the definition of public service broadcasting should include a provision whereby we can reach out to those with less educational opportunities or without the ability, for one reason or other, to access what is happening in the real world. Otherwise they will be left behind.</P>
      <P>There should be an educational content in what we are trying to achieve. There should be channels specifically geared towards the education of the wider community about business and Government in relation to the development of e-commerce. The Government and State agencies should have an opportunity to explain its policy beyond this House in simple terms to those with whom we try to connect on a regular basis, but perhaps are only successful in doing at election time. We must take more tangible action and use the educational and social welfare systems to create greater access for the public.</P>
      <P>There is a community in my city of Kilkenny with 80 per cent unemployment. Their target for the new millennium is that every house in that area will have an e-mail address. A bank of computers is available to the residents who are able to access available technology. I compliment FÁS which has provided an extensive range of courses where one can educate oneself about digital television, e-commerce etc. The community centre is accessible to all.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this Bill. I do not relish her position as regards legislation in this area. She will be busy keeping up to speed with all the developments &ndash; not that she is not doing that now &ndash; and the need to advance funding and legislation so we can take part in the global development of digital television, e-commerce and the information society.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús báire mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le páirtí an Teachta Kenny, Fine Gael, as roinnt ama a thabhairt dom chun cúpla rud a rá ar an mBille Craolacháin. Is cinnte go léiríonn an Bille cé chomh tapaidh is atá an saol athraithe le roinnt blianta anuas ach é sin ráite, tá daoine ag déanamh cur síos ar an lá ina mbeidh an fón, an idirlíon, an teilifís agus fiú siopadóireacht agus seirbhísí bainc bunaithe ar bhosca amháin i gcúinne an tseomra suite. Beidh <Col N="318" /> go leor athruithe ag titim amach go han-tapaidh amach anseo agus ní dóigh liom féin gur féidir linn iad a shamhlú fiú ag an bpointe seo. Beidh daoine ag féachaint siar ar an díospóireacht seo agus, b'fhéidir, ag magadh fúinn faoin méid aineolais atá thart faoi na rudaí atá le teacht.</P>
      <P>Ach fós tá roinnt rudaí tábhachtacha le rá mar gheall ar an mBille seo. Mar reamhrá, ba mhaith liom féachaint ar na ceithre phointe a sheasann amach. Ar dtús báire, tá cuspóir sa Bhille chun an córas tarchuir a phríobháidiú agus tá roinnt mhaith cloiste againn sna coistí eile mar gheall ar phríobháidiú comhlachtaí Stáit agus mar sin de. Ach, ó thaobh cúrsaí craolacháin de, tá roinnt mhaith daoine buartha agus tuigim dóibh mar tá mise ina measc, mar gheall ar chonas is féidir freastal ar thír mar Éire nuair atá roinnt mhaith ina gcomhnaí timpeall Bhaile Átha Cliath agus níl an oiread sin daoine ina gcomhnaí in áiteanna eile.</P>
      <P>Bheadh fonn ar pé comhlacht atá i mbun an chórais freastal ar an áit ina bhfuil an chuid is mó daoine ina gcomhnaí. Beidh freastal an-mhaith, mar shampla, ar Bhaile Átha Cliath ach níor mhaith liom a bheith i mo chomhnaí in iarthar na tíre agus a bheith ag brath ar an tseirbhís chéanna.  Caithfear dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb sin agus b'fhearr liom dá bhrí sin gan príobháidiú.</P>
      <P>Tugann an Bille sainmhíniú éigin ar chraoladh na seirbhíse poiblí agus tá sé sin thar am. Ag an am céanna nuair atá na seirbhísí eile a luaigh mé ar dtús ag teacht isteach b'fhéidir gur cheart dúinn a bheith ag féachaint ar an sainmhíniú sin mar rud éigin stairiúil seachas rud éigin feidhmiúil mar tá baol ann go mbeidh an sainmhíniú as dáta sar i bhfad chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Tá sé ráite sa Bhille go mbeidh neamhspleáchas ag Teilifís na Gaeilge nó TG4 &ndash; níl fhios agam cad is ainm dó ag an pointe seo taréis an Bille a léamh. Ach ó thaobh neamhspleáchais de tá sé ráite chomh maith go mbeidh an tseirbhís neamhspleách ag an am ceart ach níl sé ráite go soiléir cathain a bheidh sé sin ag titim amach, nó cé déarfaidh cathain a bheidh an t-am ceart ann. Tá roinnt soiléirithe le déanamh ar sin agus, b'fhéidir, roinnt leasaithe chomh maith. Má tá rud éigin le bheith neamhspleách caithfidh sé a bheith beo beathach agus in ann forbairt. Níl fhios agam an bhfuil airgeadú an stáisiúin neamhspleáigh san áireamh sna tuairimí atá luaite sa Bhille chomh maith. Má tá ciste le bunú nó airgeadú le bheith ann an mbeidh sé ceangailte leis an chostas beatha nó an mbeidh sé ceangailte le forbairt an stáisiúin nó an mbeidh sé socair buan agus ag ísliú dá bharr sin ó bhliain go bliain? Sin a tharla leis na h-údaráis áitiúla nuair a bunaíodh ciste chun iad a airgeadú. Bliain i ndiaidh bliana bhí níos lú airgid á thabhairt go réadúil dóibh mar nach raibh an t-airgead ceangailte le slat tomhais éigin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá obair mhór le déanamh ag an Independent Radio and Television Commission nua agus cén saineolas a bheidh ag an eagraíocht nua seo chun dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna móra a bheidh rompu? Is cinnte go mbeidh an saol ag éirí níos casta fós ó thaobh cúrsaí craolacháin de agus níor <Col N="319" /> mhaith liom féachaint ar an Independent Radio and Television Commission mar atá sé faoi láthair mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuil dóthain saineolais acu chun dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna atá rompu.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, tá roinnt mhaith soiléirithe le déanamh mar tá an Bille doiléir go leor ar go leor bealaí. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil stáisiúin teilifíse cheana féin againn atá ag iarraidh freastal ar an bpobal. Bheadh sé go maith dá mbeadh na stáisiúin náisiúnta sin in ann a rá go mbeidh siad in áit amháin ar an scála craolacháin &ndash; go bhféadfadh daoine, go mór mhór daoine atá ag dul in aois agus gan taithí acu ar an saol nua seo, teacht ar RTE 1 agus Network 2 agus TV3 agus TG4 fós san áit chéanna i ndiaidh seo agus gan a bheith ag iarraidh stáisiún 36 a lorg más é an seanstáisiún a bhí acu atá uathu. Tá sé sin tábhachtach agus níl sé soiléir go fóill go mbeidh sé amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte go bhfuil fadhbanna móra ann agus na stáisiúin ag déanamh iarracht freastal ar gach éinne sa tír. Léigh mé san eagrán reatha den nuachtán seachtainiúil <i>LÁ </i>go bhfuil claontóirí nua ag cur bac ar TG4. Tá sé dochreidte ach tá áiteanna i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill nach féidir leo TG4 a fháil leis na claontóirí atá ann cheana féin, Fiú más mian leo fáil réidh le <i>Eastenders </i>nó le haon stáisiún ina bhfuil cláracha eile acu ní féidir leo, mar deir an t-alt nach mbeidh TG4 á chur ar fáil ar chóras na gclaontóirí teilifíse i dTír Chonaill ainneoin go mbeidh go leor de lucht na gclaontóirí ag fáil ceadúnas go luath.  Dhearbhaigh Stúrthóir na Rialacha Telechumarsáide don nuachtán nach ceadmhach do lucht na gclaontóirí ach ceithre stáisiún a chraoladh faoi na ceadúnais nua atá le heisiúint. Fágtar acu féin na ceithre stáisiún a roghnú, dar le hoifig an Stiúrthóra, ach deir daoine a bhí ag fiosrú an scéil go bhfuil cosc iomlán curtha ar chraoladh TG4 mar go bhfuil na stáisiúin leagtha amach cheana féin agus ní féidir iad a athrú. Tá sé ráite le daoine atá buartha faoi seo go gcaithfidís fanacht go haois <i>digital, </i>fanacht go dtí an ré seo chugainn agus tá na daoine sin mí-shásta mar nach bhfuil an ré sin ag teacht go luath agus tá siad fágtha gan a stáisiún féin, stáisiún a cuireadh ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Is scannal mór é sin agus ba cheart don Aire dul i ngleic leis. Ní gá Bille a fhoilsiú chun é a leigheas ach tá sé thar am rud éigin dearfach a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Níor ghá Bille a fhoilsiú ach oiread chun RTE1 agus Network 2 a thabhairt do roinnt mhaith daoine ins na ceantair seo. Bhí ar dhaoine an dlí a bhriseadh, dul suas ar chnoic agus treallamh a thógáil. Chomh fada agus is eol dom bhí na stáisiúin teilifíse ar nós cuma liom mar gheall air agus thug siad comhairle fiú do na daoine a bhí in a bhun.  Ní gá Bille chun an scéal sin a leigheas ach oiread agus tá roinnt mhaith le déanamh seachas Bille craolacháin a fhoilsiú.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh na Dála de, tá roinnt mhaith craolaidh ag teacht ón dTigh seo ó am go chéile agus ba cheart go mbeadh an teicneolaíocht craolacháin den scoth á úsáid chun Dáil dhátheangach a thaispeáint do phobal dátheangach. Baineann <Col N="320" /> an pointe atá agamsa le <i>Oireachtas Report</i> agus le cláracha den tsaghas sin. Chomh fada agus is eol dom &ndash; agus chonaic mé roinnt mhaith de na cláracha sin agus deir daoine eile an rud céanna liom &ndash; níl Gaeilge ar bith ar an gclár sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh stáisiún náisiúnta in ann Dáil dhátheangach a thaispeáint do phobal dátheangach. Tá mise anseo ag labhairt sa teanga náisiúnta agus bheadh an-ionadh orm dá mbeadh sé ar <i>Oireachtas Report</i>. Tá sé in am d'Údarás RTE féachaint chuige go mbeadh cothrom na féinne ag daoine is cuma cén teanga a úsáideann siad sa Tigh seo &ndash; Gaeilge nó Béarla. Sin pointe arís nach bhfuil ag brath ar Bhille ach tá sé ag brath ar chothrom na féinne.</P>
    <P>Pointe eile atá ina ábhar suime agamsa agus ag roinnt mhaith daoine eile sa Dáil agus sa Seanad agus i gcoitinne ná an pointe a luaigh an Teachta Crawford maidir le ceadúnais a bhí á lorg ag stáisiúin raidio. Bhuail mise leis an ngrúpa a luaigh an Teachta Crawford, UCB. United Christian Broadcasters Limited. Is grúpa iad atá ag déanamh an-mhaitheas agus atá ag obair ar son leas an phobail i gcoitinne. Ní bhaineann siad le creideamh faoi leith agus tá siad ag brath ar dhaoine deonacha chun stáisiún a chur ar fáil do dhaoine. Tugann 200,000 duine tacaíocht dóibh go deonach chun iad a choimeád ar an aeir. Ach is cosúil go bhfuil meascán nó éiginnteacht an-mhór idir oifig an ODTR agus oifig an Independent Radio and Television Commission mar gheall air. Ní thuigim cén fáth gur féidir le dhá oifig a bheith chomh measctha suas mar gheall ar rud éigin bunúsach, sé sin stáisiún raidio atá ag iarraidh ceadúnas a fháil, mar tá daoine in Éirinn ag lorg an stáisiúin sin. Tá an stáisiún á lorg chomh mór sin acu go bhfuil siad sásta craoladh gan ceadúnas fiú. Tá sé ráite ag UCB gan é sin a dhéanamh le grúpaí eaglaise, daoine maithe tríd is tríd nach bhfuil ag iarraidh an dlí a bhriseadh ar chor ar bith. Ach tá siad an-mhífhoighneach mar gheall air agus ní cheapann siad go bhfuil aon dochar á dhéanamh acu. Tá ráite ag UCB leo gan aon rud a chraoladh go dtí go bhfaigheann siad ceadúnas. Dúirt an Independent Radio and Television Commission leo gur cheart dul go dtí oifig an ODTR agus dúirt an ODTR leo dul go dtí oifig an Independent Radio and Television Commission. Tar éis an chruinnithe in oifig an ODTR leis an Regulator Etain Doyle tá áthas orm ar a laghad go bhfuil sise tar éis a rá go bhfuil sí lánchinnte gur ghá dóibh dul go dtí an Independent Radio and Television Commission agus labhairt le Michael O'Keeffe chun an t-iarratas a phlé faoin Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>Tá sé dochreidte go mbeadh ar dhaoine deonacha, daoine atá ag iarraidh seirbhís a chur ar fáil gan brabús a dhéanamh iad féin, dul ó áit go háit toisc nach bhfuil oifigigh an Stáit in ann a rá leo cad is ceart dóibh a dhéanamh. Ba cheart don Aire a bheith cinnte de nach bhfuil siad fágtha arís ar an ngannchuid gan fhios a bheith acu cad tá le déanamh. Ba cheart don Aire cabhair éigin a thabhairt dóibh. Rud atá ag déanamh tinnis do lucht craolachán iad féin ná conas a bheidh an <Col N="321" /> digital terrestrial teilifís réitithe amach anseo. An mbeidh sé ann go neamhspleách ar nós lucht Rupert Murdoch agus eile nó an mbeidh scaireanna ag RTE sa chomhlacht nua? Más féidir é a dhéanamh le comhpháirtíocht an Stáit is fearr é mar tá an-dáinséar ag baint leis an rud a bheith ann gan smacht ar bith. Bheadh &ldquo;dumbing-down&rdquo; forleathan i gcúrsaí craolacháin agus ba cheart sin a sheachaint. Tá sé de dhualgas orainn é a sheachaint sa Stát ar mhaithe le pobal na tíre seo chomh maith le cúrsaí craolachán na tíre.</P>
    <P>Deirim é sin in ainneoin go raibh mé os comhair cúirte mé féin nuair a dhiúltaigh mé íoc as ceadúnas teilifíse de bharr easpa cláracha Gaeilge ar RTE. Tá súil agam nach mbeidh orm é sin a dhéanamh arís. Bhíos im mhúinteoir ag an am agus níor thuig mé cén fáth go mbeadh Gaeilge á mhúineadh agam agus teilifís sa seomra ranga gan seans a bheith agam an tseirbhís sin a úsáid. Sin scéal eile.</P>
    <P>Beidh argóintí eile ann amach anseo. Beidh argóint mar gheall ar chonas is féidir le pobal áitiúil cumhacht craolacháin éigin a bheith acu i dtreo is gur féidir leo a bheith ag baint úsáid as córas craolacháin gan a bheith ag brath ar chomhlachtaí idirnáisiúnta chun seirbhís a thabhairt dóibh. Ba cheart dúinn féachaint ar sin sa Bhille nuair a thiocfaidh sé os comhair an Choiste.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt leasuithe tagaithe ó dhaoine ar nós Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus baineann siad le TG4 chomh maith le RTE i gcoitinne agus an córas craolacháin. Dar leo siúd, agus aontaím leo, ba cheart uaireannta faoi leith a bheith luaite sa Bhille go mbeadh ar an Údarás seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil agus conas mar a bheadh na huaireannta eagraithe.</P>
    <P>Maidir le TG4 &ndash;  ba cheart an t-ainm a shoiléiriú sa Bhille mar tá cúpla ainm in úsáid &ndash; teastaíonn ó na leasuithe go mbeadh tréimhse á lua ina mbeadh an stáisiún neamhspleách. Gan sin beidh siad ag sleamhnú ar aghaidh bliain i ndiaidh bliana dar le go leor daoine agus tá dhá bhliain luaite acu mar theora ar an dtréimhse sin. Tá siad ag iarraidh, chomh maith, go mbeadh an freastal ar na Gaeltachtaí an-shoiléir. Ní haon dochar craoladh Public Accounts Committee agus craoladh cluichí peile agus eile ach ba cheart tús áite a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Ba iad siúd a bhí ag lorg an stáisiúin ar dtús báire.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom Raidió na Life a lua mar léiríodh an-drochmheas ar Raidió na Life ó thaobh cultúir agus feidhmiú stáisiúin áitiúil de nuair nár tugadh aon rogha dóibh ach dul ó 102 FM go dtí ard-mhinicíocht eile. Bhí sé uafásach é sin a dhéanamh dóibh agus ní raibh aon chúis láidir leis agus níorbh cheart an drochmheas sin a thabhairt do stáisiún beag deonach.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite i <i>LÁ</i> go bhfuil an-chuid daoine in Éirinn tar éis a chur in iúl go bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith acu agus gur cheart do lucht fógraíochta níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid ins na fógraí sin. Tá comhlachtaí móra tar éis sin a dhéanamh agus is maith an sampla do dhaoine eile iad. Le cúnamh Dé, beidh seans ag daoine cur leis an méid Ghaeilge a bheidh in úsáid agus a bheidh ar fáil do phobal na hÉireann, nuair a bheidh feidhm dlí <Col N="322" /> leis an mBille seo. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar roinnt mhaith leasuithe ag an Choiste cé nach bhfuil mé féin im bhall den Choiste.</P>

Ní féidir liomsa a thuiscint ach oiread cén fáth go bhfuil aon iarracht á dhéanamh ag éinne an mhinicíocht a bhí acu a athrú. Tá daoine ann a éistíonn le Raidió na Life. Tá réimse maith cláracha acu.

      <P>With the speed of change in the broadcasting sector, I suspect this legislation may need to be revisited sooner than we realise. The arrival of MP3, which allows for the transmission of CD quality sound over the World Wide Web, is one example of the rapid speed of change. One suspects that the ability of the web, particularly with the introduction of fibre optic cable, to transmit high quality moving pictures cannot be far away. I am told it may be months rather than years away. Over the next couple of years every home in Ireland will have the ability to receive hundreds if not thousands of radio and television channels via the Internet. As a result, some aspects of the Bill are vital to ensure that we continue to have an indigenous broadcaster to reflect our ethos as well as our cultural and political identity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the restatement of the public service remit of RTE and TG4. What is meant by the term &ldquo;public service remit&rdquo;? We have all received submissions from various bodies, ranging from TG4 to TV3, which deal with attempts to understand what is meant by public service broadcasting. In its broadest terms, I believe it is broadcasting, the sole aim of which is to meet the needs of an audience, and not the creation of profit. Every penny it earns is spent in the interest of its audience, not of the shareholders. In the case of RTE the Irish people are the shareholders.</P>
      <P>This remit should allow RTE to produce programmes of minority interest &ndash; to be fair, RTE has done that &ndash; to fearlessly hold a mirror to our society and to challenge our complicity. Its news and current affairs programmes should be impartial and independent, it should be in a position to encourage talent across an entire broadcasting spectrum and it should develop its own unique programme formats which reflect this island nation of 3.8 million people, rather than slavishly copying formats from across the water.</P>
      <P>RTE also has a vital role to play in the national aspiration of ensuring an inclusive society. Television is one way of reaching out to those who feel excluded and alienated from our society. It is a way of giving them a voice and it empowers them by giving them access to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill rightly states that the licence fee must be spent for the purpose of fulfilling a public service remit. However, in the past number of years <Col N="323" /> the licence fee as a proportion of income for RTE has fallen dramatically. If RTE and TG4 are to fulfil their public service remit, it is time the House considered index linking the licence fee to the inflation rate or to the consumer price index. If we do not, RTE will be forced to increasingly rely on advertising revenue to the detriment of quality indigenous programming.</P>
    <P>We all know the Government is a model of integrity and that the Minister's Department epitomises this. However, Governments change and the opportunity for abuse will always be there. In view of this, is it wise to reserve the right to the Minister, as provided for under section 24, to make an order regarding the inclusion of programming in the Schedule? Would it not be better to leave this to the judgment of the broadcasting commission?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the emergence of a vibrant, independent television production sector has contributed a disproportionate amount of significant programmes on RTE. They have brought a freshness of approach, not only to the content, but also to the way programmes are produced. Pound for pound, programmes produced by the independent sector represent good value for money. Given this, I was disappointed to note that the percentage of RTE's television programme expenditure committed to the independent sector has been reduce by 20 per cent, to £16 million, increasing year on year in line with the consumer price index. This needs to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed at the small amount of indigenous home produced material that emanates from TV3. While I favour competition, it should be reflected in the programming. What is the point in having an additional national television channel if all it does is to largely replicate what is available from a plethora of satellite channels? I would have reservations about reserving one of the multiplexes for use by TV3 without tangible evidence that the station has an identify which makes it Irish and not merely interchangeable with a television station elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In this rapidly changing broadcasting environment, we need stations that the House licences to reflect our culture and ethos and to voice the concerns and aspirations of the people of the island. Is it not also reasonable to expect that among the thousands of channels available there would be some the Irish people could tune into and know by their content they are Irish.</P>
    <P>This ambitious Bill sets out a framework for broadcasting policy in Ireland into the next millennium. In the next ten to 15 years, digital television will usher in a sweeping transformation of broadcast television, its programming and services, revenue sources, corporate partnerships and ownership structures. While many existing programme genres and styles will surely continue, many innovative types of video programming and information services will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluation of community employment was published in October 1998 following due deliberation and consultation, I brought a series of proposals to Government to implement many of the reforms put forward. The Government decision was the subject of a press release in July of this year.</P>
      <P>Since then I have held further discussions with the INOU and the ICTU to clarify some aspects of the Government decision. I was happy to clarify that, first, the average level of places on CE schemes for 1999 will be maintained at 37,500 as previously agreed; second, there will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of social economy jobs and reductions of CE places, social economy jobs in general will be full-time jobs so there will not be a direct one for one ratio; third, there will be consultations with the social partners within the Partnership 2000 Committee on Labour Market Issues on how best to allocate any medium-term resources freed up by the restructuring of CE to fit the needs of long-term unemployed; fourth, there will be consultations with the social partners at a central level on the proper funding and provision of essential services currently delivered through CE; and, fifth, I indicated that the refocusing of resources towards alternative programmes agreed with the social partners earlier this year is already operational.</P>
      <P>The Government decision to reduce the number of CE places over a five year period, and to transfer the resources for 5,000 places to a dedicated social economy programme, remains unchanged. It should be noted that the Government has fulfilled by a factor of three the commitment to 10,000 additional active labour market programme places in paragraph 4.24 of Partnership 2000. All these places are for unemployed and socially excluded persons and most of them are targeted at the long-term unemployed. There will, of course, be further consultations on the provision of support to the unemployed in the context of the post-Partnership 2000 negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the criticisms levelled at her for making an announcement during the summer regarding a cut of 4,500 <Col N="325" /> places in the CE schemes without consultation with the social partners? Will she take responsibility for the indication that all the cuts she announced in July have been discussed with the social partners as opposed to just the 5,000 which were being moved to the social employment scheme? Does she agree that at her meeting with ICTU and the INOU she confirmed there would not be a further 4,500 cuts from the 37,500 places until such time as there was full consultation and that the scheme would maintain 37,500 places into next year until such time as agreement is reached about any further cuts?</P>
      <P>Last July the Minister announced an increase in the age threshold from 21 to 25 years and changes on capping whereby three years has been set as the maximum time anybody can spend on CE schemes. Is she aware that no guidelines have been issued to FÁS offices, that some FÁS offices have already begun to implement the change in the age threshold while others have begun to implement the new cap of three years? When does this latter change commence? If the Minister insists on a cap of three years, it should not start until such time as the guidelines are issued. This means a person who has spent two years on a CE scheme should not be prevented from commencing another scheme.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the horror with which her decision was met? For example, there are many people in wheelchairs outside the House, many of whom are severely handicapped. Four hundred people on CE schemes are working with the Irish Wheelchair Association. If the Minister does anything to cut the numbers on those schemes, it will have a detrimental effect on the quality of life experienced by people in wheelchairs and with other handicaps. I hope the Tánaiste will give a commitment today that sectors such as the Irish Wheelchair Association will become part of the long-term social employment programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy posed a number of questions. First, there was full consultation with the social partners from the autumn of last year on this issue. Nothing changed as a result of the meeting in September when we discussed how the Government decision would be implemented. That remains the position. There seems to be confusion in relation to how the Government decision might be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is somewhat of a conflict in the economy at the moment because there is a shortage of people to take up many of the jobs available. There are an additional 30,000 labour market places since Partnership 2000 was negotiated and there is a commitment to a further 10,000 jobs. An unprecedented number of work permits are being granted, some for longer than a 12 month period. Employment opportunities are being offered to those seeking asylum in this jurisdiction. The purpose of training and community employment initially was to help to provide unemployed people, particularly the long-term <Col N="326" /> unemployed, with an opportunity to get back into the labour market. In the process, much worthwhile community activity occurs through community employment. We need to make decisions on how ongoing activities can continue to be funded. This is something I intend to discuss with some of the line Ministers. For example, it would be desirable in the case of schools if caretaker and school assistant posts were put on a permanent footing. It is unacceptable that every summer most schools do not realise what will happen the following year. There are approximately 4,500 community employment places in schools.</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring that, no worthwhile activity in the community, particularly in the voluntary sector, especially in relation to people with disabilities, suffers adversely as a result of changes in the labour market, I have asked FÁS to do an audit of community employment to determine exactly where the 37,500 places exist. There are approximately 3,000 schemes.</P>

      <P>Some 11 inquiries are ongoing at present. The inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited are being undertaken by High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. I understand that following the conclusion of several legal proceedings, the NIB and NIBFS inquiries are now proceeding satisfactorily and that they should conclude next year. Deputies will know that the Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited inquiry has just started and that it will be several months before it concludes. While the ultimate decision on publication of the inquiry reports in these three cases is a matter for the High Court, I am optimistic that this will occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining eight investigations are being undertaken by my Department under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. In five cases, the work of my authorised officer in examining the companies' books and documents is substantially complete. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon <Col N="327" /> (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. I expect to receive final reports on many of these companies in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In a further three cases, work is at an early stage or has not yet started. College Trustees Limited, which is based in Guernsey, indicated to my Department last month that it will not be co-operating with my authorised officer's inquiries. While this is a disappointing but not altogether surprising development, it will not deflect my Department from completing its section 19 examination of the company. It will probably be May-June 2000 before this report is available.</P>
    <P>In the cases of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited, the High Court decision in the second set of judicial review proceedings by the companies and Margaret Heffernan against my decision to institute a section 19 examination was delivered on 6 July. Appeals by both sides against aspects of this decision are listed for hearing by the Supreme Court in December. Given the ongoing legal actions, it is not possible to speculate at present as to when these two reports might be completed.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, precludes me and other parties from publishing information relating to section 19 examinations for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on Report Stage of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999, in the House yesterday. However, the results will come into the public domain in due course if prosecutions are taken in the courts against the companies or any other parties on foot of the contents of these reports. Similarly, any subsequent High Court inquiry under section 8 of the 1990 Act would result in publication of the inspector's report on the company concerned. I will not be able to make a decision on the ongoing examinations until I have received and assessed the reports of my authorised officer and any associated legal advice.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste accept that she will be long out of office before any of the inquiries she has been trailing before us for so long are completed? She said that the inquiry in respect of National Irish Bank should be completed next year. How long does it take to carry out this type of inquiry? What supervision is imposed on the inspectors? How can it take so long? In fairness to the institution concerned &ndash; I have no connection with this institution &ndash; when will the inquiry be completed? How many completed reports have been referred to the DPP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns about the length of time it takes to conclude inquiries of this kind. As the Deputy knows, the matters being inquired into were the subject of intensive legal battle in many instances. In the <Col N="328" /> case of Dunnes Stores Ireland and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre), we have not been able to begin, notwithstanding the fact that a decision was made on that issue well over a year ago.</P>
      <P>The inquiry into National Irish Bank was delayed for a similar reason. The inspectors are working full time. A large number of people had to be interviewed and litigation concluded earlier in the year. In the interests of the bank and its staff and in the public interest, it is important that the inquiry is concluded as quickly as possible. The inspectors are officers of the court and it would be improper of me or anyone else to seek to intervene or supervise their work.</P>
      <P>On the number of reports referred to the DPP, the Bula report was referred to the DPP. The Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited report is with the inspectors. I am not sure if any other reports have been completed. The Celtic Helicopters report will be concluded shortly, as will a number of other reports. It is my intention, if warranted, to refer the matters to the DPP. In some cases, there may be scope for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to initiate prosecutions in relation to certain breaches of the Companies Acts. This would be desirable because, until the McCracken report, tax evasion on a fairly substantial basis continued in this jurisdiction, notwithstanding the 1993 amnesty. Such evidence was uncovered by my authorised officers. This evasion did not happen in the dark distant past, it was current up to approximately two years ago. Therefore, it is important to enforce the Companies Acts and the Minister should use his or her power to initiate prosecutions.</P>

      <P>On the question of the five inquiries under section 19, the Tánaiste has replied on a few occasions that the inquiries are almost substantially completed. On the question of whether information regarding the Ansbacher inquiry should come into the public domain, the Tánaiste suggested on a number of occasions that it should. Is it true that in reply to a Priority Question on 24 March the Minister told us the issues are so serious that they should be in the public domain and should not just go to competent authorities. Is it the Minister's intention, when the Companies Amendment (No. 2) Bill is enacted, to use the powers in it to have this matter referred to the Moriarty tribunal? Has she had any request for the information from the Moriarty tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that we have had any request from the Moriarty tribunal. The Flood tribunal has been involved with many Government Departments in getting files relating to events in the past. However, it clearly would be my intention that a report of this kind would be submitted to that type of tribunal. In my experience, most of the information which is sent to the Authorised Officer is also sent to the Moriarty tribunal in so far as it relates to Ansbacher. A year or so ago, I took the view that section <Col N="329" /> 19 reports should be made public. However, the strong legal advice both from the current Attorney General and his predecessor and from every other lawyer I have spoken to was that if we did that we would never get a section 19 report, that the full rigours of the law would have to be applied and everybody would have to have their rights to legal representation and so on. That is the basis of the case being taken by Dunnes and Margaret Heffernan. The whole purpose of the report would be not just to carry out an inquiry but to put the information into the public domain. They argue that that cannot be done under what is a basic preliminary inquiry.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the number of work permits issued to asylum seekers since the Government announcement in July 1999 that refugees who are in Ireland for a particular period of time would be eligible for work permits; the regulations which apply to the granting of these work permits; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Non-nationals who are granted refugee status do not need work permits to work here.</P>
      <P>In so far as asylum seekers who have not received a determination of their applications for refugee status are concerned, the Government decided on 26 July, as an exceptional measure, that those who had been in the country for more than twelve months should be given the right to seek work here and that requests from employers for work permits to employ them would be generally facilitated. This arrangement would also apply to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July as soon as they crossed the 12-month threshold.</P>
      <P>In addition to these conditions the Government also decided that, in order to qualify, such persons must have been complying with their obligations as asylum seekers during the period concerned.</P>
      <P>To date a total of 15 permits have been issued by my Department in respect of qualifying asylum seekers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the regulations and rules attaching to the way in which asylum seekers can get work permits are causing problems? Has she any proposals to change the rules and regulations attached to giving work permits to asylum seekers? The employer has to advertise and go through certain procedures now. Given the fanfare that accompanied this, it is an absolute disgrace that only 15 asylum seekers have been able to get work permits when we <Col N="330" /> know there are jobs out there. Will the Minister change any of the rules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have changed many of the rules, for example, the old rule whereby an employer had to prove that he or she could not get an Irish person to do the job. When matters are brought to my attention, if an employer is prepared to give somebody a job, I accept that in the vast majority of cases it is a genuine fact that they have made every effort. We do not need to go through the kind of procedure we had in the past.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of difficulties. There is much short-term employment available at the moment. Some of the recruitment agencies have been in contact with my Department and with my programme manager with a view to establishing whether we would grant asylum seekers a work permit for, perhaps, a three-month period. The rule in the Department was for a minimum of 13 weeks. I want to change that because clearly the idea of not doing something worthwhile for the sake of a week is not good. In my experience the main problem seems to be in trying to match people seeking asylum with employers, in the first instance, trying to find who they are and where they are. I understand there are at least 2,000 people who qualify to be granted work permits. I hope discussions I had earlier this week with officials and recruitment companies will lead to the establishment of a practical and sensible way of linking people with jobs. Some employers have told me that some asylum seekers are not keen to give details of their names, addresses and so on, but that is probably a minority. There is huge scope to employ, perhaps not 2,000, but certainly a substantial number of those who are currently awaiting the determination of their asylum status.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment her views on the most recent Enterprise Ireland survey in relation to the year 2000 computer problem; the further action, if any, she proposes to take in relation to this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both I and my Department have been actively involved in preparing for the Year 2000 computer problem for more than two years. Following the issue of an initial leaflet and subsequent detailed brochures on the subject, together with a series of regional meetings, it was apparent that further action was required. In the past year, a concerted effort has been under way, with many initiatives undertaken.</P>
      <P>Our Department has spent more than £800,000 on a series of interlinked initiatives. These include the Enterprise Ireland National Y2K Information Service, specifically geared to the needs of small and medium sized companies. The service includes a telephone help line an information pack including a directory of Y2K consultants and service providers and a dedicated web site. In addition, a series of training workshops was organised and the services of the county and city enterprise boards and other development agencies were also brought to bear in helping their client companies.</P>
      <P>To raise maximum interest and encourage action, a very extensive public media campaign was organised. A series of both radio and television advertisements was run which included both national and local radio stations. Outdoor poster sites were also used. Newspaper advertising was undertaken, culminating with full page colour messages in the national dailies. Every opportunity was seized to press home the message that businesses needed to be aware of and to take action to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>As it was considered very important to assess the level of actual compliance on the ground, an integral part of this initiative was the undertaking of quarterly surveys by Enterprise Ireland. The results of the most recent of these surveys were published last month. There are many positive trends from this latest research, including the fact that 94 per cent of Irish companies are either very confident or fairly confident that their businesses will be unaffected by the millennium bug or associated issues. In addition, the number of companies that have undertaken contingency planning has risen from one in ten to three in ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these positive findings, some results of the survey are a cause for concern. Too many companies are over confident that they will be <Col N="332" /> unaffected. In addition, large numbers are still hoping for a software solution, which seems extremely unlikely to materialise.</P>
    <P>In view of these findings, I intend to ensure that the Enterprise Ireland service will continue for the rest of this year and, indeed, into early next year also. In addition, we have been interacting positively with the various organisations represented on the National Year 2000 Committee to ensure that there is direct contact with the maximum number of businesses throughout the country on the importance of the issue. For example, the co-operation of the banks, the insurance industry and accountancy bodies on the committee has facilitated an initiative whereby I wrote directly to every business in the country. More than 300,000 of these letters were distributed by these organisations to their members and clients.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>This process was undertaken since September last when it became apparent that a further effort was required to spur business forward and it has had the effect of helping some businesses to concentrate more fully on the problem. In addition I will continue to avail of any opportunity to highlight the issue. In recent weeks I have participated in radio discussions and have addressed a number of business events on Y2K.</P>
    <P>Ireland's progress has been recognised internationally. Studies by one global observer, have put Ireland in the highest league of compliance achievement, together with Australia, Canada, Holland, the UK and the USA. An international financial grouping rated this country as the first in Europe to achieve the highest rating category across a wide range of sectors.</P>
    <P>As has been stated on many occasions, ultimate responsibility for this issue lies with individual businesses and it is they who must ensure that their operations can continue without interruption after the new year. This Government has made every effort and expended considerable sums of money to encourage compliance, but it is only individual business managers who can take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>A further survey will be conducted by Enterprise Ireland in December 1999 and I hope that those results will be more encouraging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the Minister of State has done much work, but is it enough? Would he not agree that much more needs to be done, given the comments in the report? The words &ldquo;naivety&rdquo; and &ldquo;over confidence&rdquo; are quite frequently used in that report. Is the Minister of State aware that there has been very limited interaction with suppliers? Would he be prepared to tell us what else he can do between now and the end of the year? How serious an impact will the Y2K problem have on businesses that are not ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue to avail of every opportunity to highlight the issue. The Deputy can rest assured that Enterprise Ireland and all <Col N="333" /> the people involved with the year 2000 committee will do what they can to ensure the message gets across to as many businesses as possible. It is important to realise that Ireland's progress has been recognised internationally. Studies by one global observer have put Ireland in the highest league of compliance achievement, together with Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Holland and the United States of America. An international financial grouping rated this country as the first in Europe to achieve the highest rating category across a range of sectors.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that the large and medium category of businesses will be compliant but we are concerned about the small business sector. It is up to the managers and directors of small companies to ensure they are compliant. We will continue with our aggressive campaign until the end of the year, but we can only do so much. It is a matter for management to ensure they will survive into the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>What impact will the failure of these companies to be compliant have on the economy? Has the Minister any idea how many companies might not be compliant at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the number of companies which are not compliant, but 94 per cent of those surveyed said they were reasonably confident they would be compliant. We visualise that many companies will probably say their hardware and software are obsolete and should be replaced. It is difficult to know how many companies are not compliant. To lose one job or one company would be too much. We run the same risk as other countries, but we have done well internationally. We have left no stone unturned to get the message across. I thank the business organisations and State agencies for their co-operation and support. Everyone, including Members of this House, must get the message across to business people in our constituencies that 1 January is approaching and that it is up to them to ensure they will survive into the new millennium. Otherwise, their businesses will fail and we do not want that to happen.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste</askee>
      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment her views on whether any increase in PRSI contributions acts as a direct addition to the cost of employing skilled people at a time when the economy urgently needs to increase the level of skills available; the initiatives, if any, which will be implemented to address the problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22018/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My starting point in response to the Deputy's question is to urge that we must keep this issue of labour shortages and skills bottlenecks in perspective. The Irish national action plan for employment sets out a compre<Col N="334" /> hensive range of actions aimed at addressing the challenge of mobilising labour supply and ensuring we have the skills and competencies relevant to a modern economy. The thrust of Government policy over recent budgets has been to reduce the overall burden of labour taxes and to reduce the tax wedge. I propose that we continue with this overall strategy.</P>
      <P>This recognises the need to improve the reward from, and attractiveness of, work and in that regard I refer to the initiatives taken in last year's budget in terms of the introduction of tax credits, the removal from the tax net of a person's earnings up to £100 per week, the restructuring downwards of payroll levies and improvements in the operation of family income supplement. I am confident we will see more in the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>What impact will the 20 per cent increase in employers' PRSI in the last budget have on employing skilled people? Is the Minister aware that the social insurance fund has increased by 50 per cent since 1987 and that the Government does not make any contribution to it? Will she consider bringing employers' PRSI back to the 1998 levels of £28,000, particularly as this would help in the employment of skilled people, who are needed in the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right that the fund is in surplus to the tune of £200 million this year. That is because of the huge increase in employment in the economy. The household budget survey, published earlier this year, indicated that for April 1999, as opposed to April 1998, there was an extra 97,000 people at work.</P>
      <P>A number of issues affect the incentive to employ higher skilled or higher paid people, such as the wage levels which must be paid. That is a function of supply and demand. In the IT sector, where there is generally a shortage world-wide, young and inexperienced people can command high salaries. We need to find new and additional ways of encouraging employers to reward workers without necessarily increasing nominal pay substantially so that we remain competitive. I am thinking of profit sharing, gain sharing and employee share options. While these operate at present, we could do more in the tax system to encourage the further use of these mechanisms because they help to keep employees in a company for a longer period of time. There is much concern about mobility in the labour market. Companies which spend a considerable amount of time training new staff often find that in a short time they move on to their competitors for substantially increased wages. Companies need to consider how they can create incentives for people to stay with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the public sector, we must examine other mechanisms, such as efficiency funds. If public servants deliver services more efficiently and use new technology, they should get a share in the improvements which accrue to the State, particularly the financial savings. We are not only <Col N="335" /> talking about private sector incentives but also incentives in the public sector.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of people in training, particularly in specific skills training, from the time the Government took office to the end of next year there will be an extra 10,000 people in various training programmes and education courses. That will help to alleviate some of the skills problems. The fact that so many work permits are being granted and so many people are coming from other EU countries will help to alleviate some of the bottlenecks which have occurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that small business people regard the PAYE allowance as an unjust anomaly because it does not apply to proprietary directors who pay tax under the PAYE system? As regards employing skilled people, an employer is responsible for all taxation. An employee does not look at the gross salary but at the net salary, although a substantial amount of it goes on taxation even when the coffers are overloaded with money. Employers should be given an incentive to employ more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The PAYE allowance has been an issue with the Small Firms Association and others for some time. If it was extended to proprietary directors, it would also have to be extended to farmers and no one would desire that. At a time when the standard rate of corporation tax will be down to 12.5 per cent across all sectors by 2003, the extra break to PAYE workers is only a small one and is justified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group, established by my predecessor, published a discussion document on the newspaper sector in March 1999 and invited comments on its document by 30 April 1999. I asked the group to take account of, and advise me on, how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry dealing with <Col N="336" /> competition issues. These CNI recommendations concern the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers, an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
    <P>This issue forms but one part of the overall and broad ranging work of the review group. In July 1998 the review group published a discussion document on mergers law generally and work continues on its wider consideration of competition policy. In September 1999 the review group published a discussion document on competition law and invited comments by 18 October 1999. When the review group has assimilated and considered all the comments of the public and interested parties, the chairman expects to submit its final report and recommendations to me, covering all these matters, by the end of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken a long time. This group was established by my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton in 1996. I do not know why it has taken so long. It is a pity it has, but I understand the final report is due probably before the end of the year, but if not, probably shortly thereafter. When we receive the final report, we will be in a position to take action and make decisions regarding the main issues of concern to all Deputies on all sides of the House. For the future, the statutory company law group, which will be established on foot of the recommendation in the company law enforcement report, will solve many of the problems which have emerged with review groups and recommendations. The fact that a dedicated group will be appointed on a statutory basis to report every second year will mean that we will be able to continue to update company law more quickly than has been the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The print media is now owned by a small number of players and a large consortium within that owns most of the provincial titles. There is also a merger of print media and local radio ownership. This is an area of considerable concern. People in the print media have large cheque books. Is the Minister aware of the monopoly risk attached to the merger of radio and print media?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am. In the past the issue of cross-media ownership did not arise. However, with modern technology and digital television, it will be crucial that we have appropriate laws relating to the acquisition of market share, not just regarding a single aspect of the media but on a cross-media basis. That is why I look forward to <Col N="337" /> receiving the final report. We have several papers at national level and many at local level and we also have access to foreign newspapers, not to mention local radio. What is important is that there is competition. One of the pillars of democracy is free press and that is important, but we must also ensure there is competition because, as we all know, the press has enormous influence in any society. The press informs, educates and entertains people and it is essential we have competition in so far as possible in the newspaper industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does. The implementation advisory group was established prior to the excellent work done by the Committee of Public Accounts. We have had the benefit of the committee's work in the meantime and we will have its report soon. The group reported in May and its report was subsequently published. The group's membership included people from various Departments, professional bodies, three independent appointees of the Government &ndash; one a nominee of mine, one of the Taoiseach and one of the Minister for Finance. They all came to the conclusion that there is a need for an independent regulator. The Committee on Finance and the Public Service is examining this issue. It could make an important contribution to the debate and I look forward to its recommendations. A previous finance committee of the House recommended the establishment of an independent financial regulator. It is essential that is done.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of institution building or turf wars. What is important is that, as much as we need the powers of the new regulator, the culture must be right. One can have all the powers in the world, but if the culture is one of not taking aggressive action, nothing changes. Various efforts were made during the work of the group, which were well publicised &ndash; everyone is well informed because there are plenty of people to inform Members and the media of the positions of various parties &ndash; to have a single body divided internally, with policy the remit of one wing and regulation the remit of another. However, that did not find favour in certain quarters. We will shortly &ndash; probably not until after the budget &ndash; bring a memorandum to Government so that we can make a decision.</P>

      <P>When the Minister says the regulator ought to be operationally independent, does she mean independent from the Central Bank or that the Central Bank will be the financial regulator, or is it a fudge, somewhere in between? Will we allocate the top three blocks of the Central Bank to supervision and the bottom three to the remaining duties of the bank? I assume the Attorney General is being helpful in the discussions between the two Ministers on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a professional, the Deputy knows the Attorney General does not become involved in policy matters. He simply gives legal advice. He compiled an excellent report in a different capacity. I started out with an open mind about how this should be done. New institutions should never be established just for the <Col N="339" /> sake of it. That is not good. The Central Bank has a huge resource. My concern is whether the culture can change to do the job required. Some of the most successful economies in the world are those with the most aggressive regulation. The Central Bank has important functions relating to prudential supervision and monetary policy supervision and it has a role with the European Central Bank. That will continue. However, it also has a huge body of expertise relating to regulation and so does my Department, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Director of Consumer Affairs and others. It is not satisfactory in a small economy that financial regulation is all over the shop. It needs to be brought together. I have an open mind as to how that should be done. The important point is that we must do the job and the report of the advisory group makes compelling reading.</P>

      <P>At their request, I met the president and chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange on 1 November 1999 arising from the exchange's consultations with investors, listed public companies and other relevant bodies in relation to the disclosure of directors' pay and remuneration in such companies. The exchange <Col N="340" /> proposed to me that individual disclosure be made for two persons, namely for each chief executive and for the highest paid director, excluding the chief executive, while the pay and remuneration of the remaining directors would be disclosed in aggregate form only. I was advised that full disclosure of directors' remuneration could damage the marketing of the exchange if Irish requirements were too far ahead of its competitors.</P>
      <P>It would be true to say that the exchange's views and mine remain divergent. I indicated to its representatives that full disclosure for each named director is a desirable development. It is in the best interests of all the members of a company that the annual reports of Irish registered and listed companies show the remuneration packages paid to individual directors. As previously indicated, I would prefer to see the exchange's rules on disclosure being revised voluntarily rather than being dealt with through legislation. The exchange's representatives undertook to have the matter discussed again at a forthcoming meeting of the board of the exchange and they will be in touch with me after that meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first time I commented on this issue was on 4 March 1999 when I launched the suggested code of practice for the Irish Association of Investment Managers. They recommended that we take on board the confined code on corporate governance which applies in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Having considered their views, I agreed with them. Since then, I have held two discussions with representatives of the stock exchange. I would prefer if the rules on disclosure were obeyed voluntarily, as happens in many other countries. Self-regulation, if it works, is preferable and I am anxious to bring the stock exchange along that route.</P>
      <P>My position has hardened somewhat in light of all the inquiries and I have made that clear to the stock exchange. Disclosure would not adversely affect the exchange, given that it applies in the UK and Northern Ireland. In any event, companies on flotation must give details of individual remuneration packages so I do not believe disclosure would have any adverse effect on flotations. Notwithstanding that, we are a small country and, taking everything into account, all of the shareholders of a public company should be entitled to the fullest possible information on benefit-in-kind, remuneration packages and so on. The only Bill in this area is the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill which was debated in the House yesterday. Legislation will be forthcoming in company law, particularly in regard to the establishment of the new enforcement office.</P>

      <P>Surely, this matter would be very simply dealt with by way of legislation. A simple amendment to the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill would have accommodated this point. I presume the Tánaiste agrees that the stock exchange will not voluntarily change its view on this matter. The suggestion that requiring this type of disclosure in 1999 would have an adverse impact on the exchange is nonsensical.</P>

      <P>I am not certain that the exchange will not change its views. On Monday, its representatives had substantially changed their views since the previous meeting I held with them in June or July. They suggested that the packages of the chief executive and the highest paid director would be disclosed and that was a move in the right direction. Some members of public companies have told me privately that they would like to see the rules on disclosure changed. If the changes do not occur voluntarily, we must seek Government approval to introduce legislation which will allow them to be made legally. That will happen if it is deemed necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to amend section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, to permit the Information Commissioner to disclose confidential company information gathered under sections 19 or 20 of the Act. This matter was discussed at length by the House yesterday during the course of the Report Stage debate on the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999. As I explained then, our experience with the operation of section 19 examinations is that a wide prohibition on disclosure of information, relating to company books and documents is necessary in order that the company and its officers can be assured that the information gathered will have a high degree of protection from public disclosure.</P>
      <P>If that assurance cannot be offered by our Department, the company concerned may well decide to resist the conduct of the examination either through the courts or otherwise. In particular, if a public interest test were to determine whether information were to be disclosed, every company, the subject of examination, would believe or would choose to argue that publication of its affairs would be the inevitable outcome of being subject to a section 19 examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a lack of co-operation by companies and their officers would entirely defeat the process of <Col N="342" /> preliminary examination envisaged in section 19. It would also be counterproductive to the public interest of seeking to uncover corporate malpractice and of applying, in due course, the rigours of the law to those found to be in breach.</P>
    <P>It is already our experience that the secrecy provision in section 21 is not enough to avoid recourse to the courts. Two companies have already gone to great lengths to question, in recent High Court proceedings, our bona fides in regard to compliance with the statutory duties of confidentiality imposed on us by this section. They are also seeking to argue before the Supreme Court that the existing ministerial powers, tight and all as they are, are unconstitutional, because they fail, <i> inter alia</i>, to have proper regard to a company's right to confidentiality and/or privacy. Our Supreme Court defence, which will uphold the value of the confidential preliminary examination would be damaged by accepting any amendment which would permit public disclosure of information relating to a company's affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that it is to entirely misrepresent the Information Commissioner to present him as being required to put this information into the public domain? Is it not the case that the commissioner recommended that matters of privacy or issues of prejudice to investigations should be adjudicated by him? He is not suggesting that information should be automatically released into the public domain, rather, that ultimately he should be charged with deciding whether a case's merits warranted that. Does the Minister accept that the Information Commissioner is an independent office and that the commissioner would only be likely to respond responsibly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that the commissioner holds an independent office and is a man of the utmost integrity, as was his predecessor. We are dealing with serious matters here and one cannot judge the gravity of any investigation until such time as a preliminary investigation is concluded. An adjudication must then be made of what subsequent steps will be taken. From our experience of these inquiries over time, it is our opinion that the structure and system which exists is effective, inexpensive and in the best interests of ensuring the co-operation of the corporate sector in regard to investigations. In view of new legislative proposals which will result in the appointment of a director of corporate enforcement, we believe this is the road to go and that, in order to protect the integrity of the operations which exist, it is preferable to ensure the existence of an inexpensive system of initiating investigations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a normal freedom of information situation. The Information Commissioner has a specific legal brief to inquire into certain matters and to assist with the availability of information to the public at large. We are talking here about internal company investigations which are matters of grave seriousness. The system which exists is an effective one and we are confident that the proposals outlined represent the right way to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider imposing a timescale on preliminary investigations which, I understand, are currently open-ended? Following the inquiry, as assessment could be made in regard to publication. It appears that huge powers are currently available under the Freedom of Information Act. If fraud is found after an initial inquiry into a company, a timescale should be put on the inquiry in the interests of those who are unaware of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wonderful if we could put a timescale on an inquiry. We have to accept the judgment of the authorised officer or the inspector appointed to do a particular job. However, companies vary in size and have different types of operations, accounting systems, procedures and management structures. It is not possible to say an inquiry should be completed in a week, three weeks or three months. It depends on the company, its co-operation, attitude, ethics and so on. At the end of the day, that is what will decide the length of the inquiry. Once an inquiry is initiated, it is vital that it is not concluded until the maximum information is made available to the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 49 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important to establish a sound legal base for the proposed insurance disclosure regulations. The original intention was to make the regulations under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. Legal advice suggested that a comprehensive disclosure regime, as proposed by us, could be vulnerable to constitutional challenge if introduced under the 1980 Act. I was, therefore, obliged to have recourse to enabling provisions in the Insurance Bill, 1999, setting out the principles and policies upon which the disclosure regulations would be based.</P>
      <P>Regulations to introduce greater transparency in the sale of insurance products will be introduced by me as soon as practicable following enactment of the Insurance Bill, 1999, which is due to be published shortly. The Bill contains, <i>inter alia</i>, enabling measures which will allow me to introduce policyholder information requirements at point of sale and on an ongoing basis, in respect of both life and non-life insurance. There are three elements to our proposals: the incorporation of existing policyholder information requirements into primary legislation in respect of life assurance policies and proposals, for legal clarity; the provision of additional policyholder information requirements, including disclosure of commission payments, over and above the minimum EU requirements for life assurance and the provision of additional policyholder information requirements, over and above the minimum EU requirements for non-life insurance.</P>
      <P>Draft regulations to give effect to life insurance disclosure are at an advanced stage of drafting within the Department and have been widely disseminated for comment by interested parties. The precise format cannot be finalised until enactment of the Insurance Bill. Framework proposals in pursuance of greater transparency in non-life insurance, based on the enabling provisions of the Bill, are being prepared by the Department. We will engage in the same extensive and comprehensive consultation process shortly with interested organisations in that regard.</P>
      <P>One of my priorities for the insurance industry market is the development of a competitive and consumer-friendly environment. The maintenance of anti-competitive measures is anathema to progress in the creation of real market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My recent decision to remove section 37 controls on insurance commission levels must be viewed in that context. Essentially, such controls have long outlived their usefulness or effectiveness as a cost control measure. There are indications that non-established insurance companies viewed statutory control on certain insurance commissions as a barrier to trade in this State. Furthermore, the European Union Commission has also been critically examining member states' local &ldquo;general good&rdquo; rules, with a view to weeding out anti-competitive practices or trade barriers. I was also heavily influenced by the decision <Col N="345" /> of the Competition Authority in 1997 to declare as anti-competitive the insurance industry's maximum commissions agreement on life assurance commissions and the decision by the then Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, subsequently, not to introduce section 37 controls on life assurance commission payments.</P>
    <P>Insurance commissions in non-life insurance are no longer a significant cost factor in motor insurance and the Department, through the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the Special Working Group on Personal Injuries, is seeking to address the major cost factors, including the high frequency and cost of claims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify his opinion as regards direct insurers selling insurance directly, brokers and the difficulty which has surfaced recently that charges are being applied initially? I welcome the transparency. I also refer to the opinion that charges should be levied over a certain period. There is a problem as regards brokers and banks selling insurance in that they can incur costs elsewhere in the policy while giving the impression of cheaper costs. That is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I, the Tánaiste and the Department are concerned, we want to ensure a level playing field in the insurance industry. No matter who is selling insurance policies and investment products, they will have to disclose the exact deductions in respect of commission, bonuses and so on. I am not sure I accept the sincerity of a demand that these commissions should be paid over a certain period because the incentive in the insurance market has been front-loading commissions to sell policies and payment immediately to the person who sells that product as soon as the payment takes place. That is the system which has been in place so I do not see how we can agree to a change in that to allow for disclosure. As far as I am concerned, disclosure is just that, and once payment is to be made, those buying the product should know exactly for what they are paying, what they are getting and what the person or organisation selling it is deducting.</P>

If it is true that is constitutionally infirm, why did <Col N="346" /> the Minister proceed with removing the cap which is on commission at the moment? Why not proceed contemporaneously to deal with the cap and the question of proper disclosure of commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are separate matters as far as I am concerned. The removing of the cap is a totally different issue in that the situation from the point of view of the Competition Authority and the EU Commission and our experience was that it was anti-competitive and was not in the interests of the consumer. The legal advice on the disclosure of commission became available to us earlier this year from the Attorney General and, based on that, we proceeded to ensure this was included in the Insurance Bill which will be published shortly. Based on the advice available and the experience and information available to us, we have taken two decisions which, in the long-term and, indeed, in the short-term, as soon as we enact the law, will be in the interests of the consumer.</P>

In terms of the timescale open to the Government as one of the critical partners to any new social contract, when will the Minister be in a position to bring legislation to the House to give effect to the proposals of the high level group on trade union recognition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I see this as an important issue and remind the Deputy that two issues were raised by the trade union movement which it wished to see resolved before the commencement of the next agreement, that we would deal with the minimum wage and the trade union recognition. As the Deputy will be aware, I recalled the high level <Col N="347" /> group in December 1998. We have now reached this stage as regards proposals. The Deputy asked specifically when I envisage the legislation coming into being. Much good work is being done and the heads of the Bill are being drawn up, although there are one or two issues to be resolved. I hope to publish the Bill before the end of the year &ndash; I believe it comprises 20 or 30 sections. My objective is to introduce it before Partnership 2000 expires early next year.</P>

      <P>Is there agreement at this stage between the social partners or does the Minister believe he will have to bring forward legislative proposals which may not necessarily have allegiance of both sides of industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously agreement among the social partners on the basis that the high level group was made up of the social partners. Deputy Rabbitte referred to the level of consultation taking place in our Department and this is an example of where good, intensive consultation has worked under the partnership procedures. That the high level group managed to come up with a framework means there is agreement there, though clearly there are some legislative issues to be resolved. That is the responsibility of our legal advisers and we are awaiting their advice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following task forces, which were set up under my aegis as a result of major company job losses, have completed their work and reported over the past 18 months: the Tullamore Inter-Agency Group after the closure of Atlantic Mills, the Tralee Inter-Agency Group after Klopman, the Clonmel Task Force after Seagate, the Lei<Col N="348" /> trim Enterprise Project Group after Ballinamore Textiles and the Donegal Employment Initiative after the Fruit of the Loom closures.</P>
    <P>In addition to these task forces, the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative, in response to Asahi closure, has submitted an interim report. The AWG South East Task Force, in response to job losses in Dungarvan following the amalgamation of the Avonmore and Waterford Groups, was formed by the Avonmore Waterford Group and included State agencies and other interests. It has also submitted a report on its work. There are also a number of other task forces in operation for areas such as Longford, Mullingar and Laois.</P>
    <P>The task forces addressed a wide range of issues and focused in particular on measures for the attraction of replacement industry, the expansion of existing industry and the provision of re-training for redundant workers and the provision of infrastructure. Follow-up action on the task force reports has been, and is being, pursued by the relevant Government Departments, development agencies, local authorities, the private sector and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Are task forces as effective as they were when they were originally set up some years ago, given that there are so many of them? How beneficial are they in creating jobs? Ballinamore Textiles is in my constituency and I am anxious to see if that task force is responsible for any major benefits to the area which is a major employment black spot. The Tánaiste was at the launch of Western Development Commission in Ballaghaderreen, but can any immediate benefits be seen in any of these reports? There is huge publicity at the launch of these task forces, but each of them should work according to a timescale and produce a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first task force was the one established by Deputy Rabbitte in Tallaght when Packard closed. That is the first one I can remember and it was very successful. A task force gives reassurance to those losing their jobs as it means there will be a concentrated effort to address their needs. Task forces vary in what they do, but generally they seek to provide alternative training, employment opportunities for workers being made redundant and they look at barriers to industrial development in their areas. They put together the various agencies, local authorities and workers' representatives to come up with proposals. It varies and it is easier to get industry into some areas rather than others. There are some areas where this is still very difficult and that is why we have gone for regionalisation. The new regional aid guidelines agreed with the commission last week will allow us to focus grant aid in particular on areas that have not done well. Leitrim has not done well and it is not easy to get industry interested in investing in Leitrim. Much investment in the regions is foreign investment and Irish industry seems to follow the same pattern. Another county that has not done well is Laois. Wexford has the lowest level of participation in third level education in the country, for <Col N="349" /> some reason, so I put together a group at the recommendation of local Deputies to look at the barriers to job creation and industrial development in Wexford.</P>
      <P>Obviously we do not want a plethora of these things. When they have completed their tasks we usually stand them down, as the IDA in particular is a very small agency. Most of these groups are very small, but seeking to service a myriad bodies like task forces is not a good idea for State employees. In any event they fuel false expectations. In the main the task forces that have reported have made very realistic suggestions and I hope many of them can be implemented.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on yesterday's announcement of community initiative funding for Sligo. However, I was disappointed that the south Sligo application for £150,000 in community initiative funding to create a 10,000 square feet workspace was unsuccessful. There is a huge opportunity here to create jobs. Will the Minister reconsider the Ballymote application for community initiative funding, which could create up to 50 jobs in a major black spot in south Sligo? There is no task force in place.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment her views on whether it is satisfactory that inspections have not taken place later than 10 p.m. under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, having regard to the provisions of the Act relating to young people working after this time; the steps, if any, she will take to ensure that workplace inspections take place at all relevant hours; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21997/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In earlier replies this year to similar questions on this issue I detailed the requirements imposed on employers by the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, and how the Act seeks to protect the welfare of &ldquo;children&rdquo;, persons under 16 years of age, and &ldquo;young persons&rdquo;, 17 and 18 year olds. The Act seeks to protect the welfare of young persons in the workplace by requiring employers to keep wages and employment records detailing the hours of work of any such young persons, rest intervals etc. The Act also lays down specific limits as to the hours that can be worked by young persons and prohibits the employment of persons under 18 in late night work.</P>
      <P>The Act is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. Enforcement practice to date has involved carrying out inspections based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Act and as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Act can be detected by close examination of these records. Inspections have taken place during normal office hours as the majority of employers carry on business during these hours. Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur it has been normal practice for a follow-up inspection to be carried out after a suitable lapse of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that all reasonable measures have been, and are still being, taken to enforce the 1996 Act with a view to safeguarding the rights of young persons in the workplace, I am very conscious of the continuing concerns being expressed by various groups in relation to the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons. With these concerns in mind I am <Col N="351" /> pleased to state that arrangements are now being put in place for the immediate involvement of the labour inspectorate in inspections outside of normal working hours.</P>
    <P>As ever I urge anyone with information in relation to breaches of the Act to notify the employment rights division of such breaches. I am confident that all such reported breaches will be dealt with expediently and that every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with this and any other employment rights legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true and I think that is an important point. In my view there are not enough inspectors. There are ten posts in the labour inspectorate and, as I have said before, as part and parcel of the implementation of the minimum wage the Government is committed to increasing that number. That process is at an advanced stage. The plan is to have seven additional posts in place as soon as possible. This is very much tied in with the minimum wage and I very much look forward to it being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will all these inspectors be taken from looking after young people to work on the minimum wage? Will they be working exclusively on the minimum wage?

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I adverted to the very complex nature of the debate on broadcasting and the rapidly transforming technologies that have been emerging in recent years which makes it all the more complex. Last week I had an opportunity as a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science to visit the science museum in San José in the US. In the past 18 months an area on the Internet and emerging technologies was opened there and, as somebody who is not altogether at ease with some of the new technologies, I was quite amazed at how far we have come in such a short period. I was even more amazed at the age of some of the younger children who were there and who seemed totally at ease with the Internet and what appeared to be extremely complicated technologies.</P>
      <P>Earlier I spoke about the innovative video programming and information services which are emerging and which will be fuelled in no small way by the convergence of personal computer and television technologies. It is difficult to know whether we can legislate in this regard. I sympathise with the Minister as there are times I wonder whether another era of technology will have passed us by the time this debate has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the arrival of digital television will bring enormous changes to television broadcasting, most of which will be clearly positive. Obviously there will be much improved sound and vision and the elimination of interference. However, there must also be dangers, and there is no point in us pretending that such dangers do not exist. Until now it has been possible to regulate the broadcaster quite rigidly to ensure certain standards are maintained. I suppose public opinion, in many ways, has had a part in establishing certain standards. However, I think this will no longer be the case. In the new era of broadcasting, regulation will be much more difficult. The new technologies, in particular those emerging on the Internet, will mean that it may not be possible for a single country to prevent undesirable content being viewed by the consumer. Again if one keeps a weather eye on actions which have been taken, even by countries where deregulation is the order of the day, such <Col N="354" /> as the US and countries in mainland Europe, it will be found that communities are worried about the emergence of this phenomenon and the impossibility of regulation, particularly in regard the Internet. I am not in favour of censoring to any great extent, but this is something which will increasingly occupy our attention in time to come.</P>
    <P>Another issue is that in broadcasting terms more often means less, something we have seen in the US and mainland Europe. Although consumers' choice in viewing will be increased enormously, the quality of the material available may not improve and there are real fears that the quality of programming will diminish in the new world of broadcasting. I have heard Deputy Michael Higgins speak on numerous occasions at the Joint Committee on Education and Science when it discussed digital broadcasting about the wholesale buy-up by Murdoch, Fox and others of virtually all that can be bought and the services being programmed into multichannels throughout the world. To say the least, some of the material concerned is not intellectually challenging. The Minister referred to the danger of the dumbing down of TV channels. To some extent we are already seeing a proliferation of TV stations appealing to the lowest common denominator. I worry that the standards of television production and programming might follow the trend which is all too obvious and prevalent throughout that sector.</P>
    <P>Increased competition means that the free marketplace might not be able to serve public needs. One should tread cautiously in the area of deregulation and other areas of commercial life. In this context it is more important than ever that we maintain the high quality of our public broadcasting. The restatement of the role of public service broadcasting in section 24 is very much to be welcomed. RTE has delivered an excellent service to the State for many years. Indeed, I think it would be regarded as one of the best broadcasters of its type in the world. Perhaps we have often taken for granted the role it has played. We may worry or complain sometimes about the &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; approach of Charlie Bird or the slightly frivolous approach of Vincent Browne to issues we might regard as extremely serious, but there is no doubt about the quality of the work produced by RTE in current affairs, drama, comedy and new areas. I compliment RTE in particular on its regional broadcasting service. It is doing a tremendous job and has driven a great amount of change, from which the country has benefited. The competition provided by RTE for local radio stations and <i>vice versa</i> has been all to the good.</P>
    <P>In years to come, RTE will face a more difficult marketplace with hugely increased competition for viewers. This potentially threatens its advertising revenue. However, the new technology also presents an opportunity for RTE, TG4 and TV3. In the digital age, Irish radio and television stations will be available worldwide and that should be seen as an opportunity, given the huge diaspora of Irish people. People in the US, Australia, Canada or closer to home in the UK, France and Germany <Col N="355" /> claiming Irish heritage will surely be a receptive new market for our broadcasters.</P>
    <P>It is now a daily occurrence to hear on the radio about somebody e-mailing Pat Kenny from Germany. When we were in America last week we were able to check<i> The Irish Times</i> website. I also visited Australia in August and met some Irish emigrants who were making use of the new technology to access the GAA scores. In one centre in Melbourne, the people were able to list almost every score in every match that had been played in Ireland the previous Sunday. RTE should see this as an opportunity to secure a broader market. From the advertisers' perspective, it offers the chance to promote products which have an affinity with Irish people wherever they may be through teleshopping and over the Internet. It is an opportunity for everybody. Our interest in broadcasting should have two general goals. First, we must ensure that broadcasting serves our society's educational, cultural and informational needs. Second, we must foster the commercial development of the industry in Ireland. The Bill creates a framework in which the Irish broadcasting and programme making industry can adapt and flourish in the new environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to educational broadcasting, I have always been of the view that RTE made a brave start in this area a number of years ago by establishing educational broadcasting through radio. It was tried on television but it proved extremely expensive and it was more or less dropped. There has been an improvement in the provision of direct programming to schools in recent years but much more can be done. One should also bear in mind the opportunities digitalization will offer. It might offer a school community a chance to set up its own broadcasting station. This can be seen in Ballyfermot senior college and in Coláiste Dhulaigh in Coolock, where much of the media training for the industry is provided.</P>
    <P>When we talk about developing partnerships between schools and communities and between parents and teachers, broadcasting techology should be considered. It could be used to forge closer links between schools, parents and communities. The Government decision last year to invest significantly in information technology in our schools and colleges laid the foundation for working towards keeping us at the cutting edge of e-commerce and electronic information generally. The framework is created by this legislation and we should use it. The film industry, small as it might consider itself, is also given opportunities under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Article 46.1.1 of the Constitution recognises the importance of organs of public opinion such as radio, press and cinema. For the past 40 years, television has been the most powerful organ of public opinion and it has rendered a great service. It has had an enormous impact on society. Who knows what role it will play in the new millen<Col N="356" /> nium? Will a single television station have the same influence over society as RTE had? The viewing public might be split among a multitude of channels and television might be used in a different way. Already, as Deputy McGennis pointed out, children are as likely to play computer games and surf the Internet as watch conventional television programmes. The convergence of the different technologies, however, will blur the lines between these activities. The technology is fast moving and legislators will find it difficult to keep up with it. However, we must try to do so.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in community broadcasting. At present, it is a fledgling part of the broadcasting sector but it is beginning to thrive, particularly community radio. I compliment the Independent Radio and Television Commission on its courageous decision to support small community broadcasters throughout the country. Those stations have given a voice to communities who would not have such access otherwise. They have also provided a focus for discussion and debate in communities and have often galvanised opinion on, for example, telephone masts, environmental matters, racism and women's and travellers' issues. Members have been lobbied by that sector about concerns regarding the definition of a community. I do not pretend to understand the ramifications but they suggest that a community broadcaster should be owned and controlled by the community it serves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that she will put down an amendment to permit the provision of religious broadcasting. Members have been lobbied by interests in that area. I do not suggest that we should support overtly proselytizing stations but in a mature developed democracy we should not be afraid to allow religious broadcasting to thrive alongside other sectors of the broadcasting industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with much of what the Minister said. I welcome, for example, the consensus on the principle of universality in access which led to the choice of DTT as a mechanism for introducing digital technology.</P>
      <P>However, I wish the Minister had used her speech to outline the philosophical and practical background to the changes that are now taking place in broadcasting. Two-thirds of the speech tell us what is in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. That will undoubtedly be valuable but I would have preferred her to recommend that Members read the explanatory memorandum and to have used more of her time to outline her thinking on a number of important matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes taking place in broadcasting are deep and much misconstrued. The tendencies which I consider most important include, for example, convergence in technology which has already been discussed at length &ndash; it is the convergence of telephonic, televisual and personal computer technologies. Other tendencies, however, are dangerous to the public good both <Col N="357" /> nationally and internationally. I am referring to the concentration of media ownership internationally. I recall introducing a Private Members' Bill on behalf of the Labour Party to deal with one aspect of this, cross-ownership of the media. The Minister gave an undertaking that the issues of monopoly, abuse of dominant position and cross &ndash; ownership would be dealt with in this fundamental legislation. That is my recollection from what was said in June 1998 when our Bill was voted down.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not spoken about the consequences of the fragmentation of audiences. Fragmentation of audiences as public service broadcasting gives way to an entirely different form of broadcasting is viewed by the commercial sector as simple segmentation of market sectors, which may be added together. It has, however, other implications, if construed socially. It means the audience is losing that other aspect of universality, universality of coverage in terms of programming.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, referred to the 1980 statement by the BBC working group in which some principles of broadcasting were outlined. They included universality of availability; universality of appeal; provision for minorities; service to the public sphere &ndash; the nation speaking to itself; a commitment to the education of the public; that public broadcasting should be distanced from vested interests, a point to which I have referred; that public broadcasting should be so structured as to encourage competition in programming rather than competition for numbers in audience terms; and the rules of broadcasting should liberate rather than restrict the programme maker.</P>
    <P>A fundamental point about the final principle in that list of principles is that the history of television in Ireland like the history of it in Britain and the history of it in most English speaking countries I have examined reveals one straightforward point &ndash; television as a power medium of communication is at its best when the programme makers are defining the situation, but at its worse when programme providers define the situation. This can be translated into something practical. At present, digital television has taken the route of providing an increased number of channels. In the Irish case, there will be six multiplexes with five channels each working out at 30 channels. This was not the only choice digital television could have taken. The tendencies in the technology were ones that could have improved the quality of the digital picture, but this was abandoned in favour of seizing the opportunity of having more channels. In every place it has been introduced it has created increased capacity in terms of broadcasting, but it has also thrown up an enormous deficiency and shortfall in programming provision.</P>
    <P>I will refer to what is likely to happen in the future. According to a New Zealand survey conducted on air of 23 television systems, the figure 50 keeps cropping up. It costs roughly 50 times <Col N="358" /> more to produce an hour of drama at home than it does to buy it at its cheapest price from any one of the international trash bins controlled by the likes of Rupert Murdoch. That is also the case in relation to an extended documentary or historically grounded current affairs programme or news. With a much greater space to fill and faced with the choice of having to pay 50 times more for a production to fill the slots or buying it much cheaper abroad, unless there is some form of indicative regulation, we will have a lowering of the quality of content. The second principle of universality of programming is very much under attack.</P>
    <P>As a previous Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, many of us advanced defence of public service broadcasting or of ones we inherited that would not have been our choice but were good in their own way. They would adhere to what Raymond Williams referred to as the paternalistic authoritarianism of the Reith principles, which were that broadcasting should inform, educate and entertain. They were good principles that supplied a standard to which Irish broadcasting was able to relate, but that world is under severe attack.</P>
    <P>The restriction on time forces me to come to the nub of the matter in a more crude way than I would have liked. In this legislation we must make a choice as to whether we will come down in favour of enhanced programme-making or whether we will facilitate programme provision. This arises in relation to the question of what is broadcasting and should one regard it as a commodity in the marketplace. The commodification of what happens in broadcasting is the other tendency that is included in the list of the ones that have not been dealt with. It is merely a piece of time to be sold? </P>
    <P>The 1996 figure is interesting in relation to that. Of all the television commodities sold in the world, 75 per cent are sourced in the United States. That is not to say there are not good products in the United States, but why should 75 per cent come from one place that deregulated its television in 1934 and today produces the worse television in the world and having produced it dumps it around the world. For example, in the Czech Republic one can buy an old episode of &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; for $350. Our choice is whether we perceive what is broadcast as a commodity in the marketplace to be ruled by competition norms only or whether we perceive it as an aspect of culture, which has a resonance into the life of the people in terms of their past, the way that they live now or in relation to their imagined future.</P>
    <P>There is public resistance to the crude attempt of the marketplace to destroy the narratives that exist around the world. When all this froth is blown away from the digital revolution, there are only 25 million digital receivers in the world. About 8.5 per cent of the people in Europe have expressed an interest in it and more than two-thirds of the population of Britain have suggested they are not interested in it.  A large confusing <Col N="359" /> technical apparatus has arrived. I am not suggesting we ignore it, but it is being described in terms of its technical properties and the programming side of it is to some extent being neglected.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with a number of issues that are important. I am disappointed the issue of cross-ownership has not been dealt with in the Bill as promised. I am also disappointed parity of representation is not being given, as proposed in my clear focus document under heads of legislation in regard to community interests. The absence of or the apparent disappearance of educational television from the ambitious diagram at the back of my document is also interesting. I consider these areas are very important.</P>
    <P>On a more contentious matter, the role of the infrastructural manager or regulator and the broadcaster appears to be uncertain in the legislation. I was clear in my mind that the technology would always drive the capacity to broadcast faster than any new attempt to form a model of regulation in the new era. It is rather like people who suggested they were able to start a car and release the clutch, but were not quite sure how they should drive. That is precisely what is happening in relation to the hegemony being claimed by the infrastructural people in telecommunications in relation to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The DTT is not an interactive system. If the receiver is to interact, it requires the use of the telephonic. The claim that was always made for cable was that, as an alternative, it lent itself to interactivity, but it is extraordinary that the regulator, the ODTR in relation to telecommunications, has sought opinions on the circumstances in which television licences will be granted. I am willing to be contradicted by the Minister on this, but my understanding of the basic law is that this action is close to being <i>ultra vires</i>. Having regard to the manner in which licences were given to cable companies and others, they were not licensed as broadcasters &ndash; they were licensed to make a provision to carry. If it is decided to turn everyone into a broadcaster, it would open up the system. For example, it would be nonsense to regard talking to consumers before they buy a Teflon frying pan, as broadcasting. There is no real broadcasting anymore. I support the Minister in insisting that a broadcasting regulator who will be responsible to her Department will be established by legislation. The recent advertisement in the newspapers is an incredible intrusion into matters of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>What may be considered legal and constitutional matters also arise. I am not an expert in international broadcasting but I suspect that frequencies allocated to Ireland in the old days of wireless telegraphy were allocated to a State with boundaries and although they were initially allocated for international convenience, on the basis of the law they were allocated to the people. For example, the State holds the public service broadcaster for the people and it and others are administrators of convenience in the space they have <Col N="360" /> been allocated. It is extraordinary that a 40 and 60 per cent share in a transmission system is being discussed when it seems to be legally unstable to suggest a transmission system exists for sale, not to speak of how one puts a value on it. These are important questions but perhaps they can be easily dealt with. Perhaps I am wrong but I do not think I am, given the sources upon which I am relying.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful about whether the transmission system is RTE's to sell &ndash; the Bill puts it cagily, &ldquo;such as is its own and means...&rdquo; which is rather like me selling someone part of a field just in case I own it. The thrust of the broadcasting debate has been its domination by those who are accountable to nobody. One of the great traditions of broadcasting regulation was that one had to announce the principles by which it was regulated. We accept that world is gone and boundaries are not the same. I expected the legislation would have provided a regime for the licensing of satellite broadcasting, which I would have welcomed. The section in the legislation dealing with electronic programme guides seems to be very short. I know that consideration has been given to this. The positioning of indigenous stations in the electronic programme guide and whether they are pre-programmed is important.</P>
    <P>A number of issues arise infernally in this Bill. One would have to be very clever to deal with the issue of an absolute multiplication of product from different sources, but it could be done. This will have to be discussed on Committee Stage. Circumstances have changed since I was Minister when I spoke about the underside of globalisation, commodification and the homogenisation of product. For example, &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; is syndicated all over the world. During the lifetime of this legislation, another matter which will have to be considered is the abuse of the local by the global. Programmes will be purchased internationally, with a local link in. For example, a person from Cahirciveen will speak about how everyone there loves &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; and then someone in Sao Paulo will do the same and so forth. This will be classed as locally broadcast and will be used to attract local advertising. There are different versions of the local at the moment, the community, which is genuinely local, local commercial and now the globalised local. This will not only be used in the crude way I mentioned for introductions to pre-sold programmes but also in relation to different forms of dubbing and accenting which can now be done with technology.</P>
    <P>That represents the destruction of television which brings me to the driving force of the Green Paper produced when I was in office, which I defend. It was very much modelled on the thinking of Raymond Williams's injunction &ldquo;Be the arrow, not the target&rdquo; and centred on the right to communicate, not only a personal right but a community one. It mentioned being able to include a tapestry of programmes from around the world which would be reflective, contentious, provocative and critical. Above all, they would <Col N="361" /> be sourced in the experience of communities and citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister is putting down amendments on Committee Stage. Many amendments will have to be made to this Bill and we should not rush the debate on it. Deputy O'Shea suggested we reserve our position until we hear the Minister's reply to a number of questions. It is fundamental that we hear more about the proposals regarding the transmission system. How can we criticise Rupert Murdoch's disgraceful domination of the international media when he is the sole gatekeeper of the satellite system? Independent television did not queue to create an alternative satellite output. They eventually threw in the towel and lined up in Rupert's queue to use the satellite system. Therefore, are we doing the right thing in agreeing our transmission system is 60 per cent owned by people we do not know?</P>
    <P>This raises a number of other issues. As a positive response to fragmentation, the alternative is to increase the value of community television. However, it not only needs to be recognised but regarded as an equal in relation to the commission. A development fund is also necessary to enable it to come on air. If £500,000 is being given to local radio, which is good, community television also needs to be funded and developed.</P>
    <P>I spent a great deal of time dealing with section 31 of the previous broadcasting legislation. I am interested to know the current position on this. Why not accept the autonomy of the broadcaster and establish the distance between the State and the broadcaster? I also wish to raise a housekeeping matter. I went to Cabinet and sought and obtained Government approval for an increase in the licence fee, after a long time trying, so that public service broadcasting would thrive. In a memo, I asked the Government to clarify one matter so we would not fall into the same trap. The Government approved an increase in the licence fee plus indexation based on a formula agreed between the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance. That indexation has never been implemented. If that was implemented, even at the lowest calculation, it would be equivalent to the shortfall RTE now faces. It is extraordinary that the Cabinet decision was never rescinded, according to the record of the House. This raises the question why RTE has not looked for the money to which it is entitled. The Government said it is not going to do it because someone else put it through. I will return to this and other matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislative initiative by the Minister. It provides a framework for the introduction of digital television services to as much of this country and its population as possible, which is imperative. We live in a changing world. It is no longer distant but accessible with the flick of a remote control. Many Members of the House will remember when they saw their first television programme on a small screen <Col N="362" /> which was tucked away in a corner. The picture was liable to disappear if a lorry passed by. Those bygone days now seem quaint, but for those who witnessed them they were magical. We could see places we never dreamed of visiting ourselves. We were able to share with Neil Armstrong his &ldquo;giant leap for mankind&rdquo;. Then the black and white images were transmitted in colour and our sense of wonder grew. Growing up in Ulster we were more accustomed to watching programmes with better quality reception from UTV or BBC Northern Ireland than we could receive from RTE. As someone who travels regularly throughout the nine counties of Ulster, I constantly hear complaints from people concerning poor reception of the RTE signal. I hope it will be possible in the short-term &ndash; and I do not see why it should not be &ndash; to improve RTE's reception in many counties north of the Border.</P>
      <P>At the opening of Telefís Éireann back in 1961, President de Valera expressed the sentiments of the people when he said that television was a mixed blessing &ndash; capable of doing great good, but also much harm. On balance, though, the good far outweighs the negative aspects. Television may be viewed as lacking in substance, but it can change history. Those epic events in Eastern Europe, whose tenth anniversary is approaching, were brought to us by television. We were able to share the joys of those tearing down the Berlin Wall, one of the greatest symbols of repression ever constructed. The fact is, however, that the wall had been breached and weakened long before 1989 by television. People living in East Berlin had long been able to pick up West German television and taste the freedom it promised.</P>
      <P>The world of television is changing beyond recognition. It is challenging political and geographical boundaries. We are entering a new, digital television age. In the 1960s we were happy with access to one channel. In the 1970s this grew to two or maybe three, depending on where one lived. In the 1980s we were faced with the prospect of a vast range of satellite television channels, but the latest developments promise a vast range of television programmes and channels.</P>
      <P>There is also the possibility of using this new technology to provide a whole range of cultural and educational products, as well as access to the Internet at far greater speeds. This promises to transform our television from the box in the corner &ndash; a source of cheap entertainment with perhaps a bit of news and the odd weather forecast thrown in &ndash; into a valuable communications tool, promising not only one-way but two-way communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of weather forecasts, one of the best examples of radio broadcasting that I have heard for some time was RTE radio's &ldquo;News At One&rdquo; recently, when the eminent news presenter, Seán O'Rourke, questioned the director of news broadcasting diligently and thoroughly. The director admitted that, for once, it was not only politicians who could be accused of U-turns, but <Col N="363" /> that RTE was also capable of making U-turns very quickly in response to public opinion.</P>
    <P>There are still those who are opposed to the idea of digital television, but they are a bit like King Canute who sat on his throne on the beach and commanded the waves to turn back, in vain. We can be latter-day Canutes if we wait until we are drowned, not by the incoming tide but by the waves of progress. Alternatively, we have an opportunity to legislate, as the Minister and the Government are doing, thereby preparing the public and the country's broadcasting structure for this brave new world.</P>
    <P>There are many challenges to be faced, but the legislation sets about dealing with them comprehensively. One of the most pressing challenges is to create structures for the introduction of digital television. How will it be delivered to those who want it, and by whom? The costs involved are quite high and, therefore, some form of joint venture between existing broadcasters and those with greater expertise and know-how in the world of digital television is essential. It is therefore envisaged that digital television in Ireland shall be operated by a company of which RTE, our public service broadcaster and our other broadcasters shall be minority shareholders. This is the best way to ensure that we will enjoy the best of both worlds; all the benefits of the new digital television age while, at the same time, being able to guarantee that digital television is motivated not solely by profit motives but also by the public interest which is something of equal, and probably more important, value to the Government and to our people. Deputy Michael D. Higgins has spoken eloquently about the dangers of one major international corporation having the major shareholding in world television channels.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains many other important features which may be overlooked. Not least of these is the establishment of TG4 on a statutory basis, which is a further indication of the Government's commitment to the Irish language and to the promotion and conservation of our heritage and culture. Hand in hand with concern for the global aspects of broadcasting, the Bill also contains a commitment to local matters. Community based television has long been overlooked but there is no reason, in the age of digital television, this should be the case. A fund to contribute towards the capital costs of community broadcasters is being set up. This is landmark legislation in the history of Irish broadcasting. It will provide the framework for the future planning of RTE's public service programming. We need to maximise employment in this sector by ensuring that Irish television output reflects our cultural identities and values.</P>
    <P>At times, we in the western world may overlook the importance of having a free media. Yesterday the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs received a delegation from Algeria. In the delegation's written submission it outlined how some progress had been made in having a much freer <Col N="364" /> print media in Algeria. When questioned about this, however, members of the delegation said in no uncertain terms that their broadcast media was entirely a weapon and tool of the Government in power and that, in effect, there is no free public broadcasting in Algeria.</P>
    <P>Television has acted for the good in so many areas. The brutality of dictatorial regimes can be demonstrated very clearly to us on our television screens. We think of the horrors of war in Kosovo and East Timor. Such scenes broadcast nightly on our TV screens and throughout the world ensured that the European Union's member states and other Governments, such as that of the United States, had to act &ndash; although perhaps too slowly at times &ndash; to bring some of those atrocities to an end.</P>
    <P>Television coverage also shows the outstanding work that is being carried out in the field of humanitarian aid, including development programmes in the poorest countries. We think of the importance of peace here at home. The troubles in the North, which have lasted almost 30 years, reflected badly on this country as crimes and other heinous deeds were shown on television channels throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Bill prepares us to participate even more in the information society and such participation, by as many people as possible, is important. I am glad the Minister has introduced this legislation. The Independent Radio and Television Commission that was established in 1988 has been very important in ensuring that local communities have their own voice. Local radio has been an important influence in shaping rural policies and will continue to be an important voice in rural development. Although all Members have genuine grounds on which to disagree with and complain about RTE, it is a good public service broadcaster. It has served the country well and has set good standards. It is important to protect the public broadcasting system and the Minister has provided the right balance in the Bill. The application of digital techniques is set to revolutionise broadcasting and prepare it for the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Competition is necessary and good. Following the establishment of local radio, RTE has been more responsive to events in the regions. It has created more programmes with a regional content. However, people in the south of Ulster can legitimately complain that it has not received the attention it deserves from Montrose. I hope the Minister and her officials will convey this concern to the RTE authority and senior management. The areas south and immediately north of the Border need attention. Good work is being undertaken there and they should be given the coverage in terms of positive news they deserve.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the possibility of bad programmes, the contents of which would not be worth broadcasting on any channel. The Minister said the balancing act for her in promoting the new legislation is to try to get the relationship between the social, <Col N="365" /> cultural and democratic dimensions and the technological and economic dimensions right. I am glad the Minister emphasised her determination to ensure that the balance is correct. The Minister also said that in the first place we must ensure as far as possible that all have a guarantee of access to broadcasting services that have a distinctly Irish quality, that reflect Irish values and are relevant regardless of their economic circumstances. This is another important aspect, as other speakers said. It is important that the points outlined by the Minister are implemented and given effect quickly and diligently.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need to ensure that there is a public service broadcaster. In the main, Ireland has been well served by the public broadcasting medium. I am not gung-ho about privatisation. I am a strong supporter of the public sector and we can be proud of our public sector companies which worked in non-profitable areas when no private companies were willing to do so. At a time when, fortunately, the financial base of the country is much stronger than it was in the past, I would be reluctant to go down the road of further privatisation. The public sector and the system of control by the Houses of the Oireachtas, although not in a hands-on or day to day sense, works well. The public and private sector broadcasters can live side by side. The necessary competition is possible with the right balance and in previous legislation introduced by the Minister she ensured that the rights to the All-Ireland final and other major sporting events could not be bought by one multinational channel and made inaccessible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this important matter. The House will recall that I raised the case of Emerald Meats on the Adjournment on 5 November last, almost exactly one year ago. I hope now, in the aftermath of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will take this affair more seriously than on that occasion when the Minister of State gave a reply which failed to deal with any of the serious points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details I set out have been confirmed by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. It involves a tale of how the Exchequer has been ripped off to the extent of millions of pounds by the deliberate action of servants of the State either at political instigation or mere complicity in unlawful collusion with the companies in the beef processing sector which were the intended beneficiaries of the scam. Legal costs of more than £1 million arising from unnecessary and wasteful litigation in which the Department of Agriculture, Food and <Col N="366" /> Rural Development embroiled itself were finally discharged by the State. General damages awarded to the injured party have yet to be assessed but will exceed the amount already paid out for costs by an unknown factor. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development ignored all entreaties to desist and no other agency of the State would agree to intervene. Attempts by some politicians inside and outside Government to terminate the madness were fought off by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the grounds that it was likely to succeed in court.</P>
    <P>The rules in respect of GATT import quotas were changed in 1989 arising from an unrelated court judgment in that the EU Commission took over allocation of the quotas from the Department. The Commission introduced a regulation binding on member states that would give the quotas to the traditional importer, therefore, in Ireland the law dictated that these quotas should go to Emerald Meats. In blatant contravention of the law, the other beef companies, predominantly the Goodman Group, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development officials conspired to knowingly misrepresent the historical position to Brussels. The Department furnished a fictional list of traditional importers to Brussels, described subsequently by Mr. Justice Costello as &ldquo;a travesty of the true position&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department then set about doing down Emerald Meats and asserting the claims of the Goodman companies and others in Brussels, which led to a complaint by the managing director of Emerald Meats to the Garda Síochána in February 1990 that there was &ldquo;a conspiracy to defraud my company of its entitlements under EU and Irish law&rdquo;. To my knowledge no action was taken by the Garda and similar complaints to the Department were ignored. Emerald Meats was left with no alternative but to carry out its threat to sue the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the ensuing years Emerald Meats was comprehensively vindicated on all counts. Mr. Justice Egan's judgment made it clear that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development could not win an appeal. However, the Department carried on regardless. The Supreme Court in March 1997 rejected every one of the Department's legal grounds and ruled that, in addition to specific damages, Emerald Meats was entitled to general damages which have not yet been assessed. The State is occasionally forced into litigation on constitutional and other grounds that sometimes are difficult to explain to the taxpayer. No such grounds exist in this case. This was a case of conspiracy between the Department and certain companies in the beef sector to steal from a rival company. The question is, why?</P>
    <P>It would be serious in any circumstances, but especially grave when the Department involved has already been indicted of an unacceptable, cosy relationship with a dominant group of companies in the sector. This is the same Department whose negligence in supervising the depredations <Col N="367" /> of the same group in another context led to fines of up to £70 million being imposed on the State by the EU. History shows that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has been implicated from the beginning in the favouritism shown to the Goodman companies. At the height of the 1990 controversy with regard to certain Ministers and Goodman International, the then Minister told the House that the Department had written to the companies concerned seeking indemnification with regard to costs. The then secretary of the Department reiterated to the Committee of Public Accounts that necessary steps were being taken to get moneys from the companies involved. Eight years after the first such commitment was given to the House, a spokesman told <i>The Irish Times</i> that no attempt had been made to recover the money from the companies involved. Again, the question is why?</P>
    <P>Why did the Department become wantonly involved in a conspiracy to ruin a small company to the benefit of giant competitors? The Department's Secretary General is on record as saying &ldquo;Did we ever think they would?&rdquo;. Why did the Garda not act on the complaints made to it? Why did the Department persist in wasteful and expensive litigation when it had fabricated documents and lied to Brussels? What was in it for the Department or the officials concerned? Were they acting at the behest of their political masters? Given the heavy cost to the taxpayer, has there ever been an internal investigation of the scandalous handling of the licence application? Has anybody been made accountable?</P>
    <P>This is a scandal that reflects only discredit on a major Department. It reflects the climate of favouritism instigated by Ministers at the time, and since, towards the Goodman Group. It also reflects no credit on the Garda because, if it had acted on complaints made to it, millions of pounds might have been spared this House and the taxpayers. They have already incurred a substantial cost and, facing an unquantifiable bill for general damages, are entitled to answers from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation. The issue of farm safety and, in particular, the safety of children on farms, continues to be of concern both to myself and to the authority.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority has planned 1,000 inspections in the farming and forestry sector in 1999, which is an increase of 200 over the 1998 figure. Particular attention has been paid throughout the year to the promotion of child safety with the assistance of farming organisations, the education authorities and the Garda community liaison service and the authority has emphasised to farmers the need to carry out appropriate risk assessments and to draw up safety statements to cover all hazards on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority has undertaken a number of specific initiatives in relation to child farm safety in 1999. These initiatives include an information campaign on child farm safety which was organ<Col N="370" /> ised by the authority during the 1999 summer season and which targeted both safe work and safe play on farms. The authority, in consultation with relevant interests in the sector, is currently at the final stages of developing a code of practice on the prevention of accidents to children on farms which they hope to have published in the near future. Before the summer holidays the authority, through the Department of Education and Science, communicated with all primary schools urging them to reshow a video, &ldquo;Farming &ndash; a way of life&rdquo;, which was first produced and distributed in 1996. A farm safety handbook was launched by the authority in September 1999 at the National Ploughing Championships. It is a handbook of practical advice and guidance for farmers to enable them to achieve high standards of health and safety during farming operations. A section of the handbook is dedicated to child safety on farms. A very successful children's farm safety competition was also held over each of the three days of the ploughing championships with the aim of raising awareness among children of farming hazards. The authority this year also part-funded a Department of Health and Children promotion at the clinical sciences institute, University College Galway. This involved an evaluated report on the safe tractor driving programme, and the provision of an evaluated farm safety information-activity package for use in primary schools as part of an ongoing agri-sector project. The safe tractor driving training is provided for 14-16 year olds on an ongoing basis designed to develop safety skills in relation to tractor driving.</P>
    <P>In addition to these initiatives the authority's farm safety task force continues to offer guidance to the authority and to spearhead promotion activities. The members of this task force are drawn from the farming community itself, and they work closely with farming organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICA and Teagasc. The Health and Safety Authority also has an extensive range of information material available to anyone seeking advice and guidance and will continue to work closely with all of the major farming organisations in promoting farm safety.</P>
    <P>Finally, both I and the authority will continue to urge all farmers and farm workers to treat their work as a high-risk activity and to be constantly vigilant of both their own health and safety and that of their families and their workers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>In responding on an issue like this, it is always useful to look first at the data. In the first instance female labour force participation in the prime age group 25-44 &ndash; which is also the main child rearing group &ndash; is around 68%, which compares well with the European average of around 63%. Our female labour force participation in the 45-64 age group at around 38% remains a lot lower than the European average. Clearly, child care availability has not been a blockage to increasing female labour force participation, but I accept fully that it has been a constraint and a real problem issue for many working parents. I am aware also of the various reports, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>To address this very important issue in a comprehensive manner the Government established an Interdepartmental Committee on Child Care, under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and that Committee recently submitted its report to Government. The Government is currently examining in detail the findings and recommendations of that report and will be delivering its decisions on same in the near future. In the context of the report, and the overall needs of the labour market, my Department will continue to work with other Departments to ensure the provision of appropriate child care facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department and Enterprise Ireland have had a number of contacts with Boots concerning the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of these contacts the company explained that it had delisted 25 suppliers, the majority of which were distributors, but that the volume of goods purchased from Irish suppliers remained unchanged. The company <Col N="373" /> referred to the fact that £50 million of products are purchased annually by Boots UK from Irish companies. The company stressed that it was committed to growing its business in Ireland and, with the planned opening of two new stores in Waterford and Galway, would have 1,200 employees. Both stores were subsequently opened. The company also indicated that it would continue to work with Enterprise Ireland, in so far as is possible, to ensure Irish companies can compete for business.</P>
    <P>The European Single Market gives the right to any firm within the European Union to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the European Union. This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the Single Market. Once the relevant provisions of competition law and Single Market rules are adhered to, it is open to all companies to source their products anywhere within the EU.</P>

    <P>While levels of intake of apprentices in the various sectors is a matter for individual employers, as indeed, in the first instance is the responsibility for providing for its future skills needs, FÁS, in accordance with the PESP agreement, in collaboration with the social partners, seeks to ensure a satisfactory balance between the supply of and the demand for apprentices and maintains on-going consultations on the issue, in particular, through the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>The expert group on future skill needs was established to examine and make recommendations on this matter and the group will report, in the near future, to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Education and Science. This group is currently examining future skills needs in a number of areas, including construction trades.</P>
    <P>In addition, FÁS has been engaged on a number of actions in relation to labour-skill needs during the current year, and these will be continuing on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 47 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I published the final report of the interdepartmental group on implementation of a national minimum wage on the 22 June 1999. The group set out detailed recommendations for the implementation of the national minimum wage. It recommended that the date for implementation should be 1 April 2000 for all sectors of the economy. Other recommendations concern the definition of working time, pay reference period, reckonable pay, under 18 rate, job entrants and certified training rate, repercussive claims, firms in financial difficulty, uprating mechanism, the interaction with Joint Labour Committees and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The group's final report includes the impact study undertaken for the group by the ESRI. The ESRI study concludes that approximately 163,000 employees will likely benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage set at £4.40 per hour, of whom approximately 80,000 will receive an increase of at least £1 per hour. Over half of these beneficiaries will be women and over 40% will be persons aged under 25.</P>
      <P>The ESRI study estimates that the impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage on the national wage bill will be an increase of 1.6% of total gross earnings, excluding any repercussive effect. This is much lower than the figure of 4% estimated for the National Minimum Wage Commission in its report last year, mainly due to wage growth between 1997 and the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The ESRI impact study highlights the possible increased detrimental effect on the level of employment if the initial rate of the national minimum wage were to be set at above £4.40 per hour. I intend to introduce the national minimum wage from 1 April 2000 at £4.40 per hour and I have no plans to review this proposed initial rate.</P>
      <P>The drafting of the national minimum wage Bill is at an advanced stage. Subject to Government approval I will publish the Bill in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies Perry and Owen to my earlier reply to Priority Question No. 4 in response to Deputy Perry, which indicates the main thrust of the actions being taken to meet our current labour market challenges.</P>
      <P>Employment policies are an important dimension to the development of a dynamic and competitive economy. The employment action plan approved by Government in June of this year sets the strategic framework for the development and implementation of the wide range and mix of policies aimed at promoting employment and enhancing the operation of our labour market. The very positive labour market indicators which were released last month when the Central Statistics Office published their Spring 1999 Quarterly National Household Survey is evidence that current policies are proving effective. Employment has increased by a further 96,000, or 6.5%, on top of a similar increase in the previous year. The labour force increased at a healthy 67,000, or in excess of 4%. Unemployment declined by a further 30,000. These are superb outcomes by any standard.</P>
      <P>The significant and rapid growth in employment which we have recently achieved facilitates enhanced wealth generation. It enables us fund, through the increase in revenue arising from additional numbers at work, the development of our physical and human capital infrastructural requirements, and to provide appropriate additional social services supports to enhance the quality of life of all our citizens.</P>

      <P>Fruit of the Loom informed its workforce and the unions on 28 October 1999 that the company would implement a number of measures to maintain its competitiveness in the marketplace. I regret that <Col N="377" /> these adjustment measures will result in the implementation of 190 redundancies in the fabric, sewing and services departments at Buncrana. These redundancies will take place in January 2000 and reflect the company's plans to align its capacity requirements with its future order book. It is intended that the redundancy terms will be as previously agreed.</P>
      <P>On a more positive note, whereas 65% of the employees in fabric and sewing operations have been engaged on short time working, the company plans a return to full-time working for all remaining employees over the next four weeks.</P>
      <P>Although the business will continue to react to challenges in the marketplace, no further job losses are anticipated during 2000. The effect of these measures is that the company expects that approximately 1,000 jobs will be maintained at the Buncrana plant through next year &ndash; a significant improvement on the company's earlier expectations. The company is committed, moreover, to maintaining, at a minimum, an employment level of 600 jobs at the Buncrana plant until at least the year 2006.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 36, 51 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the problem, it is not possible to give a reliable figure on actual full compliance. The surveys undertaken by Enterprise Ireland and the Small Firms Association confirm that awareness of the year 2000 computer problem is very high and that many companies now have taken steps to pursue the issue. The September 1999 Enterprise Ireland survey shows that 94% of Irish companies are either very confident, or fairly confident that their businesses will be unaffected by the millennium bug or associated issues. In addition, the number of companies who have undertaken contingency planning has risen. However, the survey overall also indicates that companies could be doing more to ensure compliance.</P>
      <P>Our Department has spent over £800,000 on a series of interlinked initiatives. These include the Enterprise Ireland national Y2K information service, specifically geared to the needs of small and medium sized companies. The service includes a telephone helpline, an information pack including a directory of Y2K consultants and service providers and a dedicated website. In addition, a series of training workshops were organised and the services of the county and city enterprise boards and other development agencies were also brought to bear in helping their client companies. A very extensive public media campaign was organised. Several series of radio and television advertisements were run, both on national and local radio stations. Television and newspaper advertising and billboard sites were also used. A recent initiative has been my issuing over 300,000 letters to businesses throughout the country, with the co-operation of the banks, insurance industry and accountancy bodies.</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure the Enterprise Ireland service will continue for the rest of this year and, indeed, into early next year also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated on many occasions, ultimate responsibility for this issue lies with the individual businesses and it is they who must ensure that their operations can continue without interrup<Col N="379" /> tion after the new year. The Government has made every effort and expended considerable sums of money to encourage compliance, but it is only the individual business managers who can take the necessary action.</P>

      <P>The 31 December 1999 will be a special public holiday in Ireland, in recognition of the uniqueness of the millennium celebrations in all of our lifetimes. There are, however, sectors where it may be necessary for employees to attend work on 31 December.</P>
      <P>Workers have minimum statutory rights and entitlements under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, in relation to work on public holidays and these must be fully respected. It is of particular importance, in relation to the occasion in question, that attention should be paid to such matters as maximum hours of work, hours of rest, and night work. Furthermore, the protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 prohibits the employment of 16-17 year olds beyond 10 p.m. as a matter of health and safety.</P>
      <P>In the normal course of industrial relations, arrangements for work on occasions such as the New Years Eve holiday are matters to be addressed through negotiation between employers and employees involved, or their representatives.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate for me to provide detailed guidelines for agreements on pay and conditions for millennium work, other than to encourage the parties concerned to work together in ensuring that 31 December will be a good occasion for everybody.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the survey referred to by the <Col N="380" /> Deputy. This survey was undertaken to assess not only workers' experience of, but their attitude to, national social partnership agreements.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the indication from the study of members of the particular union involved, that the majority of those surveyed view the framing of a new national agreement positively.</P>
      <P>Regarding the extent of partnership in the workplace, there are signs from a number of sources that partnership agreements are increasingly found in Irish workplaces. At a recent conference organised by SIPTU it was stated that 63,000 of that union's membership were covered by an agreement on employee participation. A recent IBEC survey indicated that 44% of the companies surveyed had jointly created partnership initiatives with their unions.</P>
      <P>Modern enterprises face a number of challenges to maintain competitiveness in the rapidly changing global economy. The development of partnership initiatives facilitates the understanding by both employers and employees of these challenges and enables them to work together in a non adversarial manner to meet them.</P>
      <P>The development of partnership at enterprise level is an evolving process. Chapter 9 of Partnership 2000 states &ldquo;The National Framework for Partnership for Competitive Enterprises does not attempt to impose any single structure or model of partnership. There is a need to tailor the approach to fit different employment settings.&rdquo;  Partnership at enterprise level can and should take many forms. It is to be anticipated that the emergence of partnership will occur gradually.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Partnership established under the current national agreement, Partnership 2000, is working to facilitate the establishment of partnership agreements in enterprises, both in the private and public sectors. This work underlines the commitment of the Government and the social partners to the extension of partnership in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement of the closure of the Sealand shared services centre in Cork was a major disappointment for the Government, as well as to the staff in Cork. The closure arose out of the acquisition of Sealand by the Danish Company, Maersk. Maersk operates on the basis of local offices in each country, rather than on the basis of a centralised shared services operation, which was favoured by Sealand. In addition, different computer systems are used by the two companies and the Maersk system will now be adopted. Accordingly, the new owners have decided to <Col N="382" /> close the Cork operation with effect from January next. This does not reflect any negative view of Ireland, indeed the experience that Sealand had in Cork was very positive.</P>
    <P>Although the Government had approved grant- aid by IDA Ireland, no grants had actually been paid to the company.</P>
    <P>The Government, acting through IDA Ireland, is making every effort to find a replacement company to take over Sealand's Cork facility. Maersk is an active participant in this marketing effort. I am hopeful that there will be a positive outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring an equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. In the forthcoming National Development Plan 2000-06 the objective for regional policy will be to achieve balanced regional development in order to reduce the disparities between and within the two regions &ndash; the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region &ndash; and to develop the potential of both to contribute to the greatest possible extent to the continuing prosperity of the country.</P>
      <P>With regard to potential investment from mobile projects, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland introduce companies to locations which have particular strengths or suitable conditions for projects concerned. Every effort is made to persuade companies to consider areas which have the highest need for employment or are having particular problems of industrial restructuring. However, of course the final decision as to where to locate is made by the companies based on their assessment of their business needs.</P>
      <P>With regard to indigenous or domestic enterprises, the question of location is determined by where new businesses are being started or existing ones are expanding. Again, the location is decided by the businesses and the level of activity will to a large extent depend on the entrepreneurial spirit within each region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To encourage a greater regional spread, the agencies avail of a number of policy instruments such as making available, as appropriate, increased grant levels for potential investors in regional locations, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations, with the involvement of the private sector; working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at <Col N="383" /> priority locations for new industrial investment; and working closely with FÁS and local institutes of technology to identify specific skills which are available in the various regions.</P>

      <P>The Government decision to reduce the number of community employment places by 4,500 over a five year period and transfer the resources for 5,000 places to a dedicated social economy programme remains unchanged. Having taken on board the concerns expressed by organisations and individuals regarding the restructuring of the CE programme and to be as equitable and flexible as possible for participants and sponsors my Department has agreed the following implementation guidelines with FÁS:</P>
      <P>The eligibility age for participation in CE to be raised from 21 years to 25 years with effect from 29 October 1999. The following exemptions will apply for persons under 25 years of age: travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants, 18-24 year olds, referred through the Employment Action Plan who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
      <P>Duration of participant breaks between schemes to be increased from six to 12 months with effect from April 2000. Offshore island residents will be exempt from this change. Future participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years with effect from 29 October 1999. An individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account. Offshore island residents will be exempt from this change.</P>
      <P>Eligibility to participate in CE has been extended to qualified adults and widow's-widower's with effect from 15 September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the future of CE, the target average participation on the programme in 1999 is 37,500 and there will be a phased reduction over five years to 28,000. It should be noted that there will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of the new social economy programme and reductions of CE places. I have given a commitment to the social partners that there will be consultations within the P2000 Committee on Labour Market Issues on how best to allocate any medium-term resources freed up by the restructuring of CE to fit the needs of long-term unemployed; and there will be consul<Col N="384" /> tations with the social partners at a central level on the proper funding and provision of essential services currently delivered through CE.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons Monitoring Group made a submission to me at the end of May 1999. The submission proposed certain measures which might be considered to improve the enforcement of the legislation and the operation of the Act. The measures proposed for consideration included an increase in the number of labour inspectors to facilitate more effective implementation of the legislation; an examination of the working hours of inspectors with a view to making them available to work at, unconventional hours and at weekends, when breaches of the young persons legislation are more likely to occur; an obligation on all employers to display the abstract of the Act, which sets out the main provisions of the Act in summary form; an examination of possible measures to encourage young persons who are nervous about seeking the protection of legislation; an examination of the possibility of altering the burden of proof in the Act in relation to a prosecution under the provisions of the Act so that where an inspector has reasonable suspicion that young people are employed, there would then be a statutory duty on the employer to prove otherwise.</P>
      <P>These proposals are being examined by my officials with a view to improving the enforcement of the legislation and thus the operation of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>The latest quarterly national household survey which was published by the Central Statistics Office on 13 October last indicates that the unemployment rate for the south east had declined from 11.3% recorded in the April 1997 labour force survey to 8.4% in the latest quarterly national household survey. This was the second lowest unemployment rate among the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> I have recently completed negotiations with the European Commission on the maximum levels of grant aid which will be permitted at a regional level, with effect from the year 2000. The economic structure of the south east and its problems were specifically recognised during these negotiations. As a result, the level of aid for the south east has been set at the maximum allowed for a Community &ldquo;C&rdquo; region and is higher than regions such as Dublin and the mid east which have benefited comparatively better from recent economic growth.</P>
    <P>In the context of the forthcoming National Development Plan, the Government is finalising the range of public investments which will be made to improve prosperity and regional attractiveness across the country. The Government is very aware that prosperity from recent economic growth has been experienced somewhat unevenly in different regions. The significant infrastructure, human resource, enterprise and social investments planned for the next seven years are designed to rebalance regional growth and employment rates.</P>
    <P>However, it must be emphasised that while the State can provide a catalyst to growth through investments under the National Development Plan, building soundly based regional attractiveness and prosperity very much depends on the local response and use of these investments.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the position the Government will adopt at the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Seattle; if her attention has been drawn in particular to the concerns expressed by Irish development organisations and NGOs regarding the potential impact of the proposed millennium round on developing countries; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is expected that the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, scheduled to be held in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December <Col N="386" /> 1999, will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations in the WTO in 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government, along with our European Union partners, are firmly convinced that a comprehensive trade round, involving a broad range of issues is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes; to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process; to promote equitable growth and development; and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
      <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, has brought about major improvements in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in particular smaller countries. The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to integrate successfully into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by nearly 50% over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the varied concerns of non-governmental organisations with regard to the projected new round and have sought to engage in dialogue with interested parties. On 29 October I met representatives of 19 NGOs specifically to discuss Ireland's position on the new round.  Accompanying me were officials from five Departments to ensure that all aspects of our trade, development and environmental approach could be discussed. The principal concerns expressed related to the impact of trade liberalisation on developing countries, the environment and on animal welfare.</P>
      <P>I noted that in the event of a new round being launched, an ongoing dialogue with civil society would be necessary. I also offered to meet any Irish NGOs present in Seattle to discuss developments there.</P>

      <Col N="389" /> Bula Resources (Holdings) Plc Section 14</P>
    <P>The primary finding of this report, which was published on 22 July 1998 was that Jim Stanley is and was at all times the beneficial owner of MIR Oil Development Limited. and the Bula shares both formerly and currently held by Chamonix Nominees Ltd. in trust for Mir Oil, are and were at all material times beneficially owned by Mr. Jim Stanley. The report was forwarded, <i>inter alia</i>, to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Stock Exchange and the Central Bank. A number of company law breaches were also detected which I am pursuing arising from legal advice.</P>
    <P>Garuda Limited.</P>
    <P>The report of the authorised officer relating to Garuda Limited (T/A Streamline Enterprises) was submitted on 14 December 1998. Relevant extracts of the report were forwarded to the company and to its principal director on 30 December 1998 for comment. Extracts of the report have also been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Faxhill Homes Limited</P>
    <P>On 22 July 1998 I appointed Mr. George Maloney FCCA under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 as authorised officer to examine the books and documents of Faxhill Homes Ltd. The authorised officer reported on 22 December 1998. Relevant extracts of the report were sent to the company, to ascertain whether they wished to make representation on the content. Extracts of the report have also been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In consultation with any legal advisers I am considering the various issues arising from this case.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the authorised officers report on the 26 June 1999 I decided to petition the High Court for the appointment of section 8 inspectors to the company. The petition, which was heard by the court on 22 September 1999, resulted in the appointment of three High Court inspectors to investigate and report on the affairs of the company. These inspectors operate to the mandate of the court and will make such reports as are appropriate in due course.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited</P>
    <P>The High Court decision in the second set of judicial review proceedings by Dunnes Stores Ireland Company, Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Ltd. and Margaret Heffernan against my decision to investigate the companies was delivered on 6 July. The court determined, <i>inter alia</i>, that my decision was properly made. Appeals by both parties of aspects of the decision are listed for hearing by the Supreme Court in December.</P>
    <P>National Irish Bank Limited/National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited</P>
    <P>These inquiries arose following allegations <Col N="390" /> broadcast by RTE in January 1998 that National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited had been involved in the execution of policies to facilitate tax evasion. A departmental official was appointed under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989 to investigate possible breaches of insurance legislation. The authorised officer submitted his report on the 4 June 1998.</P>
    <P>On 30 March 1998 the High Court, on my application, appointed Messrs. John Blayney and Tom Grace, FCA, to investigate and report on the affairs of National Irish Bank Limited. On the 15 June 1998 the High Court appointed Messrs. John Blayney SC and Tom Grace FCA, as inspectors to National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited.</P>
    <P>The inspectors submitted an interim report on National Irish Bank Limited on the 10 June 1998 and on National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited on 11 August 1998. Further interim reports on National Irish Bank Limited/National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited were submitted on 17 December 1998 and 29 July 1999.</P>
    <P>A legal challenge to the inspectors work by certain National Irish Bank managers was determined in the Supreme Court on 21 January 1999, affirming the right of National Irish Bank employees to be protected against self-incrimination in the course of the ongoing investigation. In a further challenge to aspects of this case the High Court on 19 March 1999 ruled against National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited in their application to prevent the inspectors from investigating the bank's compliance with Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT). The court also rejected the bank's claim that it was entitled to copies of all transcripts and documents relating to interviews carried out by the inspectors with staff and customers. The consequence of such legal actions has been to retard the inspectors in their investigation with the result that it will be some time before the inspectors will be ready to submit their final report. The High Court will decide in due course whether and to what extent this report should be published.</P>

      <P>My Department has a major role in the promotion of competition in all areas of the economy and in the past has sought contributions to policy formulation from outside bodies or individuals in order to enable it to further its ongoing policy development. In <Col N="391" /> regard to the health insurance sector, as a new competitor, BUPA entered the market in 1997, my Department decided to ask Moore Mc Dowell and Joe Durkan of the department of economics, UCD, for an objective assessment of the development of the health insurance market since the arrival of a competitor to the VHI. As their opinion was not intended for publication but rather as one contribution to internal departmental competition policy formulation at that time in respect of the health insurance market the issue of publication did not arise.</P>

      <P>Since the announcement of the Government decision of 26 July in relation to asylum seekers a total of 50 applications for work permits in respect of such persons have been received by my Department. To date a total of 15 permits have been issued. The balance have either been withdrawn, refused on grounds of ineligibility or are being examined in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>In so far as the issue of work permits is concerned, my Department deals directly with the employer as it is primarily concerned with filling the job in question. It is not in a position to check out the bona fides, or otherwise, of the person on whose behalf the permit is being sought. That is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has overall responsibility for immigration policy. Clearly, my Department will liaise closely with that Department in relation to those cases arising from the recent Government decision. However, my Department will remain the single point of contact for employers and the work permits will continue to issue to the relevant employer(s) as that is where the positions arise.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions for working without a permit are a matter for the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of the Aliens Acts and my Department does not maintain any statistics on such cases.</P>

      <P>Deloitte and Touche, Consultants, were commissioned by the Department in April 1999 to undertake a review of the job initiative programme with a view to evaluating the programme's effectiveness against its objectives on reaching the end of the first phase of its operation. A final draft of their report has been provided recently to my Department by the consultants and their recommendations are now being evaluated. I expect this process to be completed at an early stage and I will then be consulting with the social partners. All current participants on JI completing their three year term on the programme have received an extension to the end of the year. I am fully conscious of the need to reach early conclusions in the context of removing current uncertainty for participants and managing agents over the future operation of the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In approving the text of the Credit Union Bill in December 1996, the then Government decided that an additional amount of £150,000 per annum in credit union fees should be raised to meet the additional staff costs involved in the implementation of the Act. At the time, annual fee income earned by the Registrar of Friendly Societies amounted to just £28,000, a small fraction of the cost of credit union regulation borne by the State and the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the enactment of the Credit Union Act, 1997, our Department prepared a consultation paper on options for a new credit union fees structure and circulated it for comment to the Registrar, the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and other credit union interests. This paper was based on the <Col N="393" /> premise that annual credit union fee income would have to rise by £150,000.</P>
    <P>Having considered the comments received, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment signed the Credit Union Act, 1997 (Fees) Regulations, 1998 in May 1998. These regulations, which were effective from 1 June 1998, replaced and substantially rationalised many of the different fee values contained in the previous fees regulations which operated from 1 February 1995. In fact, ten of the 20 fee values set out in those regulations were reduced, five remained the same and only five were increased.</P>
    <P>However, the most significant change was in the annual return fee payable by credit unions to the registrar. While this had been a flat fee of £50 per annual return, the new fee amounts to 0.01%. of the total assets of the credit union as specified in its annual return. While I acknowledge that this new structure represents a substantial fee increase for a number of larger credit unions, the new fee is actually more equitable in that it relates the fee payable to the credit unions' asset size and their ability to bear the additional cost.</P>
    <P>I have met the Irish League of Credit Unions on this issue on a number of occasions, but despite enjoying the benefits of the Credit Union Act, the league has never accepted that part of the 1996 Government decision which required the generation of an additional £150,000 in fee income. I fully support the previous Government's decision, as I believe that it is only fair that credit unions, based on their ability to pay, should contribute a reasonable sum to the costs of State supervision of the movement.</P>
    <P>I understand that there may be a belief on the part of some credit unions that the fees outlined in the 1998 regulations have been revoked or suspended. This is not correct; the stipulated fees must be fully paid under the law. I accordingly urge all credit unions to meet their statutory obligations and pay to the registrar the appropriate asset-based fee with their 1999 annual returns, together with any shortfall which may exist from 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> In July 1997, our Department developed a year 2000 plan which identified all of the IT hardware and software in operation within the Department and identified the action necessary to ensure that they are year 2000 compliant. An internal monitoring committee was set up with the remit of overseeing progress on the implementation of the year 2000 compliance plan for the Department and for the agencies that come within the Departments remit.</P>
    <P>The Year 2000 compliance plan for the Department has been fully implemented and all necessary remedial action has been carried out. I am satisfied that our Department is fully prepared to meet any of the issues raised by the millennium bug.</P>
    <P>The agencies that come within the remit of our Department which have already declared themselves year 2000 compliant are: FÁS, Forfás, the Health and Safety Authority, NET and the Crafts Council of Ireland. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the National Standards Authority of Ireland have completed remedial work on their business critical systems. Remedial work on their non-critical systems is almost complete and these agencies expect to have this work finalised by end of November 1999. The Department will continue to monitor closely developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>Additionally, on foot of a Government decision this Department and its agencies have drawn up business continuity and staff cover plans for the millennium changeover period. The objective of these plans is to ensure continuity of critical business processes during and after the millennium changeover period. They describe how each organisation intends to respond to events which may disrupt normal operations by providing a road-map of predetermined actions which will enable resumption of an acceptable level of service at the earliest possible time. The plans are under continuous review in order to keep them abreast of the changing business requirements of the relevant organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor insurance premia are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular <Col N="395" /> risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint. The premia charged and the availability of a quote will reflect any material increase in the risk.</P>
      <P>In the light of normal practice in this regard, I was surprised by the recent press reports concerning some insurance companies declining to quote for business in certain parts of the country. Accordingly, I requested our Department to urgently seek clarification on the issue. The company concerned assured the Department that it was continuing to quote for new business throughout the country but that, from time to time, there may be specific individual cases where a quote may not be forthcoming. In cases of refusals to quote for motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria. I have asked our Department and the Motor Insurance Advisory Board to continue to monitor the situation in the public interest.</P>
      <P>The cost of insurance is primarily related to insurance claims experience. The relatively high cost of insurance for young drivers is directly related to their adverse claims experience as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17-24 year old drivers is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17-24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>The previous Motor Insurance Advisory Board survey of 1993 found that under both comprehensive and non-comprehensive cover, the frequency and cost of claims for the 17-24 age group was significantly higher than in the higher age categories.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key, therefore, to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness amongst all drivers including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns including road safety educational programmes for secondary <Col N="396" /> school students. I have also exhorted our colleague, Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to expedite his Department's examination of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers based on the Ontario model which, I believe, could have a significant impact if introduced here.</P>
    <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The expanded membership of the new board, which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, is broadly representative of all of the interests concerned including road safety and enforcement experts.</P>
    <P>There is clearly no soft option for reducing motor insurance premia for young inexperienced drivers. As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluctant to quote for that risk. As in any other branch of insurance risk, reductions in premia can only be achieved by improved safety standards. In the case of young Irish motorists, the inculcation of safer driving standards and education in driving skills and the early acquisition of a driving licence, is the key to reducing their high accident rate which, in turn, should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>

      <P>The number of investigations which are ongoing in my Department is six. These are being undertaken under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 into the following companies: Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Ltd., Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Co. Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd. and Kentford Securities Limited. The examination under section 19 of the books and documents of a further two companies, Dunnes Stores (ILAC) Limited and Dunnes Stores Ireland Company, has been delayed because of ongoing legal actions.</P>
      <P>Four investigations have been completed into the following companies: Bula Resources (Holdings) plc &ndash; under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990 &ndash; Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Faxhill Homes Limited and Garuda Limited &ndash; all under section 19 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bula report was published on 22 July 1998, and it was forwarded to a number of authorities, including the DPP, the Irish Stock Exchange and <Col N="397" /> the Central Bank for their attention. Some company law breaches were also detected, which following legal advice, I intend to prosecute on a summary basis under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>I received the Garuda report on 14 December 1998 and subsequently referred it to the DPP, the Minister for Finance, certain officers authorised by the Minister for Finance in the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank for their attention. I am not in a position to prosecute any company law offences arising from this report, due to the time restriction of three years imposed in section 240(5) of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>I received the Faxhill report on 22 December 1998 and subsequently forwarded it to the DPP. In consultation with my legal advisers, I am considering whether there are sufficient grounds to mount one or more summary prosecutions for suspected offences under the Companies Acts. I obtained the Ansbacher report on 22 June 1999 and on 22 September I successfully petitioned the High Court for the appointment of inspectors to the company under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. Copies of the report have also been given to a number of parties, including the Minister for Finance, certain officers authorised by the Minister for Finance in the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank for their attention. I will decide, in consultation with my legal advisers, whether any prosecution for Companies Act offences can be undertaken in this case on completion of the inspectors' report. In addition two National Irish Bank inquiries are ongoing under the auspices of the High Court.</P>

      <P>Eligibility to participate in community employment was extended to widows/widowers with effect from 15 September 1999, subject to application of age criteria and of a qualifying period for eligibility as with unemployed persons and lone parents. Previously this category was not eligible in its own right but could access the programme by changing from widow's/widower's pension to unemployment assistance/unemployment benefit or one parent family payment as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that widows/widowers are only recently eligible to participate in CE, statistics will not be available for some time.

      <P>The administration, enforcement and promotion of occupational health and safety legislation is a day-to-day matter for the national authority for occupational safety and ealth, known as the Health and Safety Authority. Statistical information concerning the number of workplace fatalities and injuries is collected by the Health and Safety Authority. The authority's recently launched 1998 annual report shows that there was 22 fatalities in the construction sector in 1998, with seven other fatalities occurring as a result of construction related activities. Information on the number of persons killed or injured in workplace accidents in the first nine months of 1999 is obtainable directly from the authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is, at my request, currently undertaking a review of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and associated legislation, and I expect to receive proposals from the authority before the end of the year on any improvements in the legislation that may be considered necessary, including the <Col N="399" /> provisions relating to safety consultation, safety representation, enforcement and penalty provisions.</P>
    <P>The proper management of workplace health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership. The resourcing of the Health and Safety Authority is not the only determining factor in ensuring proper compliance with occupational health and safety legislation. Inspection is but one element in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, joint responsibility, commitment and participation from all sides is necessary to foster safe work practices at ground level. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work on behalf of the authority in order to make available the necessary resources to enable it to properly carry out its statutory functions. The Government is well aware of the excellent work being done by the authority to both promote greater awareness of health and safety as well as enforce obligations on all in the workplace, and indeed, in all sectors of employment and not just in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>In view of the most recent construction related deaths, I met with the Health and Safety Authority, and also with representatives of both sides of industry to discuss the overall approach to health and safety in the construction sector. Following subsequent detailed discussions between the authority, ICTU and CIF, the Construction Safety Partnership was launched. This represents the true spirit of partnership in that it has been negotiated and will be implemented by those most directly concerned. The Construction Safety Partnership is to produce a construction industry safety plan within three months, which will incorporate the recommendations of both the Forum for the Construction Industry and the authority's construction advisory committee and will include proposals related to consultation and safety representation. I look forward to receiving this plan in due course.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Construction Safety Partnership, a construction site safety representatives pilot programme, has also been launched recently. This pilot programme will benefit directly the participating projects and will also generate an awareness of health and safety amongst all employers and employees, and by presenting a united front the message will go out that a safety representative system can work if there is a willingness on both sides to make it work. I can assure the Deputy that genuine efforts are being made on all fronts by all parties to promote improved health and safety standards in the construction sector and I will continue to offer my support in any way I can to the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The special working group on a personal injuries tribunal, chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley, published its first report in May 1997. In that report the special working group set out two alternative structures for a mediation board for occupational injury claims &ndash; the first to operate within the courts system, and second, an alternative mediation structure to be established, on a greenfield basis, outside the ambit of the courts system and operating initially on a two-year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>A majority of the working group had reservations about the cost effectiveness of a greenfield mediation board and recommended a mediation system to be established within the courts system, having regard to assurances given to it about the rapid pace and scale of the on-going reform of court procedures and elimination of delays.</P>
      <P>In pursuing the special working group's recommendation, our Department has been advised that the question of establishing a claims mediation process within the courts would be a matter to be pursued with the new Courts Services Board, when established.</P>
      <P>The special working group has completed its research into personal injury compensation systems in operation in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and the USA, in the areas of occupational injuries and motor accident injuries.</P>
      <P>The special working group's consideration of the results of this research and its relevance to the possible improvement of the systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland will, of necessity, involve a re-appraisal of the recommendations in its first report for claims mediation system.</P>

      <P>In the first place, I refer the Deputy to my reply of the 4 November 1999 to Priority Question No. 4 in response to Deputy Perry which indicates the main thrust of the actions being taken to meet our current labour market challenges.</P>
      <P>In addition, on the specific question of assisting the unemployed gain access to employment I would refer to the substantial efforts being made under the preventive strategy outlined in the employment action plan. Since commencement of this support regime, over 19,900 unemployed persons have been referred by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to FÁS for supports. Over 12,800 of these referrals were young unemployed, under 25, of whom 76% had left the live register by end-September 1999, with over 60% per cent leaving for positive reasons &ndash; to a job, FÁS training programme or returned to education.</P>
      <P>I have committed in this year's employment action plan to the extension of this programme of supports to all adult unemployed, as they cross nine months of unemployment, by the middle of next year.</P>
      <P>The combination of these preventive actions together with the significant level and scale of interventions available which are targeted at the long-term unemployed to assist in their re-integration into the open labour market, is proving effective. Unemployment has fallen substantially as evidenced by the fall of 30,000 in the numbers unemployed, as shown in the most recent quarterly national household survey release, published by the Central Statistics Office last month. It is most encouraging to note that almost three-quarters of this fall was accounted for by a fall in the numbers long-term unemployed. The overall trend reduction shown in the survey measure is mirrored in the live register in which there was a decline of over 34,000 in the comparable period.</P>

      <P>Where firms had difficult-to-fill vacancies they were asked which was the single type of vacancy most difficult to fill. The most commonly cited occupational group was skilled tradespersons &ndash; 21% &ndash; with clerical &ndash; 11% &ndash; the next most commonly mentioned. This number one ranking for skilled tradespersons applied to both traditional and high-tech manufacturing and to both large and small firms in these sectors. However, in large high-tech manufacturing firms, engineers &ndash; 20% &ndash; managers  &ndash; 15% &ndash;and computer specialists &ndash; 11% &ndash; were also frequently ranked as most difficult-to-fill. Computer specialists were the most difficult to fill for finance/ insurance/business services companies.</P>

      <Col N="404" /> The National Action Plan for Employment 1999 sets out a comprehensive range of actions addressing the challenges in our labour market including, for example, the range of fiscal and structural labour market policies aimed at ensuring an adequate supply of appropriately skilled labour to meet the demands of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed, on an ongoing basis, to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment opportunities throughout the country. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are structured on a regional basis so as to facilitate a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has developed a new 2000+ strategy which has identified three key objectives over the coming years. These involve better regional development, upgrading the quality of jobs delivered and more effective links to influence competitiveness, particularly infrastructure and skills development, both nationally and regionally. IDA Ireland aims to deliver over 50% of all new greenfield projects to the Objective 1 region which compares to 25% at present. Moreover, in order to achieve better regional balance, IDA Ireland will seek to encourage projects from specific sectors to particular regions. This new strategy was approved by me earlier this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, IDA Ireland has an active programme in place targeting existing companies which are experiencing labour shortages to see if they would be willing to locate expansion projects in other locations which need the employment. The agency uses the range of incentives in place to the full in its efforts to achieve this.</P>
      <P>However, it must be recognised that many issues influence the locational decisions of investors and while incentive packages can be influential, it is ultimately the companies themselves that decide on where to locate. Other key factors which influence a company in its decision to locate in a particular area include the availability of a suitable labour force with the required skills, the adequacy of infrastructure in relation to roads, airports and telecommunications facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> The policy of encouraging companies to locate in the regions will be underpinned by the priorities identified, particularly as regards infrastructure and skills, in the national development plan, which will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has the statutory responsibility in relation to the safety of products placed on the market under the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations, 1997, has no immediate plans to consider making a proposal to restrict the sale of these goods until discussions at European Union level, at which Ireland is an active participant, are further developed.</P>
      <P>At the last meeting of the Emergencies Committee of the Product Safety Directive 92/59 on the 14 September last, it was decided that the European Commission would consider all the issues relating to child care articles and toys intended to be placed in the mouth by young children of less than three years of age and made of soft PVC containing certain phthalates. European Commission involvement was considered necessary in view of the lack of a standardised testing approach by individual member states.</P>
      <P>I understand that the European Union's Scientific Committee on Toxicity and Ecotoxicity and the Environment recently issued a report to the European Commission and it is expected that these findings will be discussed at the next meeting of the Emergencies Committee of the Product Safety Directive 92/59 scheduled for December. I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs will be represented at that meeting and will consider whatever action is appropriate in the light of these discussions.</P>

      <P>As mentioned in my reply of 30 June 1998, the Trade Marks Act, 1996, made legislative provision for the ratification of the Madrid Protocol. Ratification will require detailed implementing regulations. Work on these regulations, which involves significant technical and legal considerations, has been undertaken by the intellectual property unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions for the implementation of the protocol have been drafted in consultation with the Attorney General's office and circulated to interested parties for observations. A copy of the draft regulations will be made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the desirability of ratifying the Madrid Protocol at the earliest possible date. It had been hoped to ratify the protocol during 1999 but the administrative facilities to deal with Madrid Protocol applications in the Patents Office have not yet been resolved. This matter is currently being addressed by the Patents Office and by the information technology unit of my Department with a view to the ratification of the Madrid Protocol by Ireland early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty specifically addresses the interests of consumers and the need for a high <Col N="407" /> level of consumer protection through the following commitments: protection of the health, safety and economic interests of consumers, promoting their right to information and education, and enshrining their right to representation.</P>
      <P>These advances are very significant in themselves. In my view, however, the more important breakthrough is that consumer protection requirements must now be taken into account in defining and implementing all other Community policies, such as trade, agriculture, food, environment and commercial policy, each of which in turn impacts on the lives and well-being of consumers.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has drawn up a Consumer Policy Action Plan, 1999-2001, which focuses on a more powerful voice for the consumer throughout the EU, a high level of health and safety for EU consumers, and full respect for the economic interests of EU consumers.</P>
      <P>The action plan was endorsed by the Consumer Affairs Council in April of this year.</P>

      <P>On 25 March 1999 the Government decided &ndash; Government <Col N="410" /> Decision S180/20/10/0217 &ndash; to put in place new organisational arrangements for the management, development and operation of the national employment service function. This involves the assimilation of the Local Employment Service &ndash; LES &ndash;  under FÁS and the establishment of an employment service advisory committee which will have responsibility for advising the FÁS board on all components of the national employment service function, including the LES. Furthermore, the operational management of the LES will be transferred from my Department to FAS, under the direction of the advisory committee and operational management of the LES Subhead will transfer from my Department to FÁS with effect from the year 2000.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the advisory committee will hold its inaugural meeting before the end of this year and that the operational process for bringing the LES service within the ambit of FÁS will also be in train by then.</P>
      <P>In my earlier reply, I referred to the impending transfer to FÁS of certain employment and vocational training services for people with disabilities which are currently administered by the National Rehabilitation Board &ndash; NRB. This transfer of responsibilities is just one part of a wider restructuring of the NRB's services. It has been agreed that all elements of the NRB re-structuring will take place together.</P>
      <P>The transfer of services to FÁS has not yet taken place as there were delays in finalising arrangements for the transfer of some elements of the NRB's other services. I understand that the matters in question have now largely been resolved. The target date for the completion of the transfer of NRB's services to FÁS is now the end of March 2000.</P>
      <P>In a further change to the role and structure of FÁS, in June of this year, 25 personnel transferred from FÁS to Enterprise Ireland to facilitate the delivery of training schemes as part of a comprehensive business development service to Enterprise Ireland's clients.</P>

      <P>Two indicative offers were received in response to the joint sale of 100 per cent of Irish Fertilizer Industries. However both the State and the other shareholder, ICI, were of the view that neither offer presented a sufficiently strong basis for proceeding further with the joint sale process.

      <P>My Department is currently developing proposals in relation to both NET and IFI on the basis that the State will most likely retain its shareholding in IFI, at least in the short-term, until the fertilizer market recovers from current difficult conditions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked for figures for two years and I will provide statistics for the years 1997 and 1998 respectively, with an update on the position so far in 1999. The total number of valid claims processed by my Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, for 1997 and 1998, was 10,822 and 9,941 respectively. The total amount of money paid out from the Social Insurance Fund was £16.7 million in 1997 and £13.9 million in 1998. For the nine month period up to September 1999, the number of valid claims processed was 9,050. Expenditure from the Fund in respect of redundancy was £13.4 million.</P>
      <P>I would like to turn now to the statistics requested under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991. The total number of valid claims processed for 1997 and 1998 by my Department covered 3,209 and 3,481 employees respectively.

      <P>For the nine month period up to September 1999, the number of employees covered by claims processed under these Acts was 3,337 and the total amount paid was £1.73 million. The total number of payments made for each of the years was 479 in 1997; 466 in 1998 and 256 to end September 1999. As payments are made to employer representatives, that is, liquidators, receivers etc. each payment includes groups of employees.</P>

      <P>My Department has a number of measures in place to address the skills needs of the economy.</P>
      <P>FÁS delivers an extensive range of training courses to unemployed people to provide them with the skills they require to take up employment. Training courses for unemployed people are developed by FÁS in consultation with local employers and are regularly reviewed to ensure that the courses are relevant to the needs of the labour market. Over 14,500 people have commenced FÁS industry training courses for the unemployed since the beginning of the year. Placement rates to employment from industry training courses for the unemployed are in excess of 70 per cent.</P>
      <P>FÁS also provides training and funding for the apprenticeship system, which meets the economy's requirements for skilled craftspeople. There are some 19,000 apprentices registered with FÁS at present, compared to just under 14,000 at the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of the skills of those who are already in employment is addressed through the training support scheme, which is operated by FÁS and Enterprise Ireland for their respective client companies. The training support scheme provides financial support to firms which wish to update the skills of their workforce through training or retraining. In 1998, the training support scheme assisted over 3,000 firms to train 27,546 people. A sum of £8.8 million is available to FÁS and Enterprise Ireland in 1999 for the training support scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department is providing an additional £9 million in Exchequer funding to industry over the next three years for a pilot enterprise led training networks programme. This initiative will facilitate companies in identifying and addressing their training and human resources development needs on a networked basis.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the importance of meeting the skill needs of the economy, the Government, at the end of 1997, established an expert group on future skills needs to identify in a systematic way the skills requirements of different sectors of the economy and to advise on the actions necessary to meet those needs. The expert group's first report was completed in June 1998 and dealt with the software and electronics sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has responded to the recommendations in the expert group's first report in a number of ways: an additional £3.2 million was allocated to FÁS in my Department's 1999 Estimate to train an extra 730 people in the electronics and software sectors; Enterprise Ireland has established a programme aimed at attracting Irish people abroad back to Ireland to work in the information technology sector and FORFÁS has strengthened its national skills awareness campaign, which is aimed at encouraging second <Col N="413" /> level students to pursue careers in information technology.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures being taken by my Department, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, responded to the recommendations in the first report of the expert group on future skills needs by announcing recently that 5,400 new places will be provided over the next four years in third level education. This extra provision is aimed at addressing skills shortages in the information technology and electronics sectors. The Minister also launched a £250 million education, technology and investment fund in 1997, to meet the short, medium and long-term needs of technology and high growth oriented firms.</P>
    <P>The expert group on future skills needs is currently working on a second report, which will examine skills needs in lower technology and services sectors. I will consider any further measures required by my Department in light of the recommendations of that report when it is completed.</P>

      <P>The treaty also provides that the European Parliament is to be consulted on appointments to the Court of Auditors. The European Parliament, in a resolution of November 1992, has set out the criteria by which it will be mainly guided in adopting its opinion on those nominated for appointment to the Court of Auditors. One of those criteria is that nominees should have high level experience acquired in public finance or in management or management auditing.</P>
      <P>The Parliament also stated in its resolution that, in addition to assessing individual merit, it would ensure that a sensible balance is maintained in the composition of the Court of Auditors as a whole. By way of example, it stated that, while the composition of the court at the time was fairly successful in terms of the varied origin of its members, the lack of female representation was unjustifiable.</P>

      <P>The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, AoA, brought the agricultural sector under a new set of multilateral trade rules and disciplines with regard to market access and reductions in domestic support and subsidies. Under article 20 new negotiations on agriculture must be initiated by 1 January 2000 taking into account <i>inter alia</i> the effect which the agreement has had on developing countries. This review is a key part of the so-called built-in agenda for the millennium trade round.</P>
      <P>With respect to the review of the AoA. the World Trade Organisation Singapore ministerial conference instituted a preparatory process of analysis and information exchange, the AIE process. This process of information exchange provides a forum for WTO members to identify problems in the current Agreement and to discuss ways of solving them in future negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Net food importing developing countries, NFIDCs, have expressed their concerns about the effect of the AoA on their situation, particularly as regards basic cereal import bills. Since both food aid and subsidies declined substantially in the mid-1990s, NFIDCs have faced higher food import bills. Their reliance on food imports means that they are by definition highly vulnerable in such circumstances. These food security concerns were addressed in the WTO Marrakesh agreement which provides mechanisms for periodically monitoring the levels of food aid, the adoption of guidelines to ensure a sufficient level of food aid in full grant form and for full consideration in donors' aid programmes of requests for the provision of technical and financial assistance to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure in least developed countries and net food importing developing countries. While advances have been made on the first two issues <Col N="418" /> greater progress on the question of technical and financial assistance will be an important issue in the future round of negotiations.</P>
    <P>The review of the agreement on agriculture will provide an opportunity to address the concerns of developing countries taking into account the review of the operation of the agreement with regard to food security. The negotiating position on agriculture in the new round approved by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999, provides that the EU will promote special and differential treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries. I welcome the opportunity to deal with this important issue which is of crucial importance to many developing countries. Ireland will be encouraging a sympathetic response to the food security issues identified by developing countries during the forthcoming negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the loss of civilian life in Chechnya and the plight of the refugees fleeing from the conflict zone. Russia has been bombing alleged rebel bases in Chechnya since 5 September, has occupied a security zone covering the northern third of Chechnya, and has crossed the Terek river and encircled the Chechen capital, Grozny.</P>
      <P>An estimated 350,000 Chechen refugees, mostly women and children, have fled the conflict area, mainly to the neighbouring Russian republic of Ingushetia, whose own population numbers only some 340,000, but also to North Ossetia and Dagestan. There have been reports that a similar number of people are displaced within Chechnya. Current concern relates to the Russian sealing of the border with Ingushetia two weeks ago, out of fears that rebel gunmen might enter federal territory. There are reports that up to 50,000 refugees are waiting along roads leading in and out of Chechnya. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, expressed concern over the large numbers massing on the border, with the refugees complaining of bitter cold and food shortages as they waited without shelter. The UNHCR has sent convoys of food supplies, tents and blankets to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union has already decided to channel significant amounts of humanitarian assistance to the region through international organisations such as the UNHCR. The European Union has noted the Russian Government's <Col N="419" /> decision, communicated to the Union on 20 October in Moscow, that an inter-agency needs assessment mission will be allowed to travel to the region. Russia has also agreed to an OSCE observer mission to visit Dagestan and Chechnya before the end of next week to inspect the humanitarian situation, but it remains unclear whether the mission will actually travel to Chechnya or merely to surrounding areas. Prime Minister Putin has acknowledged that a humanitarian crisis has been triggered by the conflict. It is understood that Russia has also begun to transport those refugees who wish to return back to their homes in the Russian-controlled part of Chechnya.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the European Union Presidency, Finnish Foreign Minister Halonen visited Ingushetia on 30 October. In her discussions with Russian federal and local authorities, Foreign Minister Halonen emphasised that those seeking to leave the conflict zone should be allowed to do so and the road to Ingushetia should be opened forthwith. She deplored recent accounts of displaced persons being harassed and attacked as they have attempted to flee the conflict, and stressed that as the Russian government has repeatedly expressed its readiness to accept humanitarian relief operations in the region, it should accordingly remove all obstacles that delay them.</P>
    <P>The security situation, including the threat of kidnapping and killing of aid workers, is seriously hampering humanitarian operations. The virtual absence of humanitarian agencies, as a result, makes it difficult to verify the needs of the vulnerable population. Ireland is awaiting the outcome of the inter-agency assessment mission and is prepared to respond quickly on the basis of information received.</P>
    <P>The evacuation of refugees from a country of first refuge or the immediate region will generally only be considered by the UNHCR as a last resort and has not been proposed in relation to Chechnya. In the case of Kosovo, the evacuation of ethnic Albanian refugees from camps in Macedonia took place under a formal international humanitarian evacuation programme initiated and organised by the UNHCR. As in all such situations, the Government responded to a direct request from the UNHCR. The Government is continuing to monitor closely the situation in Chechnya in co-operation with our EU partners and the international aid agencies.</P>

      <P>As soon as the vetting process is completed, the company will make copies of the schemes available for inspection for 28 days at its main offices. This is a statutory procedure designed to allow for objections to be made to the amending schemes.

      <P>The applicant submitted 56.82 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 52.41 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 4.41 hectares or 8.42 per cent between the area claimed and that determined. Under article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less <Col N="422" /> than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied. Therefore in this case a penalty of 8.82 hectares has to be applied leaving the area determined at 43.59 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 305 on 29 September 1999, the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country and they are enforced by the Garda Síochána. If any person has reason to believe that there has been an act of cruelty against an animal, the matter should be reported to the gardaí for any action which they consider appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of DSPCA concerns relating to penalties under the above-mentioned legislation. In the context of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, the penalties for cruelty under the 1911 Act were increased significantly. The penalties now are: a fine of up to £1,500 and,or six months imprisonment on summary conviction; a fine of up to £10,000 and-or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. This represents a major recasting of the penalties in that there had previously been no provision for conviction on indictment. In addition to the imposition of a fine and-or a term of imprisonment, the court is empowered to deprive an owner who has been convicted of cruelty of any <Col N="423" /> animal in relation to which the offence was committed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the promotion of food, has included venison in its promotional campaigns in recent years. Assistance is provided by Bord Bia by way of support for processors involved in the venison industry through their marketing assistance programme. Venison companies also have access to Bord Bia operated programmes for speciality food companies. During 1997 Bord Bia commissioned a research study on the European market for venison. It has also had continued contact with the Venison Industry Board and is currently examining ways in which it can further assist in the development of the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1997 I also sanctioned an award of substantial grant aid, £80,000, under the INTERREG programme, involving both Exchequer and EU funds, to enable one segment of the venison industry develop a business and market strategy.</P>
      <P>The farmed deer population is estimated to be just under 31,000. There are no requirements by my Department for the registration of deer farmers, for the tagging of deer or for setting standards of deer husbandary other than welfare regulations which cover all farmed animals. The quality controls are those which have been put in place by producer organisations who are now taking steps to put a voluntary scheme of quality assurance in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a brother/sister inherits from another brother/sister and has received no previous gifts or inheritances from any other source since 2 December 1988, a tax free threshold of £25,720 applies. In the case of a child inheriting from a parent, the tax-free threshold of £192,900 applies. Each child in a family is individually entitled to this threshold amount.</P>
      <P>The elderly siblings relief, introduced in 1991 and which I subsequently increased in the 1998 budget, takes account of the special circumstances of elderly brothers and/or sisters who have lived together for a period of five continuous years immediately prior to the inheritance and the recipient must not be beneficially entitled to any interest in any other dwelling house. The effect of this relief means that the value of an inheritance of a share or all of their family home taken from a brother or sister can be reduced by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser, subject to the conditions of the relief being met. A similar relief exists for other close relatives such as nephews or nieces who have been resident with the disponer of the inheritance for a period of ten continuous years. Thus such an individual could inherit a half share in a house, with a market value of just over £257,000, before any inheritance tax would be due.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy, I am aware of the tax burden facing certain individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the family home where they have been residing and I am examining the capital acquisitions tax code in some detail in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The latest forecasted yield for 1999 from inheritance tax alone is about £106 million. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the tax must be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Finally, possible hardship is taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners when determining the terms of payment of capital acquisitions tax. Where the threshold is exceeded, for example, payment by instalment may be arranged, and tax may be postponed in certain cases.</P>

      <P>The provision of health centres in County Cavan is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. Financial support, from my Department for such projects, is given on the basis of available resources, the competing demands on those resources and the priority the relevant health board attaches to the project in question.</P>
      <P>I made £65,000 available for this project towards the end of last year. I have been informed by the board that this money has been expended on the acquisition of a suitable site, the employment of an architect, the preparation of a brief and the completion of tender documents. The board has held successful discussions with local interest groups and this has resulted in the brief being significantly enhanced since the original proposal. It is intended to provide a comprehensive range of health and social services from the centre which will be reflective of the current and future needs of the community and will include community care services, primary care services and sessions provided by visiting hospital consultants.</P>
      <P>The board has also advised me that it is the process of going to tender this week with a closing date of mid-December. It is the board's intention to award a contract by mid-January and to have builders on site shortly thereafter subject to funding being secured. Unfortunately, Cootehill was not high enough on the North-Eastern Health Board's priority list to be considered for capital funding this year. The project is next on the board's priority list and providing that the board's priorities do not change in the meantime, the provision of financial support will be considered next year in the light of available funding.</P>

      <P>The personal assistance service is one of a number of home support services, which includes nursing at home, twilight nursing, the home help <Col N="427" /> service and the home care attendant scheme. The home support services are themselves a part of a range of services provided by health boards to enable people with physical disabilities to achieve the maximum degree of independence. This range of services also includes respite care, day care and therapy services.</P>
      <P>In cases where the personal assistance service is considered unsuitable to the needs or requirements of an individual, a health board may provide other forms of support. The provision of services to any individual with a physical or sensory disability is a matter for the relevant health board which may provide the service itself or through a voluntary agency.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred in detail, in the House, to the publication of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework on Intercountry Adoption Assessment&rdquo;. This report was commissioned in light of the huge increase in demand and resultant lengthy waiting times for assessment being experienced in all of the health board areas.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the report, additional funding was allocated to health boards in respect of inter-country adoption assessment in 1999 on the basis of the waiting lists in December 1998. On this basis the Eastern Health Board received a sum of £213,000 in 1999. The board has advised of its proposals to recruit five additional social workers, some additional clerical support as well as funding towards improved office interview facilities. This will increase the complement of social work staff from nine to 14. These additional social workers are being recruited from an existing panel and appointed directly to the inter-country adoption services in the board. Their appointments have been prioritised in the board and are being processed as a matter of urgency. It should be noted that the waiting times in the board have been exacerbated by difficulties in the recruitment and retention of social workers in this area of work, particularly given the adverse media attention.</P>
      <P>There were 339 couples awaiting assessment at the end of October. Each social worker carrying out assessments carries an ongoing caseload of 12 applications. On average, eight reports are presented to the placement committee per month. In addition to the recruitment of new staff, the board has also taken a number of initiatives to improve the service to applicants for inter country adoption which will assist in reducing both the waiting period for assessment to commence and the assessment process itself. These measures include a maximum of ten hours contact during assessment, interviewing one referee only and the introduction of a feedback mechanism and a quality assurance system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> It should also be noted that the board is in regular contact with various voluntary groups involved in inter-country adoption who have been kept fully informed of the board's response to the report, its proposals for the funding and the position with regard to recruitment of additional staff. Based on the increase in staff assigned to assessment and the introduction of the standardised framework model, it is hoped that there will be a significant improvement in the number of assessments being completed in the Eastern Health Board area during the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The ophthalmology service in the children's hospital, Temple Street is currently led by two consultant ophthalmologists with appropriate support staff. The hospital has recently submitted an application to my Department to structure a third consultant ophthalmologist post.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I am acutely aware of the importance of reducing waiting lists and waiting times, particularly for children. To this end my Department has allocated £150,000 in 1999 to Temple Street Hospital under the waiting list initiative for the provision of treatment to children on waiting lists. There are currently a total of 72 children on the day-care waiting list and 56 on the in-patient waiting list at Temple Street Hospital. Patients are chosen for treatment under the waiting list initiative based on clinical priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had specific inquiries made of the hospital concerning this patient. The Deputy will appreciate that the determination of out-patient appointments is entirely a matter for the hospital <Col N="430" /> authorities in the first instance, based on clinical assessment of need and that consequently, urgent cases receive priority. I have asked the secretary-manager of Temple Street Hospital to investigate the position in this case and, given the particular circumstances, I have requested that he reply to the Deputy directly, as a matter of urgency. However, should the patient's parents feel that her condition has deteriorated, they should return to her general practitioner, who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case to the consultant directly.</P>

Heads of a Bill had been produced in 1996 following a consultative process and were circulated to each of the professional bodies. The responses to this document served to highlight the very real differences of opinion that exist between the professions on how such a registration scheme would operate. My Department has since been examining models of registration in other countries and expects to be in contact with the professional bodies again early next year with new proposals which will attempt to address these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have been in contact with the Irish Society for Chartered Physiotherapists only last month on the matter of statutory registration.</P>
      <P>Any registration scheme would apply equally to both public and private practitioners, but a registration system for physiotherapists alone is not envisaged.</P>

    </P>
    <P>The following fees are those sanctioned by the Department of Finance for Senior and Junior Counsel to the Flood Tribunal; Junior Counsel fees are in brackets: Brief fee &ndash; £25,000, £16,500; Daily refresher, sitting days &ndash; first 30 days &ndash; £1,450, £950; next 20 days &ndash; £1,400, £925; thereafter &ndash; £1,350, £900. Daily refresher, non-sitting days &ndash; £1,350, £900 per day. Parts of such days to be paid on the basis of an eight hour day at £165 per hour for Senior Counsel and £110 for Junior Counsel.</P>
    <P>The Solicitor to the Tribunal is paid a daily rate of £400 per day. Up to 29 October 1999 the Tribunal had the services of a solicitor seconded from the Chief State Solicitor's Office and whose salary was borne by that office. The legal researcher is paid a daily rate of £350.</P>
    <P>Following a recent request from the Tribunal the daily rates of pay for the solicitor and legal researcher to the tribunal are being reviewed.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure by my Department in relation to the tribunal up to 2 November 1999 was £4,559,319.98. The average daily cost of the tribunal since it was established on 4 November 1997, including weekends, holidays and the initial set up period before the Tribunal commenced work, is therefore £6,262.80, 728 days.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the tribunal cannot be estimated at this stage as this depends on when the tribunal finalises its business and on whether Mr. Justice Flood makes any order with regard to costs of witnesses. Mr. Justice Flood has made no such order to date. Pending any such order, my Department has no information on the legal costs of witnesses.</P>

It is my intention to introduce a community warden service on a pilot basis in a small number of local authorities, possibly two or three, with a mix of urban and rural settings. The pilots will operate for a period of three years commencing in 2000, whereupon they will be evaluated before deciding on wider introduction of the service.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were invited to make submissions to host the pilots and these are currently being considered. Dublin Corporation's submission is among those being considered and selections will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has advised that it disallowed an application for rent supplement from the person concerned as the cost of the accommodation she is sharing is above the maximum rent level set for the area. The person <Col N="434" /> concerned has appealed this decision. The Eastern Health Board Appeals Officer has confirmed that a decision on the appeal will be given by the end of this week.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board report, Securing Retirement Income, on the national pensions policy initiative &ndash; NPPI &ndash; was published in May 1998. At the time of the publication of the report I set out the Government's response in Action on Pensions, a copy of which was furnished to each Deputy at the time. This response welcomed the broad thrust of the proposals and commented on the key recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Government has already announced in July last that it intends to implement one of these key recommendations, namely, that the future costs of social welfare pensions should be partly pre-funded, and the details of this are currently being worked out by a working group, chaired by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 Social Welfare Act, I provided for the board's recommendation to prohibit reductions in occupational pensions already in payment, arising from increases in social welfare pensions.</P>
      <P>In relation to other proposals, working groups are examining key recommendations such as how best to increase occupational pensions coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this, namely, the personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, as well as the simplification of the pensions taxation regime. Other recommendations relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation of occupational pensions are also being examined and developed by the Department with a view to implementation. I will also be considering reports from the board arising from the report in relation to the treatment of pension scheme surpluses, equal treatment, the establishment of a pensions ombudsman and the introduction of a compensation fund. A report on the ombudsman is currently being prepared by the board.</P>
      <P>I propose to give legislative effect to the NPPI report in a comprehensive occupational pensions Bill, which I hope to introduce as early as possible next year.</P>

      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. The health board must also satisfy itself that accommodation is generally available within these limits.</P>
      <P>When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards by the health board.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will pay £25 to all participants who qualify for the VTOS course regardless of the length of time they are unemployed; if consideration will be given to those coming off a FÁS scheme on to a VTOS course in view of the principle that participants should not lose out in benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre, and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>In April of this year, a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced for FÁS participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is, at least 12 months unemployed. This allowance was later approved for eligible VTOS participants. The bonus was introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes. Time spent on FÁS counts towards the qualifying period, six months, in order to be eligible for VTOS. Time spent on community employment schemes counts towards the qualifying period, 12 months in order to be eligible for the training bonus.</P>
      <P>The effect of the incentive in prioritising access for the long-term unemployed would be dissipated if the bonus were applied equally to all participants. In order to ensure a co-ordinated approach, the bonus scheme applies to VTOS from September 1999 on the same basis as in FÁS, and does not cover participants transferring directly from one training programme to another.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for financial assistance under the schemes of third level student support, a person must pursue a full-time undergraduate course, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at an approved third level institution. Part-time courses do not qualify for third level grants.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to extend the third level student support schemes to students pursuing part-time courses must be considered in the light of available financial resources and competing needs in the education sector.</P>
      <P>In the 1997-98 academic year, there were more than 25,000 part-time students at third level. The steering committee on the future development of higher education considered the profile of part-time students in 1996-97 and found that almost 90 per cent of part-time students were in employment. In this context, I would point out that under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, tax relief is available at the standard rate for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses. The candidate to whom the Deputy refers should contact her local tax office regarding her eligibility to benefit from this tax relief.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I have no immediate plans to extend the financial support schemes to part-time students.</P>

      <P>An application to increase the level of resource teaching service available to the school in question is currently being examined by my Department's inspectorate. My Department will be in contact with the school as soon as this examination is completed.</P>
      <P>The last general expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level took place in 1994. The school in question applied for inclusion in the scheme on that occasion but did not rank sufficiently high in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>A subsequent study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. This study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at schools with the greatest concentration of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the study's recommendations, resources which subsequently became available were targeted on schools selected to participate in the breaking the cycle of disadvantage scheme <Col N="441" /> which was introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of any additional initiatives being taken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>It is not the case that students who have specific learning difficulties must sit State examinations without access to special arrangements that recognise their difficulties.</P>
      <P>A range of special arrangements can be granted to candidates with specific learning difficulties. These are for the purpose of ensuring as far as is practicable that a student with a specific learning difficulty is given every chance to demonstrate his-her ability at the examination. Arrangements are granted on a case by case basis depending on the evidence provided in support of the application and include the use of taperecorders, readers and scribes.</P>
      <P>In addition, all examiners who have a difficulty in assessing the material presented by a candidate are under instruction to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This is to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
      <P>Students who are dissatisfied with the arrangements proposed have access to an independent appeals process.</P>
