    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of Dáil under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Theresa Ahearn, O'Sullivan, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, Joe Higgins and Gormley. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I call first on Deputy Ahearn to state the matter of which she has given notice.</P>

      <P>I request that the business of Dáil Éireann be suspended under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the discontinuance, because of lack of funding, of the Vantastic transport for people with disabilities which may result in the loss of employment and educational and training opportunities for more than 300 people with disabilities who are totally dependent on this door to door service; and the lack of action by the Government which, in spite of its stated commitment to the provision of accessible public transport, has failed to provide the necessary funds to allow this vital service to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31, I request that the business of the Dáil be suspended to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance, namely, the serious hardship created for people with disabilities in the Dublin area arising from the suspension of the Vantastic transport scheme, following financial difficulties, especially in light of the continuing transport difficulties faced by people with disabilities as a result of the general unavailability of accessible buses and the shortage of accessible taxis; and the need for financial support from the Government to allow the Vantastic scheme to recommence operations.</P>

        <b>: </b>Under Standing Order 31, I seek the suspension of Dáil business to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance, namely, the need for immediate State funding for the Vantastic project, a crucial transport facility which is critical in enabling people with disabilities and impaired mobility to have freedom of movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 31, I wish to have the business of the House suspended to discuss the following issue of public importance, namely, the current crisis affecting the Vantastic project run by the Centre for Independent Living which, due to lack of funding, has had to cease operation resulting in a hugely detrimental effect on many people with disabilities who depend on the service for their transport needs; and the urgent requirement for the Government to re-establish funding for this worthy project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Bruton's concerns. It would be appropriate for the Minister, before we agree to the proposal for the late sitting, to indicate what the Government is likely to do in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the group last night and had discussions with the Ministers concerned. A means has been found of overcoming the financial difficulties by way of savings in a number of Departments. The group is to present detailed documentation today. That is the reason its members went home last night and did not hold a vigil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They had planned to stay for the night but when agreement was reached they undertook to present detailed documentation today when the matter will be resolved. We are happy with this. The previous Government and the European Regional Development Fund made grants available in 1996. There has not been assistance in the meantime with the result that the group is now in financial difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been in office for two years. It took a demonstration outside Leinster House by disabled people to get it to act. It is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, on her quotation from St. Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians &ndash;&ldquo;For now we see through a glass, darkly&rdquo;&ndash; to justify not dealing with the Sheedy case. It is not sufficient to see through a glass darkly in relation to what happened in the Sheedy case, notwithstanding St. Paul for whom everybody in this House has great admiration.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with the Immigration Bill, 1999, in Select Committee agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. May I explain why? On previous occasions, the Taoiseach has stated quite clearly that the conduct of the affairs of a committee on Committee Stage is a matter for the committee itself, and that this House has no right to interfere in any way. At the behest of the Government we are now purporting to ram through a guillotine motion on a committee that is still deliberating on most important legislation. A 16 page amendment was submitted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is only now being considered. It constitutes an entirely new Bill, two years after this Government took office. It is outrageous that the Government is trying to ram it through in this way. I would like the Minister to respond because we are discussing how the House conducts its business. It is in breach of undertakings previously given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking more than that. Will the Minister indicate in his reply whether the Cabinet considered this matter and why this procedure is now being adopted? Does he not regard it as a most dangerous precedent that undermines the autonomy of committees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation of which the Government proposes to prevent discussion after 9 p.m. concerns human rights. This immigration legislation affects the human rights of people in this country. It is not right that such legislation <Col N="502" /> should be rammed through the Dáil with, apart from the substantive sections, 45 amendments still to be considered, all of which the Government wants closed off by 9 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not acceptable and it is not a proper standard of democracy. It sets an appalling example in regard to Northern Ireland, where we are talking about the need for human rights legislation, that we would put such legislation through this House affecting ethnic minorities without it being properly and carefully discussed, as befits a parliamentary assembly.</P>

      <P>For Deputy Quinn's information, it does not create a precedent. It is the duty of the House to make these decisions. The Whip and the committee have endeavoured, through co-operation, to provide as much time as possible. An extra four hours are being provided today, giving eight hours in total. The work is very important and it is important that the Refugee Act, 1996, is brought into operation. The benefits of that are quite obvious. We need a decision before the recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed that the Minister has used a guillotine to interfere with the work of a committee. The establishment of committees has been one of the achievements of recent Dála and they work well. The Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is proceeding rapidly through the Immigration Bill. It was bad for the Government to limit the time a committee may take to consider a human rights issue. The Government will regret the decision taken this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I believe inadvertently, attempted to suggest to the House that the select committee would have eight hours to debate the Immigration Bill. He is perhaps not aware that the Deputies who will be centrally involved in the debate will also have to attend the House to debate item 36, which deals with the legislation to give unwarranted pensions to two former judges, and item 2, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. The suggestion that the Government is being generous in imposing this guillotine motion and that eight hours of debate is being made available to the committee is untrue. The Minister may not believe a precedent is being created here. However, the permanent officials who advise the Chair will cite this as a precedent and it will be repeatedly invoked as such.</P>

      <P>I raised the following matter on the Order of Business yesterday but the Minister did not know the reply. Perhaps he has had an opportunity to investigate the matter. There is widespread concern that applicants for foreign adoptions are being treated disgracefully by the Eastern Health Board. I understand the Cabinet received a report which it sanctioned for publication almost two weeks ago. It was to be laid before the House. Will the Minister tell the House why the report into the approach taken by health boards to foreign adoption assessments has not been published, when it will be published and whether it will be laid before the House before it goes into recess on Friday? Will he confirm that the report recommends substantial changes to the approach taken by health boards to ensure people who wish to adopt abroad are treated with dignity and commons sense?</P>

      <P>No. 7 on the Order Paper is a raft of Supplementary Estimates. Earlier, the Minister indicated that savings were being found to enable Vantastic to be funded. Obviously, for savings to be found, there must be a virement of money from one Vote to another, which requires a Supplementary Estimate. Which of the Supplementary Estimates for the Departments of Education and Science and Foreign Affairs is being used to fund Vantastic? Unless a Supplementary Estimate is introduced it is my understanding that the Minister's undertakings are not of any value.</P>

Before the House ceases to sit, as the Government wishes, on Friday, we want to be sure that the legal steps have been taken to give effect to the Minister's undertakings. He has not been able to tell us under which Vote this saving has been found or what procedure will be used to allocate the money for Vantastic. Before the House takes No. 7, which is a provision for Supplementary Estimates, it is entitled to know whether that motion is adequate to deal with the Minister's undertakings. The Minister should answer that question and not try to call into question the good faith of any other Member in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 2, to delete &ldquo;£600&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am proposing amendment No. 3 and will oppose amendment No. 4. In amendment No. 4, Deputy Penrose is seeking to put a limit on the levy that could be imposed on lower value animals. I appreciate the point he is making but it would not be possible to calculate precisely the value of every stallion. The value of a stallion is what it fetches at a sale. I have considered the provisions of section 5, however, after the full Committee Stage debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that this section is an enabling provision. No specific or detailed proposals have been put to me as yet. I acknowledge that the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, which first sought such a levy, does not represent all the breeders. The current position represents only a relatively small percentage of the total number of breeders. However, the idea of all breeders contributing to a fund to help promote and develop the thoroughbred horse breeding sector as a whole is a good one. This has worked well on the non-thoroughbred side since the formation of the Irish Horse Board Co-Op in 1993. That co-op now has 7,000 members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure a voluntary levy would work. The thoroughbred industry already has a voluntary sales levy. Many do not pay, and many of the more valuable horses are sold privately or at sales outside Ireland. I have some sympathy for the small breeder, however, whom I am anxious should not be over-burdened. What I have in mind is a small levy at the lower end, say, £25 with up to an additional £500 at the upper end. There would be no question of breeders being forced to become members of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, although a package including free membership could be devised in the context of introducing the levy. The Irish Horseracing Authority, and not the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, will collect the levy and I would have to be satisfied that breeders in general would benefit from the <Col N="524" /> revenue generated. It would be open to small breeders to form a new representative organisation if they did not favour that type of fragmentation. I will be careful to have regard for the interests of small breeders, as I did with the small bookies. I, as much as anyone else in my area, understand and appreciate the position of small breeders and I will ensure they are not over-burdened.</P>
    <P>As this is merely an enabling provision, it would not be possible for me to write any further safeguards into legislation. However, in keeping with the idea of taking proportionately more from those who can afford it, and in view of the desirability to provide in legislation for the longer term, I am proposing to increase the maximum levy to £1,000 per foal because, at the upper end, £1,000 is very little whereas at the lower end, £25 would be considered reasonable. While about 4,000 of the approximate 5,000 own only a small number of mares, I have been given estimates that, based on a typical sliding scale of rates ranging from £25 to £500, about 80 per cent of the total levy income would be funded from the top 20 per cent of breeders.</P>
    <P>The question of the contribution made by stallion owners to the racing industry arose on Second Stage. The EBF fund was established in 1982 essentially to provide a mechanism whereby stallion owners would contribute directly to the prize fund for Irish racing. In 1999, for example, stallion owners will provide £650,000 towards prize money and since the fund was established in 1982, stallion owners have contributed in excess of £9 million through the EBF system on a voluntary basis to increase prize money. The contributions have been calculated on a sliding scale; those who own the more valuable stallions contribute more, and those who own the less valuable animals pay significantly less.</P>
    <P>Under those circumstances, I propose amendment No. 3 and oppose amendment No. 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a good discussion on this matter on Committee Stage in terms of where the levy would fall on thoroughbred foals. On that occasion I pointed out to the Minister that I would be opposed to a levy being imposed on the lower end of the market, on the people who keep one, two or three mares and who, during their lifetime, rarely hit the jackpot. These are the people who stand in the rain for 24 hours at the horse fair in Ballinasloe trying to get a few hundred pounds for their horses. They do not make much money from that, it is simply because of their love of horses. It is important for the industry that there are 3,000 or 4,000 such farmers throughout the country who do their best to upgrade the breed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that the industry wants to get everybody under the one umbrella but there is an enormous difference between the people we are talking about and those at the other end of the scale where the sky is the limit on valuation. Both ends of that scale are <Col N="525" /> important to the industry, and it is fair to say the people at the upper end of the business experience problems also. They might have a great deal of money but they face enormous problems. They give much employment and it is a spin-off industry as such. I would not forget the contribution they make but financially they have always been able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for the fee, even at £25. I realise that is not a great deal of money but some small breeders have told me that once they get into the system, it will be £25 this year, £50 next year and they will be on the merry-go-round after that. I realise the fees have not yet been proposed by the thoroughbred association, but perhaps the Minister could give us a commitment that for a number of years, and particularly for a number of mares, farmers at the lower end of the market will not be levied above the £25. It is important for the Minister to say that.</P>
    <P>We made some progress on Committee Stage and I compliment the Minister on that. When replying, he should indicate where the cut off point will be between the £25 at one end and the £1,000 at the other. Has the Minister given any thought to the scale and to where the break will be? Will it go from £25 to £700 to £1,000? The industry will want to know.</P>
    <P>I do not know if those breeders who are not members of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association want to set up their own group, but there is a huge gulf between these groups. There are 500 to 600 breeders in the ITBA while there are approximately 5,000 to 6,000 breeders who are not in the ITBA. We are the only people who can speak for the breeders who are not in that organisation and I would be grateful if, when the fees are decided and struck, the fee at the lower end of the market is in place for some time so that there will not be a danger of getting breeders into the web, whereupon the fee could be increased dramatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second and Committee Stages I expressed reservations about the mandatory nature of the thoroughbred levy introduced by section 5. It appears that this mandatory levy has been sought by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association to replace the existing voluntary levy. The Minister referred to collection at the point of sale and it is probable that nobody will rush with open arms to pay anything voluntary or discretionary. The amount collected by the voluntary levy reflected the industry's good and bad times. The mandatory levy will be collected at foal registration stage, when the animal is a few months old and will be on a scaled basis, as the Minister said. However the 'ability to pay' principle will not be taken into account, which is where the voluntary nature of the previous sales levy was so important. It is important, as previous speakers said, that the industry is funded in such a way as to help it grow and prosper as a very important national asset, given its ability to earn income, particularly in the export field. However, <Col N="526" /> we are concerned with the situation of the farmer with a few mares, some of whom have bred horses which have become household names. Some winners of Gold Cups and Grand Nationals have been bred by breeders with only four or five mares. That is a once off occurrence, but many on the national hunt scene would be lucky to receive £500 for a foal after hours of waiting at a horse fair. These are the types of people we are worried about.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the levy for these people will be £25, which is fair enough. That will not be the straw that breaks the camel's back, but how long will it remain in place? Is it the thin end of the wedge? Will it be raised to £100 in no time? What is the cut off point? Even £1,000 is nothing to those prepared to pay £100,000 for a stallion's covering fee, as they hope the progeny will be so valuable that the £1,000 will be a mere drop in the ocean. We must ensure that these people continue but the small breeders may well suffer. How will this be graded or introduced so that it does not become a punitive imposition on small farmers with two or three mares, who are not making a living from this?</P>
      <P>There are 6,500 breeders in total, but the ITBA only has 500 to 600 members. The Minister said it would not be mandatory to join the association and this is important, as it is a principle laid down in trade union law if nowhere else. Nevertheless, how will this be operated? Will a foal for which a levy is not paid be able to race when it is of racing age? If its owner is not a member of this association will it be allowed to race? Much thought must be given to this. I appreciate that this is an enabling provision and that the Minister cannot sit down and set out all the steps to be taken in black and white, but legal problems may be caused down the line. Those might not be amenable to the resolution the Minister has in mind, as he wants to ensure the survival of the maximum number of small breeders we have referred to. We are aiming at collecting between £500,000 and £600,000, which is a considerable sum, but if small breeders must pay the levy we must ensure they are getting value for money. Has the Minister given any thought as to how this might operate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I note Deputies' contributions. We want to improve the horse industry at the upper end of the scale and there is no great difficulty on that. To give an idea of my thinking on this, I have increased the amount at the upper end from £600 to £1,000. The covering fees for stallions varies from several hundred pounds to £150,000. The £25 fee would apply to foals from stallions with a nomination fee of £500 and there would be a proportionate scaling up from £25 for such stallions up to the top end of the market and £100,000 stallions. However, a £50 fee for a stallion worth £1000 or £1,500 would be proportionate and would ensure that those with one or two mares are not overly burdened. In relation to the mechanism for making best use of this, it would <Col N="527" /> be the Irish Horseracing Authority and not the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association. The IHA would come to the Minister of the day with a proposal to which the Minister could agree if it was fair and equitable. The ITBA would not have responsibility for the collection or distribution of this levy; it would be a matter for the IHA. The sport horse co-operative has 7,000 members. At the early stages Irish horses were doing well internationally, in show jumping and so on, but they had no passports and nobody knew where they came from. This matter has now improved greatly. All beginnings are a bit tentative, but I think all sides want the approach to be inclusive and not to overburden any sector of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank colleagues on all sides of the House for their interesting and valuable contributions to the debate on all Stages of this Bill. The debate reflects the keen interest in horse and greyhound breeding, rearing and racing. The nature of much of the debate showed clearly the earnest wish on all sides of the House to ensure that our legislation will treat everyone affected by it fairly, proportionately and equitably.</P>
      <P>We do not wish to be too burdensome in the application of taxes and levies and, above all, we wish to ensure that the interests of small farmers and breeders, who represent the cornerstone of many rural communities, are not adversely affected. The charges we are introducing are desirable and are in the overall interest of the industry.</P>
      <P>The main amendments agreed on Committee Stage concern the reduction in the ceiling of the new turnover charges from 5 to 2.5 per cent and the introduction of a three tier scale of rates for the flat rate charges on off-course betting shops, starting with a special low rate of £500. The case for the small bookmaker was made repeatedly during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns expressed about the foal levy. While it is not possible to satisfy these <Col N="529" /> concerns in the Bill, the IHA, when deciding on the levy with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, will do so in the overall interest of breeders. My proposal to increase the maximum levy to £1,000, coupled with the assurances I gave to the House on the terms I will accept before I give my consent under section 5(1) of the Act, should reassure all those concerned.</P>
    <P>The horse and greyhound industries are very important and make a significant contribution to the economy. Approximately 25,000 people are employed in the horse breeding and racing industry and between 5,000 and 10,000 in the greyhound breeding and racing industry. They are important in terms of our tourism and leisure industries, the international image they provide for the country, their role in, and impact on, rural and local community life and their financial contribution to the economy. Both industries have moved forward in a proactive and progressive fashion over the past few years. I thank all those in the private and public sectors who contributed to that progress, particularly the boards of Bord na gCon and the IHA and the staff of those organisations. They have done an outstanding job. Much of their work is done at weekends. People travel the country to work at the totalisator and the various facilities which are provided for Saturday and Sunday meetings. Greyhound meetings are often held in the late evening and people in both industries are required to work unsocial hours.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of the leaders and representatives of various industry organisations, the executives of State and private sector bodies and the chairmen and members of the boards of Bord na gCon and the IHA. They have served in a voluntary capacity during these critical and often trying years.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food and of the parliamentary draftsmans's office, some of whom worked until 4 a.m. to prepare the legislation. Despite this excellent work, controversy has arisen concerning the date of the introduction of the provisions of the Bill. On-course bookmakers say they are aggrieved that while excise duty on off-course betting is being cut from 10 to 5 per cent with effect from 1 July, the reduction in IHA and Bord na gCon on-course levies will not take place until later in July. There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. The reduction in excise duty was given effect in a simple section in the Finance Act which has already passed. The provisions of this Bill needed extensive drafting and careful consideration by the Government and it is now being processed expeditiously in the Oireachtas. The Irish Horseracing Authority cannot prejudge a decision of the Oireachtas. Therefore, no action can be taken until the legislation has passed Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and has been signed by the President.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been enacted I will sign the Commencement Order to bring its provisions <Col N="530" /> into effect for the first date that is practicably and administratively possible. In deference to the people of the west, I hope the provision will be in place in time for the Galway races.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as the two former judges referred to in the Bill give a clear undertaking that they are prepared to make themselves available to answer questions before whatever course of enquiry is recommended by Dáil Éireann in order to establish the full truth of the involvement of both individuals in the Sheedy affair.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>I want to avoid going over much of the ground that has already been covered in the report of the committee, which was debated last night, and in the extensive question and answer session and discussions which have taken place in the House on the Sheedy affair. It is good that we reflect on these events, examine what occurred, consider the difficulties the House has experienced in discovering not simply what happened &ndash; we know what happened &ndash; but why it happened and look to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events surrounding the Sheedy case, the <Col N="531" /> tragic death of a young woman in a driving accident, the resignation of a judge of the Supreme Court and of a judge of the High Court and the subsequent difficulties can only lead to one very specific conclusion, namely, that there is a fundamental democratic and constitutional deficit which the House and the country must address.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has provisions which allow for motions by the House, in very restricted circumstances, to remove or impeach a member of the Judiciary. In this case members of the Judiciary behaved in a manner which undermined public confidence in the administration of justice. Both members duly resigned following publication of the report by the Chief Justice, but for constitutional reasons it is clear that at least one member, the former High Court and Circuit Court judge, Mr. Cyril Kelly, cannot be required to come before a committee of the House to explain why he behaved the way he did. I believe if the House passed a motion establishing a tribunal to investigate the matter we would discover the same constitutional difficulty would impact on the tribunal as impacted on the committee of the House which sought to investigate the issue.</P>
    <P>There are certain principles in the Constitution under the doctrine of separation of powers which are extremely important and fundamental to democratic society. It is right that the Judiciary is independent of Government and that it is largely independent of Parliament, and that decisions made by the Judiciary or decisions which it is called upon to make in cases coming before it cannot be in any way varied, changed or interfered with by the House. However, it is not right that where there is apparent judicial misbehaviour there is no mechanism in place, either constitutionally or legislatively, which ensures that those who behave improperly can be required to explain the reason for their actions. A constitutional amendment is necessary if we are to address this issue. We must put in place either a judicial commission or confirm specific but restricted powers on a committee of the House which facilitates it in carrying out an investigation into why certain conduct took place where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of inappropriate judicial conduct, stated to be such by the Chief Justice. It is essential, of course, in addressing this issue that nothing is done which would allow the House to interfere in any way with judicial decisions properly made.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental constitutional and democratic deficit which we should not ignore. From time to time in the House issues gather great momentum with exchanges taking place across the floor and the media focusing on them for a time. However, we then move to the next agenda and the spotlight focuses on a different issue. This issue is too fundamental and important and should not be lost in the individualisation of what occurred &ndash; we must approach it from a broader perspective. As a very minimum the Government or the Attorney General must for<Col N="532" /> mally request the committee of the House which is reviewing the Constitution to consider how we address this lacuna in our constitutional system so as to ensure that if there is a repetition of the events, or if in future there is a view that a member of the Judiciary has behaved in an inappropriate manner in the context of interfering with the administration of justice, that it could be properly investigated. It is necessary that not only what happened be clarified but that those who behaved inappropriately be required to explain the reasons behind their behaviour.</P>
    <P>In her speech yesterday, the Minister of State said something which is true but unacceptable, namely, that we may never know why these events occurred. In a democratic society where people are accountable for their actions and where the Judiciary is vested with very sacred constitutional obligations, it is not good enough that we will never know why. It is not good enough for the Government to sit back, throw its hands in the air and say we can take this matter no further. The truth of the case may be that we will never know why certain things happened, but we should never again be put in a position where we cannot know the reason behind events of this nature.</P>
    <P>As a practising lawyer, I felt a profound sense of sadness about what occurred. Mr. O'Flaherty graced the Bench of the Supreme Court for many years and made a very valuable contribution to our jurisprudence. I find the behaviour of Mr. Cyril Kelly, who was a member of the Circuit Court and the High Court and who in his work sought greater efficiency in the administration of criminal justice, as a sitting judge on the Bench completely inexplicable. I feel a great deal of sorrow for Michael Quinlan who was an excellent registrar of the Circuit Court, administering the Circuit Court in Dublin. Most Members would not be familiar with him or his work. He substantially reformed the administration of justice by the Circuit Court and sadly he is receiving and will receive no credit for doing so. To some degree he was caught in a judicial vice and it is a great shame he is not being given the opportunity to tell the committee what he said he is willing to tell it. He should be given the opportunity of coming before the committee. That the two former judges will not come before the committee should not exclude Mr. Quinlan from telling his tale and explaining his actions. I think he found himself somewhere between a rock and a hard place whereby he believed a judge of the Supreme Court was seeking certain things to happen. Certainly, Mr. Quinlan made wrong judgments &ndash; there is no doubt about this &ndash; but he should not be censored because others are unwilling to come before the committee. As we know, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty previously volunteered to come before the committee. In the context of the constitutional issue, the former Supreme Court judge, Mr. O'Flaherty, should have had no such difficulty because his behaviour did not relate to anything he did in a judicial <Col N="533" /> capacity. I understand the former High Court judge, Mr. Kelly, finds himself in a different constitutional position, but Mr. Quinlan should be given the opportunity to be heard.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary contrast between the Government's generosity to these two former judges and the speed with which the Government has introduced this legislation when compared to its miserly approach to the disabled. Individuals who undermine public confidence in the administration of justice have not been forced to protest outside this House seeking their pensions. I am not suggesting they should have been put in that position but, just as they should not have been put in that position, why should they get a priority for funding over people confined to wheelchairs who have been forced for two days to protest outside this House to get a miserly sum to facilitate the continuation of a transport system which has worked so well? I do not understand the reason for that. It reflects extraordinarily badly on the Government.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being introduced in haste. It could have been introduced in the autumn. There is a second question, the answer to which I do not understand. Many weeks ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received a report which recommended that the pool of lawyers from whom we can make judicial appointments should be extended. The report recommended that when it comes to making High Court and Supreme Court judicial appointments those eligible for appointment should not be confined to practising barristers of ten or 12 years standing but should extend to solicitors who regularly practise before our superior courts. A two section Bill is required to introduce that amendment to the law but it has not been introduced. I estimate there will be eight new appointments to the Supreme Court and High Court in the next 12 months. The Government should ensure that that legislation comes before this House without further undue delay so that we widen the pool of lawyers from whom we can select these new judges. They should not be confined to members of the Bar library. My suspicion is that the Attorney General's office, which is inhabited solely by members of the Bar library, has a vested interest in delaying the production of that legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am outraged by the terms of the Bill and by the speed with which it is being rushed through this House by means of a guillotine. The basic question is: why is the Government rewarding misbehaviour on the part of judicial personages? It is all very well for the Government to claim that we are in a constitutional <i>cul de sac</i> in seeking explanations from the judges for their inexplicable and unexplained conduct, but there is no bar on the Government answering for its own actions and it has not given us an answer for its actions in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background is simple. These judges have been found by the Chief Justice to have been <Col N="534" /> involved in misbehaviour. The Government wrote letters to the judges advising them that it would propose resolutions for the consideration of the Houses of the Oireachtas for their removal on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report amount to misbehaviour within the meaning of the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice in his report found that the conduct of former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. O'Flatherty, was damaging to the administration of justice. He found that former High Court judge, Mr. Kelly, failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge and compromised the administration of justice. In addition, a departmental report on Mr. Quinlan indicated that he obstructed and misled the Department's investigations.</P>
    <P>My stance on this matter is a fairly basic one. In each case these people are entitled to deferred pensions, pensions to which they have contributed over their years of service which will become applicable in six, 15 and 20 years in the respective cases. Why is the State paying them now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the State giving them extra sums for misbehaviour? Mr. O'Flatherty's pension would have been £26,000 with gratuity when he reached the age of 67 but the State is giving him £40,000 from April last. Mr. Kelly's pension would have been £17,000 in 15 years and yet the State is giving him £30,000 per annum from April last. Mr. Quinlan would have worked until he reached the age of 65 when he would get £11,500. He is being given £15,000 from this year. Why? What is the explanation of the Government for this generosity? To date we have not received that explanation and this House is entitled to it?</P>
      <P>Furthermore we have not received any explanation as to the negotiations which occurred between the representatives of Mr. Kelly and the representatives of the State before he resigned. Why were there negotiations? The Minister's statement mentioned that Mr. Kelly was inquiring about his pension entitlement. A simple inquiry to the Department of Finance by letter or fax could have informed him of his pension entitlement. These inquiries must have involved negotiations for extra pension on the basis that Mr. Kelly would resign. Why did that happen? Why did the law not take its course? Why was the Government so keen to ensure that he resigned rather than that the law would take its course? The only answer to that is that the facts would come out. Why did the Government not want the facts to come out? If there had been impeachment proceedings&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope you will allow me an extra few minutes. Mr. Quinlan, who was a fine solicitor, may return to such practice and I wish him every success in his career. If there are barriers to the former judges returning to practise at the Bar, that is a matter for the Bar Council. It is not a matter for the taxpayer to pay extra pensions in the meantime because they cannot return to the Bar. There are other opportunities open to them. They are both highly qualified. We should not ladle out extra money for the intervening years at the expense of the taxpayer in a situation where these people would not be entitled to pensions for many years to come. An explanation for that has not been given by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have been raised about impeachment procedures and the matter will be looked at <Col N="536" /> by the all-party Oireachtas committee this very day in a draft report on the Judiciary, but that is not the point. The Constitution contains a provision for impeachment and there are precedents in other countries. What happens normally in other countries when impeachment proceedings are threatened is that the people involved resign if they have any conscience about the matter. That is quite a normal practice. In the past 200 years only one impeachment, which was not ended by resignation, proceeded in the UK. In the US 13 federal justices have been impeached since 1776. There is such a provision in the Constitution and there is no reason it did not happened. I accept that the procedures and processes need to be fine tuned but that is not an explanation for paying extra money, by way of pensions, to stop the impeachment procedure. Why did the Government do that? Why has it been so free with taxpayers' money in these cases? We have not heard the full story and difficulties may be experienced in obtaining it from the judges because of constitutional obstacles. The Government is answerable to this House and to the public. What is its explanation of its conduct? Why is this money being paid? Why did negotiations take place and what occurred during those negotiations? Why are we rushing through a Bill in the last week prior to the recess with unseemly haste and under a guillotine? I suspect it is because the Government wants to brush the matter under the carpet and close this chapter. The Government's actions in this case are outrageous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my earlier outburst. We have just heard one excellent and one idiotic contribution. In many ways, the contrast between the two represents the extraordinary lack of logic which has informed much of the debate on this affair within this House and outside it in recent weeks. There cannot be any doubt that the case which led to this debate is one of the most extraordinary ever to come to light in this State. Friends of mine in the Bar library have suggested to me that there was evidence of odd judicial behaviour in the past but that this is the first time such behaviour came to the fore. That concerns me.</P>
      <P>In one sense, these events should be welcomed because they will help to focus our attention on precisely what we mean by something fundamental to our Constitution and our manner of administration, namely, the concept of the separation of powers. That is not the only aspect which has been dealt with in the debate on this matter. There has been a good deal of hypocrisy and a certain degree of forgetfulness in the debate to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter spoke about the separation of powers and the manner in which the concept is interpreted in this State. It seems that we clip around this issue, particularly the issue of the relationship between this House and the democratic voice of the people, the Judiciary and the courts. I would never suggest that this House <Col N="537" /> should somehow impose itself on the manner in which a judge performs his or her judicial responsibilities. I agree with Deputy Shatter that a number of the issues which are currently being cloaked from public debate by our novel interpretation of the separation of powers doctrine have nothing whatsoever to do with the performance of judicial function. They are quite separate. The debate which has taken place in this House and in committee should have focused on that point.</P>
    <P>Let me cite an example of how ludicrous the situation is in this State. Deputies Shatter, O'Keeffe and others will be well aware that there are some instances of absolutely disgraceful and unpardonable delays in the delivery of judgments in our courts. A case was recently highlighted in a magazine article which stated that a senior member of the Irish Judiciary was guilty of delaying the issuance of a judgment for seven and a half years. That performance would not be allowed or tolerated in any other country. Yet, it is allowed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Ceann Comhairle had to rule out of order a parliamentary question which I tabled on this issue and related delays on the basis that the House does not inquire into the manner in which judges perform their tasks. We should inquire into that. If there is evidence of wrongdoing in the courts and that our courts are so burdened by responsibility that judgments cannot be delivered within a reasonable period of time, it is our business to investigate that. Yet, we have effectively prevented ourselves from doing so.</P>
    <P>We have adopted an entirely novel interpretation of the separation of powers. It would be wrong if the House were to inquire into the manner in which a judge made a judgment in a particular case. However, if we were to inquire as to why a judge was being tardy, reticent, careless or downright slovenly in the manner in which he or she behaved, that would not be wrong. If senior judges will not make inquiries, it is right and proper that we should. As we have worked ourselves into a <i>cul de sac</i> because of the manner in which we interpret the separation of powers, we will not ask questions.</P>
    <P>The interpretation strikes me as one which requires an urgent review. I hope the committee on the Constitution will address the issue. A more mature interpretation should be adopted as we currently operate in a manner which is odd, to say the least. I cannot believe that the legislature or parliament of any other country would accept that if there was clear, absolute and unequivocal evidence that the courts were operating incorrectly, it would not be possible to ask questions about the matter.</P>
    <P>Last year a High Court judge in England was forced by his peers to leave his position because he delayed a judgment for 18 months. Yet, we tolerate a senior judge guilty of delaying a judgment for seven and a half years in one case and up to three years, on two separate occasions, in a case in which I was personally involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> It is no harm to debate this issue as Deputy Shatter sought to do in most of his excellent contribution. He only succumbed to politics in the final part. It is obvious that there is a need for a debate on this issue. The restrictive interpretation of the separation of powers is the basis on which the two judges and the registrar are not appearing before the committee. Deputy Shatter was absolutely correct when he suggested that the committee should hear what Mr. Quinlan has to say. I cannot understand why it does not. After all, Mr. Quinlan was a functionary of the State. He was not exercising a judicial function and I cannot understand why we should be reticent about hearing what he has to say. Given that he is a man of some experience and clearly is anxious to protect the judicial system, one doubts he would say anything which would rock it.</P>
    <P>I can understand the alternative views taken by former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty. Clearly, when he first offered to come before the committee, impeachment proceedings were in the offing. In that event, it would have been appropriate for his views to be heard. There is, after all, a constitutional right that both sides should be heard in any case. That right applies to High Court or Supreme Court judges in the same way as it applies to the most humble citizen.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Mr. O'Flaherty did not feel capable of appearing before the committee. It is very interesting to note that nobody in this House has suggested the man is a liar. He provided a very fulsome explanation of his operations in this case and those are reproduced with excellent clarity in the Chief Justice's report. If we accept that Mr. O'Flaherty is a man of honour and integrity, why do people persist in asking why he behaved as he did? He has offered an explanation. He suggested he was operating on the basis of a humane inquiry. The fact that his inquiry may subsequently have been misinterpreted and that a second judge may have misbehaved as a result of the inquiry has nothing to do with Mr. O'Flaherty who has given his explanation. It mystifies me how the media and the Opposition cannot see this. Are Members on the Opposition benches prepared to say this man is a liar and that they do not accept the story he has given, the explanation as to his involvement or interference in this case, which has been reproduced in the excellent report by Mr. Justice Hamilton? Reiterating the same story before a joint committee would not add one whit to our understanding of what happened. Nobody has suggested that the man is a liar, although his behaviour was bizarre.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an interesting observation, that one had to be happy that the administration of justice would apply equally to all citizens. It is hard to envisage a situation where a citizen from Ballyfermot or some impoverished area of my constituency would bump into a Supreme Court judge by accident while out walking his or her dog and have a serendipitous effect on a family member about whom that citizen was concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> We appear to have the basis of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty's interposition in the case. That leaves us with Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly. Deputy Shatter drew distinctions in the levels of culpability. He regarded Mr. Quinlan as accidentally involved in this affair, the &ldquo;sins&rdquo; of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty as lesser and the activities of Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly as difficult to understand. I agree. If we were to inquire into Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, however, we would be trespassing into the area of a judgment. That would be dangerous. The report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights published last week makes interesting reading. When still in preparation he had not said that he had reached the end of his consideration of the matter. I agree with Deputy Shatter's interpretation, that it is unfortunate that the joint committee did not inquire further and listen to what the county registrar, Mr. Quinlan, had to say and I am not suggesting for one moment that he would have given a different story from the one given to the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>There were many excellent aspects to Deputy Shatter's contribution. In the last few sentences, however, he was back to his old waspish, ascerbic, vicious and poisonous self. He made a comparison between the payment of pensions and the regrettable situation in which the members of the CIS find themselves. They felt compelled to picket Leinster House to ensure continuation of the service. That is a spurious, disingenuous, dishonest and bogus comparison, although I do not blame Deputy Shatter for being concerned about handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and O'Keeffe as well as the leaders of the Opposition parties focused to an extraordinary degree on the principle involved in the payment of pensions. Have they been treated with a chemical substance which has affected their memory capacity? Is there something wrong with their capacity to retain and look back over the recent past? Do they not remember the gloriously generous treatment of those involved in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the golden handshakes and pensions? Was the principle that where people do wrong it is a question of proportion not established on that occasion?</P>
    <P>I was amused at Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution in which he suggested that there was no great hurry, that one of the individuals involved could wait 20 years for payment of a pension. He made the spurious and dishonest suggestion that the Bar Council could rewrite the rules relating to a retired judge returning to practice as a barrister. Deputy O'Keeffe knows the law. After his presentation today I would not expect him to look after my interests in a road traffic case, even if it involved a parking ticket. He knows what he said was ridiculous and nonsense; it is not possible to rewrite the rules.</P>
    <P>I regularly excoriate the Judiciary. It is unusual for me to defend a member of what I regard as one of the most pampered and cosseted pro<Col N="540" /> fessions in the State, a profession that has visited more misery on more people than any other profession I care to think of. A sense of proportion must, however, be held. Would the people be better served if we were to throw out all sense of proportionality and deny the individuals concerned a pension, having denied them the possibility of performing their professions and throwing them on the scrap heap? Is that the kind of state we wish to serve? </P>
    <P>It is right and proper that those who make errors and behave wrongly should suffer. The three men in question and their families have suffered. In the case of the county registrar, the suffering is disproportionate. If we believe the story of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty &ndash; I do &ndash; he has suffered extraordinary public humiliation and a fall from the heights of his profession to where he is worse than a nonentity because he is man on whom opprobrium hangs. He has suffered enough. It is extraordinary that leading politicians on the Opposition benches, who in the hepatitis case were prepared to be generous to those whose inaction and culpability led to the death of women and the destruction of families and to suggest that paying pensions and golden handshakes was not disproportionate, now wish to flog these three characters through the streets to make a mean-spirited political point. That is shameful political behaviour. We should behave as the people would wish us to behave, with some shred of humanity. I find the baying repugnant.</P>
    <P>Some good can come from this extraordinary case. If we were to have a Judiciary which was less removed from reality, it would be good and beneficial. If we were to have a House that was more in tune with its responsibilities to ensure there is democratic control over the Judiciary, some good could come from this.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the joint committee did not pursue all of the avenues open to it. I would like to have heard what Mr. Quinlan had to say under cross-examination. The fault lies not with that individual but with us and the way we interpret our responsibilities and relationship with the Judiciary. It is time for a more mature relationship and to start asking questions.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a judgment which was issued a number of years ago by a High Court judge in Manitoba. He suggested that carrying the torch of public scrutiny into the deepest and darkest recesses of public administration would be a good thing. If the light of public scrutiny illustrated that which was good, it would be beneficial, he believed, and if it illustrated that which was bad, the bad thing could be put right.</P>
    <P>That also applies to the Four Courts. The musty, dusty corners of the Four Courts should not be beyond public scrutiny. If judges are willing to sit on cases and cause untold misery to families, there should be scrutiny and answerability. If judges have cosy little arrangements between themselves, there should be accountability. Where we should draw the line, to refer back to Deputy Shatter's excellent contribution, <Col N="541" /> is where we would transgress into the area of judgment.</P>

In one case the annual pension is £40,000 to which, as the Bill states, the judge &ldquo;shall be entitled, for the duration of his life.&rdquo;. The pension is index linked and will increase in line with the salaries of sitting judges. A second judge will be awarded £30,000 for the duration of his life. This pension is also index linked. The Irish taxpayer, therefore, is forced to pay these extremely generous amounts of money to people who have no problem getting another job. It is conceivable that the younger person, in particular, may get extremely lucrative employment in the marketplace while, for the rest of his life, the Irish people will pay him £30,000 per year.</P>
      <P>Contrast this with how ordinary workers would be treated. Imagine an ordinary worker who was dismissed or was forced to leave his or her job because he or she made a mistake and then presented himself or herself for a pension of these dimensions for the rest of his or her life. Naturally, they would not get past the front door. In that contrast one can see the double standards this Government operates. Contrast it also with how another category of people is treated. People who have worked all their lives and paid into contributory pension schemes are entitled, on reaching retirement age, which is well into their sixties, to the princely sum of £89 per week or £4,628 per year. A person on invalidity pension &ndash; let us say he is the same age as the younger of the former judges &ndash; will be rewarded by the State with £75.20 per week or £3,910.40 per annum.</P>
      <P>This is a sickening double standard which the Government has the nerve to bring before the Dáil. These provisions are being made to people who will not tell the story of what really happened in the saga surrounding the release of Mr. Sheedy. This matter has been debated inside and outside the Dáil so there is no point rehearsing the facts of the case. In short, it was a case which had Fianna Fáil fingerprints all over it from start to finish. However, we could not get to the nub of why these events occurred. Now this Fianna Fáil dominated Government is rewarding people, who are maintaining a silence and are not accountable, with extremely generous pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must admit, at least, that this is consistent with the Government's philosophy and the way it deals with different sectors of society. It appears that people who make mistakes and are guilty of <Col N="542" /> misconduct of one kind or other are rewarded above anybody else in society. One need only look at the example of the speculators, developers and house builders, the small minority who have put the right to a home out of the reach of ordinary working people. The Government has stood aside and allowed them to do that at will, irrespective of the enormous suffering that is caused to ordinary working people, the unemployed and the poor. Likewise, this Bill is brought before the House to provide for generous pensions.</P>
    <P>The clear message being conveyed is that judges in our society are beyond accountability. That is utterly unacceptable. In a society that is supposed to be democratic, it is unacceptable that judges are beyond accountability. That must be changed.</P>
    <P>This is related to the issue of the independence of the Judiciary. In many ways that is a sham. It is a hypocrisy that is contributed to by the major parties in the Dáil and the media. We are well aware that the main attribute people must have to be appointed judges is loyalty to one or other of the major parties in power at the time of their appointments. It is to do with their former political allegiances.</P>

        <b>:</b> Among their ranks one can find many people who stood for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael in elections. Suddenly, when they are rewarded at a later stage for their service, they become untouchable and, supposedly, utterly independent.</P>
      <P>This is just another example of how the legal system is skewed in favour of those who are privileged and away from those who do not have power and wealth. Judges are always drawn from the privileged echelons of society. That privilege is enhanced by their contacts with major political parties. When they are rewarded with well paid jobs they are no longer accountable to the ordinary taxpayers who pay their wages. Barristers virtually write their own cheques and nobody is entitled to curb the amount of money they charge. In so doing, they put legal redress out of reach of the majority who cannot afford to embark upon costly legal actions. Yet, in the District Courts in Dublin and elsewhere we see how the victims of society are treated by this privileged legal elite. Every day there is a sad parade through the courts of the poor, the ill-educated, the addicted and other victims of a capitalist society based on greed. They have not been able to get the start in life that others have. They do not have the privileged background that judges have. They do not have the clout or the ear of the major political parties, and they fall by the wayside towards crime of one kind or other. The courts deal quite sharply and trenchantly with the results of an unjust society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is now adding insult to injury <Col N="543" /> by proposing this legislation which awards these people from the privileged echelons of society comfort at the taxpayers' expense for the rest of their lives, without having to answer to the people why they acted as they did and without having to provide an explanation for the extraordinary chain of events that occurred around this case. This legislation is shameful and disgraceful. It speaks volumes about the Government's double standards and how people are treated. The privileged are rewarded and the poor and others outside the circles of power will pay, while they would have nothing like the same compensation if they found themselves in difficulty.</P>

      <P>I am very surprised at the manner in which the Opposition has continued to highlight this case and has tried to make such a story about it with little or no regard to the damage it has done to the lives of these people and their families. I see that Deputy Theresa Ahearn is smiling, but the way the Fine Gael Party has dealt with this matter is most unfortunate.</P>

There has been a serious attempt to associate Fianna Fáil with what occurred in this case. I am as concerned as anyone else that we do not have the full story, but at this stage we have to admit that we will never know it.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy Higgins who speaks on a fairly regular basis. He is consistent in his contributions which are the most negative ones to come before the House. Week in and week out it is the same old story. I would like to see him putting forward more positive suggestions in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not forget that we are dealing specifically with three people, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, Mr. Cyril Kelly and Mr. Michael Quinlan. I accept they have done wrong, but they put their hands up and resigned. The Government thought long and hard about this matter, which has been <Col N="544" /> discussed at some length, and it decided to introduce severance terms for these three people. In Ireland we always have a sense of fair play but for some reason that I cannot understand, the Opposition continues to press this matter and oppose the terms put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>The case was a sad one from the outset, with a woman losing her life. We cannot underestimate the grief caused to her family. Mr. Philip Sheedy, who was found guilty of the offence, was sentenced, but one must ask if, in view of the publicity, he has any chance of receiving justice. How do we define justice? Members of the House have been critical of the actions of these two judges and the registrar. What, however, would be the case if we were to apply the same standards to politicians and the way we have acted in the past? While it might not be as prevalent today as it was a few years ago, constituents would often come to politicians' clinics with problems such as a speeding offence and a Deputy or Senator would be able to look after it. Most of us never saw anything wrong with that. If one happened to know the right person, it could be looked after. Such cases are plentiful, although people might not admit it. I would not say we are all guilty, but I can put my hand up and say that I would have been involved in a few such cases, and I know many of my colleagues were also. If we applied the same standards to ourselves as we want to apply to these three individuals, there would not be too many of us left in the House. We must acknowledge and recognise the major admissions that Mr. O'Flaherty, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Quinlan made in tendering their resignations.</P>
    <P>In his speech on Second Stage last Thursday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, mentioned that the position was an unusual one and the Government was not too sure if it would have to impeach these people and bring them before the House. That would have created difficulties for us in that we would have been in unfamiliar territory. It could have taken months, if not years, of our time to deal with the matter. The three people involved have admitted they did wrong. They put their hands up and admitted they acted incorrectly. The inquiries that have taken place, at the request of the Minister's Department, clearly show they acted incorrectly. However, the price they have been asked to pay is enormous. For that reason I have no difficulty in supporting the severance terms which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented in the House last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 1 June, the death of Private William Kedian and the injuries to Private Ronald Rushe and Private Darren Clarke on 31 May while serving with the 85th Irish Battalion in Lebanon were the subject of immediate protest by UNIFIL Headquarters, Naquora to the Israeli Defence Forces who undertook to conduct an investigation at the highest level. A formal letter of protest was lodged by UNIFIL with the Israeli Defence Forces on 2 June. A preliminary report was also forwarded immediately by UNIFIL Headquarters to United Nations Headquarters, New York. The United Nations Secretary-General condemned the attack. The United Nations Headquarters conveyed a strong protest in the matter to the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations who had been summoned to United Nations Headquarters. A letter was also sent to the President of the Security Council with the details of the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request the Minister for Foreign Affairs summoned the Israeli ambassador to Ireland to Leinster House on 1 June to protest the matter to the Israeli authorities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed great concern at the loss of life and serious injury to Irish peacekeeping personnel and, on behalf of the Government, protested the incident of 31 May in the strongest possible terms. He also expressed the Government's grave concern at the pattern of recent incidents involving firing close to and at IRISHBATT positions. He insisted that there must be an immediate cessation of such incidents and demanded that the Israeli Government take firm action to prevent such targeting of the UNIFIL contingent. In response, the ambassador regretted the loss of life <Col N="546" /> and injury and undertook to report to his authorities.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing escalation of hostile activity in the UNIFIL area of operations and the risks which this posed for Irish personnel serving there, I decided to visit the area from 20 to 22 June to see the situation for myself and, more importantly, to raise the seriousness of the situation with both the Israeli and Lebanese authorities and to seek assurances that the recent reckless shelling of IRISHBATT positions by the Israeli Defence Force/<i>de facto</i> forces and the armed elements (Hizbollah) would not recur. During the course of my visit I met both the Lebanese Minister of Defence and the Israeli Minister of Defence. I sought assurances from both my Lebanese and Israeli counterparts that there would not be a recurrence of these recent serious shelling incidents. I indicated to both sides that, while Ireland is committed to the UNIFIL mission, should there not be a cessation of such incidents, serious consideration would have to be given to the withdrawal of the Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>Arising from an incident on 20 May, involving an IRISHBATT position which resulted in extensive damage to the post, including the destruction of a UN truck, I requested that the Department of Foreign Affairs protest the matter to the Lebanese authorities and on 3 June the Irish ambassador at Cairo, who is accredited to Lebanon, had lodged an official protest with the Lebanese ambassador to Egypt. The Lebanese Minister for Defence expressed regret at the recent incidents and reaffirmed the gratitude of the Lebanese Government and people for the presence of the Irish UNIFIL troops. He assured me that the grave concern expressed regarding the present situation would be raised at Cabinet and with other contacts.</P>
    <P>During my meeting with the Israeli Minister of Defence I stressed to him the utmost gravity with which the Government regard the recent incidents involving Irish troops, including the death of Private Kedian and the critical wounding of Private Rushe. As the House will be aware, in an earlier incident in February last, Corporal Noel Roche and Private John Flaherty were injured when their post was fired on. Further heavy shelling on 10 June resulted in damage to Irish positions but, fortuitously, there was not loss of life on that occasion.</P>
    <P>On 11 June, at my request, a further strong protest was lodged by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Israeli ambassador, following which the Irish ambassador to Israel also lodged a protest with the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs on 15 June. In response to the very strong protest which I made, the Israeli Defence Minister said he was very disturbed by recent events in South Lebanon but that the situation was very difficult and complex there. Referring to the Southern Lebanese Army, the Minister said that while they were trained, equipped and paid by Israel, they did not take their orders from Israel. He undertook that explicit instructions would be <Col N="547" /> given to the SLA arising from my protest but that it was difficult to give full assurances regarding a cessation of firing incidents such as I had sought.</P>
    <P>
      <i> Additional Information.</i>

    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me and the Government. While absolute guarantees cannot be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions such as UNIFIL, it is my policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. Each post within Irish UNIFIL area of operations has reinforced concrete bunkers specifically designed to withstand direct and indirect fire from heavy weapons. Rigorous operational procedures are in place to ensure that personnel occupy these bunkers in a timely fashion should the need arise. In such an eventuality, protected minimum duty personnel remain in place to ensure that operational activity is observed and reported. Physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved. Irish troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the range of initiatives which the Minister and the Government have undertaken with regard to this issue. Our thoughts are still with the families affected by the loss of life and serious injuries. Has there been a reduction in the number of assaults and attacks on the UNIFIL positions? When I visited Lebanon some weeks ago it was clear that serious attacks were being made and that dangers were being posed. Has there been a reduction in the number of attacks since this range of initiatives has been undertaken?</P>

      <P>There were a number of incidents which I outlined in my reply. Since my visit we have not received a report of further incidents close to the Irish positions. The Government is treating what happened with the utmost gravity and matters will continue to be monitored and will be kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prime Minister-elect of Israel, Mr. Barak, has suggested he will be withdrawing troops from the area. The peace process in the Middle East is at a very delicate stage. Will the Minister put his threat to withdraw Irish troops into context? While safety and security must be the first consideration, I am sure that given the delicacy of the peace process, it is the wish of the public and the Minister not to engage in a hasty withdrawal. Given that the situation is very volatile and dangerous, is the Minister seriously suggesting withdrawing troops in the short-term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of Irish troops serving in the United Nations and in UNIFIL is of para<Col N="548" /> mount importance to me as Minister for Defence, to the Government and to the people. One only had to visit Ballyhaunis and meet Private Kedian's family to appreciate the impact of his death and to recognise the impact further tragedies of that kind would have. In such circumstances serious consideration would have to be given to the withdrawal of the troops, especially in view of the nature of these incidents. We are a peace keeping force under a UN mandate and we should not be deliberately targeted by either side. I wanted to stress this aspect to the Lebanese and Israeli authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy is right that it is a tense time there. It is hoped to achieve the ultimate withdrawal of Israeli troops under UN Resolution 425 in a peaceful way. We will stay as long as is necessary to achieve that goal provided the authorities on both sides respect our position. In recent times that position was not respected and I made it absolutely clear that our troops will not be a target for the Hizbollah or SLA forces. As the Deputy is aware, one specific incident, in addition to the others which occurred, could have gone dangerously wrong.</P>
      <P>We were extremely lucky not to have major casualties on one occasion and there was no option open to me at that time other than to reinforce the Government's view that should Irish positions continue to be targets of indiscriminate, deliberate firing, it will not stand idly by without seriously looking at our position there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiatives and thank him on everybody's behalf for his efforts to assist the two unfortunate families. What was the reaction of the UN Security Council to the Minister's request? Since he returned from the Lebanon, has he updated the UN on his views about the very dangerous situation that pertains there for our troops?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On leaving south Lebanon I made it clear to the commanding officer at UNIFIL headquarters in Naquoro that I would continue to review the position. I was extremely anxious that there would be a cessation of those incidents and that we could continue to do the work for which we went to south Lebanon, namely, to help to finalise the peace process so that people there could return to living normal lives as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I have not been in contact directly with UN headquarters but my Department constantly liaises with the UN and every action will be taken in this regard to maintain the safety of the troops. However, we will not let it rest at that. Monitoring continues daily and I want to see a period of peace during which our troops will not be assaulted in the manner in which they have been up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments on support for the families. We were happy to be able to help them at such an extremely difficult time and look forward very much to the return of <Col N="549" /> Private Ronnie Rush to continue his recovery programme. It was as close to a miracle in medical terms as one could imagine and I hope his recovery continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1244 on 10 June 1999 which, among other things, authorised the establishment and deployment of an international security presence in Kosovo &ndash; KFOR. The Security Council resolution established KFOR for an initial period of 12 months from June 1999 and it will continue thereafter unless it decides otherwise.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department, the Secretary General of NATO was informed on 9 June that Ireland would be interested in participation in KFOR, subject to approval by the Government and the Dáil. The NATO secretariat identified a KFOR requirement for a transport unit, in line with what Ireland could contemplate providing to the force. A formal invitation to participate in KFOR is expected.</P>
      <P>Following consideration by the Government yesterday of the request, it has been decided, subject to the approval of the House, to agree to the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force comprising a transport group estimated at between 80 and 100 personnel, equipped with 32 vehicles, for an initial period until June 2000, for service with KFOR. The necessary enabling motion will be brought before Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the House rises for the summer recess.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that it would take a minimum of six weeks from the date of approval by the House to the commencement date of deployment of the contingent. A military fact finding mission to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe &ndash; SHAPE &ndash; Mons, Belgium, is today seeking clarification on a number of practical matters in regard to the proposed participation in the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should Dáil approval to participate in KFOR be forthcoming, it will be necessary to send a Defence Forces reconnaissance party to the mission area prior to deployment and before a final decision is made on the composition of the transport group. In the meantime, all necessary forward planning in relation to the recruitment of personnel, the preparation of vehicles and equip<Col N="550" /> ment etc. is ongoing within the Defence Forces in anticipation of approval by the House to participate in the mission. It is intended that Defence Forces personnel would undergo specific KFOR training prior to their departure for Kosovo and in this regard a training syllabus is being prepared by the military authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the participation of our Defence Forces in KFOR but it is extremely important that the Minister reassures the public that the Defence Forces will have the necessary equipment, training, information and logistical support to participate effectively and safely. It will be a difficult mission which will go on for a long time. It is indicative of the changing peacekeeping role in which our Defence Forces will be involved. I understand that new APCs will not be available for at least another year or two. Must Ireland supply all its own equipment for the mission? Is it up to standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A Defence Forces reconnaissance group will look at and tease out all the practical issues associated with the success of the mission and one of the primary aspects of that will be the safety and security of the troops. We expect to form part of a battalion comprising 400 personnel, which will probably involve the British and Norwegian Defence Forces. We will supply our own vehicles and will not have the new APCs on stream for this mission. However, this is primarily a transport mission which will be involved in humanitarian tasks and, of course, the transport of equipment, particularly for infrastructural development. A great deal of damage was done and it will be necessary to support efforts and initiatives to restore some sense of normality for the refugees as they return to Kosovo. I assure the Deputy that the training programme and reconnaissance effort is geared towards making sure that planning, training, equipment and support is sufficient to guarantee the safety and security of the troops who are deployed on the mission as far as that can be done.</P>

      <P>Early in the play, I publicly indicated, largely because of what I saw on television, the unspeakable atrocities carried out against these people, that when a UN decision to send an international force to Kosovo was taken, Ireland would be ready to play its part with a transport company. We took the initiative by saying that we would be prepared. This is consistent with the policy of previous Ministers so that we would always be seen to try to work out to what extent we could help. That was done on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> The formal request from the UN has not been received yet. The UN resolution has been adopted and we expect the formal request any day now. We took the initiative, which was consistent with what was done in similar circumstances in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge that there are limited resources, does the Minister agree that this is a significant opportunity for Ireland to re-examine its commitment to peacekeeping? Earlier questions related to our interim force in the Lebanon, which has been there for 21 years. Does the Minister agree it would be more beneficial for Ireland to make a major contribution to KFOR and to downsize our commitment to UNIFIL? If the programme for the purchase of APCs was condensed into 18 months instead of six years and the feasibility of leasing equipment from other countries was considered, does the Minister agree Ireland could supply a battalion to KFOR?</P>
      <P>Ireland has been part of UNIFIL for 21 years and while I appreciate that good work has been done, we are one of the few remaining countries from the initial group involved in the mission. It is time to consider pastures new, particularly in light of the disdain the Israeli Government appears to have for UNIFIL. Since the start of the year, five protests have been lodged by the Government, including one on 11 June following the tragic death of Private Kedian.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to my comments? Does he agree it would be in Ireland's interest in terms of our contribution to European security to downsize our participation in Lebanon and to make a major contribution to KFOR?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmins is always in a position to impart information on these matters because of his experience. I am anxious to reach the day when we can substantially reduce our commitment to UNIFIL in South Lebanon. I have consistently indicated this position. However, the scenario there is still difficult and we are prepared to stay and to try to finish the job. It may be possible to reduce our commitment within a short time if Prime Minister-elect Barak is able to complete the withdrawal of Israeli troops under the terms of the resolution. This would provide an opportunity to deploy a much larger contingent in Kosovo. I look forward to that happening as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also anxious to accelerate the acquisition programme for APCs. I will consider every avenue open to me to accelerate the programme because it presents a different opportunity which Ireland could follow in terms of the location of future missions. It is not easy to give a definitive <Col N="552" /> answer on whether I will be successful because it involves substantial money and major investment is being made in other equipment, vehicles and general infrastructure in the Defence Forces. The figure this year of approximately £57 million is an all time high in terms of investment across the board. I cannot give an absolute guarantee but I am considering how the period during which the APCs will be acquired could be condensed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that Ireland's response of approximately 100 troops, which is not overgenerous but probably the maximum which can be offered at present, places the Department of Finance's memo on downsizing the Defence Forces into context? It shows that if Ireland wants to continue to make a contribution at an international level, the approach of the Department of Finance to the Defence Forces in terms of downgrading and suggested reductions in the number of battalions and troops is not the way forward.</P>
      <P>Is Ireland in a position to supply technical or specialist staff? For example, how many of our troops have been trained in mine clearance? This is one of the most urgent and demanding needs in Kosovo at present. How many have been trained in mine clearance? Is Ireland able to supply any technical, medical, engineering or other specialist members of the Defence Forces to Kosovo? As I said previously, international publications on the defence forces have said that there is an enormous need in these areas in Kosovo at present.</P>

      <P>As far as Kosovo is concerned, the indications were that a transport unit was required. People will also be sent to work in the administrative area under the interim arrangements in Kosovo regarding the preparations for democratic institutions and the greatest possible autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>At present, Ireland is participating in 13 different missions. A considerable number of specialists is involved in the smaller missions and to date we have not received a request for those specialists to go to Kosovo. However, they will be supplied to wherever they are needed in so far as the commitments can be met.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made in establishing a compensation scheme for dealing with deafness compensation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on preparing a scheme of compensation to provide for persons who have genuine hearing difficulties arising from their military service is progressing satisfactorily in my Department.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that on 20 May 1999, when I last answered questions on this subject, I mentioned that work on the scheme would be influenced by the outcome of the appeal in the case of Hanley <i>v. </i>the Minister for Defence. This appeal, which is critical to the State's strategy for dealing with the Army hearing loss claims, will be heard in the Supreme Court tomorrow, 1 July.</P>
      <P>The main issue in the State's appeal of the Hanley case is the scale of damages which has been laid down by the High Court. Given the imminence of the Supreme Court appeal, further comment by me at this time would be inappropriate. However, I hope I may soon be in a position to recommend the establishment of a compensation scheme to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the appeal will be heard tomorrow. I did not realise it would be heard tomorrow and we will be much wiser when the decision is available. How many cases have been submitted in the past month? What is the latest information on the awards being made in the courts? Has the average award continued to drop in recent weeks?</P>
      <P>There has been some publicity recently about a new assessment test for hearing loss which was developed by a university. Has an approach been made to the Minister about incorporating it in the new compensation scheme? Is that appropriate? Does the Minister have any information on this matter and has any decision been made on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 100 new cases were submitted up to 25 June. My recollection is that the number submitted in May was approximately 70 while the total in April was approximately 130. The number in earlier months was between 70 and 80. The average is still approximately 100 a month, which is a continuing worrying trend.</P>
      <P>The tariffs have continued to reduce. The average is approximately £11,000 per case at present, which is a reduction from the all time high of £35,000 per case a few years ago. However, the legal costs associated with each case have remained static and, therefore, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis the legal costs involved in managing the cases are higher. It is essential to establish an out of court environment to try to reduce the legal costs and to ensure there is an affordable tariff which is fair to both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disturbing that 100 new cases continue to arrive in the Department each <Col N="554" /> month. This highlights the urgency of establishing a compensation scheme. Has the Minister made any progress on establishing the tariff or is he awaiting the outcome of the Supreme Court case? Is the Minister encouraging the Minister for Finance to hurry the legislation on a State claims agency to enable more efficient handling of cases taken against the State in defence and other areas? The post-traumatic stress disorder cases taken against the Department of Defence may escalate, and other compensation issues are arising in the Defence Forces at present. How does the Minister see these other cases being dealt with? Will the agency he is going to establish be able to cope with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It will deal primarily with hearing loss cases because these are the bulk of the compensation cases before my Department. It is thought the Army Pensions Board will be able to deal with the minority of other types of cases. There are about 21 post-traumatic stress cases altogether and each will be dealt with on its merits. If the out of court environment proves successful we could consider it for other types of cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 26, and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The 1999 cadetship competition was advertised in April and it is intended that 58 cadets will be recruited from that competition in October this year. Seventeen Naval Service apprentices were enlisted in April 1999. A competition for 15 Air Corps avionics apprentices was advertised recently and it is envisaged that successful applicants will commence duty in autumn 1999. The military authorities have submitted no proposals for the enlistment of additional Army apprentices this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to enlist 550 recruits to the Permanent Defence Force in 1999. To date some 146 recruits have already been enlisted from the first phase of the general service recruitment programme which commenced in February and a <Col N="555" /> further 105 are expected to be enlisted within the next three weeks. I envisage no difficulty in reaching the full recruitment quota for this year as we will be maintaining our policy of continuous recruitment throughout 1999 with the second phase of general recruitment due to commence in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>What advertising took place for these positions? On previous occasions I asked what contact was made with career guidance teachers in schools, colleges or universities in relation to such positions. Was contact made with them in this case or was there only an advertisement in the newspapers? Recruitment should be through career guidance teachers to give pupils every opportunity to take up these positions. Perhaps the Minister could take this on board to ensure it happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was happy to take on board the House's advice. Deputy Wall mentioned this matter to me more than 12 months ago. The recruitment programme is now oriented towards, and primarily focused on, second level schools and local radio. It does not concentrate as much on the traditional national advertising campaign, although that is still conducted.</P>
      <P>We had more than 1,000 applications to last year's recruitment programme. Even with employment opportunities in the economy generally and the number of students going to third level, the calibre of the candidates offering is going up all the time and the programme is becoming more successful. The Deputy has had the opportunity to meet some of the young recruits and those who are now applying are dedicated to the Defence Forces, that is what they want to do. I am extremely happy with that progress and we are having no difficulty filling our complement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that, as a country of tradesmen and craftsmen, we may lose out if the Government does not ensure we have enough apprentices for all the relevant trades. I ask the Minister to make a commitment that, where possible, the Department of Defence will not be found wanting and will ensure every possible position is provided to train craftsmen and tradesman, whatever the trade may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, so far this year I have had no request from the military authorities for recruitment of apprentices. Some 28 apprentices are completing their training at present. Any requirement for specialist services arising from apprenticeship recruitment will be undertaken once I have a request from the military authorities to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>On Army apprentices, does the Minister agree that if we are to have 40 new APCs and perhaps a mechanised battalion over<Col N="556" /> seas, it is imperative that we have fitters, etc., for those vehicles, and that if we do not take in apprentices we may run into difficulty? He said he had received no request from the Army authorities but is that not because there is no structure to educate these apprentices since the closing of the apprentice school in Naas? One reason for recruitment in recent years was the successful voluntary early retirement or VER scheme. Will that scheme continue in the immediate future or is it finished for the time being?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The VER scheme is over, the last phase was during 1998. The Deputy is incorrect in saying there is no facility for training apprentices; apprenticeships in the Navy and Air Corps, third level institutes and FÁS training schemes are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Army apprentices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there are specialist needs which can be supplied only by Defence Forces personnel, the new training facility in the Curragh will be well able to take care of that. If we want to train people we have plenty of facilities in which to do it. All the indications suggest we are one of the best countries in Europe at training people, but we can do it at much less cost than the Deputy is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding recruitment of Air Corps cadets, has a decision been taken on replacing aircraft? The Price Waterhouse report stated that a decision not to replace the Marchetti aircraft would impact fundamentally on the training regime for Air Corps pilots; if they were not replaced pilot training would have to be conducted outside the Air Corps and, in all probability, outside the State. What action is the Minister taking to ensure this does not happen and that replacement fleet is ordered so that we can continue to train Air Corps pilots in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my ambition to be able to maintain these training facilities into the future and that will require the purchase of new aircraft in due course. The final draft of the review of the Air Corps will shortly be available and that will point to the levels of expenditure required to replace aircraft over a period of ten or more years. An interesting feature of some of the discoveries I have made in recent times is the extent to which aircraft in other countries, equivalent to ours, has a much longer lifespan, notwithstanding that the hours in the air for other countries' aircraft are significantly longer. It may be that a considerable amount of our aircraft could have its life extended. Notwithstanding that, there will be a need for new aircraft and it will be my task to see how I can meet those resources following the completion of the review. We will continue to do that job as well as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister now disagree with the findings of the Price Waterhouse report <Col N="557" /> which stated repeatedly that various aircraft were due for replacement in 2002?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into that issue in detail until I have the final report. I do not disagree that we will need considerable resources to replace aircraft over time. I am simply saying that it was interesting for me to discover in the course of my examination that aircraft scheduled to become obsolete at a certain time will have fewer hours in the air and will be seven years newer than similar aircraft working in style in another European country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the recruitment requirements for the Naval Service, is the Minister confident that we can cope with the necessity for additional vessels and the recruitment of additional personnel? The number of patrol vessels patrolling 15,000 sq. miles of territorial waters is inadequate and is not comparable to the number of vessels patrolling any other western seaboard. In terms of the expansion of recruitment, is the Minister satisfied he can recruit people to the Naval Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Finucane knows, I have stepped up recruitment to the Navy which has been considerably better in recent years than in the previous term of office. It is still not sufficient, however, and we have a significant requirement to protect our natural resources. We must be able to strengthen that whenever we can with new recruitment and with the new ships that will come onstream later this year. It will be difficult. I understand the complement this year will be approximately 135 additional recruits and there will be specialist areas in cadets, watchkeepers, etc., but it is getting more difficult. We have a particular problem currently because there was substantial recruitment to the Navy in the late 1970s but after 21 years people are now qualifying for their pensions. The alternative opportunities in employment outside the Navy are significantly greater than they were in the past. A problem is being experienced in trying to maintain the numbers and meet the type of commitments Deputy Finucane outlined which are essential in protecting our fisheries resources, combating the import of illicit drugs into the country and in the provision of rescue and safety measures. The recruitment this year will be higher than ever before and we hope to continue that and draw more people into the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 71 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for affording me the opportunity to bring the House up to date on the progress of the White Paper on Defence. As the Deputies know, this will be the first ever White Paper on Defence. It will provide a framework for the evolution of national defence policy and the continuing reorganisation process in the Defence Forces. Overall, the White Paper presents a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>A range of foundation work which will form the basis of the future planning elements of the White Paper has been under way for some time. These foundation elements relate to an assessment of the defence and security environment, an examination of the progress already made in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, and the consultative process. As the Deputies are doubtless aware, the defence and security environment is in a state of evolution both in the European and national contexts.</P>
      <P>The timetable for the White Paper will depend on the completion of the consultative and planning elements and the subsequent work. Subject to the satisfactory completion of this work, I plan to bring my proposals to Government later this year.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the importance I have placed on the consultation element of the process. It would be remiss of me not to ensure that a topic of fundamental importance is properly addressed. I must add, however, that I am conscious of the need for balance to be maintained between consultation on the one hand and my duty as Minister on the formation of defence policy on the other.</P>
      <P>In August 1998, a notice was inserted in the national press inviting interested individuals and organisations to make submissions to my Department by 16 October 1998. Some submissions were received by this date and others came in the subsequent months. While neither individuals or organisations requested a delay in the publication of the White Paper on Defence, some asked for an extension of the deadline for the receipt of their submissions. Consequently, additional time was made available to those who required it to complete their submissions on the White Paper. Obviously, this has had implications for the timetable for the completion of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all, some 45 submissions have been received <Col N="559" /> from a wide range of individuals, groups and organisations and a series of consultations have taken place on foot of these written submissions. These consultations may be augmented as the preparatory work proceeds. I understand these submissions contain a wide range of views and it is important to ensure that all submissions are adequately considered.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that full consultations on the White Paper on Defence will take place with the Defence Forces representative associations in accordance with the normal system of representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my recollection that the Minister stated in the House that the reason the White Paper would be delayed was because some organisations had asked him for an extension of time. The timescale he has outlined is next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Later this year? That is not because any individual organisation asked the Minister for an extension of time but because it is a Government decision to delay it. Has the Minister not received all the submissions the various representative associations and others intended to make? Would it not have been more correct for him to say it was a Government decision to delay the White Paper on Defence until later this year, even though the Taoiseach and the Minister said it would be published in June? I raise this matter because it has implications for decision-making in respect of the Defence Forces. For example, the reviews of the Air Corps and the needs of the Navy have not yet been carried out. The Minister has not made the decisions about the Air Corps fleet, which has implications for training. All things being considered, the Minister should have tried to publish the White Paper on Defence in June so that it would not delay these decisions which are so important for the future of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply, I was anxious to ensure there was a good consultative process. Deputy Fitzgerald is wrong to suggest that the Government is delaying this matter. Not only did some groups request more time to make their submissions, they then asked if they could make an oral submission also, which we are glad to accept. This is the first ever White Paper and we want to get it right. We do not intend to rush it out just for the sake of doing it. The consultative process is continuing. It has meant that we will be some months behind the original estimate, but there has been no delay in other areas such as recruitment, refurbishment, acquisition, the review, etc. All of that work is proceeding includ<Col N="560" /> ing appointments and transfers. I said at the outset that the White Paper would not delay the mainstream of activities but it has to be completed properly. We will then have the medium to long-term strategy that will be followed into the future, but I assure the Deputy that nothing else is being held up.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance is not that transparent in its pressure on the Defence Forces. Given that the Minister plans to have oral hearings, are there any plans to involve the public in consultation on this matter? The public has had an opportunity to contribute to the White Paper by way of written submission, but when the White Paper on Defence was being published there was a series of public meetings. The issues were discussed at those meetings and the findings were incorporated in the White Paper. There is enormous interest in Defence Forces issues at present for a variety of reasons, not all of them good, but there is increasing interest in the role of our Defence Forces at home and abroad. People have opinions on this and the Minister has the chance to give people an opportunity to state those opinions. It would be interesting to gauge public opinion through consultative meetings.</P>

      <P>There were 18 submissions from organisations, 12 from serving and former members of the Defence Forces, seven from Civil <Col N="561" /> Defence officers and eight from individuals, making a total of 45. I was happy that so many organisations and individuals took the time and interest in this. I had not considered national fora for this as we had already gone so far with the consultative process, allowing people to come in and make oral submissions. I will give some thought to it, but it is not something I had contemplated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 39, 49, 54, 55, 56, 95, 96 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1244 on 10 June 1999 which, among other things, authorised the establishment and deployment of an international security presence in Kosovo, KFOR. The Security Council resolution established KFOR for an initial period of 12 months from June 1999 and it will continue thereafter unless the Security Council decides otherwise.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department, the Secretary General of NATO was informed on 9 June 1999 that Ireland would be interested in participation in KFOR, subject to approval by the Government and the Dáil. The NATO secretariat has identified a KFOR requirement for a transport unit in line with what Ireland could contemplate providing to the force. A formal invitation to participate in KFOR is expected. Following consideration by the Government yesterday of the request, it has been decided, subject to the approval of the House, to agree to the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force comprising a transport group estimated at between 80 and 100 personnel, equipped with 32 vehicles for an initial period until June 2000, for service with KFOR. The necessary enabling motion will be brought before Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the House rises for the summer recess. It is envisaged that it would take a minimum of six weeks from the date of Dáil approval to the commencement date of deployment of the contingent.</P>
      <P>A military fact finding mission to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe &ndash; SHAPE &ndash; at Mons in Belgium is today seeking clarification on a number of practical matters in relation to the proposed participation in the force. Should Dáil approval to participate in KFOR be forthcoming, it will be necessary to send a Defence Forces reconnaissance party to the mission area prior to deployment and before a final decision is made on the actual composition of the transport group. In the meantime, all necessary forward planning in relation to the recruitment of personnel, the preparation of vehicles and equipment etc. is ongoing within the Defence Forces in anticipation of approval by the House to participate in the mission. It is intended that Defence Forces personnel would undergo specific KFOR training prior to their departure for Kosovo and in this regard a training syllabus is being prepared by the military authorities.</P>

      <P>When contact was made with the Israeli Government, was the Prime Minister elect, Mr. Barak, made aware of the concerns of the Irish Government in relation to the increased dangers for Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL, given his stated intentions for the area? He obviously wishes to withdraw troops and make peace, but is he aware of the concerns of our <Col N="563" /> Government? Has the Taoiseach or the Minister been able to contact him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone in Israel could be unaware of the concerns we expressed which were carried on local and national television. I was there in the interregnum period between the outgoing and new Governments and, from my experience, the normal process is that outgoing Governments indicate the position regarding serious matters to the incoming Government. The Israeli Defence Minister undertook to use his offices to the fullest extent and to report to the Israeli Cabinet on our anxieties. I am not certain but I do not think Mr. Barak could avoid knowing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This should be followed up. Deputy Wall asked the Minister about getting back to the UN after his visit and, given the change of Government in Israel, perhaps it is appropriate to restate our concerns through the proper channels.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, if there is an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon and we can condense the APC programme, is it Government policy to try to increase our contribution to KFOR?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for due consideration at the time. It seems that as we are committed to having approximately 10 per cent of the Defence Forces engaged in activities under the UN banner, if we withdraw from UNIFIL there will be scope for deployment to Kosovo or other missions. I see our contribution to Kosovo, based on the agreement of the House, if it is forthcoming, as being as extensive and as comprehensive as we can possibly make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not a comment on the changing nature of peacekeeping as undertaken by the Irish Defence Forces? As Deputy Timmins said, there is the potential to make a greater contribution to peacekeeping in Kosovo. We will obviously be debating the new request in the House this week, but how does the Minister see it? In the context of Irish peacekeeping for the past 25 years, what challenges does the Minister envisage the KFOR mission offering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Peacekeeping has evolved and there has been a shift away from territorial defence to a more difficult and complex arena. The kind of specialist training, preparation and equipment we will have to provide, as well as the responsibility of carrying the cost, places an extra onus in our preparation to deal with those changes. However, there are opportunities. They should not be looked at as challenges that cannot <Col N="564" /> be overcome. We have been able to meet these challenges in the past with meagre resources and with a different climate in the country. We should now be better able to deal with this fast changing scenario, where regional deployment will be more organised and where we will have to make full financial provisions for this ourselves. I am looking forward to this challenge, not in the sense that I want to see more problems like Kosovo, but experience shows us that this seems always to happen somewhere and we must be prepared to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Personal injury cases are taken on the basis that negligence is alleged against the defendants. Each claim against my Department is dealt with on its own merits in the light of legal advice received. With reference to post-traumatic stress disorder, there are now 19 cases outstanding.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have for some time operated a stress management and PTSD programme, the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to provide support for personnel so that they can deal with trauma and stressful situations in an appropriate and timely manner. This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can establish, no Department is signed up to what is known as an insurance link service. In other words, if someone puts in a claim there is no authority with which a Department can check if he or she has submitted a previous claim. In these cases the trauma must first be established, but if that is the case, is the Minister satisfied that it is caused by incidents involving the Defence Forces? What is his view of the suggestion that all Departments should sign up to an insurance link service to check if claimants have made previous claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmins has touched on a central point. He may have read in today's paper of other concerns regarding the compensation culture which is developing. It is not easy to determine where something was caused. Some 19 claims have been made against the Defence <Col N="565" /> Forces and each one will be dealt with individually.</P>
      <P>We are learning more about post-traumatic stress. At one time it was thought that the syndrome only resulted from major conflicts such as the Vietnam war but we now take a more enlightened approach to the condition. We are happy to develop earlier intervention mechanisms and better support services. It is proving extremely difficult to guarantee that only genuine cases come to the fore because of the way some cases are being dealt with in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information. I will obtain it and send it to the Deputy. I am aware of a number of cases where stress is alleged to have taken place while the soldier was serving with the UN but I do not know the proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that our commitment to peacekeeping will increase and our troops will be in increasingly dangerous situations, is the Minister concerned that there is no scheme for dealing with claims taken against the Defence Forces? We have had the experience of the deafness compensation claims, we now have 21 cases of post traumatic stress disorder and there is no reason this number will not increase dramatically. Should we not do what other armies have done and put a scheme in place to deal with these cases, for example, by means of a pension scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>All the options mentioned by the Deputy were considered in the context of the deafness claims. The cost of providing pensions would have been considerably higher than the cost of dealing with the cases in the way that we did. There is a range of options for which we must prepare. We must examine the essential nature of the support services which are provided and recognise that there is such an ailment as post traumatic stress disorder, that it can be caused by being in extremely difficult circumstances and that each one of us can react differently to it. Quite a number of people are engaged in other stressful activities and must deal with serious accidents, for example. We must find an appropriate way to deal with the matter in general.</P>
      <P>In answer to an earlier question, I said that the experience of seeing how the out of court environment works might help us to approach the cases in a way which would be more satisfactory to both sides. We will explore those options when we have more experience of how the out-of-court environment works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 29 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the question of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was the subject of a Private Member's motion and debate on 28 January 1999 in this House, culminating in the passing by the House of a Government resolution undertaking favourably to examine further Ireland's participation in PfP, taking into account the ongoing public debate. Any decision by the Government in favour of Ireland's participation in PfP would be submitted to the House for its approval and would make clear the nature and scope of such participation. The Government published an explanatory guide to PfP on 20 May 1999, as part of the preparatory process. This guide is widely available. Partnership for Peace was also the subject of statements in the House on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. In addition, individual states decide on the scope and extent of their participation in PfP activities and, in this regard, agree individual partnership programmes covering the activities to which they wish to subscribe. In Ireland's case, should it be decided to participate in PfP, it is envisaged that selected activities would include peacekeeping under a UN mandate and humanitarian and rescue tasks. These are activities in line with our traditional involvement and experience in these areas. These activities would also be reflected in Ireland's presentation document which would be presented to NATO upon signature by Ireland of the PfP <Col N="567" /> framework document. These matters will be addressed in detail in the coming months as will the question of resource implications. I would stress, however, that it is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations they are assigned from time to time and in line with the Taoiseach's announcement that membership of PfP will not lead to any increase in real defence spending.</P>

      <P>There have been two informal defence Ministers' meetings since I became Minister for Defence. On the margins of ministerial meetings, almost everything is discussed from time to time. We are not unduly influenced by what other countries might do. We have our own strengths, our own tasks to do and our military neutrality to protect. I have had consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and we are now embarking on the more serious task of working out the kind of draft document which will suit us in our deliberations on the question of joining Partnership for Peace. I will now begin the more serious part of working out the type of draft document which we think suits us in terms of our deliberations in joining Partnership for Peace. Of course, we will gain some experience from what has happened in other places, but we will not be unduly influenced by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is early days to outline specifically what will be contained in the document, as a negotiating framework must also take place. We are entitled to set out our own stall. We would like to influence the direction of certain aspects to military activities by participating countries and we might be inclined to include in the framework document some specific details on how the armaments industry is developing. We cannot be sure about this yet, but we do not need to show our hands openly at this stage beyond saying there are areas of very specific interest to us. The majority of countries in Partnership for Peace are not members of NATO. A consultative process is also necessary to ensure the right criteria are set out and efforts are made, as it is a major decision. We will keep our cards close to our chests for a little while longer.</P>

I urge the Minister to broaden the discussion. I welcome what the Minister said on including something on the armaments industry. This would be very important and I think the public would be greatly assured by it. How will <Col N="569" /> the Minister ensure there is a more open debate and that more information is given to the public on this matter? The demands for a referendum have been fuelled by a lack of information on Partnership for Peace.</P>

As far as I am concerned, we are an independent country and we have our own stall to set out. We will not be isolationist but rather will participate. We will not stand idly by when we see unspeakable atrocities being committed against people. We will do the best we can in an independent and open way. I will see to what extent we can have a more participative involvement in how things proceed. I will keep the House informed at every stage and I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be anxious to do the same. We have received very strong support for this measure in the House and people are entitled to know what is happening as soon as possible. We can have a further debate later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>A contract was placed by the Government Supplies Agency on behalf of my Department with Westport Clothing in October 1998 for the supply of combat suits in disruptive pattern material during the years 1999 and 2000. The requirement for 1999 was set at 13,000 smocks, 13,000 winter trousers and 33,000 summer trousers at a value of £979,000 approximately, exclusive of VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> However, Westport Clothing experienced ongoing difficulties in providing a sample of the specified fabric and consequently failed to meet the original delivery date of 1 February 1999. Because of the need to meet the extended delivery requirements of the Defence Forces to equip the UNIFIL battalion by September 1999, it was considered prudent by the Government Supplies Agency to place a supplementary contract with an alternative supplier. An order was, therefore, placed by the agency with Seyntex N.V., Belgium, in May 1999 for the supply of 4,000 smocks, 4,000 winter trousers and 20,000 summer trousers at a value of £476,000, exclusive of VAT.</P>
    <P>The agency has indicated that at present both companies are on schedule to supply garments in July-August 1999 for the UNIFIL requirement arising in September 1999 and to deliver the balance of the contracts, as scheduled, to the Defence Forces. The combined supply by both companies will satisfy requirements for 1999 and 2000.</P>
    <P>Both contracts were placed following a tender competition which included advertising in the Official Journal of the European Union. Westport Clothing submitted the lowest tender to meet the required specification and Seyntex N.V. submitted the second lowest tender.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The clothing is being made in Belgium but I understand the cloth is being made in Romania. The cost is £476,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will any effort be made by the Government to recoup some of the money it has paid out because of the extra order which was necessitated by the problems experienced by the first company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The first company is back on schedule to fulfil its element of the contract. Any outstanding balance arising from what happened can be examined once that work has been completed. Currently, I have no information about further difficulties. I understand Westport Clothing has ironed out its difficulties.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that there has been fairness in the approach to apprentices affected by the move of the apprenticeship school to the Curragh; if these apprentices are now behind in both their technical and military training; the action, if any, he will take to remedy the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 28 apprentices at the Army Apprentice School in Devoy Barracks prior to the closure of that barracks. Of these, 18 attended the Dublin Institute of Technology, either at Bolton Street or at Kevin Street, for the purpose of completing their final &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training module which consisted of ten weeks. These 18 apprentices are variously training as motor mechanics, carpenters and electricians. <Col N="572" /> They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January and completed it at the end of March. The remaining ten apprentices, who are training in electronics-communications, have relocated to the School of Signals on the Curragh. They will now complete their training in the middle of the year 2001.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the average cost of training an apprentice had reached the level of £100,000 per annum and this was clearly unsustainable. At the outset, when the closure of the apprentice school was announced, I gave an undertaking that every individual student would be given the opportunity to complete his or her training. I am informed by the military authorities that the new arrangements have worked satisfactorily and that the standard of instruction provided has been excellent. All the students will, as promised, complete their apprenticeships.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, in future, Army apprentices will attend at FÁS and-or regional technical college courses for their formal &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training. This is already the long established position with Naval Service apprentices. The apprenticeship needs of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are kept under constant review. Apprentices will continue to be recruited for specific trades and crafts, as and when required, in response to individual service needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the changes &ndash; the fact that the apprentices must travel to Dublin to complete their apprenticeships &ndash; involve extra cost on the apprentices? Did any of the teachers at the Army Apprenticeship School take up the option of going to the Curragh to continue their profession with the apprenticeships? I understand there were eight teachers involved. Did they all take the retirement option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the second part of the question first, two of the teachers are now teaching in the Curragh training school. The other eight are at a distance from me in the sense that negotiations continue with the Department of Education and Science as to the options they wish to take. I understand a voluntary early retirement scheme and other options are being put forward as well as the opportunity to teach in other institutions. These are matters which are the subject of continuing debate between the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the Department of Education and Science. My Department is at a distance from this but naturally, because they were in Devoy Barracks, I am anxious to see a reasonably quick resolution to the outstanding matters that affect those teachers.</P>
      <P>There would obviously be some costs involved for individual apprentices arising from the change. That ,of course, would have to be put in the context of the opportunities of all other apprentices in the country who are students in colleges. It would not be much different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the company in which he or she was employed, it would be fair to expect any person on apprenticeship rates of pay, who had to travel to further their education, to receive remuneration in respect of the cost. If such is the case for these apprentices, the Department of Defence should ensure the amount of money involved, however small, should be given to the apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Wall that I will have that matter examined. As I said originally, I want to put it in the context of the initial circumstances in that the cost per student provided by the State for the training of apprentices was astronomical and could not be sustained. Changes had to be made, and they were made. I will see if there is a way I may be able to cushion the apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked whether any of the apprentices are behind in their technical and military training as a result of the decision. Is this the case? Has the Minister taken action to compensate those students or to make sure they are not unduly delayed because of the decision? I understand a number of apprentices were badly affected by the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the outcome of the change has been highly satisfactory from every point of view. I met some of the student apprentices concerned and their parents. I cannot guarantee it would not take one or two months to complete training in certain cases. The guarantee I gave was that they would be in the position to complete their training. The situation appears to be satisfactory. The Deputy should bear in mind that I changed something which had gone very wrong. It was impossible to do that without breaking an egg somewhere.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 37, 38, 47, 51, 70, 72, 75, 93, 94, 97 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These questions fall into the category of those to which I have already given a comprehensive answer. I am happy to take further supplementary questions and the reply may be included in <Col N="575" /> the Official Report on the basis that the House is in agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>As I indicated to the House on 1 June 1999, the death of Private William Kedian and the injuries to Private Ronald Rushe and Private Darren Clarke on 31 May 1999 while serving with the 85th Irish Battalion in Lebanon were the subject of immediate protest by UNIFIL Headquarters, Naquora, to the Israeli defence forces who undertook to conduct an investigation at the highest level. A formal letter of protest was lodged by UNIFIL with the Israeli defence forces on 2 June 1999.</P>
    <P>A preliminary report was also forwarded immediately by UNIFIL Headquarters to United Nations Headquarters, New York. The United Nations Secretary-General condemned the attack. United Nations Headquarters conveyed a strong protest in the matter to the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations who had been summoned to United Nations Headquarters. A letter was also sent to the President of the Security Council with the details of the incident.</P>
    <P>At my request the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, summoned the Israeli ambassador to Ireland to Leinster House on 1 June 1999 to protest the matter to the Israeli authorities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed great concern at the loss of life and serious injury to Irish peacekeeping personnel and, on behalf of the Government, protested the incident of 31 May 1999 in the strongest possible terms. He also expressed the Government's grave concern at the pattern of recent incidents involving firing close to and at IRISHBATT positions. He insisted that there must be an immediate cessation of such incidents and demanded that the Israeli Government take firm action to prevent such targeting of the UNIFIL contingent. In response, the ambassador regretted the loss of life and injury and undertook to report to his authorities.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing escalation of hostile activity in the UNIFIL area of operations and the risks which this posed for Irish personnel serving there, I decided to visit the area from 20 to 22 June 1999 to see for myself the situation on the ground and, more importantly, to raise the seriousness of the matter with both the Israeli and Lebanese authorities and to seek assurances that the recent reckless shelling of IRISHBATT positions by the Israeli defence force <i>de facto</i> forces and the armed elements &ndash; Hizbollah &ndash; would not recur. To give an indication of the level of escalation, there has been a total of 38 firings close to IRISHBATT positions between 14 May 1999 and 25 June 1999.</P>
    <P>During the course of my visit, I met the Lebanese Minister for Defence and the Israeli Minister for Defence. I sought assurances from my Lebanese and Israeli counterparts that there would not be a recurrence of these recent serious shelling incidents. I indicated to both sides that, <Col N="576" /> while Ireland is committed to the UNIFIL mission, should there not be a cessation of such incidents, serious consideration would have to be given to the withdrawal of the Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>Arising from an incident involving an IRISHBATT position on 20 May 1999 which resulted in extensive damage to the post, including the destruction of a UN truck, I requested that the Department of Foreign Affairs protest the matter to the Lebanese authorities and on 3 June the Irish ambassador at Cairo, who is accredited to Lebanon, lodged an official protest with the Lebanese ambassador to Egypt. The Lebanese Minister for Defence expressed regret at the recent incidents and reaffirmed the gratitude of the Lebanese Government and people for the presence of the Irish UNIFIL troops. He assured me that the grave concern expressed regarding the present situation would be raised at Cabinet and with other contacts.</P>
    <P>During my meeting with the Israeli Minister for Defence I stressed to him the utmost gravity with which the Government regards the recent incidents involving Irish troops, including the death of Private Kedian and the critical wounding of Private Rushe.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, in an earlier incident in February last, Corporal Noel Roche and Private John Flaherty were injured when their post was fired on. Further heavy shelling on 10 June 1999 resulted in damage to Irish positions but, fortuitously, there was no loss of life on that occasion. On 11 June 1999, at my request, a further strong protest was lodged by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Israeli ambassador, following which the Irish ambassador to Israel also lodged a protest with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15 June 1999. In response to the very strong protest which I made, the Israeli Defence Minister said he was very disturbed by recent events in South Lebanon but that the situation was very difficult and very complex there. Referring to the Southern Lebanese Army, the Minister said that while they were trained, equipped and paid by Israel, they did not take their orders from Israel. He undertook that explicit instructions would be given to the SLA arising from my protest but that it was difficult to give full assurances regarding a cessation of firing incidents such as I had sought.</P>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me and to the Government. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions such as UNIFIL, it is my policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. Each post within the Irish UNIFIL area of operations has reinforced concrete bunkers specifically designed to withstand direct and indirect fire from heavy weapons. Rigorous operational procedures are in place to ensure that personnel occupy these bunkers in a timely fashion should the need arise. In such eventuality, minimum protected duty personnel remain in place to <Col N="577" /> ensure operational activity is observed and reported.</P>
    <P>Physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved. Irish troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister visited the Lebanon, how did he find the morale of the Defence Forces? Is he happy with the level of morale having regard to the tremendous pressure involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald and others were in the Lebanon some weeks before I visited it. I understand from chatting with them that they found the members of the Defence Forces in great fettle. I also found that.</P>
      <P>I was particularly anxious to visit the B Company, where the late Private Kedian had served. Obviously, that was an awful trauma, a big setback and a great worry to everyone. Notwithstanding that, I found them in tremendous form. It is a great tribute to their training and to their dedication and commitment that they had overcome that. Obviously, there will be memories and shock for a while, but they were back on duty. Of course it is important for their safety and security to concentrate on the job. In so far as one could say, they were extremely happy. One could not have been happy because of what happened, but morale was high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in paying tribute to the troops because the 85th Battalion, under Lt. Col. Pat Nash, has come under great pressure.</P>
      <P>On another occasion I expressed concern that there are many very young recruits involved. I would have the same concern in relation to Kosovo. The Minister reassured the House at that time that a balance between experienced personnel and new recruits would be maintained. Will he also give us that reassurance in relation to Kosovo? The pressures on young recruits cannot be underestimated in this sort of situation. We have seen it at first hand, and it is most demanding. I would certainly not want to cause undue worry to the families, but it is extremely important that recruits, particularly the new younger ones, have the support of older experienced officers and men in the Lebanon and in Kosovo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that in terms of the selection of the contingent, which first and foremost is on a voluntary basis, proper training and gearing up for whatever may be expected in the context of the mission will have the right balance. The Deputy should bear in mind, however, that if I were gauging reaction on morale, I would say that the older members were harder hit than the younger members of the Forces. There are obvious reasons for that. The Deputy underestimates some of those young people&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since UNIFIL was established in 1978, the Irish Government has lodged various protests with the Israeli and Lebanese Governments. To date this year, five protests have been lodged with the Israeli Government. The Israeli ambassador was summoned to Leinster House on 1 June following the tragic death of Private Kedian. Yet, as recently as 11 June, a further protest was lodged with the ambassador regarding a series of six close firing incidents involving the Irish UNIFIL contingent on 10 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One uses the available instruments in terms of calling in the ambassador and protesting to the relevant Governments. The circumstances surrounding these incidents are very complex. Notwithstanding that, there is no justification for what has happened. It is not possible to control everything, especially in a tense situation. The available options are limited. I assume the Deputy did not expect me to declare war. I was anxious to meet the defence Ministers and convey to them the seriousness with which we were treating the matter. I hope and pray my visit will have some effect because the past few months have been very tense, difficult and dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any decision been made on the overseas allowance which has not increased for many years? The Minister was involved in discussions on the matter. An increase in the allowance would be a practical way of showing we value the work of overseas troops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a very firm commitment this year, as I did last year, on the overseas allowance. Once the pay deal was dealt with, a new proposal was issued by RACO and PDFORRA and is currently in conciliation. I look forward to a speedy resolution of the matter, subject to negotiations with the Department of Finance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the position on the sale of the six barracks; the number of meetings he has had with local communities and councils in each area; and the projected value to his Department of the sale.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15 July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in ques<Col N="579" /> tion are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. With the exception of Clancy Barracks, which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been evacuated.</P>
      <P>The decision to close barracks was part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally. The purpose of the decision was to remove from the Defence Forces the burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations and to effect savings in relation to security and maintenance costs at the locations concerned. It was also designed to release troops for operational duties which would have a positive impact on the security duty capacity of the Defence Forces and free up resources for necessary re-equipment.</P>
      <P>Price Waterhouse consultants commented that 'security military tasks' were the highest consumer of military manpower at home. Essentially this activity is concerned with the military guarding, or otherwise securing, of its facilities. Troops engaged in this activity are not available for operational tasks. The high level of manpower involved in this area is partly a function of the excessive number of facilities occupied. All personnel affected by the closures were reassigned to other posts or were offered voluntary early retirement if they satisfied eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision of 15 July 1998 to dispose of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were subsequently evacuated. In addition to those initial meetings, I met Members of the Oireachtas and local councillors about Castleblayney Barracks on 3 February and 3 March 1999 and local councillors and officials from Naas Urban District Council on 3 and 10 March 1999 about Devoy Barracks, Naas. My officials met councillors and officials of Kildare County Council on 11 February 1999 about Magee Barracks, Kildare. Discussions also took place between my officials and officials of Cork County Council on 2 December 1998 about Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. Further meetings will take place as required.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Two of the barracks properties, Castleblayney and Fermoy, have already been offered for sale and a decision on the offers received will be made shortly. In relation to Devoy Barracks, general agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, which was <Col N="580" /> adopted on 19 May 1999, and will be put up for sale as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for accommodation of the refugees. Magee Barracks, Kildare, is currently being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>In relation to Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, a tender competition for the appointment of independent consultants to draw up an integrated action area plan for the future development of lands at the former Murphy Barracks has been completed by my Department. It is expected that the appointment will be made in the very near future, after which the successful firm will be required to submit an integrated plan within three months. It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>How close is the Minister to concluding the deals in regard to each of the six barracks? In view of the overall cost of security, the amount of money the Department will receive at the end of the day will be drastically reduced if we are not in a position to close the deals in the short-term. How far advanced is the 15 per cent of the sales which the Minister stated would be given to local communities and councils in each area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very close to concluding a deal in regard to Devoy Barracks, Naas, and Castleblayney Barracks. Delays will occur with Magee Barracks in Kildare as a result of the refugee situation. We are well advanced in Ballincollig and are very close to disposing of the lands at Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy. Clancy Barracks will be vacated by 1 July 2000.</P>
      <P>There is some misunderstanding in regard to security costs. Our figures indicate that the maintenance costs for these buildings, with the payment of security duty allowances, is practically equivalent to the security costs associated with security firms. The Price Waterhouse review spelled out that a great number of personnel was solely dedicated to securing buildings and should be on operational duties. The cost of security as against the total value of the properties will be insignificant in the long run.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister briefly referred to the cost of security duties and the drain they place on barracks resources. While I realise he cannot become involved in the nitty gritty day to day running of barracks, will he give a commitment to consider this issue? Archaic security systems are in place in many institutions, particularly military institutions, throughout the country. They place a drain on manpower and resources and it would make life easier for everyone concerned if a more enlightened view were taken.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time Deputy Timmins has pointed to necessary changes in the Defence Forces. More sophisticated systems, which are easier on personnel, are being utilised nowadays by many progressive companies. We must recognise the existence of such opportunities and reach agreement as quickly as we can. This is the progressive way to go and would release personnel for operational duties and UN activities. Too much pressure is being placed on manpower in terms of minding the house.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan, 1996-98, provides for an overall strength of 11,500 for the Permanent Defence Forces. It is my intention to maintain a policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies, as required, and I am satisfied that this policy will ensure the maintenance of an adequate strength. This figure of 11,500 comprises the following strengths for the three components of the Permanent Defence Forces: Army, 9,487; Naval Service, 1,089; and Air Corps, 924. The implementation plan also provides for special studies to be carried out on the Naval Service and the Air Corps, and Price Waterhouse management consultants were engaged to conduct such a review.</P>
      <P>The Government has now considered the final report from Price Waterhouse and has agreed, in principle, to the proposal that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multi-tasking-multi-capabilities and dedicated services, and that Government decision-making on equipping and staffing of the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be made accordingly. Arrangements are currently under way for the drawing up of implementation plans for both services which will give effect to the recommendations of the consultants' report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote in updating military equipment. Total amounts spent on weapons, ammunition, transport and communications systems as well as equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service over the past four years are as follows: 1995, £18 million; 1996, £20 million; 1997, £31 million; and 1998, £37 million. It is estimated that approximately £55 million will be spent on these areas this year and will include the following major items: a new fishery patrol vessel, due for delivery later this year; <i>LE Eithne </i>completed a half life refit earlier this year and <i>LE Orla</i> will undergo a similar refurbishment programme later in the year; the supply of 16 new turrets and 16 fire directing systems for fitting to existing Pan<Col N="582" /> hard armoured cars &ndash; the first two turrets and two fire directing systems were delivered and fitted last month and the balance is expected to be delivered towards the end of this year; the delivery of approximately 70 troop carrying vehicles such as four wheel drives and three quarter ton trucks, and a contract for the supply of up to 40 armoured personnel carriers. It is expected that a contract will be in place later this year and the first APCs should be delivered next year.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue and expand, where possible, the modernisation programme to ensure the Defence Forces are equipped to the highest standards appropriate to their roles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister intend to fund the peacekeeping operations in which the Defence Forces will be involved in Kosovo at a cost of £2.5 million and meet expenses that will arise if a decision is made to become involved in Partnership for Peace and other demands are made on the Defence Forces? Is it intended to use money raised from the sale of barracks and savings under the voluntary early retirement scheme for this purpose? The Taoiseach said that there would be no increase in Defence spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not say that there would be no increase in Defence spending. The intention is that over time the Defence envelope will hold its own against all other areas. There will be an increase each year. The value of the voluntary early retirement scheme is that it releases funds for other purposes. The first tranche will become available this year. There are a number of opportunities open to us, including the rationalisation programme and savings accruing from the closure of barracks, which will be considered to continue the programme of change and modernisation. We will as a result be well able to commit increased resources to the United Nations without damaging the fabric of the Defence Forces. Infrastructural development can continue apace. What we have been doing is keeping dilapidated barracks open when they should be closed and sold off. I will now be in a position to ensure the Defence Vote will have an impact. I will not have to compete with the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science in drawing down funds. We will have plenty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 53, 78 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The ongoing recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address any shortfall in personnel in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. Some 65 positions within the first intake of general service recruits in March-April have been allocated to the Naval Service. There will be a second such enlistment intake of general service recruits in September-October. Some 17 apprentices and four radio and radar technicians have been enlisted this year. Some 14 cadets will be recruited for the Naval Service from the 1999 cadet competition. The vast majority of technical staff vacancies which have arisen have been filled internally by promotion. Vacancies created in lower ranks consequent on these promotions will be filled by the ongoing recruitment programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the vast majority of the technical staff vacancies which have arisen have been filled internally by promotion. How many remain to be filled? Is it true that the Naval Service is under pressure to find senior staff with the required high level of expertise such as electrical engineers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There was major recruitment into the Naval Service in the late 1970s. Personnel are now entitled to leave on pension. The opportunities for employment outside the service have improved dramatically. This places pressure on us to find senior technical staff. The recruitment programme will help, although it takes time to train personnel. Approximately 135 personnel will be recruited this year. Some 21 personnel were recruited in 1996 and 60 in 1995. There is ground to be made up. I cannot deny that there are difficulties but we have to look on this as a challenge rather than anything else.</P>

      <P>The manner in which the Opposition parties have dealt with this matter has been nothing short of despicable. In a radio interview on 6 May Deputy Rabbitte said that Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty had good grounds under Article 35.2 of the Constitution which deals with the separation of powers for refusing to appear before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. He also said that he would not be in favour of the introduction of retrospective legislation, that Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty had been a highly respected judge of the Supreme Court and that to use the payment of a pension as a carrot to appear before the joint committee would not be correct.</P>
      <P>On 20 April Deputy Howlin said at column 478 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I do not begrudge fair play to anyone. Notwithstanding the conclusions reached by the Chief Justice, it is clearly appropriate that adequate pension provisions should be made for the judges who have resigned.</P>
      <P>It is clear from those contributions that the two Deputies concerned were supportive of the Government in what it is providing for in the Bill. It may not be popular to say this but I have no difficulty in supporting it. It acknowledges the tremendous sacrifices made by the three individuals concerned in resigning their positions. They have paid an enormous price for the wrongs they have done. Many are of the view that the price has been too high but their decision to resign must be respected.</P>
      <P>Like politicians and the banks, members of the Judiciary have become a target for the public. By and large, the Judiciary has served us well. It tends to be one case in a thousand which makes the headlines when judgments are made with which we might not agree. However, many of the courageous decisions made by judges in the past have given us the civil rights we currently enjoy.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill. It is fitting that these three people should receive pensions. Deputy Joe Higgins spoke earlier about the type of people who become judges. However, one cannot ignore the fact that for most, if not all judges, their appointment to the Bench means a massive reduction in income. Many of them are prepared to accept that in the best interest of the country and we must recognise that.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has not given proper consideration to the families involved. Names are bandied about in the House with little or no care given to the damage and hurt it causes these people. They made mistakes, acknowledged that what they did was wrong and resigned. We do not use the same standards for ourselves. It is important that there be some consistency when dealing with matters such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the three individuals, Hugh O'Flaherty, Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan, for the contribution they have made. They committed wrongs and paid a heavy price. We should not simply remember them for that one incident but take <Col N="586" /> into consideration, particularly in the case of the two judges, their long and distinguished careers. We should acknowledge their contribution and wish them and their families well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad to think that fine people such as Hugh O'Flaherty, Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan have resigned. The Opposition and the media brought this about. I wish to speak briefly on behalf of Hugh O'Flaherty, whom I know.</P>
      <P>For many years he served at various levels in the Judiciary where he fulfilled his duties with integrity and impartiality. He was admired and respected by his colleagues in the judicial and legal profession. He always administered the law with justice and fairness. He stood for what was best in the area of real values and morality. He was, and is, a person of compassion and understanding. In short, he was one of the giants in the legal and judicial profession.</P>
      <P>It was a great tragedy for the judicial system that Hugh O'Flaherty took the decision to resign his position in the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, the Opposition, the media and the vested interests that brought about this catastrophe have done enormous injustice to this decent and honourable man. They have destroyed a brilliant career with their snide remarks and innuendoes. They have caused deep hurt, insult, outrage and heartbreak to a great man and his family. I wonder if they thought about his family. Their aim, now, appears to be to utterly destroy the man.</P>
      <P>These people already have his head on a plate but they are not satisfied. They now want to persecute him further. I believe Chief Justice Hamilton's report is most unkind to Hugh O'Flaherty. Was there a hidden agenda in the report? Was there a reason for his harshness and severity? Were the circumstances used as an opportunity to remove an honest, honourable, upright and just man from a position of such importance? If that is so, it is a sad day for justice and for the retention of true Christian values in our society.</P>
      <P>The proposal by the Government to allow these gentlemen their respective pensions, following their resignations, is simply and solely an effort to give them what is rightly theirs. It is a recognition of their years of brilliant and outstanding work in the public service. It would be most unfair and unreasonable to attach conditions to the pensions and gratuities they have been allowed.</P>
      <P>I have listened to all of this debate. The Opposition speakers, let it be the &ldquo;Cahirciveen connection&rdquo; or the spokesperson, Deputy Jim Higgins, have been most unfair to these gentlemen.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the contributions of Government Deputies on this matter. Deputy Power described the comments of the Opposition as despicable and Deputy Matt Brennan said the Opposition was extremely unfair to the two judges.</P>
      <P>The nub of the issue is the fairness of the administration of justice. There can be no doubt that the report delivered by the Chief Justice to the House, while it did not explain the why and wherefore of what happened in the extraordinary Philip Sheedy case, made it clear that, in the view of the Chief Justice, both judges had been sadly lacking in the administration of justice and in ensuring that justice must not only be done fairly but be seen to be done fairly. Government Deputies want to have it both ways. The Government was prepared to impeach both judges, embarking on uncharted waters, only a few weeks ago. There is an element of hypocrisy in the comments of some Fianna Fáil backbenchers.</P>
      <P>When the details of this affair broke in the media, it generated the most comprehensive, even hourly, response from my constituents. Very often, senior citizens in my constituency of Dublin North-East, have telephoned in consternation and great anger at what they perceive as a perversion of justice. They have demanded that this House take action as soon as possible to prevent such a situation from recurring. Those citizens were correct in their fundamental approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years we have had many discussions on the issue of separating the powers of the Judiciary and the Executive, as well as on the <Col N="588" /> common law system of justice we inherited from the British. In a recent article, the former Deputy, Michael McDowell, made harsh comments on the civil law system other EU member states employ. A few years ago, in Italy, there were strong suspicions that a golden circle existed &ndash; with one law for the rich and another for the poor &ndash; providing jobs and emoluments for those who toed the Christian Democrat party line. Italy's legal system, however, involves an investigating magistrate or judge with investigating powers, to whom the police are responsible. It would be the best way to investigate matters such as those before us today.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Government effectively closed the door on any further inquiries into the Sheedy affair. This is hardly a surprise because last week it voted down a proposal from my party colleague, Deputy Howlin, for a public inquiry. The Government's intention to get shot of the affair has been apparent from day one and the legislation before us encapsulates the Government's approach. The Government's advice to avoid the possibility of an unprecedented impeachment seems to have been generally accepted, but it is not a view I hold.</P>
    <P>The Constitution, in its wisdom, provides for the accountability of the Judiciary to the Oireachtas in tandem with general operational independence. I would be keen to see that principle being given greater definition. To put it succinctly, does the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence in the operation of judicial functions apply to judges who, in the words of the Chief Justice, operate in a manner detrimental to the administration of justice? That is the key point of the issues before us.</P>

      <P>The net effect of this affair, it would appear, is that we have learned nothing. We know which judges acted and how they acted, but we still do not know why. The cynical view that there is one law for those with access to power and another for those without it, has sunk into the subconscious of more and more people. We must not confuse the declining interest in this issue in the media or amongst the public, with satisfaction that we as politicians have done our work. Rather, the public have made their judgment and in reality they expect a little more. They are not surprised at what has gone on. Both politics and the Judiciary have been damaged as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> The circumstances preceding the decisions the Government will force us to make in this legislation are so bizarre as to give rise to suspicions. The pension arrangements are extremely generous and would not apply to anyone else in any other profession, in similar circumstances. My colleague, Deputy Howlin attempted to establish on what actuarial basis the pensions were arrived at &ndash; £40,000 per annum for the former member of the Supreme Court, £30,000 for the former member of the High Court, and £15,000 for the Dublin County Registrar. There seems not to be a logical basis on which to allocate such extraordinary emoluments in these cases. They have been allocated, yet we still do not know why these men had to resign. We know what the Chief Justice thought of them and we picked up a general drift, such as that felt by my constituents, but we still do not know the reality of the matter. The former justice of the Supreme Court has had the temerity to refuse to be accountable to this House which appointed him in the first instance. That is the essential problem.</P>
    <P>We have no actuarial basis for the pensions and, even going on the age and past achievements of the judges, we cannot discuss how these figures were arrived at. The distinguished journalist, Mr. Gene Kerrigan, said that the Fianna Fáil Party has, as usual, come up with a way around a difficult new part of our administrative structure, namely the Freedom of Information Act. The way around it is not to write things down. The Minister is not even prepared to give any account of phone calls or other discussions as to how these figures were arrived at. It is an incredible situation, like something out of Kafka.</P>
    <P>It now appears that these figures were negotiated without any real assessment of the cost to the State. How else can one deduce the absence of any written records on the file prior to the Minister making his original statement in the House? This appears to be ludicrous and reeks of a party or parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, trying to put the issue to bed in a hurry.</P>
    <P>I wish to sum up where we are now and where the Government seems happy to leave this tragic affair. Two of the most senior judges in the country, one tipped as a possible Chief Justice, were forced to resign &ndash; an event without precedent. Despite negotiating generous pension arrangements over the phone with the Government, they refused to give any account of themselves to the representatives of the people, in this case the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. The Chief Justice, having completed the initial report which damned both judges in the eyes of the Government, suddenly discovers constitutional impediments to doing what has already been done. We are told that legal difficulties prevent the matter from being taken any further, although on that basis it seems to me that the Government should ask the Attorney General to hot foot it up to Dublin Castle and request the two eminent judges there to stand down their <Col N="590" /> respective tribunals. It is a nonsense. The Government has asked the working group on the courts to examine the issue of judicial accountability. Everybody seems to think it is a good idea and that it will not impact on the relationship between this House and the Judiciary. That will be left to another day and another crisis.</P>
    <P>As this affair is being so unsatisfactorily finalised, our thoughts must be with the family of the late Ann Ryan. Her death was the underlying tragedy which sparked all these events and which produced a scenario whereby many of our fellow citizens feel there is one law for the rich and one for the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing his time with me. We should not lose sight of the fact that this case arises from the death of a young mother who died as a result of reckless driving by a man who had exceeded the drink driving limit. He was a man who happened to be an architect and came from a particular background. That should not matter but clearly it had a very significant bearing on this case. Justice for the family of Ann Ryan &ndash; her husband, children and relatives &ndash; is at the heart of this matter. Everything we say must spring from that core principle. I have listened to statements here with increasing nausea when I think of what actually happened to that family, and the lack of accountability the Government has shown to them. We in the Labour Party have striven to find out why justice was not done in this case. Why did senior members of the Judiciary release Mr. Philip Sheedy? We have done our best from the Opposition benches to try to find answers, not just for the family but for the public at large. The Government, however, has taken a different approach. It is now putting the lid on the saga and is trying to close down the matter by speeding the Bill through the House at this late stage in the session. In the words of a former Member, the Government believes it can draw a line in the sand. The Labour Party does not accept this can be done. I do not accept this and neither do I believe, do the public, who deserve answers to the serious issues raised in this affair. This will not go away simply because the Government has decided to close down the debate in this House. The debate goes on outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Chief Justice rocked public confidence in the administration of justice. According to that report the actions of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty were &ldquo;damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo; and the manner in which Mr. Justice Kelly conducted himself &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;. Can anything be more damning than those two statements? In the wake of the report the Government made it clear to the individuals involved and to the public at large that it would begin proceedings to impeach both judges. There was a clear intention to proceed with impeachment. At that stage the Government believed the issue was so serious that the unprecedented impeachment of two <Col N="591" /> senior members of the Judiciary was necessary. However, in the following days both judges and the county registrar resigned.  </P>
    <P>What occurred in those critical days is surrounded by mystery. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has discovered that neither notes, a record or supporting documentation relating to the pension payments for the three people involved exist. That is not accountability. The Bill being debated is a direct outcome of those negotiations which we are expected to believe took place without so much as a quill being used to calculate complicated pension arrangements. I firmly believe the Government has a vested interest in battening down the hatches and bringing debate on the saga to an end. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>From the work of the Dáil committee and the report of the Chief Justice we now know what happened, the sequence of events and that the key players in the affair had widely different recollection of key events. We know how Philip Sheedy secured early release from prison but we do not know why. This question has to be answered.</P>
    <P>Instead of providing answers this Bill seeks to stifle debate about this important affair. The Bill will, in effect, reward the three individuals who resigned, those who were strongly criticised by the Chief Justice in his report and who brought shame and dishonour to the Judiciary, by giving them enhanced pension payments. It does not place any obligation on these individuals to account to this House or to a forum established by this House for their unprecedented and incredible behaviour. This Bill is nothing more than a shoddy attempt to sweep under the carpet an affair that has for the first time shaken public confidence in the Judiciary and left a lingering feeling that in Ireland there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor. It is outrageous that instead of protecting the public good the Government is intent on ramming this legislation through by hook or by crook.</P>
    <P>We have a position on how this matter should be dealt with. We believe a tribunal of inquiry with a limited and focused remit is the best way to get to the bottom of the affair. We also believe that the individuals who resigned should not received financial pay-offs until their co-operation for such a forum is secured. That is a reasonable requirement. I cannot think of any other area of responsibility where people are being treated in such a preferential way. This proposal which is reasonable and effective in terms of getting the answers we need was voted down by the Government at the committee.</P>
    <P>The Ryan family, in particular, and the public in general are again being asked by the Government to accept half truths &ndash; that one cannot look into the glass except darkly, that only God can judge. All of us in this House have a democratic mandate which we bear &ndash; I hope with pride &ndash; but it imposes certain requirements on us too. When things go wrong, when people fail, or act <Col N="592" /> wrongly we have a duty to ensure that the people who create these factors are made accountable, regardless of who they are, but particularly when they are senior members of a Judiciary that has a fine record but can only operate if it has the confidence of the public. This is damaging to the Judiciary as well as to public confidence. That has to be recognised.</P>
    <P>Accountability and transparency are issues the Government regard as optional extras. We have it now but not when it is difficult, when it means we have to go public on the serious events that took place, which are central to the way society operates.</P>

      <P>There is a question of honour and of public confidence in the Judiciary. That honour is in doubt. The Oireachtas has a duty to ensure public confidence is not misplaced or destroyed. The doubt will linger on because of what the Government is doing and because of its failure to meet the challenge. In effect there is unacceptable collusion. Nobody in this House has ever challenged the idea of the independence of the Judiciary. From the beginning of this crisis nobody has challenged the principle of the independence of the Judiciary. It is of fundamental importance to society, it has constitutional weight and we all recognise it must be protected. It has to rely on us being satisfied with the answers to certain questions otherwise it will not be true independence. How are judges appointed? How securely do they hold their posts? Is the level at which they are paid maintained? Do they hold other remunerative posts? Do they formally assert their independence before the people? How do they behave? Do they act independently in the courts and are they seen to do so? That question has not been answered satisfactorily in relation to these two judges. Putting them away, feeding them money to ensure the answers are not put into the public domain is not the way forward. It is not possible to keep the lid on what is a very central issue in society because these are special people. If a doctor is found guilty of malpractice, he would not be given a pension, particularly after six months in a position. Mr. Justice <Col N="593" /> Kelly had served for only six months in the High Court and yet he is given a pension.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Minister of State there a clear route which the Labour Party has pinpointed and pointed out to the Government. The failure of the Government to accept that route as the way forward is indicative of its approach in trying to preclude and to secrete what happened. We do not intend to give up on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 35.2 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.</P>
      <P>The independence and impartiality of the Judiciary is a fundamental cornerstone of our democracy. The existence of democracy depends to a large extent on the majority of the people having confidence in the institutions of the State and especially in the Judiciary and the courts. The courts and the judges have served the State well since its foundation. Even though judges have been appointed on the advice of the Government of the day, the proof of their impartiality and independence has often been seen when Bills referred to them have been held by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. At times this has proved to be awkward and embarrassing for the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>It has always been accepted that judges and courts were impartial and beyond influence, especially political party influence, and that the courts were totally independent. This independence was seen to be so important that it was enshrined in the Constitution. It is a matter of grave seriousness when two senior judges and the county registrar had to resign from office because of actions that, according to the Chief Justice, were open to misinterpretation, to say the least.</P>
      <P>I will take a different approach to this. When the Minister of State is ready he might like to listen. Both judges involved were learned men and had contributed enormously to the rule of law in the State. Their loss is great. They have lost as have their families and the State. Their learning, experience and skill should have continued to benefit us all for many years.</P>
      <P>In his last duty as a judge of the Supreme Court, Mr. O'Flaherty offered his resignation because, he said, the highest duty of a judge is impartiality as well as the appearance of impartiality. He offered his resignation so that confidence could be restored in the administration of justice. The Minister referred to errors of judgment in the handling of one case, but confidence has not been restored in the administration of justice by the resignation of the three prominent people involved in the Sheedy case. If anything, the resignations raised even more questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost certain the former judges would have been impeached if they had not resigned. If they had been impeached it would have been <Col N="594" /> unprecedented. Furthermore, pensions would not have been paid. They would probably have lost everything. By resigning they at least hope to guarantee their pensions. Was this the gun that was put to their heads in the unwritten agreement?</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that the legislation is rooted in past events which, he said, resonate in the present and have implications for the future. He is anxious to brush the matter under the carpet and to focus only on the future. The Minister rightly said: &ldquo;We must now look forward and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that confidence in our judicial system is fully restored.&rdquo;  However, it will not be possible to look forward until the events of the past are completely dealt with. The Minister also said it would be grossly unfair to dismiss years of sterling service because of errors of judgment.</P>
    <P>How could such eminently clever, experienced, wise and learned men make the same error of judgment? One, or even two people might make an error of judgment but for three of the most learned people in the land working together to make the same error of judgment at the same time raises very serious questions. The most important of these questions is, why?</P>
    <P>In introducing this legislation the Minister and the Government are trying to push the past under the carpet. This is grossly unfair to the three gentlemen involved because the Government has not made any effort to allow or encourage them to explain why they did what they did. This will mean that in the history of the State and the Judiciary, a doubt will hang over the integrity and good name of the people involved. They should at least have been given an opportunity to explain why they did what they did and to answer that vital question.</P>
    <P>More importantly, confidence in the judicial system has not been restored. If anything, the affair seems like a cover up. Could not the Minister have delayed this legislation until the autumn and given all sides more time to reflect and to think about the implications? Instead, by trying to rush it through the House in the last week before the summer recess, the Minister has raised even more questions about the Government's reasons for introducing this legislation in this manner.</P>
    <P>Government backbenchers are very concerned about the good names of the former judges. Why not allow them explain their actions and redeem their good name? Mr. O'Flaherty said on a number of occasions that he did not do anything wrong and he still maintains that. Prior to his resignation he offered to appear before an Oireachtas committee on a voluntary basis to put his case and answer questions. However, inexplicably, after resigning he said he was barred from doing so because of constitutional impediments. Did he make another error of judgment in offering to come before the committee or was some other pressure applied to prevent him from doing <Col N="595" /> so? I believe he is making an error of judgment in not appearing before an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>These are the question that are in the public domain and that remain unanswered. If the Minister has his way they will be covered up and forgotten about after the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, according to advice received by him, it would be unconstitutional for legislation providing for these pensions to make payment dependent on complying with a requirement that the former judges provide some explanation or self justification or make themselves available to give evidence before an Oireachtas committee. The Minister is anxious not to dwell on this matter. He calls it a fruitless exercise which, he says, would only cloud debate on the detail of the Bill. While he is anxious to debate the detail of the Bill, he is avoiding consideration of the justification for the Bill.</P>
    <P>Why should the people concerned receive pensions? They have resigned in disgrace. Did they resign to avoid impeachment and to guarantee their pension payments? The Constitution allows for impeachment of judges for stated misbehaviour or incapacity. Impeachment proceedings would have necessitated a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, including probably a lengthy debate on the reasons both judges should be impeached. The Government was anxious to avoid such a debate. There is not any procedure that I am aware of for judges to defend themselves before the Dáil or Seanad acting as judge and jury. Was it the case that Mr. O'Flaherty, in offering to appear before an Oireachtas committee, was trying to avail of an avenue to put his side of the story prior to impeachment proceedings being initiated in the Dáil or Seanad? If he did get such an opportunity his thoughts and rationale would be available to Members during the Dáil and Seanad impeachment debate. However, in what the Minister calls the resignation agreements &ndash; they are unwritten agreements &ndash; the former judges have reached with the Government there seems to be an unwritten proviso that neither should appear before any Oireachtas committee. The Government appears to be determined that neither former judge has the opportunity to put his side of the story.</P>
    <P>In the midst of this we must not forget that a young mother was killed because of the reckless driving of a drunk driver. Three eminently learned people made the same &ldquo;error of judgment&rdquo;, to quote the Minister, which resulted in the early release of this man who had consumed more than the legally permitted level of alcohol. The early release might not ever have been discovered except that Mr. Sheedy was spotted and Mr. John Ryan asked questions, and persisted in doing so.</P>
    <P>I began by discussing the importance of maintaining the impartiality of the judicial system in the eyes of the public. The Sheedy affair, as it has become known, is one example where the administration of justice was compromised. Was this an <Col N="596" /> isolated incident? A chance meeting in the street uncovered what the Minister calls errors of judgment. It may be that the three gentlemen in question acted out of humanitarian interest and with the best motives. However, they have not been allowed to put their case.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Sheedy case last night, the learned Deputy O'Kennedy put up a number of legal roadblocks to stymie every avenue the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights has tried to follow. Many questions remain unanswered. The three learned gentlemen resigned in disgrace and have not been given the opportunity to put their point of view. The Government has not made any effort to facilitate the two former judges in this matter. It appears it has done everything to ensure they do not put their case. When the history books are written the names of O'Flaherty, Kelly and Quinlan will surely figure in the texts that detail the end of the millennium in Ireland, as will the actions and inaction of the Government.</P>
    <P>Many unanswered questions in the handling of the affair by the Minister and the Government will also be written about and future scholars will look back at this episode and series of events and speculate about the answers that might have been. The Government has done a great injustice to the people concerned by not allowing or facilitating them and by rushing to cover up.</P>
    <P>The two former judges involved in this case had distinguished and promising careers. Why did they decide to take such risks? What motivated all three of them to become involved in the same error of judgment? Did they not know that what they were doing was legally and morally wrong? However, the implication that they had been paid or bought off for reasons unknown will remain in the annals forever and will be another chapter in the history of Fianna Fáil and GUBU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition's proposal is to decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill until such time as the two former judges referred to in it give a clear undertaking that they are prepared to make themselves available to answer questions following whatever course of action is recommended by the House on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister has previously stated that he has received clear advice that it would be unconstitutional to include in legislation providing for pensions or payments to judges or former judges any provision that such payments would be dependent on the individual judges complying with a requirement that they provide an explanation or justification or make themselves available to give evidence before an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No undertakings were given to either judge before they resigned. However, they were subsequently informed that the Government would introduce and support such a measure. This unfortunate and unprecedented situation must <Col N="597" /> not plummet into complete and utter disorder. Some contributions by Opposition Deputies demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of the legislation. The proposed postponement of the legislation is an effort to get around the constitutional difficulties. I assure the House that the Government will have no hand, act or part in such a manoeuvre. Neither will it play fast and loose with the Constitution in this matter. The gave its word that this legislation would be brought forward and it has put it before the House. The Government will fulfil its word, it has a moral obligation to do so.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by a number of Deputies about the reason the Bill should be delayed. Deputy Shatter suggested that it could be introduced in the autumn. However, the former judges have dependants and young families. Deputy O'Keeffe proposed the postponement of payments for a number of years. The Government recognised the grave circumstances that arose and decided that letters of unprecedented substance should issue to the two judges. The men were accountable and resigned. However, we must not lose all sense of reason. The Bill was not brought forward in haste and to delay it further would be completely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made a preposterous allegation that the Government is trying to hide behind something in this case. There has seldom been such an issue on which Government has been more forthcoming and open in its response. Three detailed reports have been made available to the Oireachtas; a series of debates has taken place in both Houses; and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights has reported on the case. This is not the action of a Government that wishes to hide behind something or sweep it under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche made a valid point that Mr. O'Flaherty provided a fulsome explanation of his involvement in this case to the Chief Justice. Deputy Jim Higgins<i></i>also described the report of the Chief Justice as &ldquo;clear, unequivocal and decisive&rdquo;. At what point do we decide that explanations are adequate and comprehensive to allow for the progression of this legislation? At what point do we decide that we have transgressed far enough into the independence of the Judiciary and the sensitive area of the separation of powers?</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the lack of understanding demonstrated by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputies Broughan and McManus. I am surprised at their misunderstanding of the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Dáil. That was borne out when I asked both Deputies during their contributions what they would do? Deputy Broughan replied that he would hold a public inquiry and a Garda inquiry. The joint committee was the best forum to look to for a judgment in the case and it decided that a public inquiry would serve no purpose. The Garda and the DPP, having considered the matter, adopted the view that a criminal investigation <Col N="598" /> was not warranted, and that remains their position. I fail to understand the proposals put forward by those two Deputies, who I expected to have a better understanding of the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the dimensions of the pensions reflecting the losses incurred by these men by their resignations. As the Minister said in his opening contribution, it is a common feeling among Members that persons with whom this legislation deals have paid a heavy price in terms of financial loss, anxiety and strain, which they have borne over recent months. It must be acknowledged that, apart from the events resulting in this legislation, each of the three men made valuable contributions to the administration of justice. I endorse the remarks of a number of Deputies about their contribution.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Jim Higgins's statement that Fine Gael does not have a fundamental problem with the payment of pensions to three men. A number of Deputies, including Deputy Howlin, referred to the levels of pension provided for in the Bill. Deputy Howlin suggested that they are too high and that it is more appropriate to apply rates which are based on the actual entitlements of the judges at the time they retired. Such a solution is not the right course to follow for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy's principle were to be applied, it would mean that in the absence of legislation Mr. O'Flaherty could not be paid anything until 26 March 2005, Mr. Kelly until 7 June 2013 and Mr. Quinlan until 10 January 2019. These are the legislative requirements under the current scheme which only allow for deferred payments at the appropriate retirement age. The people involved and their families, therefore, would not be in receipt of any pension income in regard to their years in the public service for a considerable time. Does the Deputy want to put those families through such hardship?</P>
    <P>The rates of pension which have been provided are, of course, higher than the deferred rates and are payable from the dates of resignation, but they do not include any provision for the payment of lump sums to which the people involved are entitled, albeit some way down the line. This factor must also be taken into consideration when assessing the level of pension payments in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The net financial loss suffered by the judges is another important factor. This can be estimated by calculating the actuarial value of the pension provisions in the legislation and subtracting this from the total value of their current entitlements and the value of their loss of earnings up to retirement age. Taking these figures into account, the net loss amounts to £637,000 for Mr. O'Flaherty and £1.039 million for Mr. Kelly. These are substantial amounts of money.</P>
    <P>These people have paid the ultimate price in terms of their careers, and their families have also suffered. Accordingly, it will not be necessary to invoke procedures which no Member would have <Col N="599" /> welcomed. The pension payments provided in the legislation go some way towards addressing the various elements which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Howlin, McManus and O'Keeffe, stated that it is not valid to compare the actuarial value of the judges pensions if they had served their full terms with their current position. Deputy Howlin made a comparison with that of a Member of this House who lost his or her seat in an election. He stated: &ldquo;I cannot think of any other walk of life in which two senior officials who resigned in the wake of such severe criticism would receive such generous settlements.&rdquo;  I remind the House &ndash; in doing so I do not wish to rake up old coals in respect of the person involved &ndash; that on 30 May 1995 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, informed the House of a severance package to the then senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office. This package was agreed by the Government in the wake of the Brendan Smyth case. I will not go into much detail about that statement but suffice to say that as well as an enhanced payment the person involved also received an enhanced lump sum. At the time Deputy Bruton defended the Government's decision on the basis that the person involved had acted in error and he had provided good service to the State during his public service career. Those comparisons speak for themselves. Above all, this is an example of the hypocrisy displayed by members of the Labour Party during the debate. They were part of the Government which made that decision. They did not appear to have a problem then, but they appear to have a major one now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also placed on record the Government's view that &ldquo;court challenges were very likely. Such legal challenges could absorb a great deal of valuable time and money for the State and the results would be unknowable.&rdquo;  I emphasise the word &ldquo;unknowable&rdquo;. The comparisons are clear in the matter before the House, particularly in respect of the unprecedented nature of the events surrounding this legislation and the uncharted path of impeachment.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and Howlin raised the question of written commitments. My colleague already informed Deputy Howlin, in response to a parliamentary question on 5 May, that no undertakings whatsoever were given verbally or in writing to the two judges in regard to the pensions they would receive either before or after their resignations were received. The House is aware that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty resigned on Saturday, 17 April and Mr. Justice Kelly on the following Tuesday, 20 April. Due to the urgency of the matter in the context of the particular constitutional process being contemplated by the Government, several discussions took place during those days. In the case of Mr. Justice Kelly, there were discussions between his legal team and counsel for the State in relation to pension <Col N="600" /> entitlements. Those discussions were inconclusive and were broken off prior to the resignations.</P>
    <P>No undertakings were given, verbally or in writing, in respect of the pensions to the three individuals before or after their resignations were tendered. No undertakings could be given as it was a matter for the Legislature to provide for such pensions. I reject in the strongest possible manner the insinuation by Deputy Broughan that the officials and legal representatives of the Department concerned did anything improper in the negotiations which took place but were not recorded. It is a serious charge to make against officials or legal representatives. It is particularly serious to suggest that this is the way the Fianna Fáil Party does business. I reiterate that the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party had no involvement whatsoever in the discussions; it was entirely an official matter.</P>
    <P>The reason there are no written records in the Department on the calculation of the pension amounts prior to 20 April is that most of the discussions on the issue took place over a weekend and were conducted mainly on the telephone. Officials in my Department discussed the matter with Finance officials over the telephone and one of my officials, in turn, held discussions over the telephone with counsel for the State. It must be emphasised that what was being discussed was not what the Government should decide in relation to pension entitlements, but what proposal should be put to the Oireachtas. It was accepted at all times and clear to all concerned that the actual decision would fall to be made by the Oireachtas. There are written records in relation to the publication of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of a clear absence of accountability. I contend that both judges involved in this case have been fully accountable for their actions. They have been accountable to the extent that it was necessary for them to resign. It is clear that mistakes were made and grave consequences arose for those concerned. The Government fully recognises that the judges should be accountable and took the only action open to it, giving notice of possible impeachment procedures. The responses of the judges were honourable. They accepted what must have amounted to a devastating personal consequence. They ensured that a potential constitutional crisis was avoided. I fail to understand some of the comments made by some Opposition Deputies during the debate. They misunderstand the position.</P>
    <P>The accountability of judges was considered recently by a working group on the courts commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham. The sixth report of the Denham group dealt with, among other matters, judicial conduct and ethics. The group examined the issues surrounding judicial conduct, such as judicial independence, its fundamental nature in the context of the rule of law and the procedures adopted in other countries relating to the handling of judicial conduct <Col N="601" /> which might be considered unsuitable for a member of the Judiciary. It recommended the establishment of a judicial committee and on publication of that report, such a committee was established by the Chief Justice in April this year. It had its first meeting on 19 May last.</P>

        <b>: </b>We oppose this section. This is the section of substance. It effectively approves an index linked pension of £40,000 for the former Supreme Court judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, £30,000 for the former High Court judge, Cyril Kelly, and £15,000 for the former County Registrar, Michael Quinlan. Fine Gael does not have any objection in principle to the payment of these pensions. These judges served for varying lengths of time in the courts over which they presided. Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty had an illustrious career in the Supreme Court going back to 1991. Mr. Cyril Kelly had an illustrious career in the Circuit Court and, latterly, in the High Court. While all three gentleman resigned and saved the Oireachtas considerable trauma in terms of not having to bring forward impeachment proceedings, too many questions have been left unanswered.</P>
      <P>The former Supreme Court judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, initially wrote to the committee, which was presided over at the time by Deputy Monica Barnes, offering to appear before it to make a full statement and answer all questions. At that time, Mr. O'Flaherty was a serving judge in the Supreme Court. The committee acceded to his request and wrote to him. In the interim he resigned and he is now claiming that he cannot come before the committee because this would trespass on judicial function. I made the point that there was no exercise of judicial function. He simply had a chance meeting in Herbert Park with family friends and was asked to intervene in the listing of the case. He intervened and for that he stands indicted. In the words of the Chief Justice, he &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;. There was not a judicial function involved.</P>
      <P>We have made the point repeatedly that it is illogical for Mr. O'Flaherty to claim while he was a Supreme Court judge that he was willing and able to come before a committee, answer all questions and make a statement, yet, having resigned, he finds it is not constitutionally permissible for him to do so. He was not exercising a judicial function; one might say he was exercising the dog. He was taking a walk when he happened to meet somebody who asked him to intervene. There is an obligation on Mr. O'Flaherty to come before the committee and answer the unexplored aspects of the case.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kelly is in a different category. We do not expect him to explain anything that transpired within the precincts of the courtroom but there is no constitutional impediment on Mr. Kelly answering questions in relation to the lead-up to the case, the approaches that may have been made to him, the manner in which he believes he has been or could have been compromised by virtue of contacts made in relation to the manner in which he might have handled this case. We also need a clear explanation as to the contradiction implicit in the version of events of Mr. Kelly as against the version of Mr. Justice Joseph Matthews.</P>
      <P>There are too many unanswered questions and until such time as these questions are explored and fully determined, this House should not vote on the proposal to give the three gentlemen in question pensions for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>We have paid tribute to Mr. Michael Quinlan for his willingness to come forward and explain his role. He has written to the committee on two occasions. On the first occasion he set down a set of circumstances he would like to see brought about to enable him come before the committee. On the occasion of the second letter, he said he was prepared to come before the committee without any preconditions. The same level of co-operation that has been forthcoming from Mr. Quinlan should be forthcoming from the two judges before we accede to the Government's request to vote this legislation through the House to give them their pensions.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Higgins in this. The Opposition is extremely dissatisfied with the lack of response from the Government side on the report laid before the House yesterday from the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. That report suggested alternative ways forward in terms of either the committee examining the issue or establishing a tribunal of inquiry. The response from the Government was a nice biblical quotation about seeing through a glass darkly but that did not throw any further light on the Sheedy case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins said, there are many unanswered questions in relation to both Mr. <Col N="605" /> O'Flaherty and Mr. Kelly. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, indicated on Second Stage that he had made a request under the Freedom of Information Act in relation to how the figures for the judges' pensions were arrived at and for the documentation in the Department. There were no details of the arrangements for both judges. In the case of Mr. O'Flaherty, at the age of 67 he would have been entitled to a pension of £26,000 per annum and a gratuity of £79,000. Instead, at age 61, he is getting a pension of £40,000 per year. Mr. Kelly would have been entitled to a pension of £17,000 per annum at 65 and a gratuity of £51,000. Instead, he will receive an annual pension of £30,000 at 51. The former registrar would have been entitled to a pension of £11,500 at 65 and a gratuity of £34,7000. He will receive an annual pension of £15,000 at 45.</P>
    <P>These are generous arrangements and seem to have been worked out in detail in the Department, but there seems to have been no information on paper regarding them. We are now being asked to pass this Bill, which would rubber stamp what was agreed. I do not know how this was agreed, as there are no documents recording that. Why are there no documents to show how this was worked out in such detail?</P>
    <P>We are being asked to pass this Bill with no satisfactory answers about this case. We need to be told how this case could have been be relisted and how subsequent events occurred, given that it all started with a chance meeting with a judge walking his dog. There have been no satisfactory answers to that question and many others have been left hanging. This case reflects upon the administration of justice, given that those who do not meet judges when out walking may not have the same chances as those who do. I am not necessarily suggesting that is the conclusion one should draw from this case, but until such time as more light is thrown on this matter, that suggestion is in the air. It is essential, in moving forward, to get clarification on what the constitutional reference to the exercise of judicial functions means. We also need clarification on how answerable judges are to the law when not exercising their judicial functions. It is unsatisfactory that we are being asked to nod through this Bill, given the derisory response on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night.</P>

      <P>This section will allow the Government to pay pensions to the three people concerned. Nobody would deny a person a pension if he or she had worked for it and if incapacity forced him or her to leave a job, as provided for in the 1961 Act. However, these three people are not leaving their jobs due to reasons of incapacity as we understand it, such as ill health. The Minister said last night it is time for us to accept this reality and to move on from this episode, as if it were an episode of &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;. This was not just an episode. It goes to the operation of our justice system in a fundamental way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report, the Chief Justice said Mr. O'Flah<Col N="606" /> erty's intervention in relisting the case was in the spirit of humanitarian interest. If so, why was Mr. O'Flaherty so unwilling to come to an Oireachtas committee and explain his humanitarian motives and why he felt he had to help someone for those reasons? If the Chief Justice felt Mr. O'Flaherty did what he did for humanitarian reasons, I cannot understand why he will not come to the committee. Mr. O'Flaherty clearly understood what the Chief Justice meant and was willing to come before the committee before he resigned. As Deputy Higgins said, he was not willing to do so afterwards. That defies logic and clarity. Why was Mr. O'Flaherty willing to explain his humanitarian motives when a judge and yet, when no longer a judge, he said his lips were sealed and that the Constitution forbade him from attending the committee? If ever there was a contradiction, this is one. If he claims the Constitution stopped him, it would have been a much more relevant argument when he was still a judge than when he resigned.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kelly had a good reputation as a judge in the Circuit Court and in his short time in the High Court. I am disappointed he felt he could not explain his motives to the committee. If his motives were good and if, as he tried to explain in his correspondence with the Chief Justice, there was nothing wrong with his handling of the case, what was he afraid of? What was he afraid of from Deputies O'Sullivan, Barnes and Jim Higgins as well as the other committee members? What did he have to hide? We are getting no explanation and must sail into the sunset with the Biblical quotation &ldquo;For now we see through a glass, darkly&rdquo; in mind.</P>
    <P>We will never know what happened and fundamental damage has been done to the system of justice. If an ordinary people are not happy with what happens in court, they will say they did not speak to the right person. They will say they did not have the right dog to take for a walk or meet a judge in the right park, which is unacceptable. I am not saying people have a basis for saying this, but they will say so, and we have heard it already. My post has increased greatly since the Sheedy case, with letters from people who believe that not everything was done in cases that concerned them and colleagues have told me the same has happened to them. I do not understand why these judges were so reluctant to appear before the committee. It is a pity, given the service they gave to the State, that they have allowed this dark cloud to remain over the justice system by not coming clean.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the Government because we heard the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform say they wanted to give time to those concerned to give explanations. Suddenly, however, it is time for us to accept this reality and to move on from this episode, in the words of the Minister. Why the change of face? Why did the Tánaiste say on the Order of Business that she would demand answers when there is not a sign of a Progressive <Col N="607" /> Democrat for this debate? There is no sign of an objection to this happening without our knowledge. That is why the Opposition is so angry with the Government.</P>
    <P>When this was announced on 20 April, the Government had agreed to the pensions but there was no mention of the fact that the law had to be changed. I had already consulted the 1961 Act and could find no reference to a mechanism whereby people leaving their jobs for reasons other than incapacity could be given pensions before reaching pension age. The Minister of State slipped a line into her speech that night when she said the Minister had outlined the severance terms to which the Government was and is prepared to agree. The sentence continued, &ldquo;.and which would be brought before the House in due course for approval.&rdquo;  It took the Opposition to ferret out the fact that this needed new legislation and the Government had to come to the House afterwards with its hands up and say &ldquo;Goodness me, we forgot to tell you we need legislation.&rdquo;  The Government assumed the House would rubber stamp this legislation before the committee or before the ink was dry on the Chief Justice's report. It was trying to pull a fast one, which is the only way I can describe it, and that has added to the sense of disquiet generated by this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power referred to how awful the Opposition was for criticising the judges, given the pain their families have suffered. I understand the pain the three families have suffered and it was difficult for them to live through what they did. However, none of this would have happened if a young mother had not been struck down and killed by a car taking off and landing on the roof of the car she was in, injuring her children and leaving her husband bereft of his wife and his children bereft of their mother. That is what we should remember.</P>
    <P>We feel some sympathy for the families of the judges because the cases gained a great deal of publicity, but they must accept the consequences of their actions, just as politicians do. A woman is dead and a young man who took too much drink and caused the accident received an appropriate punishment. Following legal advice he succeeded in having the sentence reviewed and his term of imprisonment shortened. He then tried to give the impression that his legal advisers had acted without his knowledge in seeking a review of his sentence. I do not believe a solicitor could take such an action without informing his client. The young man subsequently went back into court and, in 90 seconds, had his sentence suspended. The woman is still dead. The man is still without his wife and their children will grow up without the help and support of their mother.</P>
    <P>We are now subjected to the Government telling us to face reality and to move on from this episode. It will not be time to move on until the Government does its job and finds out from the judges why they did what they did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" />  I have some sympathy for the county registrar, Mr. Quinlan, who misguidedly tried to protect a Supreme Court Judge. The power of a Supreme Court Judge is illustrated in the way the county registrar did not tell all the facts to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on three separate occasions and left the Minister within a hair's-breadth of giving wrong information to the House. As a former Minister for Justice, I know how appalling it is to come into the House wrongly briefed or not fully briefed. Nevertheless, on a human level, I can understand Mr. Quinlan's actions. He was trying to protect a Supreme Court Judge, who now owes Mr. Quinlan an apology for placing him in the position of feeling obliged to remain silent and not say who had asked him to relist the case.  Why did Mr. Justice O'Flaherty find it impossible to come to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights after he had resigned when it had been so easy before. Perhaps he thought that by doing so he could have saved his job. For the sake of his reputation and of his family, who must have suffered greatly, he ought to have appeared before the committee. Was he casually walking in the park? Did someone suggest that he walk in the park at that time? These questions have not been answered and many rumours and innuendoes have been repeated.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to quote St. Paul. We need a Pauline conversion. The Government must realise that it has promised the House that information and an explanation would be forthcoming. There is a danger that this can happen again.</P>
    <P>I realise that the pensions will be the only ones of their kind. They have been granted, not because of sickness of incapacity, but because of actions which were inappropriate and, in one case, bad for the course of justice. Is the Minister concerned that in granting these pensions for very specific reasons we have created a precedent? We will find it very difficult to refuse similar pension arrangements to judges or senior civil servants who wish to return to private practice or retire early. An assistant secretary who has not actually been found guilty of misdeeds may choose to save himself and his family embarrassment by retiring. How can he or she be refused a similar pension arrangement? If a higher civil servant is obliged to retire because of incapacity, six and two thirds years are added to his or her pension payments. A civil servant who is only 45 would not qualify for a pension. This Bill has created a precedent and I do not believe the Govenment has sufficiently examined its implications.</P>
    <P>I know of no other instance when three people who were found by the Chief Justice and the Minister to have acted inappropriately had a Bill passed to accommodate their specific needs. We remember the controversy which surrounded the passage of legislation to accommodate the Goodman difficulties in the summer of 1993. We are now discussing pension legislation for three people who have not been able to explain what <Col N="609" /> they did, why they did it and what were their motives. Their motives may have been benign but we do not know, because they will not tell us.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, who is a barrister, must hear what is being said in the Law Library. This case has left a cloud over the legal system. The Director of Public Prosecutions has had to repeat his direction to people acting for the State not to enter into behind-the-scenes discussions or deals. Justice must be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister had not rushed this legislation through the Oireachtas before the Committee's recommendations had been examined.</P>

      <P>I will tell Deputy Owen a few home truths. Mr. O'Flaherty provided a full explanation of his involvement in this case to the Chief Justice. Deputy Jim Higgins, whom I commend for the measured way he has dealt with this issue, described the report of the Chief Justice as clear, unequivocal and decisive. In a response to another member of Deputy Owen's party the Chief Justice said, &ldquo;In my letter dated the 25th ultimo to the secretary of your Committee, I stated that I was unable to accede to the Committee's request to make further inquiries into the circumstances surrounding Philip Sheedy's release from prison.&rdquo;  Either Deputy Owen misunderstands the fundamental division between the powers of the judiciary and the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not misunderstand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or she is playing a serious game of stroke pulling.</P>
      <P>It is quite distasteful that Deputy Owen and one or two other Deputies have attempted to drag the tragic death of Ann Ryan into this debate. I find that quite upsetting. The legal advice received by the joint committee of the Oireachtas &ndash; this also concerns a misunderstanding between judicial and non-judicial functions &ndash; appears to suggest it has the authority and power to question a judge in connection with non-judicial functions. I also understand from the report of the committee that it considers an amendment to that legislation could provide that judges and former judges could not be compelled to give evidence in relation to the exercise of their judicial functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We all understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee rightly pointed to the serious difficulties which may follow from such a course of action. Judicial and non-judicial <Col N="610" /> functions cannot be easily categorised, particularly in the context of handling a court case. If the amendment was included in the compatibility legislation, further questions would have to be resolved, such as who would decide in any particular circumstance what constitutes a judicial or non-judicial function. Would the committee or a Minister certify that the actions fall within the judicial category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would taking one's dog for a walk fall into that category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it ultimately be a matter for resolution by the court where there is a difference of opinion regarding classification? Does the Oireachtas committee or a Minister have the authority to adjudicate on issues such as whether a particular matter relates to judicial functions?</P>
      <P>The fundamental point is that the independence of judges does not simply mean they cannot be required to answer questions. It also affects the position whereby the payment of their pensions may be made dependent on their doing so. A judge's independence is not something a judge or the Oireachtas can waive.</P>
      <P>I wish to put a simple, straightforward question to Deputy Owen regarding one of the points she made. She sat around the Cabinet table when the Cabinet decided to make a package available to a former member of the Office of the Attorney General, then the senior legal assistant. The package was agreed by the Government in the wake of the Brendan Smyth case. At the time Deputy Bruton defended the Government's decision on the basis that the person involved had acted in error and had provided good service to the State during his career in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton put on record the Government's view as follows: &ldquo;court challenges were very likely and such legal challenges could have absorbed a great deal of valuable time and money for the State and their result would be unnoble&rdquo;. I emphasise the word &ldquo;unnoble&rdquo;. I put it to the House that in the matter before us, particularly in respect of the unprecedented nature of the events &ndash; this is where Deputy Owen above everybody else is getting her figures mixed up &ndash; surrounding this legislation and the uncharted path of impeachment, the comparisons between both cases are very clear.</P>

        <b>:</b> There is invariably an attempt to hold up the Constitution as a prohibition, cloak and deterrent in relation to anything we might do. Despite what the Minister said we <Col N="611" /> are not anxious to play foot loose and fancy free with the Constitution. However, there is a lack of clarity in the matter. We do not know whether a challenge to the constitutionality of any role of any inquiry, be it a committee of the House or a tribunal of inquiry, would be successful. This is why we should not shirk from taking action. The matter should be fully tested in all its angles and aspects before the High Court, the Supreme Court and the European Court if necessary so that if an unfortunate event such as this involving a major judicial controversy arises in future we will have certainty in relation to how we should handle it. We should not shirk our responsibility in this regard. We should meet the challenge head on rather than always saying there might be a constitutional challenge. A constitutional challenge can be mounted to anything. When tribunals are set up, people are in and out of the High Court and it and-or the Supreme Court makes a determination. This provides clarity and allows tribunals to proceed. In relation to this issue we have an unprecedented situation where one judge compromised the administration of justice and another damaged the administration of justice and did not conduct the matter in a manner befitting a judge.</P>
      <P>I am amused by the allegations from the other side of the House in relation to the role, in the words of Deputy Matt Brennan, of the media and the Opposition, that we hounded these two honourable gentlemen out of office. In both cases the Chief Justice said they had compromised and damaged the administration of justice. The Chief Justice said Mr. Kelly did not conduct the matter in a manner befitting a court case. These were not the comments of the Opposition but of the Chief Justice, a peer of the judges who carried out a calculated evaluation of the role of both gentlemen. He decided that both had damaged and compromised the administration of justice and that their positions, therefore, were untenable. The Government, not the Opposition, gave effect to this conclusion in the context of Article 35.4.1º of the Constitution. Following a Cabinet meeting the Government decided to write to both people and tell them in the clearest possible terms that unless they resigned the Government would have no option but to bring impeachment proceedings under Article 35.4.1º of the Constitution. Therefore, the Opposition and the media had no role in relation to the course of action which transpired and to try to blame the Opposition and the media for highlighting and raising the matter in the Dáil in order to ensure the Government did what had to be done is not fair and does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not in a vengeance mood or part of a vendetta. We accept that there have been heads on plates, as somebody said today in a rather ungracious way. We are talking about establishing the truth and to say the matter has been concluded because both gentlemen fell on their swords is not sufficient. We need to know the <Col N="612" /> roles of the other players, whether they were main players or bit actors. We need to know, for example, what Mr. Ken Anderson has to say. Allegedly, he is the person who approached Mr. O'Flaherty in Herbert Park. He was in the company of Mr. Sheedy's sister. We want to know what she had to say and what role she played. We want to know the role of Mr. Sheedy senior. One can understand the anxiety of a father whose son is facing a protracted spell in prison and that he will do everything he can to ensure his son is released at the earliest possible date. He played a central role in making contacts and we need to know what contacts he made, who he contacted and what level of contact there was to ensure this high level of preference was accorded to his son.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor we need to know who phoned Ms Eileen Creedon when the case was mysteriously promoted from No. 19 up the list resulting in her absence from the court room. We want to verify whether this call was a decoy or some unhappy coincidence. We need to know the roles of the other officials involved, including those from the office of the Circuit Criminal Court and County Registrar, all of whom are named in the report of the Chief Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

        <b>:</b> Finally, we need to know the role of the different political people involved. For example, we need to know the role of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Lenihan, former Deputy Jim Tunney and Senator Don Lydon who submitted the two psychologists' reports. We must establish whether this was a bizarre set of unrelated coincidences which led to the maladministration of justice or whether somebody orchestrated the entire sad saga.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of the debate on Second Stage of the Bill which deals with a matter of principle, I felt compelled to declare an interest. The interest I declared was that I have been a member of the Bar since 1961, a member of the inner Bar since 1973 and a member of the Benches of the Kings Inns, which is the governing professional body for all practising barristers in respect of which judges are members as judicial benchers along with Bar benchers like me. I felt compelled to do that lest there be any implication that I was concealing from the House any interest I might have as a consequence of my interest in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we deal with this aspect of it, I also feel compelled to make another declaration, that is that I have known each of the three persons concerned in different ways and to a different extent for some considerable time. I have known former Supreme Court judge, Mr. O'Flatherty, since I was called to the Bar in 1961. He was just one year ahead of me. Anyone who had the privilege of knowing him, either as a member of the Bar or <Col N="613" /> as a distinguished member of the Supreme Court, would have known that he was highly respected and regarded both for his humanity, his interest in individuals and, above all else, his interest in introducing young members of the Bar to the principles and administration of justice. I recall many of those who now sit on the High Court gathering around Mr. O'Flaherty's bench in the Law Library. On one occasion I recall mentioning to him that I found it impossible to consult him &ndash; he reminded me of Plato in the groves of the Academy with all the disciples gathered round trying to learn the principles of law from him. That is the man who is at issue in one of these cases, a man who has been highly respected not just nationally but internationally also as any inquiry of highly qualified significant members of the US Bar, the Australian Bar and many others would show. I am sure the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is aware of this. Mr. O'Flaherty has always been recognised as a constitutional lawyer of the greatest eminence and balance.</P>

      <P>It may be a mystery. Mysteries, by their very definition, sometimes remain unexplained.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Flatherty had the privilege and opportunity of practising before what was regarded as the most eminent Supreme Court the State ever had, that is, the court presided over by the late Chief Justice, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, the late Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, Mr. Justice Henchy, Mr. Justice Griffin, &ndash; I forget who else was involved &ndash; as well as the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Tom O'Higgins. It was not doubted that his qualification in the constitutional and jurisprudential area was almost unique. That is what commended him to the Government when his appointment came up for consideration.</P>
      <P>For what it is worth, if this has any impact on the views of Members of this House, his acceptance of the great honour of being elevated as a relatively young man to the highest judicial office in the land outside that of the Chief Justice, also meant accepting quite a reduction in his income as an eminent practising senior counsel. Anyone who has any experience of the Law Library will know that to be a fact.</P>
      <P>Some of those who sit in the High Court had access to Mr. O'Flaherty from time to time to consult his views. He did not set himself up as the arbiter and only judge of all things but he has always been highly regarded wherever he served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having taken a considerable reduction in income to serve &ndash; and nobody in this House will suggest that a Supreme Court judge's income is not adequate &ndash; much of what he would otherwise have earned, had his illustrious career as a member of the Supreme Court continued, will not be available to him now. The Minister stated this clearly. For reasons which I am not contesting <Col N="614" /> although there could be other arguments, the lump sum provision and other things which would have arisen for him will not now arise. That is a simple fact.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I look to see the basis of the argument. I have dealt with Mr. O'Flaherty but perhaps I should deal with the other two judges at this point. I did not know former High Court judge Mr. Cyril Kelly at the Bar. I certainly did not know him as a colleague at the Bar and when I returned to the bar he had been appointed to the Circuit Court. Incidentally, I remember that when he was appointed to the High Court I attended the usual reception. I could not but know, with some degree of gratification, that more than half of those who were present for that celebratory event were prominent lawyers who were well known members of the party opposite who obviously had a special regard for Mr. Kelly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be said so that we will know exactly the people with whom we are dealing. Not having known him, I resumed practise at the Bar some four or five years ago. When one returns to a profession having been away as long as I was away, one cannot just pick and choose work but must do whatever one can to get reintegrated into the range of the practice and procedure. I found myself more than once before Mr. Kelly in the Circuit Court. Given the nature of and the huge proliferation of cases continuing like an unstemmed tide in his court, it would not have been possible for any judge in this or any other jurisdiction to deal with them all. Unfortunately, the level of crime in this city was such that one would never get to the end of it. Mr. Kelly was known and appreciated by all. I practised before him on two or three occasions and he always did his work very properly and competently. He would consult when he was unaware whether on an arraignment the accused would plead guilty or not guilty and the consultations were always conducted properly. The representatives of the DPP, the defending counsel and the stenographer would meet in Chambers because some of these things can be done more expeditiously in that way and records of all conversations were kept properly. In the light of that consultation, Mr. Kelly would be able to reach a conclusion on what might be his position in the event of a plea. That was the manner in which he expedited the course of justice and, as one who did not know him and who had no part in his appointment, I found him as a judge to be entirely efficient, human and extremely effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another person concerned in this issue. I did not really know him but I knew, as anybody practising in the Four Courts would have known, that Mr. Michael Quinlan was highly regarded and ordered in everything he did. There were occasions from time to time when one or other of us wished to know when a case would be taken. Inquiring about something like that is standard <Col N="615" /> procedure and does not pervert the course of justice. He was known to be one of the most efficient and courteous members of the administration. I presume Deputy Owen would confirm that from her knowledge of him.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with three people who, in different ways, have lost considerably, both in terms of their personal standing and financial position and in other ways. The Chief Justice found that they compromised the administration of justice and we do not need to go back over that.</P>

      <P>No. The Deputy should wait a moment. I did not interrupt the Deputy. I am not saying it is not a serious matter and that it was not damaging to the interests of justice. Those are very serious matters. The Chief Justice reached a conclusion in his report. I formally invite Deputy Higgins to withdraw the remarks he put on record in the House last night. The terms of the Chief Justice's report were very clear. Deputy Owen asked what was being said in the Law Library. I can tell her what is being said in legal circles about the Chief Justice being dragged into this matter. I will quote extracts from the Deputies' statements in the course of my contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes understandably stated in the course of her report that &ldquo;.all options were fraught with constitutional or legislative difficulties .&rdquo;. Had she examined the committee's terms of reference, that would have been very clear. The committee was taking on, and demanding, a role to which it had no right. There was not anything in the committee's terms of reference which entitled it to make the demands it made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barnes should learn to contain herself; the Fianna Fáil Party practices that discipline. Having stated that all options were fraught with constitutional and legislative difficulties, Deputy Barnes proceeded to say that &ldquo;.with that in mind, the committee decided to write to the Chief Justice.&rdquo;. I do not find her remarks as offensive as others that were made. The committee decided to write to the Chief Justice and request him to make further inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the Sheedy case. On the one hand, the committee pointed to constitutional and legislative difficulties and, on the other, breached the very principles which form the fundamental bedrock of the Constitution, namely, that of the separation of powers. The Chief Justice's report is on record. If Deputy <Col N="616" /> Higgins does not withdraw his remarks, the Ceann Comhairle should ask him to do so. He stated that &ldquo;.in essence, the Chief Justice said that justice was perverted in the Sheedy case and that the two judges involved played key roles in the perverting of justice.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is able to dream up quotations the Chief Justice never made from his fertile imagination, he could obviously easily dream up offences which are not known in our law in any event. Having asserted that to pervert the course of justice was a criminal offence, Deputy Higgins went on to say &ldquo;.in such circumstances, where there is clear evidence of a criminal offence.&rdquo;. What is happening to contributions in this House when Members can proceed from introducing terms which the Chief Justice never used to establishing an offence which was never mentioned? In my view, it would be nothing short of treason if someone perverted the course of justice while serving on the Bench. However, nobody perverted the course of justice and nobody found it to have been perverted.</P>

      <P>I have a high personal regard for Deputy Higgins.

      <P>&mdash;I quote a further comment in which he stated: &ldquo;Mr. O'Flaherty must be rendered accountable for the very serious charge of which he stands indicted by the Chief Justice&rdquo;. Is the Deputy aware of the meaning of the term 'indicted'? An indictment is a very formal and serious charge for a criminal offence. Indictments are presented by the DPP. Deputy Higgins stated that Mr. O'Flaherty must be rendered accountable &ndash; as every citizen who breaks the law should be &ndash; for the very serious <Col N="618" /> charge of which he stands indicted by the Chief Justice. It would be very wrong for the State to fail to act if an ordinary citizen deliberately perverted the course of justice.

      <P>As if the Chief Justice had not been sufficiently drawn into matters with words being put into his mouth, Deputy Higgins stated:</P>
      <P>Similar to other members of the joint committee, I am deeply disappointed that the Chief Justice has declined to resume his inquiry into the Sheedy affair. He claimed that it would be &ldquo;constitutionally impermissible&rdquo; and &ldquo;improper and inappropriate&rdquo; for him to make any further inquiries into this matter at the request of the committee.</P>
      <P>With due respect, the Chief Justice was absolutely correct. He does not need my opinion to vindicate his decision. Anyone with the vaguest notion about judicial function would know that it would not be the role of the Chief Justice or anyone else to co-operate with the committee.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins went on to say:</P>
      <P>The request was motivated in the first instance by an acknowledgement of satisfaction with his original report and, second, with a view to allowing the Judiciary and the bar to deal independently with the issue themselves rather than having judges subjected to scrutiny by an outside or extra-judicial body.</P>
      <P>The Bar will deal with the matter as it always takes responsibility for such issues. I was under the impression that the committee intended to get an external body to look into the matter. I understood that a suggestion was made to get a judge from another jurisdiction to consider it.</P>
      <P>In a very critical reference to the Chief Justice, Deputy Higgins proceeded to state that &ldquo;.not alone did the Chief Justice decline this option but his curt response to the series of valid questions put to him by the committee was unhelpful and discourteous&rdquo;. Have we lost the run of ourselves? The joint committee had no proper role or function in the matter which was not referred to it by the Dáil for consideration under its terms of reference.

    </Speaker>
    <P>If he wanted to plead constitutional grounds, he should have done so in advance of writing his report at the Government's request. Having carried out his investigation into the conduct of the two judges while they held office and <Col N="619" /> published his report on 14 April it is illogical and contradictory for him to try and argue that it is constitutionally impermissible for him to inquire further into the matter when both individuals are no longer judges.</P>

      <P>The joint committee, which was chaired by Deputy Eoin Ryan, undertook its task in accordance with the terms of reference agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. At no stage was it suggested that it was acting outside its terms of reference. Is Deputy O'Kennedy aware of the depth of concern and anxiety among the public about where we are at? The reason the joint committee was encouraged to seek answers to serious questions was that Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty indicated in an interview that he was willing to appear before an Oireachtas committee to answer any questions put to him. How then can Deputy O'Kennedy condemn and arrogantly insult the joint committee by suggesting that it insulted the Chief Justice by taking this task unto itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking a rational explanation and acutely <Col N="621" /> aware of the separation of powers, the joint committee attempted to ascertain how far it could go within the parameters of its terms of reference with the voluntary co-operation of the individuals concerned. I express my anger at the attitude adopted by Deputy O'Kennedy to the members of the joint committee, the majority of whom come from his side of the House.</P>
    <P>The reason the committee, with the agreement of all sides, applied again to the Chief Justice was that it was most impressed that, constitutionally, he appeared to be within his rights in responding to the Government and undertaking the task of interviewing the chief participants in this unfortunate event and presenting a report to Government. Our approach to the Chief Justice, despite the insolence the Deputy thinks the committee displayed in making it, was based on our logical belief that if the Chief Justice, within the parameters of the Constitution, could start the task, perhaps he could, within the same legal and political parameters, finish it in a way the committee could not.</P>
    <P>I would not like to think there was such a division between the institutions of the State that it would be seen as insolent or arrogant on the committee's part to address itself to the Chief Justice on an issue of such huge concern to him, the institution he represents and to Members of this House. Is the Deputy suggesting there is such a chasm between us, that we should not even have the temerity to address him? With that positive and productive attitude, the committee approached the Chief Justice. I wonder if the Deputy read the contents of my letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I then proceeded to say to the Chief Justice, not with the intention of putting him in a difficult position, that due to the difficulties that he, more than most, knew the committee was encountering and given that he had been able to produce such a good report, could he, in the event that he might not be able to complete that report, advise the committee as to how it could proceed. Is the Deputy suggesting that the committee is bringing itself into a position of contempt by asking this of the Chief Justice, who was fully and centrally involved in trying to resolve the same issue the committee was attempting to resolve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last matter I wish to raise is one which <Col N="622" /> should be debated either within the All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution or in this House. An interesting point was raised during our legal briefing. We did not act as idiots or as blind fools; we got an extraordinarily good legal briefing from a highly respected senior counsel. The Deputy, by making his allegations against the committee, is also more or less denigrating the briefing the committee got and&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;under which the committee acted at all times. Something of huge interest and importance arose. It was pointed out that the Article in the 1922 Constitution which provided for the separation of the judicial and political spheres merely referred to functions. The 1937 Constitution, however, was careful to specify judicial functions and there appeared to be a good reason for that. The interpretation could be, therefore, that judges in areas other than strictly judicial functions could and should be accountable and could be asked questions within that parameter by the committee or anybody else without it interfering in their judicial functions.</P>
      <P>The work carried out by the committee was done with concern about and consideration for the constitutional separation of which everybody is hugely aware. We were desperately trying to resolve something and get the answers the people really want. Above all, we did this work in a spirit of minimising both the hurt to everybody and the fall-out which this terrible event has had, first, on the Ryan family &ndash; we will continue to mention this because that family will continue to live with what happened to them &ndash; and, second, on the career and family difficulties and traumas suffered by other people as a result.</P>
      <P>I am proud of the committee's work and I am disappointed that the Oireachtas did not accept what the committee asked it to do.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - National Infrastructure and Settlement Plan: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy John Bruton on 29 June 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting that it will be necessary to build some 40 per cent more houses over the next ten years than currently exist;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting that current rates of house price increase represent a crisis for individual families and a serious threat to pay moderation and economic growth;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting the requirement to balance com<Col N="625" /> mercial and residential development to ensure that suburban developments contain office and commercial space as well as housing, and that centre city developments should contain a proportion of affordable housing so that traffic flows in both directions and transport facilities are used efficiently;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting the requirement to plan and develop new cities and centres of population to redesign the physical shape of the country in order to ensure infrastructural problems are overcome in an environmentally sustainable way;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting that public transport is underfunded, underutilised and insufficiently competitive;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting that the planning process is now hopelessly slowed and deadlocked by objections to development and that some objections can best be overcome if the facilities to support new housing, such as roads, public transport, well-maintained play areas and childcare facilities are put in place at the same time as new houses;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting with concern the fact that some potential objectors to developments are either funded by competitors or are bought off by interested developers;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting the failure of the Government to produce a coherent national waste management plan which is central to any coherent national plan for housing;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; noting the failure of the Government to adequately address the traffic problem affecting all parts of the country;</P>
    <P Just="Center">is of the opinion that at current and foreseeable rates of growth in housing demand, Ireland is facing a housing and infrastructural crisis; and calls on the Government to tackle the looming housing and infrastructural crisis as a single project and to produce a national infrastructure and settlement plan which would decide future development patterns, to be under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and be invigilated on a weekly basis by him, so that all our people are housed in places that are accessible to where they work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes with approval:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the increased levels of funding in 1999 relative to 1997 for infrastructure such as national roads, up by 30 per cent to a record £337 million, non-national roads up by 40 per cent to a record £242 million &ndash; in addition to which local authorities are providing a further £81 million &ndash; water and waste water up to 70 per cent to a record £275 million <Col N="626" /> and housing up almost 46 per cent to just over half a billion pounds;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the comprehensive range of initiatives taken by the Government to maximise and expedite housing supply and secure house price stabilisation which have resulted in the moderation in house price increases in the last six months;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the record level of new housing output of 42,349 in 1998 and the 21 per cent increase in output during the first four months of 1999;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the announcement of a four year multi-annual programme of local authority house building to provide an additional 22,000 houses over four years;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the announcement of a Commission on the Private Housing Rented Sector;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the initiatives taken in relation to the provision of affordable housing;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the publication of draft Guidelines on Residential Density to make more sustainable use of development land while ensuring a high quality living environment;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the Serviced Land Initiative which will provide serviced sites for over 100,000 additional housing units, and the Rural Towns Initiative;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the publication of Strategic Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area to provide an integrated land use and transportation strategy and a framework for future infrastructural investment;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the Government's decision in principle to draw up a National Spatial Development Strategy;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the success of the Government's negotiations on Agenda 2000 and the consequent attainment of Objective One status for the Border, Midland and Western regions;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; that a major new Bill reforming and consolidating the planning code will be presented to Dáil Éireann shortly;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the additional resources deployed to cope with the increased number of planning applications in local authorities and appeals in An Bord Pleanála;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the Government's commitments in relation to the Dublin light rail project and Exchequer capital funding for bus and rail investment;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the measures being undertaken, in the framework of the Dublin Transportation Office</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; Short-Term Action Plan and otherwise, in relation to traffic in Dublin in the period to end 2000;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the publication of a new policy state<Col N="627" /> ment on waste management, Changing Our Ways, to provide a national framework for local waste management plans;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the new Urban Renewal Scheme and the proposed scheme for the renewal of smaller towns;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash; the Government's adoption of public-private partnerships as a means of procuring infrastructural services;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and calls on the Government to continue to implement and further develop these policies to ensure that the population have access to adequate housing, that Ireland's infrastructure is brought up to the standards required of a modern, rapidly growing economy during the period of the forthcoming National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006, and that physical and economic development takes place in a sustainable and spatially balanced manner.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and I congratulate the Fine Gael party on tabling this motion. All is changed utterly, Yeats wrote about the events of Easter week 1916 which ultimately defined Irish politics for the rest of this century. The era ushered in by those events is coming to a close. It is a era defined by political division on the national question and economic under-achievement. It is not a coincidence that the prospects for peace and reconciliation on this island and economic growth have come relatively simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Obsession with the national question represented a tendency to look backwards and not forwards. Hopefully events elsewhere today will put in place an important building block to the future. Even so, there should be no complacency about the challenges ahead. Politics is, in one sense, a cruel business and yesterday's achievements become just that. There is no time for a pat on the back or relaxation.</P>
      <P>This society, even as it grows and develops, faces major difficulties. Alongside economic growth and affluence there is still poverty and despair. Poverty and despair have been an integral part of the Irish experience this century but things are different now.</P>
      <P>For the first time ever we have access to the level of resources needed to tackle some of that despair if we choose to do so. There was a time, and it is not too long ago, when people on the left of the political spectrum were told they should stop worrying about the share-out of the pie and concentrate on the baking of it. In my view we have come full circle. The baking of the pie is proceeding nicely and it is time to actively consider its share-out. Continued economic growth is important and, in part, that is what this motion is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without investment in housing, transport and <Col N="628" /> traffic, the continuation of the economic circumstances that we have seen in recent years will be endangered. The Government, unfortunately, seems frightened by the challenges ahead rather than prepared to grasp them.</P>
    <P>It is timely to have this debate on the day applications for shares in Telecom Éireann close. That sale, one of a series being contemplated by the Government, will generate literally millions of pounds for the Exchequer. Unfortunately, the Government shows no signs whatsoever of knowing what to do with it. The sultry programme for public private partnerships and the ineffectual amounts of money being talked about for the national development plan, indicate a Government and a Minister for Finance simply unprepared for the future. It is, perhaps, understandable that a generation of politicians, of which I am one, might be frightened by the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>During the 1980s economists and experts screamed at us that all things public were bad and that spending by the State was the worst of them all. They are changing their tune now but I fear the Minister for Finance has been indelibly scarred by those days. Nobody will thank us for funking this challenge. Those on housing and hospital waiting lists must sit and wonder at the callousness of a Government that leaves them there while generating surpluses in the region of £1.5 billion this year alone. The current account surplus is greater. Those figures do not include provision for the receipts from privatisation of which two have been decided this year. Nobody, least of all me, is calling for feckless investment. Like the motion before us, I have called for an integrated and spatial plan to chart out Ireland's future in the next decade, a decade that must become the decade of investment.</P>
    <P>What I expect, however, is a realisation from the Government that we have in our grasp the kind of choices simply unknown to previous generations. Let next year be year zero in more ways than one. Let it be the year that we decide to begin to put to an end to the social divide that is the cancer in our society today. Let it be the year in which we close the door on the confines of the past and embrace an ambitious future. Acceptance by the Government of the spirit of the motion before the House would be a start. Its performance to date has not been good. It has balked at the big questions and tinkered with the small ones. No other Government in living memory, not even its immediate predecessor, has sat down at the beginning of a year and planned a budget surplus of the magnitude of this year's budget surplus.</P>
    <P>The allocation of resources in a time of plenty is often more difficult than in difficult times. It requires ambition and imagination, two commodities that are sadly lacking in this Administration. It is surely time the Government attempted to display one of those commodities. That will be the choice facing the electorate at the next election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I bring to the attention of the House, as the closing date for applications for Telecom Éireann shares was 4 p.m. this afternoon, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will have on his table on 31 December a sum in excess of £55,000 million in cash. The figure of £1,000 million is more tangible than the figure of £1 billion. I put it to the House, having dealt with what is required to be done in the Estimates and in the current account expenditure, that the Government and the Minister for Finance will have £55,000 million on 31 December. That sum is virtually equal to the amount this country received in the past six years from the European Structural Funds through the decisions arrived at in Edinburgh in 1992 and signed off in Brussels in July 1993. The greatest single tragedy facing this country now is that a Government with that scale of resources has not the slightest idea of what to do with the money, how to invest it, how to allocate it or how to ensure that new found wealth, which all of us have helped to put together, is reinvested in a manner that can eliminate some of the scars of poverty and inequality that have marked this country since our independence and which can be eliminated if the political will to do so exists. That is why the Labour Party supports this motion from the Fine Gael Party. It calls on the Government to accept the spirit of the motion and to introduce plans with imagination and ambition, which the country now requires.</P>

      <P>I have read the motion carefully, but I have heard nothing from the Members on the other side of the House to indicate they have any new policies or solutions to meet the serious infrastructure deficit, other than to ask that the Taoiseach to call weekly meetings on the matter. By contrast, in its two years in office the Government has been taking effective action across a wide range of issues. Some of these are spelt out in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Following the negotiation of a successful deal for Ireland under Agenda 2000 and the fruits of sound economic policies, the National Development Plan, 2000-06, gives us a great opportunity to address the infrastructure deficit once and for all. The Government is determined to do this in a radical way and the Deputies will see this when the plan is published. The Government has established a Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructural development chaired by the Taoiseach. This will ensure that over the next seven years political priorities are afforded to the implementation on the ground of this major programme of work and that individual projects are not unnecessarily delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> Last night Deputy John Bruton expressed his concern at what appeared to be an emerging objector culture, which has the potential to delay major infrastructural and housing projects that are needed for the public good. This is a very worrying trend at a time when we are trying to build up our infrastructure and to ensure that the fruits of economic growth are spread more equally throughout society. While projects must be subjected to rigorous analysis to ensure they meet our objectives while protecting the environment, we need certainty and finality. The Cabinet sub-committee will examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the Labour Party's Commission on Housing. In December 1994 Labour Party Ministers took up office in two Departments of key influence in relation to housing, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance. Four years and four months later it launches a report on housing. Why, when Labour Party Ministers held office in these two Departments for two and a half years did they not take action to address the problems that were clearly developing in the housing area?</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House with a point by point critique of the Labour Party's Commission on Housing, but I must take issue with certain aspects of it. What is presented is a wish list of miscellaneous items which lack coherence. Many are, at best, of only marginal significance to the central issues affecting the housing market. For example, fair price certificates may sound a very worthy concept but their introduction can only involve house price control under a new guise. A similar approach was tried in the past but it proved ineffective and in many ways counter productive. It would not cause a single extra house to be built, indeed, it could retard housing supply as would inevitably be the case if it gave rise to an elaborate bureaucratic process. It could, therefore, conceivably have the opposite effect to that intended.</P>
    <P>Possibly the most damaging illusion the Labour Party is attempting to sell is the fiction that real housing needs can in some magical way be met through legislation. I am afraid that legislation will not build a single extra house. However, ill-conceived legislation could prevent the building of houses.</P>
    <P>Independent commentators agree that the key to affordable housing lies in increasing supply, yet when Labour Party politicians have the opportunity to do something practical about housing policy, such as zoning adequate land, they are frequently found lacking. They do not have the courage to stand up to the anti-development lobby and zone land to meet the needs of people.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said it is well recognised that once it takes hold, house price inflation can be difficult to rein in. However, the Government has succeeded in doing that. Over the past six months, second hand house prices in Dublin have risen by only 2 per cent compared with an <Col N="631" /> increase of almost 25 per cent in the preceding six months.</P>
    <P>Government actions have played a major role in achieving the slow down in house prices. That is a very significant achievement against the background of continuing economic growth and low interest rates. I, therefore, urge the House to support the amendment to the motion calling on the Government to continue with its good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>As any Deputy will recognise, there are major problems in housing and traffic, especially in the Dublin area. These two issues have reached a crisis point. However, neither of them has crept up on us unnoticed. Both were predictable, given the increased population, the higher employment rate and the rate of return of our young educated emigrants.</P>
      <P>It is hypocritical of the Fine Gael Party, backed by the disingenuous Labour Party, to condemn the failure of the Government. They did not recognise the trend, foresee the problem, invent an infrastructure or plan for any of the solutions. By contrast, the Government has risen to the challenge, identified the needs, initiated some solutions and responded to the economic demands. I would be the first to recognise that much more needs to be done, especially in the two areas of housing and traffic.</P>
      <P>The immediate implementation of the Bacon report has resulted in an increased output in housing of 42,000 units in 1998 and an increase so far this year of 21 per cent. I welcome the announcement of extra local authority housing. Over the next four years 60,000 households will benefit from social and voluntary housing schemes.</P>
      <P>It is especially important that the rate of increase in the price of houses is slowing down and is seen to be levelling off. This is long overdue. A number of houses are now being withdrawn at auction. However, many problems remain. People born and reared in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire cannot afford to buy a house in the constituency. They are moving out to the suburbs of Dublin, which now extend from Carlow to Mullingar. We need increased density, but this does not mean poorer quality. These two things need to be looked at closely together.</P>
      <P>Incentives must be given to people to allow them to extend their houses. Planning permission must be speeded up and by-law approval must be granted where needed. People now find it is easier and cheaper to extend rather than to try to move.</P>
      <P>I understand why the prices of new houses in my constituency are so dear. A house in Foxrock was sold two weeks ago for £8.5 million, not for the value of the house but of the land around it. Any houses built on this land will be sold for extraordinary amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is contrasted with the homeless people, those who sleep on Dún Laoghaire Pier, the 2,000 people on the local authority housing list and the <Col N="632" /> numbers of young mothers with small children in bed and breakfast accommodation. Despite its best efforts, the council is finding it very difficult to house these people because, despite the allocation from the Minister, we do not have the land on which to build the houses.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider allowing the local authority to allocate some of the money at its disposal for housing to a hostel and day care centre for these young homeless women and their children, not as an alternative to housing, which they deserve, but to relieve the pressure on them having to register in Eastern Health Board hostels and return to Dún Laoghaire to spend the day wandering the streets with their children because they are thrown out of the bed and breakfast accommodation at 8 a.m. and are not allowed return until 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>A major problem also exists with regard to rented accommodation. In my area rents are escalating at a rate of over £100 per month. I welcome the establishment by the Government of the commission on the private housing rented sector. I hope it will look into these issues and will specify a percentage increase which can be allowed by landlords. I also hope it will specify that adequate notice must be given to people.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic, I ask that the investment and commitment of the Government to the light rail, buses and DART carriages will continue. I welcome the extended platforms at DART stations and the extended carriages for the DART trains. I ask that special work be done with Dublin Bus to review the school transport system in Dublin and the facility of link buses to take passengers to DART stations. This would avoid people parking on residential roads, especially in the Blackrock and Monkstown areas.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties which exist, but I also acknowledge the work of the Government to date. I ask that it continues to implement and develop the policies to provide for the necessary housing and infrastructure. Rather than condemn the work of the Government, as the Opposition has done, we should condemn the lack of planning and foresight by the previous Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important subject, which is relevant in every constituency where there are urban centres and not just Dublin and Cork. However, one must look at the background to the current situation. Ireland is a small state by European standards both in terms of its population and geographical area. It comprises 70,000 square kilometres and its population is approximately 3.6 million. It ranks twelfth in size among the 15 EU member states. The density of population is a little more than 52 persons per square kilometre and significantly, it is the lowest in the EU. For example, the density of population in Northern Ireland is 117 persons per square kilometre, which is more than double that of the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> On the eve of a new millennium, Ireland, North and South, faces many political, economic and social challenges. The structure and distribution of population presents a formidable challenge for urban planning. Urbanisation is a relatively recent phenomenon in Ireland both in terms of its extent and impact. At the beginning of the century, only 25 per cent of the population lived in towns and villages and the majority of those settlements were small. The urban threshold definition set by the Central Statistics Office is 1,500 persons and upwards. The CSO also defines towns with populations of less than 15,000. In reality, these are mostly small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>According to the 1996 census, approximately 58 per cent of the population lived in towns and villages varying in size from 1,000 persons to just over 1 million, which referred to the current extended urban area of greater Dublin. In less than 100 years the aggregate urban population has more than doubled. Further growth will be seen in future and that will create a huge problem for all of us.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a number of important steps to try to address this. When EU funding was debated some months ago I stated that Ireland needed to disperse funding to the west to try and prevent migration to the greater Dublin area and other urban centres. If population balance is not restored, we will have a completely lopsided country where the majority of people will live along the east and south coasts and that will not be good for those areas or the ones that people leave. The deal that was agreed with the European Commission on Structural Funds was good and in the years to come there will be a rebalancing of investment so that fewer people will migrate to the east and south.</P>
    <P>It is not the complete solution but it will make a significant impact on population distribution. I also welcome the urban commission which is to be established by the Minister. It was promised by us during the local elections and it will be important. It will look at all aspects of urban development, such as housing types, transport, shopping facilities, high quality urban design, etc. We want to ensure that there will not be poor urban design as it would result in many problems. There should be a good social mix and the necessary facilities should be provided for urban centres to develop properly. The commission will also have a great impact.</P>
    <P>Dublin has a huge problem, which is not unique to it. I read an article in an English newspaper earlier about the problem faced by people living in London. They cannot afford to live there and the article reflected on how the British Government needed to address that issue. It is a difficult problem which has also been experienced in a number of American cities. Examples were provided of American cities which had achieved economic success, yet people who worked in the service industry in them could not afford to purchase a house, although they earned a reasonable salary. The Bacon reports tackled <Col N="634" /> and identified many solutions to that problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the commission on the private rented sector. It is long overdue and will tackle the quality and cost of available accommodation and issues relating to landlords. The Minister referred to the national spatial development strategy, which is also a positive move. It will address some of the problems which have been mentioned. However, the current housing problem was a long time coming and did not develop overnight. I am surprised at Fine Gael's attitude towards it. The party seems to blame the Government for everything but people could see this coming for quite a while and very little was done about it.</P>
    <P>Any impartial observer would acknowledge that the Government has done a huge amount in this area to try to tackle the problems. It will not be easy and the only way to tackle them properly is to make sure that supply meets demand. However, it must be ensured that the supply of housing is regulated, designed and serviced properly. Too many times in the past, developments were built without any long-term planning.</P>
    <P>There are many examples, but Tallaght is the obvious one. Tallaght is only coming into its own now. It is a great part of Dublin and people are proud to have come from there, although for years they were starved of basic services, including shopping centres, colleges and hospitals. These services have been provided and the town is booming. It has seven or eight hotels and is a thriving urban centre. I have no doubt that it will go from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>The urban commission can examine future planning of urban developments to make sure that proper planning, structures and services are provided. However, there must be more imagination in the design of developments. Developers make huge amounts of money and more effort could go into the quality and design of buildings because they will be a legacy for future generations. Other wealthier countries adopt good design and planning principles. Temple Bar is well designed, but better standards could be met by developers there. The Government has made huge strides in trying to tackle this serious problem that will not be sorted overnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion because it gives us an opportunity to discuss the serious issue of the lack of housing and escalating house prices. The Minister referred earlier to the Rip Van Winkle awakening of Fine Gael, but two other parties were in the previous Administration. Since the Government took up office in July 1997, it initiated the Bacon reports, acknowledged the serious problems that existed and tried to implement policies and proposals immediately to ensure that the housing crisis would at least be alleviated. It must be pointed out that ideological differences in the rainbow coalition created the situation where we are now playing catch up with regard to the supply of land. House prices are <Col N="635" /> now vastly excessive given that wages have not increased, inflation has remained static and interest rates are low. The Opposition has much to answer for in that regard. The motion shows that it regrets it did not take action as a result of ideological differences during the two and half years it was in Government.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about tackling the housing problem, we must recognise that there is insufficient development land. Local authorities have much to answer for because of decisions taken with regard to their development plans in the past. They did not take account of the fact that the economy was growing rapidly, interest rates were low and many people who emigrated in the 1980s and early 1990s were returning. The bubble was likely to burst unless something was done. Local authorities and planning officials have much to answer for because they did not consider demographic trends, the increase in population and the number of young people reaching house buying age. Ultimately, the finger must be pointed at many local authorities.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about developing infrastructure, another area which needs to be considered is the tolling of roads. This is common in other European countries where huge infrastructural developments have taken place. Their success should be acknowledged. The introduction of public-private partnership funding is good, but the tolling of roads should be considered. It may be unpalatable in isolated incidents, but it must be examined in the overall context of the development of infrastructure, growth of the economy, the number of cars on the road and the movement of people.</P>
      <P>Regarding the urban commission and city living, another issue that should be considered is the provision of skyscraper developments for offices. I do not support the idea of people being housed in skyscrapers, but there is nothing wrong with using skyscrapers for the provision of office space. This would free up many inner city areas which could attract urban dwellers. Urban living is becoming popular among young people and it should be encouraged. The fact that Dublin's inner city has a low skyline should be acknowledged. Land prices are very high in Dublin, but land is scarce. If developments were built upwards for the provision of office space, it could free up large tracts of land in the inner city for urban dwellings.</P>
      <P>Another aspect which must be considered is encouraging people to stay in rural Ireland. This is the information technology age and computers allow people to work from home. The provision of grants to encourage people to stay in isolated areas in rural Ireland should be considered. They could set up businesses which make use of the Internet and the other technologies which are now available. This might discourage people from moving to urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Fine Gael Party's acknowledgement that it failed during its two and a half years <Col N="636" /> in Government. It is apologising to young people for the fact that it allowed house prices to escalate beyond inflationary pressures, a problem which the Government is trying to redress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of the economy is a reflection of the success of Government policy in terms of investment in a number of areas. However, despite this success, there is a need for further investment and an examination of the development which is taking place in the regions. Balanced development is necessary. I ask the Minister to consider the south-east region because an analysis of it would indicate that it is falling rapidly behind the national norm.</P>
      <P>An example relates to the provision of bypasses around the town of Carlow and the city of Kilkenny, leading to the port of Bellview. This is not a parochial issue. The port of Bellview is being developed, but the proper road infrastructure has not been put in place. There is no proper plan in relation to the cross-radial routes from the port or the two counties. Due to the rapid growth in the economy, the Department should take a more proactive role in relation to the bypassing of Carlow and the provision of funds to ensure that work is carried out soon and not in the new millennium. The half completed Kilkenny bypass should be funded through a public-private partnership to ensure the route is finished, with the exclusion of an inner relief road through the medieval city. The route from Kilkenny city to Carlow, which directly services the Bellview port, should be considered as a matter of urgency. The development of the port will be hindered because of the poor infrastructure that has been put in place.</P>
      <P>The information technology explosion that is taking place and the entry by various businesses into the area of e-commerce means that the country must be in a position, from a commercial point of view, to participate in this development. There is a further need for public-private partnerships in relation to the provision of proper cabling, fibre optic or otherwise, throughout the country. If fibre optic cable and a proper road structure were put in place, a different type of economy would emerge. There would be an emergence of e-commerce and an awareness in that area which would bring prosperity and new employment to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to address the social housing crisis. In Carlow-Kilkenny, at least 1,500 people are on the housing list. Given the land being made available under the new county development plans, the new concept of steel structured houses, which is low cost but achieves a standard which is acceptable around the world, could be used and a number of homes could be provided at less cost than ordinary houses. Local authorities are paying more than the real value of houses and their funding is being bled as a result. If this new building concept was accepted, as it is in other parts of the world, and the necessary land was made available under the new county <Col N="637" /> development plans, there would be a rapid decrease in the number of people on housing lists.</P>
    <P>New developments are creating further pressure on the planning authorities. There is a need to review the whole planning process. I appreciate that legislation will be introduced by the Department and I welcome that. However, interim measures may need to be taken to ensure that there is proper planning and the pressure being placed on the various planning authorities is relieved by increased staffing levels and the provision of funding for proper policing under the current planning structures.</P>
    <P>Hospital services were mentioned. In common with other developing countries and developments in our economy, the regions need to be considered in relation to the provision of proper medical care. Industrialists and others will leave because of the growing population and there is a need to examine the medical services offered. Given that Waterford is the centre for medical services in the south-east region and the number of services is growing, there is a need to examine the neighbouring counties with a view to forming outreach facilities. I bring to the attention of the Government the need to develop St. Luke's hospital in line with the growth of the south-east region and its economy. If nothing is done about this matter, industry and the quality of life in the region will be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. I will quote a couple of examples from my home town, Skibbereen, which are of interest in the context of this motion. A new relief road is being built but no funds have been provided to link it to the centre of the town. The sewerage scheme dates to pre-Famine days. Raw sewage is being pumped into the river yet no funds are being provided for the urgently required new scheme. The other side of the coin is that a site which would have been available for £25,000 a couple of years ago was sold recently for £50,000 and a new four bedroom house which would have fetched a little over £100,000 a few years ago recently sold for £200,000. These examples show how the piecemeal approach of the Government affects, in microcosm, a relatively remote town. We have an infrastructural deficit but no overall plan to tackle it, while house prices become more out of reach for most people. The Government's approach will not solve these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority housing list is ballooning and currently stands close to 45,000. In 1997 the number of new houses started or purchased by local authorities was 3,606. Given that we are told the Government accepts that there is a huge problem and that the housing list has escalated, one would have thought that figure would have doubled in 1998, but there were only 3,504 house <Col N="638" /> starts or purchases last year, a drop in the figures. That has been the Government's reaction and it is important that we quote these examples.</P>
    <P>Yet in response to the motion there has been a nauseating smugness on the part of Government speakers, not even an acceptance that we have a problem. It is not merely a problem, it is a crisis which will continue to get worse until, at minimum, the Government accepts as much. This problem has been a central issue in the negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000. We have seen on television tonight the real level of inflation, which has been hugely affected by the escalation in house prices. In response there has been no overall approach, merely piecemeal, partial and unsuccessful efforts.</P>
    <P>One third of our population lives within 30 miles of this House, but where is the Government's demographic policy? Does it accept that there are huge difficulties outside the Dublin area? Where is the White Paper on rural development? It has made no effort to deal with the problem as a whole, not just in a narrow departmental way or in terms of the infrastructural deficit but in terms of how it affects housing, transport, health, education etc. The overall picture can be handled only through a co-ordinated approach. That has not happened in Ireland, which is why Fine Gael has tabled this proposal. We do not say the Government has done nothing, but what it has done has been partial and piecemeal and does not provide the answer to the enormous crisis confronting us. We need to take a different approach in light of the developing crisis which is getting greater by the day.</P>
    <P>We need a single overall national infrastructure and settlement plan to decide future development patterns. Only one person can take charge of this, namely, the Taoiseach. It is not only the Department of the Environment and Local Government which is affected, all Departments have an input. This motion should be accepted as the first step towards providing a solution to this crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In boom times Governments have little to do in terms of intervening in the economy. The one major requirement of a Government in these circumstances is that it knows where it is going. It should have an overall strategic plan to channel growth and ensure all the decisions it makes after that, whether large or small, feed into the overall plan and facilitate its achievement. If one does not have a vision of where one wants to go, one does not even know when one has deviated from the plan; such deviations express themselves as logjams and bottlenecks of crisis proportions in the economy. By the time the <i>ad hoc</i> solutions are put in place, the problems they are designed to address have already changed. Even as we regularly clap ourselves on the back for our booming economy, it is slowly being eroded by inefficiencies arising from an inadequate infrastructure and the inflationary pressures of escalating house prices and labour shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> To speak specifically about Dublin, the area I represent, even as incomes rise all individuals and families have the sense that their quality of life is deteriorating. This is particularly true of young people who are forced out of Dublin by rising house prices, which is having a hugely dislocating effect on extended families. Grandparents are left alone in Dublin while younger people are condemned to a lifetime of commuting and to bringing up children without the support of the family network or the social network of friends. We claim to be a country which favours the building of sustainable communities, but this is the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>Even as sales increase businesses experience ever-rising transport costs because of infrastructure deficits and congestion. They also suffer rising wage costs as they bid to attract and even to keep staff in a city which is increasingly congested, unattractive and expensive to live in.</P>
    <P>Twelve to 18 months ago in this House I warned that a settlement strategy for the Dublin region alone was a pointless exercise because the city could never accommodate the continued drift from other parts of Ireland, any more than other parts of Ireland could withstand the drift to the east. A comprehensive national settlement strategy, based on growth centres, is a must for the country as a whole, but it should not be seen as an excuse to abandon Dublin and starve it of the infrastructural investment required to make it a viable capital city.</P>
    <P>We have a strategic plan and guidelines for Dublin, which require us to increase the number of households by a staggering 42 per cent in the next ten years. This is to be achieved by concentrating housing within the Dublin area, with higher densities to facilitate the provision of public transport. I support this. Directives have gone out to local authorities, asking them to comply with higher densities. However, no directive has issued to any person or agency to provide the public transport which is absolutely critical to high densities. Without public transport, high densities exacerbate the problems we already have. Higher densities are not achievable because they will be fought at every turn by a public which is already bedevilled by traffic congestion. Without public transport they will not be accepted and will be fought through An Bord Pleanála and the courts.</P>
    <P>Last Monday Arnott's sale started and the city's traffic came to a standstill. That a sale in one shop can bring the city to a halt graphically conveys that Dublin is no longer viable. This is even before we provide one house towards increasing by 42 per cent the number of houses in Arnott's catchment area. Despite all the promises, reports, announcements and reannouncements, the Government has not made a single decision of any consequence about transport in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The essence of sustainable development is an integrated approach to all policy areas. We can<Col N="640" /> not solve the housing shortage without giving equal and simultaneous consideration to the environmental, employment, transport, educational, shopping, recreational and child care needs of the individuals and families who will live in these new homes. It is vital to our economy that we stabilise house prices because of the danger of inflationary pressures affecting other sectors and because of the real difficulties in retaining and attracting staff into the public sector where local authorities are finding it virtually impossible to recruit staff to deal with the huge workload. The rising house prices in Dublin are preventing us getting the necessary staff to provide houses in Dublin. That problem must be tackled through the tortuous process, which I raised with the Minister on several occasions, of recruiting staff through the Local Appointments Commission. If the Minister did something about that bottleneck it would make a real difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the contributions of some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers on this issue before coming into the House and they were rather pathetic and simplistic about this issue. Two years ago, in June 1997, the circumstances were different. There probably was an emerging housing crisis, but it is different now and we must face reality. We should have a reasoned debate in which people put forward solutions which, hopefully, the Government will take on board. At that time, all our infrastructural money was committed under that programme. We are now entering a new programme and the Government will have a greater opportunity to plan ahead. Despite the fact that we will have less EU funding, we will have a budget surplus of almost £2 billion next year. We must use that money to ensure we improve our infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to rural areas. How do we attract people into rural areas? Due to the lack of provision of sanitary facilities, such as water and sewerage, and inferior roads, people are not inclined to build homes in rural Ireland. That includes villages and some small towns which are mostly market towns. In regard to the next national plan, if we are to encourage people to build in these areas, I appeal to the Government to ensure there is increased funding on the previous five year programme for local and regional roads and for the provision of sewerage and water facilities throughout rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was the Minister in charge of rural development in the previous Government. More than any other programme, we want to revitalise rural areas and encourage people to build houses but they need sewerage and water facilities. There is provision of water in most areas but we are wasting valuable land because most councils will not allow indepth building if sewerage facilities are not available. As a result, road frontage is being used up where indepth building is taking place that would provide more houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that building a house in the country is affordable because it will encourage <Col N="641" /> people to move to the country. What else can we offer people? A previous speaker on the Government benches mentioned PPPs. I agree that with the introduction of PPPs we can provide some of the broad infrastructure we need which would encourage people to work internationally from their own houses.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to increasing the new house grant to £5,000 for people living outside urban areas. That might encourage people to build in rural areas which would free up the traffic in urban areas. We should also examine our existing stock. One of the advantages of the reconstruction grant provided by the 1983-87 Government was that thousands of houses throughout the country that would have become dilapidated were restored. Some of those were old farm and manor houses which would have been demolished were it not for the reconstruction grant. Consideration should also be given to reintroducing this grant for rural dwellers in particular who are living permanently in those areas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to devise a policy on holiday homes in rural Ireland. People currently building holiday homes are taking over land and represent unfair competition for people who are trying to provide housing locally for themselves. That issue will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of an urban commission. I am in the process of preparing a document in which I will propose establishing a rural commission which will address matters such as building houses in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The natural increase in the national population, assisted by the dynamic economic factors, has created an element of housing growth demand unprecedented on this island. Only a few years ago we witnessed wholesale emigration as the young sought employment far from these shores. The opposite is now the case, with State agencies promoting job opportunities in Ireland as they travel the world to find workers to fill job vacancies in our hungry economy. This unprecedented upturn has placed a demand on the political system to create a truly new Ireland. It is said that every disaster is but a moment of opportunity. Equally, every opportunity is but a waiting disaster unless it is managed and structures are put in place to meet the demands of that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economy demands an immediate increase in the housing stock. It affords us the challenge of putting adequate infrastructure in place to service both the population and the commercial sector demands. The people on the Opposition benches highlighted those deficits over recent years but the Government, like rabbits caught in the glare of car headlights, appeared to be frozen in time, hoping that something or someone else would resolve the problem. Unless action is taken, we will find that those who now eagerly invest in our country will pick up their tents and pitch them elsewhere. Unless immediate action is taken to address the serious under-provision of services <Col N="642" /> and housing, this country is heading for a major crisis.</P>
    <P>Due to the lack of Government response, the whole planning process is delayed. It is not delivered on time, just like public transport. What is the reason for this? It is because the Government has not put in place additional personnel in the planning departments of local authorities, nor has it staffed An Bord Pleanála at a level which will allow it cope with the demands placed on the planning process by the current scramble for housing. If we do not provide for immediate, adequate new housing starts, the cost of all housing will continue to increase beyond the capacity of the economy to find workers at whatever level who would provide suitable accommodation for themselves and their families. First time buyers, those who wish to trade up to accommodate an increasing family or those who want to rent a small flat or apartment will not be able to afford to provide for their own housing needs.</P>
    <P>The problem is further compounded by the Government's abandonment of those on the housing lists of local authorities. We are allowing a serious domestic crisis to develop. Families cannot function without homes. It must be one of the first duties of any Government, no matter how bad it is, to ensure there are sufficient, decent, available houses to meet the reasonable expectations of the citizens of the State. The Government must provide the supports to effect fast-tracking of the planning process while ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place to protect communities and the environment. The need for new housing is but one symptom of the threat against modern Ireland. We are challenged by the failure to provide development in an integrated way. Housing is pushed out of the centre and commercial development is sucked into the centre. This puts unsustainable demands on the transport infrastructure. There is a huge concentration of people going towards the city each morning, only to pour out again each evening. Correct planning must be encouraged and incentives must be put in place to encourage families back to our city centres. This would allow ease of access to employment, education and services which are already in place but which are underused due to population redistribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. I wonder how the Government hopes to resolve the crises in housing, traffic and transport infrastructure if it does not admit we have a crisis in those areas. We have crises in housing and with traffic congestion, be that in Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere. The first problem is that the Government does not admit that these areas are in crisis. How are we to expect the aspirational wish list which forms the amendment to this motion to solve these problems? I welcome the fact that our motion is well structured and will take on these problems in an integrated fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to see how the national housing <Col N="643" /> crisis can be solved if we do not put a national plan together. That is not to criticise local authorities in any way. They have done tremendous work with the resources made available to them by various Governments. I pay tribute to Galway County Council for the efficient way it has used its resources. We are particularly indebted to the wonderful management structure in the housing section. I pay tribute to the work of that section's manager, Mr. John Tierney, and his staff. They have done a job that is second to none. However, they are starved of resources. They have imaginative plans they could put in place if they had the resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, should note their initiatives regarding social housing. There are perfect examples of wonderful social housing projects in Galway. However, we now find that those who would benefit most from social housing are excluded from it due to income limits and restrictions. The £10,000 income limit for inclusion is a waste of time. I ask the Minister of State to request his colleague to increase this substantially to allow local authorities with the initiative to do so to provide social housing to reduce the chronic housing waiting lists in every local authority area. I believe that communities would work with local authorities to solve some of these problems and if one has a community working with a local authority one is making progress that has not been achieved heretofore.</P>
    <P>In past housing schemes, design was inadequate and all too often construction faulty. Services were not provided and there was no follow-up, with the result that we were left with ghettoes. That is a terrible indictment of Government policy over the years. I was amused by Deputy Kelleher's suggestion that the Government was playing a game of catch up for the inadequacies of the last Government. It begs the question: what were the Governments of the 1980s with Haughey, Burke and Flynn doing? What was that code?</P>

      <P>I am glad that colleagues opposite are so excited at getting something done, as the housing and traffic issues are very serious. The Government is very fortunate that there is a major surplus available from taxation. There is also the sale of Telecom and other national assets to provide funds for what is necessary. Whether the Government will provide those funds is another story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see more social housing. I have tried to encourage my own local authority and <Col N="644" /> that of Cavan to use more social housing. While my constituency may not suffer from the same housing problems as Dublin, there are still many problems in this area. A lone parent recently called to see me who has been on a housing waiting list for five years. She had no chance of getting a house until she moved out of her family home, which is a very serious indictment of our system. Her family relationship was a difficult one and could not continue indefinitely, but at least she has some chance of getting a house now she has moved out of home. This costs the State more money. The Government should examine these regulations with a view to improving the situation.</P>
    <P>Middle income couples can no longer raise a mortgage to buy a home even in areas like mine, never mind Dublin. County councils must be given the wherewithal to build more houses if this situation is to be rectified. I had to laugh at the amounts mentioned in the amendment to this motion and at the references to the increases in funding for regional and county roads. That did not happen in Monaghan, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows. We had a nominal increase for regional county roads and there is as yet only talk of improvements for major roads such as the N2. It appears that there will be no action on this for the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>If a crisis is to be averted, the infrastructure must be put in place to allow jobs to be created in the regions. That will not happen unless traffic can flow reasonably freely to the airports and ports. The Government has the opportunity in the next few months to create the infrastructure in rural areas, especially in Objective One areas, to provide ways and means of disposing of waste and to expand existing industries. I am begging the Government to ensure that rural areas are properly looked after when it brings its national plan to Brussels and that it does not simply increase the number of people in Dublin, creating more housing problems. One should not think that the housing crisis in Dublin does not cause problems for rural areas. It causes enormous problems for young students who must find rented accommodation in the city because there is no third level college in their own county. I ask the Government to consider this aspect of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate because it gives me the opportunity to compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Wallace and Molloy, on their excellent record to date. They have shown excellent teamwork. I also welcome this change from the Opposition's usual tactic of avoiding discussion of the issues while attacking personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are only two thirds of the way through this Dáil, yet it would take all evening to outline the Government's achievements during the past two years and to list the issues which have been dealt with in that time. The figures prove the benefits <Col N="645" /> which have accrued from hard work, and the public recognises that.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion outlines the issues which Fine Gael and Labour and their Government colleagues refused to deal with during their most recent term of office. Some Opposition speakers referred to the need for a national housing plan. It is only two years since those parties were in office but they made no mention of such a plan and dealt with none of the issues they have outlined this evening.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment, on the other hand, outlines a comprehensive and integrated programme to deal with each of the issues under discussion. Figures have been quoted which prove that this is an active, efficient and productive Government, whether it is dealing with jobs, investment in infrastructure, social services, education or the lowering of personal taxation.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government said last night that each region cannot be expected to develop in exactly the same way. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and the Government must build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses. He also made the interesting point that each region should get its fair share of supports and benefits, and that is exactly what is happening.</P>
    <P>I contrast the achievements of the Government with the rainbow Government's approach to these issues. In June 1997 our local national newspaper, <i>The Examiner, </i>carried a national jobs creation map on its front page. On this map, County Cork was totally blank. If one were to examine the same map now, one would find a very even spread throughout the country. That is how job creation should develop. We must help the weaker regions. I treasure that map and I have kept it because I will need to reproduce it in three years' time. The Minister's approach is the correct one and I agree totally with it.</P>

      <P>I would like £300 billion of our spare money to be spent in urban areas. The streets of Cork, Dublin and other cities were ignored until two years ago when the Minister allocated money for non-national urban roads. I ask that he consider this need before committing funds to major infrastructural works. I ask him to monitor the work of the National Roads Authority which completed the building of a four-lane carriageway into two housing estates in Bishopstown in Cork. We should not hand over total responsibility to the NRA.</P>

      <Col N="646" /> Our housing difficulty was added to by the failure of so-called left wing politicians, many of whom have changed groupings since, to deal with the question of zoning. They took what they saw as the high moral ground and young people are now suffering.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dennehy cannot believe what he has just said about Cork. I almost broke my ankle walking up Patrick Street when I was in Cork for the last by-election there. I pity the people of Cork who have to walk on streets which are in such bad condition. The people of Cork complained bitterly about Fianna Fáil and the Government and had praise for no one except Deputy Liam Burke who, they said, was doing a wonderful job.</P>
      <P>The country is suffering a shortage of housing and infrastructure. My own town of Westport has no proper water supply. We must rely on a temporary supply from Castlebar. Neither have we a sewerage scheme. Mayo County Council has stopped granting planning permissions in the little village of Murrisk, four miles from Westport, because there is no infrastructure in place there.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder we have a housing crisis. All Governments must share the blame for granting housing tax breaks for the rich. No one should be given a tax break for a second home. While some people own three and four houses, young people cannot afford to buy a first home. The house purchase grant of £3,000 was adequate ten or even six years ago but it is not adequate now. A grant of £3,000 was a help in buying a house for £50,000 but where would one buy a £50,000 house now? One could not buy a local authority house for £50,000 but the grant has not been increased.</P>
      <P>If the Government really wished to tackle the housing crisis, it would have put a package of measures in place. The first measure would be an attempt to assist young couples setting up home. There should be no stamp duty on second-hand houses when the purchasers are buying their first home.</P>
      <P>Young people are not getting a chance while rich people are getting all the opportunities. In Westport 108 houses went on sale for £83,000 and are now being sold for £150,000. Only eight Westport people are living in these houses. The rest are being rented from people in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere, and we have more people on the housing list than ever before. It is not good policy to reward the rich and crucify the poor, but this Government's policy is making the rich richer and the poor poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has the resources to solve the housing problem. County managers should be instructed to buy as much green area as possible, <Col N="647" /> provide water and sewerage and make sites available for people on the council housing list. We do not need Trinity College, UCG or any other institution to tell us that it makes sense that sufficient provision of a commodity results in it becoming cheaper. Land should be bought and sites made available so young people can be given a chance.</P>
    <P>I could never understand the great friendship between the building industry and politicians and political parties. I come from the west and I suppose I was innocent and did not know much. I have learned much in the past few months and now understand why that relationship existed and why it is in the interest of builders to ensure house prices are at current levels. For some builders the bigger their plans the better. Those applying to build 100 houses will receive planning permission from the county council but a person applying to build one house in a rural area will be asked to provide a puraflow system, additional land for the percolating centre etc. What has gone wrong? The rich are getting richer because they have influence with political parties.</P>
    <P>I often wondered why some council officials were friendly with builders. I will not mention names, but I never thought an official would get involved in such dealings. People used to ask me how builders got planning permission, and we can now understand how it was done. In Dublin city we see what happened, how certain people were very friendly and how certain officials got rich even though they were not in jobs which paid big salaries. This has an effect on property prices and young couples who have not a hope of entering the market.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about addressing the matter, it can do so quite simply. Young people should be encouraged and assisted. There should be two grants available to couples who are first time buyers, one of about £10,000 for those buying in towns, which would not match the rate of inflation in the housing market over the past few years, and a grant of £20,000 to encourage people to move to rural areas which would help stop the movement into towns. We have seen what has happened in Dublin city, with people crying to get out of it. There are people coming to the country on rural resettlement schemes. We welcome them and the more who come to the west the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, has once again been sent to the House to bat on behalf of his two colleagues. It is most strange that the Minister of State with direct responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, could not find time at some point over the past two evenings to come to the House for this debate. Had he done so he would have learned something about the crisis in the housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision to reject the Fine Gael motion is yet another example of its complete inability to respond to the housing crisis. It <Col N="648" /> will not even recognise that there is a crisis. During two years in office Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party have consistently dodged making an effective response to the new problems which have emerged from our new economic success. Last night the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, strutted his stuff on the floor of the House, all style but no substance. The speech was an exercise in self-congratulation. Indeed, it seems the Minister has a new scriptwriter given the edge in last night's speech. It once again highlighted the lack of vision at the heart of Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>The housing crisis now requires direct intervention by the Government in order to satisfy conflicting interests in the economy. Ministers are now two years in office and it is high time they confronted the colossal infrastructural deficits which exist and face their responsibilities. Failure by Government to respond will literally choke the future prosperity of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that for many in the trade union movement the problem of house price inflation has overtaken the issue of pay as a central ingredient required to make the successor to the PCW work. It is the lack of moderately priced homes which is currently driving a new and understandable militancy among many in the public sector. House price inflation is as important an issue for employers as employees. There is now clear evidence that the lack of affordable housing could well reduce the potential numbers of additional workers returning to the country, a crucial issue in the context of the ability of the State to address the current labour shortage.</P>
    <P>Despite the hype and PR which surrounds the Government's response to the housing crisis, it is not an exaggeration to suggest that the first and second Bacon reports have not worked. Taken together the measures announced by the Government over the past year have not stabilised house prices, the central objective of Government policy. Indeed we have seen a substantial rise in house prices in the first half of 1999, with a projected increase of over 20 per cent for the full year. The runaway train of house prices has not stopped to pick up hard pressed potential buyers.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to learn about the very small price increases in 1999 mentioned by the Minister in his speech to the House last night. I know he was drawing from statistics compiled by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, but those statistics substantially conflict with the statistics produced by the Irish Permanent and Sherry Fitzgerald. A week ago a leading economist said there is every likelihood that in 1999 we will see a persistent increase in house prices close to the levels we saw last year. Therefore, the central tenet of Government policy, namely, price stabilisation, is not working and cannot work. Furthermore, price stabilisation will make no difference to the vast bulk of people on ordinary wages because they still will not be able to afford a home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> In March 1997 a couple who were first time buyers taking out a 90 per cent mortgage would have spent 27 per cent of their net monthly income in financing their mortgage. By September 1998 this figure had increased to 40 per cent of their net monthly pay. This is the key issue which has not been addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>A deliberate outcome of the current strategy is that many couples are borrowing substantial sums of money to meet excessive mortgages. The Central Bank has already highlighted to politicians the risk attached to this phenomenon. It is quite obvious that the problem of house price inflation is having a hugely detrimental effect on the ability of young people to buy a home.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate we have spent very little time dealing with the problems associated with housing lists and it is on this issue that I wish to conclude. When the Government came into office there were just over 27,000 applicants on our national housing list. The Minister has refused to publish the national housing assessment carried out in March this year, saying he will publish it in September. Why will the Government not publish the national housing assessment and why did it decide not to publish <Col N="650" /> it until after the local elections? The reason is that it knows full well that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the number of people looking for social housing from the State during the past three years. This is the acid test upon which the Government must be judged. The reality is that only 6.9 per cent of total capital expenditure this year will be spent on the provision of housing for those on housing lists. This is the lowest percentage in the past five years.</P>
    <P>I will not accept the taunts that have been thrown at us in relation to social housing. When this party was in office we spent 8 per cent and 9 per cent of available capital resources, which were considerably less than those available to the current Government, on social housing. The Government increased the amount of money provided for local authority housing last year, but the number of acquisitions and starts decreased by 3 per cent. Therefore, all the hype and spin doctoring which has been done by the Government throughout the debate is farcical when one considers the scale of the problems we face. Unlike the Minister, we believe that housing is a fundamental right &ndash; he believes that it is a function of the market. That is the point on which we fundamentally disagree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is threefold. It allows for special opening of licensed premises and registered clubs on new year's eve for celebration of the millennium. It introduces changes to the law in the area of permitted hours on Sunday afternoons and provides for the granting of exemptions for extension of hours of trading after midnight on Saturdays.</P>
      <P>The Minister who is in Belfast at the Northern Ireland talks wishes to make it abundantly clear that this small Bill is not the end of the matter in regard to reform of the licensing laws and related matters. Far from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is long enough about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's stated intention &ndash; an intention to which he is committed &ndash; is to bring forward a comprehensive package of measures in the autumn which will deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with extending the hours during which licensed premises are permitted to trade. Any suggestions made which imply otherwise, whether in the House or elsewhere, are completely wide of the mark. To put the matter beyond further doubt, the Minister favours extending the opening hours of licensed premises so that they reflect the realities of current social interaction as well as the clear demand from members of the public and those in the trade for longer opening hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding to deal with the issues in the Bill, I acknowledge the work of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights which examined, under the efficient chairmanship of Deputy Flanagan, the <Col N="654" /> licensing laws. Its report presented to the Minister in June last year was the starting point for his examination of the law in this complex and most controversial area. Every Member can testify to the interest not just of those associated with the trade but of the public in issues relating to the licensing laws. I doubt if there is a single Deputy who does not have an opinion on what changes should be made or how far those changes should go.</P>
    <P>The experience following publication of the report of the sub-committee bears this out. The Department sought observations from interested parties and individuals. In excess of 70 submissions were received, not just from the major interest groups within the trade but from individuals and groups anxious to see the licensing laws amended to encompass their sphere of activitiy. The Minister received numerous letters from individuals and public representatives on their behalf who wished to make a case either for or against change.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to finalise wide-ranging changes in the law later this year. He has, as part of the consultation process, met many interest groups and continues to meet others in the context of finalisation of his further proposals. Most would agree that it is virtually impossible to satisfy the demands of all sides in a comprehensive liquor measure. What one group in the licensing trade advocates as essential is protrayed by other sectors as an unjust attack on their ability to make a living and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to think that he can find the middle ground between those who advocate no change in the law as it stands and those who see regulation of this area as the personification of the nanny state and that the effect of change does not have to add to the social cost of alcohol abuse but that greater access to alcohol has been complemented by a greater appreciation of the dangers of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that our society has changed significantly for the better in recent decades as far as our attitude to alcohol is concerned. Our maturing attitude means that we can at the same time speak not solely about the licensing laws in the context of what must be done to limit abuse but about the role of alcohol within the tourism industry as part of our social fabric and as something which can be celebrated in a positive way. Social drinking has for many people moved onto a new plane where the consumption of alcohol is only part of the enjoyment of some other activity and not an end in itself.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions contained in the Bill. Section 7 provides for the setting aside of normal opening hours on the eve of the millennium. Licensed premises and clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts will be permitted to remain open from after normal closing of 11 p.m. on 31 December 1999 to 8.30 a.m. the following morning. Premises will be allowed to supply alcohol for consumption on the premises but not otherwise during the extended period. <Col N="655" /> This provision gives publicans and licence holders plenty of time to make arrangements in light of public expectations which will facilitate celebration of a significant date in the calendar. This is a move which the National Millennium Committee has sought and it will be welcomed by it.</P>
    <P>The best provision for licensed premises on the occasion is that they should have flexibility throughout the night as regards opening hours. The approach is a pragmatic one. People will want to arrange celebratory parties on the night in question in many different ways. In so far as licensed premises are concerned, there is everything to be said in favour of celebratory events being held in proper licensed premises and clubs where a degree of responsibility and control can be exercised.</P>
    <P>No licensed premises is obliged to remain open throughout the night. Individual premises, based on demand or the plans of the licensee, can decide the time appropriate to the circumstances and it will be a matter for licensees to come to appropriate arrangements with staff in respect of the additional hours of opening, if they want to avail of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the opportunity presented by the need to make arrangements for the millennium to advance two other measures. Section 2 abolishes Sunday closing between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Section 3 provides for the granting of special exemption orders after midnight on Saturday nights. These two provisions are being advanced now so that licensees and their customers can have the benefit of them this summer and onwards. They are areas of the law which the Minister had intended to change as part of his overall examination of the licensing code.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the requirement on licensed premises to close between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sundays will be generally welcomed. It is clear that there is a demand for this relaxation of the law. It has become a feature of Sunday afternoons for families to enjoy lunch outside the home. Many licensed premises provide good value in this market and the Minister is ensuring that customers can enjoy their lunch without the need to have one eye on the clock or for licensees to remove customers at an unrealistic time of the day. All round, this should provide for a more relaxed enjoyment of what is often a family day out. This provision will also be of benefit to tourists. I accept that many visitors must find it strange that they can order a substantial meal in a public house at 1.30 p.m. but are then encouraged to eat up and be off the premises some time after 2 p.m. Many games are televised on Sundays and many people like to watch such sports in the convivial atmosphere of the local pub or club.</P>
    <P>The revised Sunday hours will also apply to private clubs which are permitted to supply intoxicating liquor by virtue of being registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts. Section 4 makes the appropriate change in relation to clubs. <Col N="656" /> The revised Sunday hours will apply also to off-licence premises.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the abolition of Sunday closing the Minister is altering the situation pertaining in hotels and restaurants. Under the existing law restaurants are granted an exemption for Sundays which allows them to serve alcohol with a meal up to 3 p.m. Under section 5 hotels and restaurants will be permitted to serve alcohol throughout the afternoon and evening. Section 6 alters the prohibited hours in restaurants holding a special restaurant licence. Under the current law such restaurants are normally prohibited from opening for the sale of intoxicating liquor on Sundays between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Section 6 removes this prohibition. These are logical consequences of the removal of the prohibition on licensed premises opening between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 3 regarding certain special exemption orders. There are many areas of the licensing code in need of review and attention and this is one of the most obvious areas. A whole industry, the nightclub and disco sector, owes its existence to the special exemption order. Under the current law it is impossible to obtain such an order for any time after midnight on Saturdays. The owners of nightclubs and hotels who operate nightclubs or discos point to Saturday night as potentially one of the busiest nights of the week. Section 3 removes the restriction on the granting of special exemptions after midnight on Saturdays. This amendment will be of immediate benefit to the nightclub and disco sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken this opportunity to introduce certain amendments to our licensing laws so that the benefits can be enjoyed straight away. The broader picture will be addressed later.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I have no problem with the three matters addressed by the Bill although I am at a loss to know where the demand arose for the once off, all night opening of licensed premises on new year's eve as a way of celebrating the millennium. No publican to whom I have spoken relishes the prospect of keeping their premises open all night. However, given that it is a once off occasion, Fine Gael will not oppose the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abolition of Sunday afternoon closing has been anticipated for a considerable period of time. While Irish people have accepted Sunday closing as part of what we are, it must appear strange to overseas visitors. Until a few years ago there was a holy hour in Dublin and Cork on week days until it was abolished by the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Gerry Collins. I welcome the <Col N="657" /> abolition of Sunday afternoon closing. Apart from being an outdated concept and principle, a substantial number of pubs are involved in the catering business and offer extremely good value for money. Their Sunday business, however, is considerably disrupted and constrained by the obligation to close for two hours in the afternoon. The removal of the prohibition on special exemptions after midnight on Saturday is welcome. It is legislating for the reality of what is taking place in discos every Saturday night.</P>
    <P>However, I object to the piecemeal approach of the Minister. I vividly recall the debate on the Licensed Premises (Opening Hours) Bill, 1998, introduced in March 1998 by the late Deputy Upton. True to form, the Minister refused to accept the Bill. Apart from making the case that a select committee of the House was engaged in a review of the licensing laws and had not reported, the Minister's main problem was that the legislation was not comprehensive enough. In his contribution he stated: &ldquo;I can give an undertaking that any recommendation made by the select committee arising from its review of the licensing laws will be given the most serious consideration by me with a view to amending the legislation .&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The select committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flanagan, consulted widely, received numerous oral and written submissions and produced an excellent report containing 72 recommendations. Instead of fulfilling his pledge of giving &ldquo;the most serious consideration&rdquo; to the recommendations of the select committee, the Minister has taken only two on board. He has shirked his responsibility and has failed to deliver on the comprehensive reorganisation of our liquor licensing laws about which he was so concerned a mere 15 months ago.</P>
    <P>Many groups will be dissatisfied with the Minister's abdication of responsibility. In particular, he has left the publicans in a disgruntled mood. They cannot understand the reason the unanimous recommendation of the all-party select committee to extend the licensed opening hours to 12.30 a.m. all year round has not been adopted by the Minister. In his contribution to the debate on the late Deputy Upton's Bill, the Minister spoke about the need for &ldquo;balancing of sometimes competing interests&rdquo;. By not extending the opening hours, he is perpetuating a situation where parents and grandparents have to leave the social atmosphere of the public house at 11.30 p.m. only to arrive home to meet their children and grandchildren departing for the club or disco where they have ready access to alcohol into the early hours of the morning.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that tonight in this city visitors from continental Europe, who have paid handsomely to holiday here and are enjoying the unique atmosphere of the Irish pub, will be told at 11.30 p.m. to finish their drinks. Apart from the tourism aspect, our early closing laws reflect our lack of maturity as a nation. We should be capable of applying our own standards and per<Col N="658" /> sonal strictures without expecting the State, its laws and the Garda Síochána to be our personal moral policemen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and I have published a Private Members' Bill which proposes to extend opening times for licensed premises. The Bill extends the opening hours by one hour in summer and one hour and 30 minutes in winter, thereby giving a year round closing time of 12.30 a.m. It abolishes the 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. closing time on Sundays. St. Patrick's Day, which at present is treated like a Sunday, will instead have normal opening hours. Christmas Day and Good Friday closing will remain and publicans will have to clear their premises by 12 midnight on Christmas eve and holy Thursday, thereby avoiding trespassing on either Christmas Day or Good Friday.</P>
    <P>Given that it is not possible to move the Bill this week during Private Members' Business, Deputy Flanagan and I have tabled the substance of the Bill as an amendment to the Minister's Bill. I ask the Minister, in a gesture towards the balance he referred to when contributing to the debate on the late Deputy Upton's Bill, to accept this amendment. In doing so, he will recognise the unique position of the pub in Irish society. It is ironic that the Irish pub, which is being replicated throughout the world, is enormously popular and is a huge commercial success, can have unrestricted opening hours in most countries in which it is established. Yet in pubs on our native soil which cater for the native population it is shutters down and lights out every night before midnight.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed the Minister failed to bring forward the comprehensive legislative measure he spoke about 15 months ago and which is so long overdue. To appreciate the need for consolidating legislation, one need only look at the range of Acts in which the current practice and code are grounded. They range from the initial Act of 1833 through the Acts of 1835, 1836, 1845, 1854, 1855, 1860, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1872, 1874 and 1877 to the Intoxicating Liquor Licensing Acts of the 20th century in 1902, 1909, 1910, 1924, 1927, 1943, 1946, 1953, 1960, 1962, 1981 and 1988. Is it any wonder there always has been and continues to be confusion about the body of law governing the liquor trade?</P>
    <P>Many of the Acts built on preceding Acts by reinforcing or strengthening them in some manner. Section 13 of the Licensing Act, 1872, for example, introduces a penalty for the publican who permits drunkenness or violent, quarrelsome or riotous conduct to take place in his premises or who sells intoxicating liquor to a drunken person. Section 14 of the 1872 Act introduces a £20 fine for any licensed person who knowingly permits his premises to be the habitual resort of or place of meeting of reputed prostitutes, whether the object of the resorting or meeting is for the sake of prostitution. The publican shall, if he allows them to remain there or remain longer than is necessary for the purpose of obtaining reasonable refreshment, be liable to a penalty not exceeding <Col N="659" /> £20 for the first offence and £40 for the second and subsequent offences.</P>
    <P>These penalties are doubled in the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924. Section 10 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, provides that every person who occupies or keeps any lodging house, beer house, public house or other place where intoxicating liquors are sold or any place of public entertainment or public resort and who knowingly permits them to meet or assemble there or knowingly allows them to deposit goods therein, having reasonable cause for believing those goods to be stolen, can be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10. Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, deals with the sale of intoxicating liquor to those under 18 years of age. Section 34 of the same Act prohibits children, unaccompanied by parents or guardian, to be on a licensed premises.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not availed of the opportunity to untangle the mass of legislation governing the various outlets serving liquor, ranging from the traditional public house to restaurants, hotels, clubs, discos and off licences. This was the opportunity to introduce a comprehensive, intelligible and workable Bill to meet the reality of modern Ireland as it faces the new millennium. One of the most disturbing features of modern Ireland is the growing epidemic of under-age drinking. This country is afflicted by an orgy of child alcohol problems. When first year students of 12 and 13 years of age arrive at post primary schools on a Monday morning smelling of stale alcohol fumes and visibly hung over, it is time to reappraise the situation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that is the position in virtually every post primary school in the country and the age threshold continues to fall. There is almost total disregard for the law on under-age drinking and we need to come to grips with what is a major cancer among the young. There is also the other side of the coin, which is parental responsibility. The performance of parents in this regard is scandalously negligent. There is no point in expecting the State to be the moral parental guardian &ndash; acting in <i>loco parentis </i>&ndash; if parents have not sufficient interest to insist on their offspring being in at a reasonable time. I am not talking about midnight or 12.30 a.m. If parents do not collect their children, do not know their means of transport home, do not check their condition and do not know what time they arrive home, then parents are guilty of criminal negligence. If children know there are no boundaries, no limitations, no parental checks and no parental interest, who can blame them if they decide to indulge themselves? The streets of urban and rural Ireland in the early hours every Sunday morning are littered with bottles, beer cans, bodies, vomit, urine and blood. These young people are the mirror of a so-called modern Ireland of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Parents are not being fair to their children by <Col N="660" /> not establishing and insisting upon limits. I do not know where we went wrong. What has happened to the basic requirement of parental maturity, example and responsibility? Up to 15 years ago I was a teacher and at that time it was the norm for teachers to attend secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community school graduation balls. Nowadays, teachers are not generally invited to such events, but if they were, many would decline to attend because of the embarrassing performances which inevitably take place and which have become part and parcel of the alcohol saturated graduation ball scene at this time of year.</P>
    <P>The present splurge of teenage drunkenness is serious and is wreaking havoc on society. The rack and ruin has yet to be seen in many cases. The combination of under-age drinking, late drinking and take-away shops to which people go when they are disgorged from discos and dance halls at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, means that many streets, even in rural Ireland, have become no-go areas. Many senior citizens are no longer able to enjoy peace in the tranquillity of their own homes. We have a major public order problem which is being fuelled to a large extent by uncontrolled under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>The law has a primary role and it should be enforced. Education also has a role, but the primary role and responsibility rests with parents. Unfortunately, far too few of them appreciate or accept this responsibility.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to think again. However, instead of making a decision to defer consideration of the Bill on Committee and Report Stages, the Government should accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Flanagan and me. Then we would have the balanced Bill which the Minister aspired to 15 months ago when he spoke on the late Deputy Upton's Bill. It would be a Bill that would bring some semblance of equilibrium between the competing interests he was so concerned about on that occasion.</P>

There will not be any changes between now and the resumption of the Dáil in the autumn. Why can we not face the facts? We are engaged in a deliberate political sham.</P>

I accept that licensing law is a complex area and Governments have not helped over the decades. We suffered from the piecemeal changes in the legislation over the years. They have been more a response to an initial difficulty rather than to a comprehensive examination of our licensing code which for the most part dates from the last century.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister has engaged in widespread consultation on this issue. That was already stated by his Minister of State, but following that consultation the Minister appears to have learned nothing. He appears immobilised by his own indecision on the matter. The review of February 1996 was on an all-party basis, with urban and rural members of all political parties having an opportunity of participating in a round-table exercise which produced 75 recommendations. The consultation process took more than a year with numerous public and private meetings, written submissions, oral hearings and a seminar addressed by the Minister. The committee engaged an expert consultant for the bulk of the consultation process. We had the opportunity of meeting experts from other jurisdictions and that wide-ranging report was presented to the Minister last June.</P>
      <P>The only reaction it elicited from the Minister was engagement in the same widespread consultation and discussion that had already been undertaken by the committee. This was no more than an exercise in long-fingering. The Competition Authority committee sat contemporaneously with the liquor licensing review committee. Apparently, there has not been an official reaction from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform since that report was published some ago, not to mention an indication that he would act favourably on the recommendations of the Competition Authority report, which dealt with high prices, value for money, barriers to entry to the trade etc. The Minister did not consider these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of extending trading hours, it is a question of achieving a balance in the public interest. Some people speak in terms of deregulation and say there should not be any control of trading hours. I am not sure if that is in the best public interest. Neither am I sure if the concept of obtaining exemptions is the best practice. The exemption practice as it operates is bringing the law into disrepute. There are special exemptions, general exemptions and area exemptions. The <Col N="663" /> special exemption available only for hotels and those premises with special restaurant certificates is unfair to the vast majority of retail traders in the licensed trade. It means that hotels and certified restaurants occupy a dominant position in the market and, in effect, constitute a monopoly on late night drinking. This is unjust.</P>
    <P>The public, the unsuspecting punter who wishes to have no more than a glass of beer at midnight has to determine whether he is entering a certified restaurant or an hotel. If he goes near an ordinary seven-day licensed premises, which is where he wants to go, he will have little chance of getting a drink if the proprietor of those premises is acting within the law. It is wrong that the law is turning a blind eye to those pubs with restaurant certificates which operate as ordinary seven-day licensed premises into the night without fulfilling the legal requirement to provide a substantial meal. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing himself, his Department, the Government and this House a disservice by not scrapping the late night monopoly of hotels and certified restaurants.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell to any great extent on the 75 recommendations of the all-party committee published and presented to the Minister more than a year ago. The report has also been circulated to Members. It is a pity he did not give effect to the recommendations on the trading code, the summer-winter time change, recommendations 21 to 29, and the extended trading hours, recommendations 30 to 37. There is no doubt consumers wish to have a less restrictive regime. It is farcical that a person on a licensed premises in a public house with a glass of shandy in his hand at 11.50 p.m. on a summer's night can be successfully prosecuted in a court of law and reprimanded. There is an alternative. The person can put down the glass of shandy and leave the premises in haste. He can pay £8 to the local night club, listen to the loud music, be invited or tempted to dance and forced to eat the rubber chicken which constitutes the substantial meal he must eat if he is to be in keeping with the law.</P>

      <P>Citizens are forced to enter these premises against their better judgment when all they want is a glass of shandy on a summer's night. In the event of a private celebration when they wish to have a drink after midnight they cannot do so without paying for the privilege. That is unfair. These anomalies cannot be justified. It defies belief that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, having considered the matter for months, has brought forward a reforming measure to mark the start of millennium, to abolish Sunday closing between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and to remove the special exemptions anomaly for Saturday nights, and yet did not address the issue. In the course of his address, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, did not tell us <Col N="664" /> the reason the Minister did not address these issues. We will now have the worst of all worlds because the Minister said the Bill which he introduced in the last week of the session will not become law at all.</P>

      <P>It will be deferred. Rather than delay the House on this measure I will allow other colleagues to contribute. Let us get real on this issue. The Bill has been proved defective by the Minister's colleagues. They have said, as have the citizenry, they would be happy with an extra hour. That is the Fine Gael amendment. We can accept a sensible amendment concerning theatres and other recreational outlets, as proposed by the Labour Party which is worthy of support. If we pass this legislation the Minister can deal with the more complex issues of barriers to trade and licensing in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused about the Government's intentions. I had thought we would go right through the Bill, that we would have the opportunity to amend it and that it would become law at some stage. Clearly there has been a U-turn in the course of the day due to pressure from various sources, including some who are not members of the Government, but who may be supporting the Government. This is unsatisfactory from the point of view of those of us who wanted to contribute to the debate, to amend the legislation and put forward sensible proposals as we have done in our amendments.</P>
      <P>For the past hour or so I have tried, as has Deputy Higgins, to be in two places at the one time. We had been moving amendments on Committee Stage to the Immigration Bill while we were supposed to be in this House. That is unsatisfactory. It is ironic that we need not have come in to deal with this Bill because the Government has decided it will not proceed with it. It is unacceptable that we were not able to deal properly with the Immigration Bill. Time was allowed today and tomorrow for this Bill. It is time wasted because the Government will &ldquo;bring forward a comprehensive package of measures in the autumn&rdquo;. I presume this Bill will be subsumed in the autumn by a more considered approach to the whole question of extending the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity this Bill will not go through the House, despite our reservations about it. While its provisions fall far short of what is required to reform the outdated licensing laws, if passed, substantially amended, before the recess, at least the Sunday holy hour could have been abolished in time for the peak tourist season. As the Fine Gael Members have said, the Bill could have been amended if the Minister had been willing to accept the proposed amendments. They are probably in line with most of the proposals the Government will put forward in the autumn. The Sunday holy hour provision could have been abolished for the tourism season because there <Col N="665" /> is broad consensus across all parties that it is an inconvenience, especially in areas that depend heavily on tourism.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to take only Second Stage of the Bill before the recess is a disgraceful U-turn. It has misled the House because the order for all Stages was circulated by the Whips. It should explain why it no longer intends to proceed with all Stages of the Bill. Is it the case that it has once again succumbed to pressure from its Independent supporters? It is high time it grasped the nettle and provided some real reform of the licensing laws. Apart from the other points that have been made, its pussyfooting on the matter is costing the economy in terms of tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>Reform of the licensing laws has been well ventilated by Members of the House. Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights have dealt with the matter in the run up to the publication of the review of the Liquor Licensing Bill, which was published just over a year ago. Earlier still, the House had the opportunity to consider the matter over two weeks of Private Members' Business when, on behalf of the Labour Party, the late Dr. Pat Upton introduced his Licensed Premises Opening Hours Bill. I remember the conviction with which he spoke on the Bill.</P>
    <P>This latest opportunity to debate the issue presents the weakest, least ambitious proposal to reform the licensing laws. The Bill merely plays around with them. The only real and welcome reform is the proposal to abolish the provision on the Sunday holy hour. Had the Minister supported the Labour Party Bill these reforms could have been introduced over 15 months ago. It presented a more radical and modern approach to reforming these laws.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main provisions contained in the Bill, the Labour Party proposals sought to extend the opening pub hours on a daily basis, thereby abolishing the anomalous gap between the winter and summer opening hours as well as bringing closing time to 12.30 a.m. with subsequent drinking up time provisions.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill also looked at removing the mandatory closing on Good Fridays and the reform of off-licence opening hours. In addition, it contained a provision to allow heritage centres, especially those based on brewing and distillation, to serve alcohol. I commend my colleague, Senator Gallagher, in this regard because for some time he has been trying to make a special case for heritage centres. This issue is close to his heart as he resides somewhere near where Tullamore Dew is produced. I understand Irish Mist is produced in the same area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Tullamore is the only town in Ireland that gives a man his &ldquo;dew&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately it cannot give any man or woman their &ldquo;dew&rdquo; without paying approximately £100,000 for a pub licence because <Col N="666" /> under existing legislation it cannot serve beverage in the heritage centre in the absence of such a licence. Similar provisions apply in other such heritage centres, such as the centre located at Midleton. While these centres should be restricted in terms of the hours they serve beverages, they should not require a pub licence. The removal of this provision would add to the tourism potential of areas which contain heritage centres, especially centres based on traditions of brewing and distilling. There is a comparable provision for racing tracks. This is under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food and a licence may be granted at the discretion of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. A similar provision for heritage centres could be left to the discretion of the Minster for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. It is a sensible measure and I do not see why the Government would wish to oppose it. Unfortunately, we will not have the opportunity to propose amendments to this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party Bill is head and shoulders above this Bill because it made ample provision for the protection of workers in the industry so that they would not suffer as a result of longer opening hours. Efficient and helpful bar staff have always remained at the heart of the Irish pub industry. When extending bar opening hours we must be careful to maintain these characteristics by offering protection to workers involved in this industry.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has made it clear that employees should not be obliged to work during the added pub opening hours. An employee who works extended hours should be paid at least time and a half and employees should be given at least four days' notice before they are obliged to work the extended hours. It is important that the issue of employees is taken into account, especially in the context of the millennium proposal in the Bill, which contains no measure to protect the rights of workers. We seek a short amendment on that, but my preference would be to adopt the measures in the Labour Party Bill, which would adequately protect workers and would be in accordance with the trade union Mandate, which represents most bar workers. Unfortunately, not all bar workers are members of trade unions. The union is rightly anxious that workers should be properly protected in the context of extended hours and in respect of the millennium proposal.</P>
      <P>The Bill allows for a special once-off opening for licensed premises for new year's eve. Pubs can choose to open for 36 hours. This change has implications for workers, yet the Bill does not contain a single provision to offer them protection. Millennium working conditions are already a hot potato. New year's eve has already been declared a bank holiday to mark the new millennium and people have high expectations as to how they might celebrate it. There will be huge pressure on workers in pubs and clubs and the failure of the Bill to address their welfare is a serious error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In expectation of new reforms in the licensing <Col N="667" /> laws, the trade union Mandate published a report outlining the need for increased worker protection. We would fully support that, but it appears its demands have fallen on deaf ears. There is a balance between consumers' rights and workers' rights in this area. In seeking to extend the licensing hours we are trying to ensure that the consumer has more choice and that the clearly expressed wishes of consumers will be taken into account. Those wishes were expressed to the Government again today. However, that needs to be balanced against the rights of workers, which must be an essential part of any legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful how well the licensing laws are implemented. A certain leeway is granted in parts of the country, with which some people would agree. However, if laws are not always enforced and if the majority of citizens would prefer not to see them enforced to the letter, we should change them rather than keep them on the Statute Book and turn a blind eye to certain aspects of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It puts all law into disrepute when we keep laws on the Statute Book but do not implement them. That is an important point to consider when taking account of what the Opposition seeks to have included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The late Pat Upton referred to the experience of other countries that amended their licensing laws to provide for extended opening hours. Scotland is a good example because the Irish and the Scots share certain characteristics. The extension of licensing hours in Scotland did not cause great disruption to public order or late night binge drinking. Unfortunately, that happens anyway and could not be attributable to a change in the law. If people want a drink, they will find the means to do so. As Deputy Flanagan said, they will pay £7 or £8 to listen to loud music which they do not want to hear if they want to have an extra drink or two. I passed by such an establishment recently and the level of noise was deafening. There should be an option for those of us who want to drink late but are not young enough to withstand the noise level, in the interest of our hearing.</P>
      <P>The obligation to provide food to all patrons who avail of late night drinking in these establishments is not always met. In many cases, there is not enough food to provide a meal to everybody on the premises. Again, that is flouting the law. As Deputy Belton eloquently said, we need to reflect the reality of the situation. I would have preferred if the Minister had introduced an honest, detailed Bill which would have done that rather than introduce one which tinkers with the system and provides for all night drinking on the eve of the millennium, to which I object.</P>

      <P>The Bill seeks to amend and extend the licensing Acts. Criticism of it, in some ways, might be justified if it were the only Bill to be introduced to address the liquor licensing trade. The Minister has stated clearly that this is not the case. Many Members are overreacting and the many legitimate demands of the licensed trade will be addressed later this year in a more complex and substantial Bill. The Minister stated his intention to introduce a further, more wide-ranging Bill in the autumn, which will comprehensively address the multiple issues governing licensing laws and opening hours. He stressed that this short Bill is being introduced in order to benefit tourism during the busy summer season. The Minister has been criticised for his attempt to assist the industry during the last year of the century. He is anxious that it should be passed as soon as possible and that the full benefits may be enjoyed by the tourism industry and licensed trade. It must be borne in mind that it may not be possible to consider all the amendments which have been tabled by Fine Gael and the Labour <Col N="669" /> Party before the close of business in the House on Friday and the Bill may not be passed.</P>

      <P>Many other changes were advocated by the licensed trade, the tourism industry and the public, which will be fully addressed in the later Bill. The Minister has addressed three matters in this legislation, the abolition of the holy hour, the removal of the prohibition of special exemptions after midnight on Saturdays and the introduction of the arrangement of all night opening on the eve of the millennium. Many people believe that the special licence for new year's eve is wonderful and all of us will be able to party into the new millennium. However, I will stay at home that night if God spares me.</P>

      <P>Some people see it as a licence to indulge in the binge of the century. Others do not share this outlook and there has been severe criticism of the proposal by publicans and the public. A publicans' spokesman has slated the proposition as totally impractical. He said that there was no market demand for the extended opening hours. The extension of the hours is optional and, therefore, not compulsory. Publicans can, therefore, close their doors as they desire.</P>

      <P>Disquiet has been expressed by doctors, medical support staff and accident and emergency personnel. I am aware that the Garda is concerned at the proposed overspill of thousands of people onto the streets at a specific time early on new year's morning because it could cause serious flashpoints. The Garda and others may have suggested that it would be better to introduce all night opening so that people could come and go as they pleased. Flashpoints would not develop as they do currently even on ordinary Saturday nights when hundreds of people spill onto the streets after night clubs close. What would it be like on the night of the millennium if closing time was rigidly imposed and people could not hail taxis to go home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not dream up these proposals. He is responding to demand and has taken into account the many valid reservations expressed. Many people believe that the holy hour is sacrosanct because if public houses did not close on Sunday afternoon, drinkers would spend the entire day on the premises. Others do not favour the removal of the prohibition on special exemptions. Their submissions have been taken into account and, indeed, a number of recommendations were made and are under consideration by <Col N="670" /> the Minister.

Many of the 75 recommendations in it will require a great deal of consideration before they are transposed into law. All will be considered by the Minister, his officials and the House when the larger Bill is presented in the autumn. For example, we recommended that closing time should be at 11.30 p.m. from Sunday to Wednesday and at 12.30 a.m. from Thursday to Saturday. I am surprised that Deputy Flanagan, who was party to that decision, said that Fine Gael is recommending that closing time should be at 12.30 a.m. Is it a Fine Gael or a publican's amendment to the motion?</P>

      <P>Many under-age vulnerable young people fall victim to the lure of the so-called &ldquo;craic&rdquo; of causing a public nuisance. Street drinking is an unfavourable and ugly sight and it causes offence to visitors. I am concerned about people openly drinking on our streets and I have travelled extensively and spent many hours gathering information on this increasing phenomenon. I have studied how it is addressed nationally and abroad and I succeeded in introducing a pioneering by-law to prohibit the practice in my native city of Cork. This was accomplished with cross-party support on the city council. It is now illegal to consume alcohol on the streets and in public areas of Cork city. Similar laws should be put implementyed throughout the State in secondary legislation.</P>

      <Col N="672" /> The licensing code is complex and in many ways outdated. The problem of the overspill from pubs with people drinking in public areas needs to be addressed by the Minister as do the recommendations in the report.

      <P>In common with thousands of individuals, groups and organisations, I have a view on the licensing laws. As stated earlier, the Minister has consulted these groups. Each individual and group has an opinion which has been expressed. Opinions differ and they all demand different action. While some people want change on the basis of their personal views, the collective opinion of an organisation or the views of representatives of publicans, hotels or nightclub owners, others do not want any changes made to the licensing laws. Some people are against the flexibility in the existing laws. All these views must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Contributions to the debate reflect the differing views on both sides of the House. If one dug deeply one would find varying views in the Fine Gael and Labour parties on the licensing laws. The organisation which represents publicans is divided on how the legislation should be approached and what type of legislation is needed. The Opposition should not try to fool the public by saying the problem arose at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party because that is not the case. They should not suggest either that the problem landed on the desk of the Minister today or yesterday or that they were never in Government.</P>

In addition to all the different opinions on the issue, the world is changing. Over the past 20 years, and not only the past two years, there has been flexibility with regard to the hours kept by public houses, hotels and nightclubs. In general, the law is flouted and <Col N="673" /> any legislation which is introduced should reflect the actual position. It should be clear and we should be willing to enforce it in a way that ensures the law is respected. Anomalies in the current system are addressed in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The message should not go from the House that the only way to celebrate the new millennium on New Year's Eve is with a festival of drink. There are many other activities in which people can participate instead of staying in a pub, club, hotel or elsewhere and drinking their way into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the time provided for in the Bill is an option. There should be a clear recommendation regarding the closing time for all establishments. The new millennium is an historic event and, undoubtedly, people will celebrate by drinking or staying out late at clubs and discos.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Others will want to mark the new millennium in other ways and enjoy it with <Col N="674" /> or without drink. Will the Minister consider removing the option and including a specific recommendation on how people should behave? The provision on closing between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. is also a reflection of the reality. I am glad the Bill takes special regard of extensions after midnight on Saturdays. This is another recognition of what is happening. I support the Bill to that extent.</P>
      <P>There are other issues relating to the millennium. I mentioned staff problems but all the other services must be supported during that celebration &ndash; hospitals, gardaí, etc. This provision gives them the opportunity to know what they will have to deal with. No matter how people celebrate, there will always be a negative aspect. We must think of workers' rights and employees engaged in these services will have to work long hours to work their plan for the occasion. The support services for families who suffer disruption because of drink will also have to be addressed. Indicating the licensing laws at this point, as the Government is doing, will give the family support services for drink related matters the opportunity to obtain extra personnel to provide the necessary help to the families concerned.</P>
      <P>I support the measures to be taken on the basis that a further Bill will be introduced early in the new session to take into account all the issues raised in this debate. I hope that Bill takes a radical approach to overhaul the current legislation, and that it recognises what is happening in licensed premises. It will mean that we will have on the Statute Book a measure which can be properly policed.</P>

      <P>I am amazed to hear speakers on the Government side trying to camouflage the hopeless efforts of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to rectify the licensing laws. The proposals in this Bill will do nothing to facilitate the tourism industry. Twenty four hour opening of pubs on 31 December 1999 is not in the interests of the industry and was not requested by publicans or their customers.</P>
      <P>After all the discussion, submissions, reports and lobbying, it is incredible that such minute changes are the sum total of the Government's proposals. The Minister's measures cannot be taken seriously and subject the legislative process to ridicule. They have generated anger, shock and betrayal among publicans not felt since the famous and ill-fated Road Traffic Act, 1994.</P>

International visitors are astounded when they are instructed to finish their drinks and leave a licensed premises at 2.30 p.m. on Sundays, 11 p.m. in winter and 11.30 p.m. in summer.

      <P>Four Independent Deputies &ndash; Deputies Blaney, Fox, Gildea and Healy-Rea &ndash; who are propping up the Government, represent major tourism areas. I call on them to exert pressure on the Government to accept our amendments and have the revised Bill passed unanimously, thereby restoring public confidence in their representatives. The people of Donegal, Wicklow, Kerry and elsewhere are livid at the treatment they are getting from the Government, which is drifting like a ship without a rudder. The Minister is adopting a Mickey Mouse approach to this serious matter. The country feels betrayed by a Government which has failed to face reality. I call on Deputy Healy-Rea to exert pressure on the Government before it is too late. He will not sell this lame duck story to the people of Killarney, Kenmare, Kilgarvan, Bunown or Cahirciveen. The people of Kerry, Cork and elsewhere are calling for an amendment of the licensing laws.</P>
      <P>I will conclude with the following appropriate quote:</P>
      <P>There is nothing so lonely, so morbid or drear</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Billy the Blacksmith who stood outside the pub with no beer &ndash; that must be me. The Minister and the Government have <Col N="676" /> failed in their efforts to bring reality into the legislation. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahy, introduced the Bill on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my heart goes out to him for having to present this shambles. Six months ago the Minister announced through his spin doctors that closing time would be changed to 12.30 a.m. but when it came to the crunch he failed to introduce this in the Bill. Not only has he failed to do that, he will fail to get the Bill through the House, and the Minister of State knows that. He had to come into the House tonight to front a shambles. The Opposition has forced the Government to face the reality that this Bill is an utter shambles. The Bill states that pubs will no longer be required to close on Sunday afternoon. That is facing reality, as is the extension to 12.30 a.m. The Opposition and the Independents, as Deputy Sheehan said, have told the Government where to go on this issue. As Deputy O'Flynn rightly said, there was no member of the Opposition at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting today but I am sure some of the people in Fianna Fáil are realists. Fianna Fáil has always claimed to be a party of reality, and some of its members proved that today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some different points from those made by my colleagues. We understood from the Minister some months ago that this Bill would benefit the tourism industry and that it would allow for the extension of time to 12.30 a.m. to bring us into line with our European counterparts. In no country would the police knock on the doors of pubs late at night and perhaps take down the names of customers still on the premises. If opening hours were extended, it would avoid the pressure drinking that takes place here. People tend to take their last drink or two in a hurry which causes some of the problems we face today.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals mainly with Sunday opening hours and the opening hours on the eve of the millennium. After midnight, clubs and other premises will be allowed remain open to allow our young people and many others drink into the early hours of Sunday morning. This will lead to fewer people attending their place of worship on Sundays.</P>
      <P>I have a slightly different attitude to the Sunday afternoon issue. I realise restaurants and other places which have licences can serve drink during that period, but it is the only time on a Sunday that publicans and their staff can have time off. I do not have a strong view on the matter but it appears to be just another change.</P>
      <P>The issue that has alarmed me most is that a country which would claim to be Christian has decided to encourage and orchestrate an orgy starting on the eve of the millennium through to the start of a new century. If that is the way we intend to celebrate the birth of our saviour, there is much to be considered. It is unreal that we should be talking in those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that the gardaí, doctors <Col N="677" /> and nurses will have to be available to deal with the problems that will be created by this measure. If Members do not believe me, all they have to do is consider what happened in my own town of Clones last Sunday night-Monday morning when crowds of people who had been attending a match broke the law. The people of Clones were afraid to leave their homes because of the drunken orgy that took place. That seldom happens but it happened last Sunday night. I had many telephone calls from people who want to be assured that more gardaí than were on duty during the match will be available in the future if similar trouble arises. There is little point in having three or four gardaí in the town, there must be larger numbers.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of what could happen on the eve of the millennium. We should not put more pressure on the forces of law and order, medical staff and families. There will be some people sitting at home on the eve of the millennium wondering in what condition their loved one will come home. I ask the Minister to reconsider that issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has missed a golden opportunity to sort out the tourism industry. We were given a promise but the promise has been broken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement that the three recommendations in this short Bill will help facilitate the tourism industry is not only a major contradiction, it is also an insult not only to every publican whose livelihood depends on the tourist season but also consumers whose lifestyle has changed rapidly due to the demands today's society places on them.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Higgins on the dangers of the abuse of alcohol. Those dangers are considerable, but changes in lifestyle are very much evident. In the past year, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland took a reasonable approach on the hours of trading and made reasonable demands. Major legislation is promised on licensing reform, but the licensing laws go back to 1833 and a whole tranche of changes are needed. A closing time of 12.30 a.m., with a half hour drinking up time, which the Minister appeared to agree to on previous occasions, is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was drawn up to facilitate the tourism trade but it will not do anything in that regard. Does the Minister believe that the recommendations in a short Bill could facilitate the tourism industry? I do not believe that. Enormous changes have taken place in the laws governing restaurants, which are welcome. Pubs serving food on Sundays can now be facilitated and I welcome that. The extension of time on Saturday nights is welcome also, but the Minister could easily have taken on board the additional time required by the vintners in the coming tourist season, which is so important. The turnover of 69 per cent of publicans is less than £150,000. There is no gravy train. It is a sad reality that people do not go into pubs until late in the evening and the <Col N="678" /> Government should legalise what is already the practice in many areas. That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    <P>The Minister also had the benefit of 75 recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights and a review of the liquor licensing laws which recommended a 12.30 a.m. closing time, with half an hour drinking up time. In some respects our laws are archaic and complicated. It is extremely difficult to open an off-licence &ndash; the price of a pub licence is approximately £100,000. There are people with vested interests who do not want change, but we must accommodate the consumer.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point about the dangers of alcohol, a drug which affects many homes throughout the country. We must be reasonable in our request. We should have integration of all laws to ensure we eliminate under-age drinking. This is half-hearted reform. The Minister should have said three weeks ago that this would not happen until the end of the year. The vintners would have been happy to wait until then, but the Minister led them along and then cancelled the plan. That is regrettable.</P>

      <P>It should not take enormous effort to deal with the question of opening hours. I do not understand why it was not addressed in the Bill, particularly when the need for the 12.30 a.m. closing time, with a half hour drinking up time, is a reasonable and balanced demand. The Minister has seen fit to ignore the needs of society, the publicans, the recommendations made by the joint committee of which Deputy Flanagan is chairman, on which I compliment him, and the indepth consideration by that committee. Will the Minister include a 12.30 a.m. closing time in the later, substantive Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If we needed any sign that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is out of touch with what is happening in the country, this Bill is it. He is introducing laws which the majority of people are against. For example, the vast majority of people do not need 24 hour opening to celebrate the millennium. They may feel that perhaps an extension to 2 a.m. would be sufficient. The Minister stated that the extension of opening hours to 12.30 a.m. would take place this summer, but it has not happened. Many people find this hard to understand. The Minister had a good opportunity to implement the recommendations of the committee chaired by Deputy Flanagan, but he did not take that opportunity. I cannot understand why? I assume he does not know what people need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should also have dealt with the introduction of a national identity card scheme to combat under-age drinking. Fine Gael Members are not suggesting that there should not be a pragmatic view of the damage alcohol abuse can cause. Under-age drinking is a serious problem <Col N="679" /> that can be addressed by an identity card scheme which the Minister should have introduced in this Bill. The Minister's apparent inability to extend licensing hours to 12.30 a.m. and to give a half hour's drinking up time is what most of us cannot understand. I welcome the changes for Sunday drinking, as the situation was ridiculous with the rather archaic licensing laws. If he could do this for Sunday he could have done it for the rest of the week. I do not know if he did not have the will to do it or if the Government decided not to introduce this extension of hours.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who is taking the brunt of the criticism. It is not his fault. The Minister is like the Duke of York. He has led us up the hill and then back down again.</P>

      <P>The amendment I tabled, which will not apparently be taken tomorrow, as was originally signposted, is designed to give some substance to what I can only describe as a threadbare Bill.</P>
      <P>The general reaction to this Bill has been disbelief. People are aghast that such a minimalist approach should have been taken by the Government. The only people who will rejoice at this Bill are journalists for local newspapers who specialise in covering &ldquo;found on&rdquo; cases in the District Courts, as publicans, their patrons and the gardai carry on the farcical after hours ritual which has become a permanent feature of life, particularly in rural Ireland. It has gone beyond a joke.</P>
      <P>Our ludicrous licensing laws remain largely unreformed. The core values which inform the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, framed at the time of the prohibition on alcohol in America, are still intact. This Bill is the flimsiest of efforts, containing minor provisions which should form part of a much wider Bill addressing comprehensively the whole area of the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor. The abolition of the holy hour on Sundays is long overdue. This was a tattered statute, long fallen into disrepute and more honoured in the breach than in the observance. The only other purpose of the Bill is to grant a once off, 24 hour exemption over new year's eve and new year's day. It is hard to see this as anything other than a gimmick, a gimmick I do not support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By advancing such a proposal, the Government merely underlines its failure to address the cen<Col N="680" /> tral need for the extension of normal opening hours. This is addressed by my amendment, which simply seeks the extension of opening hours to 12.30 a.m. every night, summer or winter, with a normal half hour drinking up time. This is the least that needs to be done if we are to deal honestly with the reality of drinking habits in Ireland today. It is time we started treating people as adults and time to offer our tourist visitors an opportunity to experience and enjoy Irish hospitality and craic. We must also begin the process of promoting within our indigenous population a new, measured and responsible drink culture that will banish to memory many of the current bad and objectionable practices, as well as the many and varied hardships that result therefrom.</P>
    <P>An often neglected aspect of the closing hours question is the torment endured by people who live in proximity to nightclubs and discos which become the resort, several nights a week, of people with little interest in clubbing or dancing, but whose main purpose is to obtain a late drink after they are ejected from pubs. Our restrictive opening hours lead directly to the crowding of people into such late serving establishments, with all the resultant interfaces that occur, including violent exchanges and damage to property. This problem is especially acute in our medium to smaller towns, which often have only a handful of premises with late licences. There is no need for such problems to persist. They can be solved by comprehensive legislation covering all aspects of our licensing laws. I will commend my amendment to the Minister at the appropriate stage, and revisit the arguments in support of it. I urge the Minister to accept it and to ensure that out of this effort we will see a worthwhile Bill, deserving of the support of all opinion represented in this House.</P>

I have not heard such an idiotic proposal from a Government in many a long day. It is adding to the ridiculous, hysterical hype winding people up for the millennium.

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this valuable opportunity to raise this important matter. The 75 per cent increase in waiting lists in the North-Eastern Health Board region between March 1997 and March 1999 is a cause for alarm, at a time when the Celtic tiger is said to be roaming the country. Almost 1,000 extra cases await treatment. The cases include bypass operations, hip replacements and other orthopaedic procedures. Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, has approximately 220 more patients on its waiting list, an increase of 85 per cent. Wards in that hospital have been closed down. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, has 500 more patients on the waiting list, an increase of 107 per cent.</P>
      <P>A patient who was seen in September 1998 was told that he would be seen by the surgeon in Navan on 3 June 1999. When the patient was seen on 3 June he was told to wait until the following Tuesday to have an X-ray in Monaghan. He then had to return to Navan on the following Thursday, so the person accompanying him had to take three days off work. This examination was done in an effort to have the patient put on the urgent list, but he has heard no word since. On his last visit, the surgeon told him that his hip needed to be replaced urgently and his other hip, which had been replaced previously, needed attention.</P>
      <P>A second person has been on an urgent list since April 1999. When my office phoned the admissions department we were informed that the theatre will be closed during July and August because of holidays and refurbishment. The hospital can give this patient no information until after the holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case refers to a person who is in a home for the elderly in Northern Ireland. He has been there for the past 15 months instead of being in the complex in Monaghan where he had been previously resident, at one third the cost. <Col N="682" /> When will this patient be operated on and relieved of his pain and when will the State be relieved of the cost of £360 per week which must be paid to the nursing home in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>A young girl was to have a check-up in Tallaght hospital last autumn. The other day I received a letter from St. Vincent's Hospital which included the following:</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Hospital, up until the start of the year, were operating a video telemetry machine. Because of cutbacks, of which I am sure you are fully aware which involve the Tallaght Hospital, this service has been suspended.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if you could write to the Minister for Health requesting that this service should be financed because we don't have any access for this service for our patients in St Vincent's and Tallaght Hospitals.</P>
    <P>All this is happening at a time when we have millions of pounds in extra revenue. The sale of Telecom Éireann is about to take place, yet these people are being asked to suffer indefinitely. In the absence of the real Minister, I am sure Dr. Moffatt will give us reasons for this situation and try to make things sound as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be going to Brussels as our Commissioner shortly. For the sake of the health service in the north-eastern region and because of his failure to finance it, I hope he goes. When he had the opportunity a few weeks ago, he failed to finance Monaghan General Hospital. I ask the Minister to give those who are suffering some hope that they will be called in the next few weeks and will not be allowed to suffer any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be in a position to address the House tonight on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Cowen, Minister for Health and Children, and to clarify for the House the position in relation to waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board has made a commitment in its 1999 service plan to improve significantly lengths of time patients are waiting for essential procedures. The board is currently pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at improving waiting times and, together with the new policy circular and guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children at the instigation of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, it is anticipated that waiting lists and, more importantly, waiting times for public patients awaiting treatment will be significantly improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 the North-Eastern Health Board approved a framework for the development of acute hospital services in the region and is currently working towards the full implementation of the developments contained in this plan. Towards accelerating implementation of the plan, the Minister, on 31 May 1999, approved the establishment of project teams to plan the devel<Col N="683" /> opments identified for the Louth-Meath and Cavan-Monaghan hospital groups respectively.</P>
    <P>The range and complexity of services in the region have been significantly developed and enhanced, and this in itself has contributed to the increase in their waiting lists. People from the North-Eastern Health Board area are now able to avail of treatment in their own region, whereas prior to the development of local services, these people were forced to travel outside their own area and thus were not appearing on the north-eastern waiting list.</P>
    <P>The high rate of road traffic accidents and trauma in the region is also a significant factor in the north-east and should be considered when looking at the waiting list issue. The Deputy will be aware that there is a considerably higher number of road traffic accidents in this area than in any other part of the country and this has an impact on hospital services and waiting lists.</P>
    <P>At national level, I regret to have to inform the House that the current national waiting list figures are a direct result of the <i>ad hoc </i>manner in which the previous Government handled the waiting list initiative. In 1997, an election year, the preceding Government reduced the funding to the waiting list initiative by 50 per cent on the previous year, allocating a mere £8 million compared with £12 allocated in 1996. This very significant reduction in dedicated funding to hospitals to enable them to carry out additional procedures, over and above their normal activity, resulted in this Government inheriting a chronic situation in relation to waiting lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures do not show that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is tackling the waiting list initiative in a structured and strategic manner. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that at the end of March 1999, the national waiting list figure fell by 1,887. This represents a reduction of 5.1 per cent since December 1998 and reverses the upward trend in waiting lists that started when the previous Government was in office.</P>
      <P>This decrease extends across a large number of hospitals and specialties. It vindicates the approach the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has adopted since coming into office in addressing the issue of waiting lists in an integrated way, using a combination of short-term, medium-term and long-term initiatives to deal with both the immediate problem and the underlying causes that have been giving rise to it.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has this year allocated a total of £20 million of dedicated funding to enable hospitals to provide treatments to patients who would otherwise have been waiting for significantly longer periods. This represents an increase of two thirds over the funding allocated for this purpose in 1998 and it is 2.5 times higher than the funding given by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned, several important initiatives <Col N="684" /> have been undertaken by the Government in relation to the management of the waiting list initiative. These include the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated, the provision of £9 million to services for older people and an allocation of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. I am confident that these initiatives will continue to have a significant and positive impact on waiting lists for the remainder of the year, and more importantly that waiting times for public patients will be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will not respond to this matter. It always seems that my colleague from Mayo, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, replies to the issues I raise. I have time for Deputy Moffatt and I do not want to be dismissive about him, but I would like him to tell the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs that I am disappointed he is not present. I considered whether I would go ahead with this matter, but out of respect of the House I will make my case. The non-attendance of the Minister seems to reflect an attitude in the Department and the message probably being sent out by the Minister is that those who are not able to fight for themselves should be taken on. The Minister and the Government will pay the penalty down the road.</P>
      <P>The person in this case had an accident at work eight years ago in which she lost part of three of her fingers. In recent years the Department has been taking her pension from her and then reinstating it. Again her pension has been taken from her. The delay in getting an oral hearing to appeal the decision of the Department is outrageous. Money is taken from her the minute the referee decides she is no longer entitled to a pension and that she is fit to work. The person then has to go begging to the community welfare officer. Compassion is not shown by the Department. People should be paid until the appeal has been processed. This would encourage the Department to be faster in arranging appeals so that people would not have to wait for months.</P>
      <P>There would be uproar if money was taken from me or the Minister and if we had to wait six months before we could make an appeal and in the meantime had to go begging to the community welfare officer. It is wrong that we are attacking the weak in society, something which is happening in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another category of people affected by this are those who may not be physically injured but who may be mildly mentally handicapped. I have sent some of these cases to the Ombudsman. These people are not be able to take up employment and yet do not fall into any particular category. The inspectors do now show compassion to such <Col N="685" /> people. The message from the Government, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, is that these people should get out to work whether or not they are fit to work. If they are not fit for work the attitude seems to be that maybe they will die and go away. This is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a certain category of people who should be protected by the State and I am asking that the delay in making appeals be dealt with immediately so that people are not made wait for months for oral hearings. This is a reasonable request. If they have to wait for months they should be paid in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to tell the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs that I am not satisfied with what is happening in the Department. When the Dáil returns in October &ndash; there is doubt as to whether it will come back given the tribunals which are taking place &ndash; I will have the Minister in the House to answer issues such as this. I will table many questions about the delays people are experiencing in waiting for oral hearings. The officers in the Department should be called off the weak people in society. I support the Department and the Minister in going after people who are defrauding the State, namely, those who are working and are drawing dole. These are the people who should be dealt with, not the weak, the sick and those who do not fall into any particular category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, regrets that he cannot be here to reply on this occasion. The person concerned had been in receipt of disability benefit initially, and then invalidity pension from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>A person who is incapable of work and satisfies relevant contribution conditions will qualify for disability benefit in the first instance. If people have been claiming disability benefit for a minimum period of one year and are considered incapable of work for a further 12 months, application may be made for invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the regulations governing payment of disability benefit and invalidity pension require the Department to exercise adequate medical control of customers. This control is exercised through the medical assessors to whom customers in receipt of such payments are referred for examination on a regular basis. All the Department's medical assessors are fully qualified and experienced doctors. Their examinations are carried out in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Except in cases where a person might be deemed to be permanently incapable of work, claimants are required to attend for medical examinations on a regular basis in order to establish the extent of their incapacity and their continued entitlement to payment. Following such an examination in February 1999, a medical assessor <Col N="686" /> considered that the person concerned was not incapable of work and payment of invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer from 11 March 1999.</P>
    <P>She appealed against this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and in the context of her appeal she was examined by another medical assessor of the Department on 23 April 1999 who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
    <P>In the light of this the person was afforded an opportunity at that stage to set out the complete and up-to-date grounds for her appeal and to furnish any further medical evidence she wished to submit in support of her appeal. In accordance with statutory procedures, the comments of the deciding officer who made the decision disallowing pension were also sought.</P>
    <P>The current position in regard to her appeal is that the matter has been examined by an appeals officer who considers that an oral hearing of the appeal will be required to give the person concerned the opportunity to present her case.</P>
    <P>The appeals process is quasi-judicial and the procedures are designed to ensure that every appeal gets full and satisfactory treatment in an independent and impartial manner in accordance with principles of natural justice.</P>
    <P>More than 5,000 oral hearings by appeals officers are heard annually and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to give a precise time for the holding of an oral hearing too far in advance of the hearing. The timing of the hearing will depend on a consideration of the number of cases to be heard, the time when individual cases are received, the proposed location of the oral hearing and the availability of appeals officers. A person will usually be advised approximately two weeks in advance of the proposed date.</P>
    <P>I understand from the social welfare appeals office that the oral hearing of this person's case will be arranged for the week commencing 26 July 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with my constituency colleague, Deputy Power. It is important that in the early days of this official dispute every effort is made to find an acceptable solution.</P>
      <P>As this issue affects education and its provisions in Kildare, it is of paramount importance that the Department on the one hand and the trade union on the other do not become so entrenched in their views that it prevents them from finding an acceptable solution. I stress that time is of the essence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kildare VEC is one of the most active in the country, with ten post primary schools, more than 4,000 students, three VTOS centres, two Youthreach centres and a teaching facility in the Curragh Prison. In addition, it operates a huge adult education programme in the county with more than 1,000 adult participants. The VEC also <Col N="687" /> helps hundreds of people through its literacy programme.</P>
    <P>The VEC also has to deal with the primary and post-primary transport scheme as well as third level and post-primary grant schemes. Having been a member of the VEC, I recall the problems which occurred in 1995 in relation to this matter. The small gains made by the staff on that occasion were to be supplemented by further action from the then Department of Education. Sadly, this has not happened. If the previously mentioned work of the VEC is not to be damaged in the long-term, it is imperative that the Minister and his officials enter into dialogue with IMPACT, the officials' trades union, to resolve the present impasse.</P>
    <P>County Kildare is the second fastest growing county and it cannot afford to have a vital link in its development, such as education, undermined by a lack of action on the part of the Department. The staff have, to my knowledge, which is first hand due to my involvement with the VEC, acted honourably at all times in this matter. However, the lack of personnel to meet the workload involved to ensure the successful running of the VEC has left the workforce with no other option but to bring this matter to a head. The members of staff have on many occasions been forced to bring work home to ensure that deadlines are met. Surely it is totally unacceptable that staff who have given such excellent service over a long number of years should have to endure such unnecessary and unsustainable pressure. The Minister should put a mechanism in place to ensure an equitable solution can be reached in order to resolve this very important matter for the staff of County Kildare VEC and for the development of education in County Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Wall, for allowing me share time with him this evening. He has outlined the difficulty which County Kildare is facing at present. It is most unfortunate that the strike is taking place. There has been a staffing problem in County Kildare VEC for a number of years. This has been brought to the attention of the Department of Education and Science but little or no action has been taken. Certainly the numbers have not been increased and the problems have remained. The figures have been provided to the Department. Comparisons with similar vocational education committees throughout the country clearly demonstrate that there is a serious shortage of staff in County Kildare VEC.</P>
      <P>The action the workers are taking is not being taken lightly. It comes after much dialogue and effort on their behalf to try to bring about a solution. The workers have made great sacrifices to try to keep the show on the road and they feel at this stage that strike action is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get involved directly. It is not a pretty sight to see these people on strike. They would much prefer to be doing <Col N="688" /> their work, as many of them have been doing well for a long number of years. The Minister should get involved and ensure that this problem is sorted out as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Wall and Power for raising this matter. It gives me an opportunity to clarify the circumstances which have led to the present industrial relations difficulties in County Kildare VEC and to outline my Department's plans to have claims for improved staffing levels and structures processed within an agreed framework for the VEC sector.</P>
      <P>The allocation of administrative staff in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme-wide basis. It is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy sanctioned staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. The Deputies will be aware that any case for an increase in staffing has to be approached in the context of Government policy on public service numbers and staffing norms in the VEC sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>County Kildare VEC has made a number of representations to my Department concerning the adequacy of staffing levels in the scheme based on the increases in pupil numbers and the expansion of programmes. Arising from previous claims for an improved grading structure and staffing increase, my Department carried out an examination of the staffing levels in 1995. In addition, the grading structure of the VEC was evaluated by an independent consultant. Arising from these reports, the clerical staff complement for County Kildare VEC was increased from 15.8 to 17.8 posts and a new senior management grade was created in the committee. This allocation was arrived at on the basis that it compared favourably with other schemes of similar size. Further increases in the administrative staffing complement of the VEC have since been approved by my Department to support the ESF and PLC student maintenance grant schemes and the operation of the VTOS and Youthreach programmes.</P>
      <P>In his report on the grading structure to apply in the VEC, the independent consultant recommended that the need for the appointment of an assistant principal officer in the VEC should be reviewed at a later date. My Department has agreed to have this review carried out but IMPACT indicated that this was not acceptable. It requested a full review of its structure and threatened industrial action, including an all-out strike from Monday, 21 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not opposed in principle to the carrying out of a staffing review in County Kildare. However, I am not aware that the levels of activity in County Kildare VEC have changed substantially since 1995. In addition, my Department has received similar requests from many other vocational education committees. I want to ensure that all requests from vocational education committees for improved staffing levels and structures are dealt with in an equitable, trans<Col N="689" /> parent and timely manner. With that in mind, work is currently under way on the development of an agreed framework for looking at staffing claims generally from the VEC sector. This framework will inform my Department concerning the level of pressures and demands falling to be meet by vocational education committees, including County Kildare VEC, in an objective way so that an appropriate and timely response can be made. My Department expects to be in a position to finalise the detailed arrangements shortly following discussions with all relevant interests, including staffing and management representatives.</P>
    <P>The threatened strike action in County Kildare was deferred for one week pending discussions between my Department and the VEC to be held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. These talks were held on Wednesday last and were adjourned without a solution having been found.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I am conscious of the hardship which might occur following the withdrawal of labour by IMPACT members in County Kildare. I am anxious that this hardship be kept to a minimum and, in this respect, I have asked the committee to ensure that all possible steps are taken to minimise the hardship caused for groups affected by the dispute.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to be available for further talks in order to resolve the matters at issue. I am confident that a mechanism can be found which addresses the particular difficulties of County Kildare staff while also allowing for the development of the proposed national framework.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for being present in the House at this late hour.</P>
      <P>On 30 September 1998 there were 86 pupils enrolled in Convoy joint national school. These pupils were divided into three multi-grade classes. Junior and senior infants were grouped in one class, giving a total of 28 pupils. First, second, third and part of fourth class were grouped, giving a total of 32 pupils in that classroom. The rest of fourth class, together with fifth and sixth classes, were grouped, which gave a total of 26 pupils in the higher classes. These groupings were arranged after the most careful consideration and assessment of the abilities of the pupils involved. The middle class exceeded the recommended maximum class group by two pupils, which is clearly in breach of the national guidelines for maximum class numbers, which I understand to be 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister met representatives from the school in Letterkenny during his visit to Donegal last September and they had an opportunity of putting the case for a third assistant teacher. I <Col N="690" /> understand that the Minister was very positive in his response that day. The school representatives had high hopes that an additional teacher would be appointed, but we have reached the end of the school year and nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>For the coming school year the situation will become even more critical. From September next it is estimated that a minimum of 90 pupils will be enrolled in Convoy joint national school. In addition, 24 local authority houses are about to be allocated in Convoy, which could increase that enrolment beyond 90. I understand 90 is the required number of pupils for the appointment of a third assistant teacher. From next September the classes will be divided as follows: 32 pupils in junior classes, 32 pupils in the middle class and 26 pupils in the senior classes. Therefore, for the next school year two class groupings will be in excess of 30, which is the recommended maximum class number. This is simply unacceptable and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Convoy joint national school is also participating in the Breaking the Cycle scheme, which is designed to cater for educationally disadvantaged schools. A recent in-school survey revealed that 35 per cent of pupils in the school are performing below average and a number of pupils who have been assessed were border line special education cases. I visited Convoy joint national school and witnessed how both teachers and pupils are operating under most difficult circumstances. It is completely unacceptable that in excess of 30 pupils are crammed into a multi-grade classroom designed to cater for fewer students. Neither teachers nor pupils are given a fair chance in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>To allocate an extra assistant teacher to this school would not incur or require any additional capital costs. An empty classroom is already available in the school. The only extra cost involved would be the salary of the new teacher.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying that no primary school class grouping should exceed 30 pupils. Convoy joint national school will clearly be in breach of these guidelines for the 1999-2000 school year. Indeed, the school was also in breach for the year which has just ended. In view of this, the fact the school is in the breaking the cycle scheme and the level of disadvantage, I am appealing to the Minister to sanction a third assistant teacher as soon as possible, even on a temporary basis, to relieve the pressure on teachers and pupils in this school. On the basis of enrolment alone, the school will be entitled to the third assistant from September 2000.</P>
    <P>As a millennium gesture and the fact that two class groupings will be in excess of 30 pupils, I ask the Minister to approve the extra teacher from 1 September next.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Dála as ucht an cheist a chur ós comhair an Dáil anocht. The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrol<Col N="691" /> ment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. That has been the norm for the past decade and is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Convoy joint national school is a principal and two mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 79 pupils as at 30 September 1997. The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher and a breaking the cycle teacher.</P>
      <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 86 pupils. Despite the fact that I have implemented substantial improvements in the staffing schedule for the 1999-2000 school year, this enrolment does not meet the minimum requirement of 90 pupils for the appointment of a third assistant teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, I regret that there is no <Col N="692" /> basis at present whereby I can sanction the appointment of an additional teacher for Convoy joint national school. If there are any special needs children in the school and where professional assessments are provided to the Department, there is an automatic entitlement of additional teaching resources, be they part-time, whole-time or child care assistance for such children, separate to the overall pupil-teacher ratio for the school. If it has not already done so, I would urge the school to make applications in respect of any such children through the local inspector to the special education section of the Department.</P>
    <P>If the numbers in the school increase significantly in September, the situation can be reviewed. However, in line with existing policies, it is not possible to make an exception for this school over any other.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 July 1999.</P>

      <P>The Partnership 2000 working group on basic income is considering an indicative basic income proposal put forward by the Conference of Religious in Ireland. The CORI proposal is that a basic income would be paid unconditionally to everyone, irrespective of whether or not they were in receipt of income from any other source. While the basic income would be tax free, all additional income would then be taxable at a flat rate. Under the proposed basic income system, all social welfare payments would be replaced by a basic income payment. Employee's PRSI would be abolished, and employer's PRSI would be replaced by a social responsibility tax. The implications of this change are being considered by the group.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the group has completed its discussion of phase one of the study which covers the costs and distributional aspects of basic income and for which a considerable amount of detailed analysis of costings, taxation and social welfare matters has had to be undertaken. The report of phase one of the study will be submitted in the near future. Work has already commenced on the second phase of the study which will evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system.</P>

      <P>I intend to visit Russia in mid-September. The invitation to visit was conveyed by the then Russian Prime Minister Primakov when I met him in Shannon last March. Prime Minister Stepashin has renewed the invitation. While the programme for the visit is still developing at this point, it is likely that I will meet Prime Minister Stepashin on 14 September. In addition, I would hope to meet with President Yeltsin and other important political figures. This will be the first official visit to Russia from Ireland at Head of Government level, although Ireland has had diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation and previously with the Soviet Union for more than 25 years. Relations with Russia have been of significant economic benefit to Ireland. I would hope that this visit will serve to consolidate those relations and provide a basis for their future development. I expect to be accompanied by a business delegation.</P>
      <P>It is also possible that I will attend a meeting of Heads of State and Government during the summer to discuss the EU's stability pact for South East Europe. The proposal for this summit was put forward by the German Presidency in recent days, but the arrangements have not yet been put in place. The summit may take place in July.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. The procedures provide for the appointment of an independent complaints <Col N="695" /> inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister. All complaints, other than the most trivial or vexatious, are referred to him by the Minister. The agreement also provided that the revised complaints procedures should operate on a trial basis for two years, after which a review of the procedures should take place. This review is now being undertaken by sub-committees of the conciliation council established for that purpose. I am hopeful that agreement on reviewed procedures will be reached without undue delay.</P>

These missions have operated under both UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement mandates.

      <P>In recent months a number of approaches have been made by private concerns regarding the possible use of facilities at Baldonnel aerodrome. My concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for commercial use. However, the greater utilisation of this under-used resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other implications of the greater use of Baldonnel by private companies are appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise. However, I will be taking a positive approach and co-operating fully with that Department in examining any proposals received in the matter, subject to the special requirements of the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Austrian Minister for Defence I attended a meeting of Defence Ministers of the member states of the European Union in Vienna on 3 and 4 November 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The invitation from the Austrian Minister was extended in September last year when Austria held the presidency of the EU. The meeting, a once-off and informal event, was non-decision making in character and was held outside the institutional framework of the EU. No decisions or conclusions were reached and no final document was, therefore, produced. Defence Ministers of all the 15 EU member states, including of course the EU neutral states, attended as well as the secretary general of the Western European Union &ndash; WEU. Discussions focused primarily on the development perspectives of European peacekeeping and crisis management with particular emphasis on the practical effect of the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty of Amsterdam. This reflected a recognition that the need to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts, such as those that have occurred in the former Yugoslavia, is the current key security challenge facing the UN and the international community as a whole. I found this an area of great interest and, indeed, importance for Ireland in view of our strong commitment to European integration and in consequence of our long history of support for peacekeeping operations. These two fundamental <Col N="698" /> concepts are brought together in Ireland's readiness to contribute to Petersberg Tasks on a voluntary and case-by-case basis as is our right in accordance with our observer status at the Western European Union. On the basis of our voluntary and long peacekeeping experience, Ireland is ready to make continuing contribution to strengthening the international community's conflict prevention and crisis management capabilities and I made this known during the course of the meeting. Indeed, Ireland has, along with our fellow neutral EU member states, and many other non-Nato states, moved into a new dimension of regional peacekeeping through our participation in the stabilisation force in Bosnia &ndash; SFOR &ndash; and now with our intended participation in KFOR in Kosovo. I found that the Vienna meeting provided a timely opportunity to share experiences in the peacekeeping area with those other countries with which we have much in common.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from what I have outlined, the focus of the Vienna meeting was very firmly in the area of peacekeeping and crisis management. My contribution to the discussions was in that context. I was pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to the meeting and to indicate Ireland's approach to the issues raised.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Vienna meeting, I might mention that I have had occasional meetings with other European Defence Ministers on the margins of Western European Union ministerial council meetings as the occasions presented. Such a meeting took place prior to the Western European Union ministerial council meeting in Bremen on 10 May 1999.</P>
    <P>I received an invitation from the German Minister for Defence to attend a meeting of European Defence Ministers at Bonn on 28 May 1999 in order to, <i>inter alia, </i>exchange views on developments, such as the Kosovo crisis, in advance of the EU summit at Cologne. Due to prior commitments I was unable to attend. Ireland's permanent representative to the Western European Union, ambassador Eamon Ryan, represented me at the meeting.</P>

      <P>By 25 June 1999 the total cost of awards, settlements and plaintiffs' legal costs paid by my Department in Army hearing loss claims was £83 million. A sum of £2.8 million has been paid in respect of 176 court awards, while out of court settlements in 3,215 cases have cost £61.3 million.

In addition, cost projections are based on the scale of damages laid down by the High Court in the case of Hanley <i>v. </i>Minister for Defence. Following that judgment, my Department estimated that the total cost of claims outstanding at that time would be of the order of £550 million, excluding legal costs. The Supreme Court appeal in the Hanley case will be heard in the Supreme Court tomorrow, 1 July 1999 and the main issue of the appeal is the scale of damages.</P>
      <P>Details concerning the number of hearing loss claims received for each month this year is contained in the tabular statement which will be circulated with the official report.</P>

      <P>I recently approved a proposal from the military authorities that the military band at the Curragh should be amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade, the Army No. 1 Band. The amalgamation of these two bands does not involve any reduction in the overall numbers of musicians within the school of music as already provided for within the Defence Forces review implementation plan approved by the previous Government. Under the previous organisation of the Defence Forces, each Army Command &ndash; of which there were four, namely the Eastern, Curragh, Southern and Western Commands &ndash; had a military band. In the new organisational structure, which came into effect on 1 November last, these four commands were replaced by three brigades. Each of these three brigades, eastern, southern and western, has a band as part of its organisation, with the band of the former Curragh command being now amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The military authorities are of the opinion that this new organisation of the school of music will allow all of the Army bands to function to their full potential. Proposals for the recruitment of a <Col N="702" /> small number of particular instrumentalists will be considered in the context of the Defence Forces review implementation plan.</P>
    <P>The proposed eventual deployment of personnel of the Army School of Music is as follows: Eastern Brigade (Army No. 1 Band) 45; Southern Brigade 41; Western Brigade 41; HQ Administration 9; total 136.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 126 and 143 on 1 April last, a court of inquiry was initiated immediately following the accident at Kilworth firing range and its report was subsequently submitted to higher military authority. The inquiry encompassed the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry. The report as submitted gave rise to additional queries which could be addressed only by the reconvening of the court of inquiry. I am advised that the report of the reconvened court has been submitted and is currently under consideration by higher military authority. The Deputy will appreciate that courts of inquiry of this nature are intensive and wide ranging and can take some considerable time to bring to completion.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my earlier reply, the outcome of the inquiry will determine if any action needs to be taken in the interests of safety. However, weapons handling training on the mortar type involved in this accident is continuing but live firing for training purposes has ceased pending completion of the investigations.</P>

      <P>The competition for the procurement of armoured personnel carriers by my Department is currently under way and last February two vehicles which complied fully with the initial technical specification were selected to go forward to the final stage of the tender competition. The successful proposals were submitted by Mowag of Switzerland who manufacture the &ldquo;Piranha&rdquo; APC and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria who manufacture the &ldquo;Pandur&rdquo; APC.</P>
      <P>Both suppliers were asked to prepare formal tenders on the basis of a detailed specification. Completed tenders are being evaluated at present to determine technical merit and the best economic advantage to the Department of Defence. The evaluation process included trials in Ireland, over a two month period, of both vehicles by the Defence Forces and these trials were completed last week. Further tests are due to take place at the manufacturers' premises in August.</P>
      <P>The tender evaluation process will continue with a view to placing a contract for the supply of the selected vehicle in the required configurations, together with associated future maintenance and technical support.</P>

      <P>In February 1996 the Government accepted the Defence <Col N="705" /> Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 which set out the objectives and targets for the initial phase of the Defence Forces reorganisation process.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the overall Defence Forces reorganisation process thus far. From among the many objectives that have been achieved I would like to highlight a reduction in the overall PDF strength by 1,300 to 11,500 and the consequential allocation of 50 per cent of the pay savings to infrastructure and equipment investment; a continuous recruitment policy; the successful introduction of a new structure for Defence Forces headquarters; a comprehensive reorganisation of the Army into a three brigade structure; and the completion of the consultants' studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
      <P>In addition, in July last year, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision was part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally. Five barracks were subsequently evacuated and the sale of these will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>The momentum for reform of the Defence Forces will continue by means both of the implementation plans for the reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval Service which are currently being finalised and through the White Paper on defence process which will be completed later this year.</P>

    <P>Two of the teaching staff employed at the former Army Apprentice School, Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare are currently employed at the Signals School, Curragh. At present, the Department of Education and Science is actively pursuing the possibility of redeployment to institutes of technology for the remaining staff members, in consultation with the staff concerned and with their trade union. The possibility of voluntary early retirement under the relevant Department of Education schemes also arises in some cases. My Department is keeping in touch <Col N="706" /> with the Department of Education and Science in the matter.</P>

      <P>The overall responsibility for the co-ordination, management and provision of accommodation for the Kosovar refugees is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, following the Government decision of 15 July 1998, five military barracks at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare and Castleblayney have been closed. The disposal of each of the barracks is currently being processed. However, arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house the Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect these five locations to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees.</P>
      <P>Magee Barracks, Kildare, has been found suitable and arrangements have been made by the Department of Foreign Affairs through the Office of Public Works to provide mobile home accommodation for the refugees there. A total of 265 refugees have been accommodated there.</P>
      <P>Two non-commissioned officers travelled to Skopje in Macedonia on Thursday 13 May where they worked locally as civilian volunteers with the Department of Foreign Affairs. They worked under the auspices of the Irish ambassador to OSCE with regard to the administration and co-ordination of activities in the field relating to the conveyance of refugees to Ireland. The two non-commissioned officers returned home on 17 June 1999 on completion of their duties there.</P>

      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty brings within the remit of the common foreign and security policy the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management. The treaty provides that it will be for the Western European Union to carry out such tasks, at the instigation of the EU. Ireland will be entitled to participate in such tasks, and has indicated its willingness to do so on a case by case basis. Ireland considers it important that the EU should seek to ensure the effective functioning of these new provisions on <Col N="708" /> peacekeeping and crisis management now that the Amsterdam Treaty has come into force.</P>
      <P>Any involvement by the Defence Forces in the Petersberg Tasks under the auspices of the Amsterdam Treaty would most likely be in the areas of peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks on a voluntary and case by case basis. It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations with which they are tasked from time to time.</P>

      <P>Consulting engineers engaged by my Department to advise on the works necessary to restore the swimming pool facilities at the Curragh Camp recommended a number of options for extensive upgrading and modernising of the existing installation and for the provision of a new complex, which would cater for the broader water-training requirements of Defence Forces personnel. Following examination of the recommendations, construction of a new pool was found to be the better value for money approach. The new pool, which will be a major improvement on the previous facility, will be linked to the existing gymnasium which is also to be upgraded. Detailed design work in connection with the preparation of tender documents is in progress. It is anticipated that a contract will be placed later this year and that work will be completed in about 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pool will be fitted with the latest facilities to cater for the different requirements of the Army and Naval Service. It will include a diving pool for sub-aqua training and for the training of Air Corps personnel in escape procedures. It will also include a confidence-building, learner pool <Col N="709" /> which will provide a safe pool facility for smaller children. This is a very important element given that the pool facility will continue to be made available to families of Defence Forces personnel and to schools in the Curragh area.</P>

      <P>The person named applied under the special beef premium scheme in December 1992 on seven male animals. He was paid the premium in June 1993. An animal bearing the tag number attributed to one of the seven animals on the special beef premium application was subsequently applied on under the suckler cow scheme in another herd. On examining veterinary records it was established that the tag number related to a female animal. As male animals only are eligible for beef premium, my Department has no option but to seek recovery of this payment which was EU funded.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the tax reliefs available under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the above regulations, a disabled person is a person who fulfils one or more of the specified medical criteria, and who is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide that where the Revenue Commissioners have reason to believe that the person named on a primary medical certificate does not fulfil any one of the specified criteria, Revenue shall refer that person for examination to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final, which shall cancel the certificate if it considers it appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the majority of cases, where a primary medical certificate has been received by them, no further certification is sought in respect of future claims. However, where there is reason to believe that a person named on a primary medical certificate may not still meet the specified medical criteria, Revenue shall refer that person to the board of appeal for reassessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To minimise the involvement of the board of appeal, which would be principally engaged in the processing of appeals against the refusal of the issue of primary medical certificates, and for the greater convenience of the person in question, I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners have on occasion asked for a fresh certificate to be furnished in support of a current claim as an <Col N="723" /> alternative to the immediate referral of the case to the board of appeal for re-assessment.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that requests for fresh primary medical certificates or referrals to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal have only been made in a very small number of cases. Of the five cases referred to the board of appeal for re-assessment, four have been assessed so far and the primary certificate has been cancelled in each case. One case is currently awaiting assessment. Fresh certificates were requested in four other cases. One fresh certificate was furnished; no further applications for relief were received from the remaining three.</P>

      <P>Capital acquisitions tax is levied on the recipient of gifts and inheritances. Transfers between spouses, however, are exempted from CAT. The tax is charged on the value of the gift or inheritance in excess of the relevant exempt threshold. There are three exempt thresholds as follows: Class I: £192,900 &ndash; where the recipient is a child, or minor child of a deceased child, i.e. certain grandchildren. This threshold also applies to a parent where he or she takes an absolute inheritance on the death of a child; Class ll: £25,720 &ndash; where the recipient is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendent, other than those covered by Class I; Class III: £12,860 &ndash; where the recipient does not fall within Classes I or II i.e. non-lineal relations and strangers.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, these thresholds have been indexed to the CPI on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>Where a beneficiary has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988, the value of these benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current liability to tax.</P>

    <P>Stepchildren and legally adopted children are entitled to the £192,000 threshold. Close relatives such as nephews or nieces who have been resident with the disponer of the inheritance, may avail of the close relatives relief whereby the value of the shared residence may be reduced for tax purposes by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser. Both the disponer, in this case the aunt, and the recipient, the niece, must have been living in the house for ten continuous years immediately prior to the inheritance and the recipient must not be beneficially entitled to any interest in any other dwelling-house.</P>
    <P>A nephew or niece of a disponer is treated as a child of the disponer in respect of a benefit comprising business or farming assets if the nephew or niece has worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer in the five years ending on the date of the benefit.</P>
    <P>In order to avail of the £192,900 threshold, a nephew or niece must be able to show that the benefit consisted of business or farming assets, or shares in a trading company, and that he or she has worked in the business throughout the relevant five year period for more than 24 hours a week, or for more than 15 hours a week where the business concerned is carried on exclusively by the disponer, any spouse of the disponer and the nephew or niece concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to evidence or proof that the person qualifies for any of these reliefs, I would like to remind the Deputy that inheritance tax is a self-assessment tax. In a situation where the case is selected for audit, it would be up to the individual claiming the relief to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no specific requirements in the legislation concerning the type of evidence required. However, a claimant may be required to corroborate any claim by reference to independent evidence from third parties. In the case of the close relative's relief, production of documentary proof that the individual has resided with the disponer, which is a condition of the relief, may also be sought.</P>

      <P>In response to the increased numbers of reported suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland a national task force on suicide was established in 1995 to make recommendations to service providers about how the problem of suicide and attempted suicide could effectively be addressed. The task force comprised individuals from a wide range of backgrounds from the voluntary and statutory sector. The report of the task force, which was published in 1998, marked the culmination of detailed examination of the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland and outlined a comprehensive national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the national suicide prevention-reduction strategy commenced shortly after publication of the report with a partnership approach adopted between statutory and non-statutory services. I wish to assure the Deputy that this partnership approach continues to operate effectively, drawing from many disciplines in both the voluntary and statutory sector, in implementing the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group in 1998 by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide. Membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. The main responsibilities of the group are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of the health boards. To date, the group's research-review has covered a range of data including: current Central Statistics Office figures relating to the incidence of suicide; the latest research material available on suicide; the new gardaí report forms (Form 104) submitted to the Central Statistics Office in cases of suicide; and the work of the newly established suicide committees and co-ordinators-resource persons appointed in each health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an early stage in its deliberations, the group recognised the need for research-resource support to assist it in carrying out the tasks recommended in the report of the national task force on suicide. Funds have been provided for this purpose and formal approval for the creation of a research-resource officer post has been issued. It is envisaged that the post holder will be involved in the collation of all existing research material, both national and international and making it available to the committee. The appointee will also examine the effectiveness of <Col N="726" /> intervention programmes and will liaise with local co-ordinators in each of the health boards.</P>

      <P>As part of the guidelines determining the eligibility for receipt of various support schemes for persons with disabilities, individuals are required to undergo medical assessment. When the assessment is carried out, the medical officer decides if the condition is likely to change at some later date and hence the medical officer will arrange for a medical review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the condition is considered permanent then a review may be carried out at periodic intervals based on the individual's needs and specific circumstances. These reviews are not carried out simply to determine the permanency of a recipi<Col N="727" /> ent's condition but also to ensure that the services available and the care plan in place meet, to the extent possible, the needs of the recipient on an ongoing basis. Reviews are also necessary for the purposes of the health board's financial accountability.</P>
    <P>Health boards are requested to carry out all reviews in a sensitive manner to minimise any distress to the recipients or their carers.

The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority in my Department's health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and a consultant-led service is now available in each health board.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of formulating a policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services which will include consideration of the specific needs of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I have provided additional revenue resources of £0.5 million in 1998 and £1.378 million in the current year to enable further improvements to be undertaken in the child and adolescent services in a number of health boards and it is intended that these services will continue to be developed in the next few years.</P>
      <P>The provision of funding for voluntary and-or private groups is a matter for the health boards. I would suggest that the regional health boards be contacted directly by the relevant support groups to discuss their needs, including funding requirements, and what role the groups might have in the future development of services in the boards' functional areas.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below. The latest period for which information is available for the Western Health Board is in respect of the quarter ending on 31 March 1999. Information in relation to the average waiting period for this procedures is not readily available. I have asked the health board to forward this information directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the waiting list initiative I have allocated a total of £20 million of dedicated funding this year to enable hospitals to provide treatments to patients who would otherwise have been waiting for significantly longer periods. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the funding allocated for this purpose in 1998 and it is 2.5 times higher than the funding given by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have allocated £9 million to services for older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services in 1999 in areas that will help to address the underlying causes of waiting lists. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds for elective work, including treatment of those on public in-patient waiting lists. The Deputies will be aware that the review group on the waiting list initiative identified inappropriate use of acute hospital beds, due to such factors as the shortage of step-down places and facilities for rehabilitation, as a key source of substantial waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to building on the success achieved so far this year in reducing waiting lists <Col N="729" /> by continuing the implementation of the recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative in a structured and integrated manner. My Department will continue to work closely with hospitals and health boards to ensure that both waiting times and waiting lists continue their welcome downward trend.</P>

      <Quest>if public patients in the Eastern Health Board region will be able to avail of the national breast screening programme at the Mater and St Vincent's hospitals when it commences in view of the fact that only private patients are able to avail of this service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, in Ireland mammography is used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease. It is not correct to state that this service is only available for private patients. There are 19 diagnostic mammographic units available in Ireland for public patients. Of the 19 units 14 are available outside of Dublin, with at least one unit in each health board area. In the Eastern Health Board region, symptomatic services are available to public patients at five hospitals including the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, my predecessor gave the go ahead for the introduction of Phase I of the national breast screening programme. This phase will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50-64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population. There will be two central units located at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin and at the Mater Hospital, Dublin where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the national breast screening board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas, irrespective of their health service eligibility status.</P>
      <P>In March 1999, I announced that Phase I of the national breast screening programme would commence in October 1999. A key element in meeting this target date was the provision of appropriate physical facilities for the screening programme. The Deputy will be pleased to know that my Department has now approved the acceptance of tenders in relation to the development of the Eccles unit at the Mater Hospital, where refurbishment work can commence immediately.</P>
      <P>In addition, the planning for the development of the Merrion unit at St. Vincent's Hospital is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position shortly to approve the acceptance of tenders in this regard. It is planned that the necessary works for both units will be completed to facilitate the commencement of screening in October 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am <Col N="731" /> satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>

      <P>A circular letter was issued by this Department in September 1998 in relation to the remuneration of hospital pharmacists. This circular concerned pharmacists employed in the health services in general and did not make reference to pharmacists employed in any specific agencies.</P>
      <P>Due to a misinterpretation of the terms of the circular by the Eastern Health Board in relation to superannuation, no increases were paid to those pharmacists employed by the board who had retired prior to the implementation date of the circular 1 April 1997.</P>
      <P>The Department has now clarified the issue with the Eastern Health Board and the board is now arranging to have the pay award applied to those pharmacists who retired before 1 April 1997 in accordance with this Department's circular No. 76/97 which sets out detailed provisions for the application of superannuation benefits to serving and retired officers.</P>

      <P>Since coming into office, I am acutely aware of the importance of reducing waiting lists and waiting times, particularly for children. To this end my Department has allocated £150,000 in 1999 to Temple Street Hospital under the waiting list initiative for the provision of treatment to children on waiting lists. At the end of March 1999, the most recent period for which information is available, there was a total of 98 children awaiting ophthalmology procedures at Temple Street. Patients are chosen for treatment under the waiting list initiative based on clinical priority.</P>
      <P>However, if the patient's general practitioner feels that her condition has deteriorated or requires urgent intervention, he would be best placed to advise on the availability of appropriate alternative services.</P>

An extensive consultation process was entered into in recent weeks with all interested parties and support groups and is now about to draw to a close.

My officials will now review their proposals in the light of the consultation process and consult further with the office of the Attorney General in the matter before commencing work on drafting the Heads of a Bill. As you can appreciate, it is difficult to give a precise timescale for the introduction of legislation in this area but I can assure Deputy Ahern that the matter is being addressed and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, commits the Government to the restoration of decision making power to local authorities and local people. A major renewal programme for local authorities is well under way and the position regarding the many initiatives is as follows:</P>
      <P>Constitutional recognition of local government and periodic local elections has been provided for in accordance with the provisions of the Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1999, following the passing of the recent referendum.</P>
      <P>Ireland signed the European Charter of Local Self Government in October 1997. Ratification of this Charter, which requires Dáil approval, will take place as part of the renewal process now under way.</P>
      <P>A new buoyant funding system for local authorities was introduced on 1 January 1999. This is being complemented by work which is now well advanced on the development of more modern financial management systems and the enhancement of value for money in local authorities.</P>
      <P>Work is well under way on the preparation of a major local government Bill for publication later this year to modernise and consolidate local government law and to introduce a range of reform measures. A key element of this Bill will be to enhance the role of the elected member. This Bill will involve the repeal, amendment, updating and consolidation of the local government code, including city and county management. This legislation and various other reform measures will enable local authority members to determine and review policy with proper support and within a modern legislative framework.</P>
      <P>County and city local authorities established new strategic policy committees (SPCs) in 1998, providing new ways of involving local people more closely in their work. IR difficulties delayed the effective operation of the SPCs. However, a broadly based working group which was established to bring forward proposals for revised SPC guidelines, is due to report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme for the integration of the local development and local government systems through the establishment of county and city development boards in January 2000 has been drawn up by a task force which I chaired. The <Col N="737" /> programme is currently being implemented and the recruitment process for directors of community and enterprise is nearing completion. These boards will position local government as the hub in bringing together the activities of State bodies, local development agencies and in promoting economic, social and cultural development.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme of one stop shops for which funding is being provided is under way.</P>
    <P>The electoral area boundary committees' reports and their recommendations were accepted in full by the Government and implemented for the recent local elections.</P>
    <P>A long service gratuity for councillors was introduced prior to the local elections in June 1999 to recognise the dedicated service of long serving councillors. It was also designed to widen the opportunity for new entrants, including women and the young.</P>
    <P>Priority is being given to meeting the training and education needs of all councillors. A working group, which was established to bring forward proposals regarding a training and education programme, is due to report shortly.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the creation of strengthened local authority management structures are the subject of discussions between the local government management services board, representing local authority management and the unions representing local authority administrative and technical staff.</P>
    <P>Most of the detailed controls in the personnel field which had been exercised by the Department have been devolved to the local authorities already and it is intended to devolve responsibility for personnel matters to the maximum extent possible to the local authorities and, where appropriate, to the local government management services board.</P>
    <P>Recruitment of staff to posts other than those filled through the LAC is a matter for the local authorities themselves. Section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1998, will, when implemented, remove the statutory requirement that every post for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the LAC. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will declare by order the level at which the LAC will fill posts. Posts not filled by the LAC will be filled by open competitions at local level.</P>
    <P>Measures are being taken to develop and promote good human resource practices in the local authorities with particular emphasis on areas such as training, gender equality, employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A major national commemorative programme to celebrate the centenary of local government in Ireland and to promote the achievements of local government, which commenced in August 1998 is ongoing.</P>
    <P>In relation to other areas mentioned in the Deputy's question, the following initiatives have been implemented or are planned.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government promised to <Col N="738" /> update and consolidate Ireland's planning laws. To this effect a comprehensive review of planning legislation was carried out and a major Bill to reform and consolidate planning law will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In line with commitment in the Programme for Government to enact conservation legislation to protect the built environment the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 23 June 1999. Planning authorities will now have additional powers to protect our architectural heritage. In particular, they will be able to ensure that protected structures are not endangered through the neglect or actions of their owners, and will be able to compulsorily purchase a protected structure to ensure its protection.</P>
    <P>Additional measures to protect the built environment have also been introduced including a grant scheme of £3.9 million for conservation works to protected buildings and £300,000 for the employment of conservation expertise in local authorities.</P>
    <P>Integrated area plans under the new tax incentive based urban renewal scheme are being implemented in five cities and 38 provincial towns. This scheme will run to the end of December 2002.</P>
    <P>A new tax incentive based scheme to restore the built fabric of smaller towns has also been announced.</P>
    <P>The major development in relation to traveller accommodation was the enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act in 1998.</P>
    <P>With effect from next year a new multi-annual local authority housing programme will be introduced. This will facilitate local authorities in planning and implementing their housing programmes over a four year period rather than relying on annual allocations as is the current position.</P>
    <P>As far as possible in implementing the reforms, I have attempted to increase the discretion available to local authorities. In addition to the staffing controls I mentioned above, the following steps have been taken: Responsibility for the administration of the rural water programme was devolved to county councils in January 1997 and additional support measures were introduced in February 1998.</P>
    <P>All new local authority housing schemes or programmes introduced in recent years have been devolved to local authorities from day one. Under the new affordable housing scheme, Departmental sanction is not required for individual projects and the carrying out of projects under the scheme comes within the local authorities' own responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul, Neighbourhood watch and community alert who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as  strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, (such as the pendant or button alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck). When this Government came into office in June 1997, the multi-annual budgets for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 for this scheme had been set by the previous Rainbow Government at £2 million in each year. In 1997, I requested the Government to increase this £2 million for that year by £3 million to £5 million and that was agreed. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.</P>
      <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12.6 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Taking account of the demand that has existed in relation to the scheme in previous years, a total of £5 million again has been allocated by the Government to the scheme for 1999. On the basis of 1997 and 1998 experience, it is anticipated that in excess of 21,000 people will benefit under the scheme this year, making a total of approximately 77,000 since the scheme started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications under the 1999 scheme were invited recently from voluntary organisations and community groups. As the closing date for receipt of applications is 16 July 1999, it is not yet possible to determine the level of demand this year. However, the scheme will operate precisely as it has done in previous years i.e. the percentage of the amount sought to be covered by the grant actually allocated will continue to vary depending on the degree of need and the overall number of worthwhile applications to be funded. In general, grants will range upwards of 50 per cent of the cost of the purchase and/or installation of necessary security equipment. While grants of up to 90 per cent of the total cost may, however, be <Col N="740" /> considered where individual circumstances and needs so warrant and in the light of the overall demands which must be met, it is important to note that not all applications received in previous years were funded at a level of 90 per cent. It is therefore not possible to guarantee a particular percentage of funding for individual applications across the board.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of March 1999 there were 11,659 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance. The estimated expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is over £59.5 million.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was launched in October 1998, and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, arange of measures were introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers, that is, over 40 per cent increase in funding in one year.</P>
      <P>The changes introduced in the 1999 budget included some improvements in the means test for carer's allowance. From August 1999, a disregard of £75 per week will be applied to the income of a single carer and the current disregard of £150 per week will be applied to the joint means of a married couple.</P>
      <P>The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. One of the major issues raised by these groups was the removal or easing of the carer's allowance means test.</P>
      <P>The review examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test which applies to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests associated with social welfare schemes. The position will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to the old age contributory pension (OACP) is determined by reference to the level of PRSI contributions that claimants have throughout their working lives and is not affected by the claimant's means. However, where a person has not paid PRSI contributions or has insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for OACP, they may apply for the means-tested old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the means test is to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need. Accordingly, in assessing means, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, for example, earnings from employment or self-employment, together with the value of any capital or property owned.</P>
      <P>As there are substantial numbers of people in receipt of weekly social assistance payments, it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments. This would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or whenever the capital was moved from one investment option into another. For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
      <P>Under the current arrangements for assessing capital and property the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent. These arrangements, which were provided for by my predecessor, applied to old age non-contributory pensions with effect from October 1997.</P>
      <P>While the formula for the notional assessment of capital includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, the actual effective assessment rates are much lower. For example, a single pensioner can have capital of up to £6,160 and a couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension. In addition, a couple with capital of £20,000 would only be assessed with means of £600, giving an effective assessment rate of just 3 per cent. As only 2 to 4 per cent of pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, this means that the effective assessment rates for the vast majority of pensioners are very much lower than the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent rates which are used in the notional assessment formula.</P>
      <P>The current formula which is used to determine the value of capital or property disregards a certain amount of capital from the assessment in recognition of sudden and unforeseen needs which may arise; attributes a value to the potential investment income which the capital or property is capable of generating; and recognises that, in addition to the value of the income which the capital or property is capable of generating, there is a further benefit to the claimant through the possession of that capital or property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the current system is designed to <Col N="742" /> ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital or property should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Department is reviewing the system in the light of the interest rates currently available on investments. However, it should be noted that simply reducing the assessment rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent down to the current levels of interest available on bank deposit accounts would disproportionately benefit those who are well off and this consideration was among those informing the decision of the previous Government to set the assessment rates at their present levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home face difficulties in maintaining their social insurance record and has given a commitment under An Action Programme for the Millennium &ldquo;to provide the mechanism to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However as the Deputy will be aware, certain measures have already been introduced to address this problem. Special arrangements are already in place to help people who work in the <Col N="743" /> home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age (contributory) pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted. It is estimated that up to 250,000 people could ultimately benefit under the above arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that in November 1997 I introduced new pro-rata pensions so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age (contributory) pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent. To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. This measure is of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>However, in line with its stated commitment, the Government accepts that more work needs to be done in this area. My Department is now considering the issue on a three-fold basis.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the issue is being examined in the context of the general review of the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) and retirement pensions which, it is hoped, will be completed shortly. Secondly, an in-depth examination of the provisions of the homemakers scheme and the estimated costs will also be undertaken by the Department, later this year. This examination will consider the present disregard arrangements and alternatives such as the award of credited contributions, the question of retrospection, and the cost of any change to the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>Finally, the question of pension provision, both social welfare and occupational, is being considered by the Department in the context of the pensions board report on the national pensions policy initiative. In its report, Securing Retirement Income, the pensions board recommended that occupational pension coverage targets also include specific targets for increased coverage of women in both employed and self-employed areas.</P>
    <P>The board considered that the proposed introduction of personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs) would greatly facilitate the position of women with broken employment records due to childcare and other responsibilities. The working group, chaired by my Department, which was set <Col N="744" /> up to examine issues relating to the introduction of PRSAs, is making good progress. The outcome of the group's deliberations will be reflected in the comprehensive pensions Bill which I hope to publish early in 2000.</P>
    <P>There are, at present, just under 350,000 women in receipt of a social welfare payment, including pensions, unemployment payments, sickness and maternity benefits and supplementary welfare allowance. Child benefit, which of course is payable irrespective of employment status is also being paid to a further 483,000 people, of whom it is estimated that 95 per cent are women.   </P>

      <P>I am the Minister responsible for ensuring the designation and the conservation of special areas of conservation, SACs, under the European Habitats Directive. An important element of that conservation function is the assessment of potential damage that any new development might cause to the integrity of these sites. Golf courses, like other developments, are generally subject to planning permission.</P>
      <P>In a limited number of cases it has been found necessary to initiate legal proceedings against unauthorised developments, including two golf courses where injunctions were sought and granted. These particular injunctions are still in force. In one case the matter was referred to the SAC appeals advisory board under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, which has submitted its recommendation to me recently. I have informed the High Court that I accept this recommendation which is likely to lead to a revision of the status of the injunction. Proceedings have not to date been discontinued in any case.</P>
      <P>Where proposed developments, including golf courses, have been consistent with the conservation needs of an area proposed for designation as a natural heritage area (NHA) or SAC, they have been facilitated, often at local level. However, where the scientific evidence indicated that a particular development will cause significant damage to the protected habitat, it cannot be permitted. While the boundaries of some proposed SACs have been revised, these revisions were, in all cases, for scientific reasons and not to facilitate golf courses or any other type of development.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for an equal opportunities child care programme. The programme is mainly designed to support local communities who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment. It is targeted primarily at community based projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme is part-funded by the EU and has a budget of approximately £6 million, over £4 million Exchequer and £2 million EU funding, for she period 1998-1999. The Programme included capital funding for 106 projects to develop new childcare facilities or to upgrade existing facilities. The allocation of these funds was related to the overall objectives of the programme and made on foot of applications received by June 1998 in response to a national media advertising campaign.</P>
      <P>Additional EU funds were provided for the programme in April and June of this year out of which a total of approximately £800,000 will be allocated to supporting training and networking among the national voluntary child care organisations whose membership base comprises service providers. As these funds are from the European Social Fund, they can only be used for training and development purposes and cannot be used for capital initiatives. My Department invited proposals from the national voluntary child care organisations, including the IPPA, relating to the first tranche of this European Social Fund allocation and set a closing date of 14 June for receipt of applications. The applications are currently being assessed and I will make an announcement on the allocation of these funds in due course. Arrangements are in hand in respect of seeking applications for the remaining funding.</P>
      <P>Applications by my Department for assistance with capital projects can only be considered in the context of the allocations for childcare in the budget for 2000.</P>

The process of recruiting additional psychologists for the agency has already begun. An advertisement for additional staff has been placed and interviews for the new posts will be held shortly. It is envisaged that all schools, both in County Kildare and nationally, will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five-year period and most will have access before that time.</P>

      <P>The NUI Galway intake to the Higher Diploma in Education programme in 1992-93 was open to graduates and applicants were divided into two categories. Category I comprised graduates of the university that year, graduates of the university from previous years engaged in full-time post-graduate studies in the college or who were undergoing postgraduate training and or experience abroad and graduates from the university the previous year allowed to defer places. Category II comprised all other applicants. Priority was given to Category I applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> The position in relation to the 1999-2000 intake is that the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland at Cork, Galway, Dublin and Maynooth agreed to initiate a common application/selection procedure. The criteria for admission to the courses is outlined in the 1999 Higher Diploma in Education Applications Centre Handbook. The handbook states that successful completion of an eligible primary degree course is an essential prerequisite for entry to the higher diploma. Applications are ranked in order of merit on the basis of points which are awarded for: undergraduate and primary degree performance additional postgraduate qualifications; additional relevant qualifications and teaching experience.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for a copy of the 1999 handbook to be forwarded to the Deputy for his information. I understand that the position in relation to the 2000 handbook for the 2000-2001 intake, is that it will be available in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>Attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are characterised by pupils exhibiting persistent and maladaptive levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.</P>
      <P>The management of pupils behaviour is part of all teacher training. Special additional in-service training is available for groups of teachers dealing with children with particular difficulties, including children displaying the characteristics mentioned above.</P>
      <P>Children with less serious forms of this condition are capable of functioning successfully in integrated settings, with the help of resource teachers. For children with more serious forms of troubled behaviour, a range of special schools and special classes dealing with emotional or behavioural disorders is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a major development in special education services under which all special needs children in the primary system are now <Col N="755" /> entitled to an automatic response to their needs. The response in question may take the form of additional teacher or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the particular child. Details of these new arrangements, which are available to the pupils referred to by the Deputy, have recently been circularised to all schools.</P>
    <P>I have also announced the extension of the remedial teacher service to all primary and post-primary schools in the country from September next.</P>
    <P>The assessment of children who are suspected of suffering from attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is best carried out in a multi-disciplinary setting. Classroom teachers, in consultation with educational psychologists, will usually carry out the initial identification and referral to a clinical team for diagnosis. The availability of such psychological advice to teachers will be considerably enhanced with the establishment of the national educational psychological service agency. This agency will begin to provide a service on 1 September, 1999. The process of recruiting additional psychologists for the agency has already begun. An advertisement for additional staff has been placed and interviews for the new posts will be held shortly. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the new psychological service at the end of a five-year period and most will have access before that time. The national educational psychological service will be organised in close collaboration with the clinical psychological services in order to ensure that all children have access to appropriate help.</P>

      <P>Superannuation benefits of retired teachers and the dependants of deceased teachers are calculated in accordance with the teachers superannuation schemes.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Each teacher who retires on pension and each widow-widower who is awarded a pension following the death of a serving teacher or a pensioned teacher, when being awarded pension, is given particulars of the award in writing.

In addition, any pensioner who requests additional details on his or her pension <Col N="756" /> is provided with this information either by phone or in writing.</P>
    <P>Requests for additional information are few in number. However, following correspondence from the Retired Teachers Association, my Department is now providing teachers who retire from May 1999 with more detailed information regarding the make-up of their pensions. This more detailed information will enable teachers to confirm that their pension has been correctly calculated and to confirm that subsequent increases in the salary and allowances of serving teachers are correctly reflected in the pensions of retired teachers.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the long service increment for principals is payable without application and without additional duties; and if it will be applied equally to all pensioners in accordance with precedent.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the payment referred to by the Deputy is payable on the basis of service and without the need for an application. The position is that it was agreed between the parties to the PCW agreement that this payment would be an allowance rather than an increment in salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the long-standing practice of my Department, the benefits of increases in salary are reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and the benefits of allowances are reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held those allowances during service. Since the payment is an allowance, it is not payable in the pensions of teachers who retired prior to the date <Col N="757" /> from which the allowance was introduced, 1 August 1996.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed between the parties to the PCW Agreement that the payment of the long service allowance would apply during the period of the early retirement scheme and that the early retirement scheme would operate on a pilot basis pending review in the light of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. It is expected that the commission will report later this year. The early retirement scheme for teachers and the payment of the long service allowance will be reviewed at that time.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the new rating system for the principal's allowance is not been applied equally to retired principals breaching the long established practice dating back to 1973 that they will have parity of entitlements with those currently retiring.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances are not payable to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996, the date from which it was agreed that the revised scales would be effective.</P>
      <P>The amount of a principal's or deputy principal's allowance is determined by a scale which is related to the size of school involved. With effect from 1 September 1996, the basis for payment has been changed from a system based on numbers of pupils enrolled to a system based on numbers of teachers employed; the scale of payments has also been extended with the effect of increasing the maximum allowance payable.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the principal's or deputy principal's allowance which arises due to the restructuring of the scale is payable only to retired teachers who have received an increase in pay as a result of holding the scale point in question during service. An increase arising from the restructuring of the scale is not payable, therefore, to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996. This is in line with the longstanding practice that the scale of an allowance payable is determined at the date of retirement and that the retired teacher will continue to receive the benefit of the scale reached at retirement irrespective of whether enrolments in the school fall or rise after retirement.</P>
      <P>There is no practice in my Department which decrees that retired principals will have &ldquo;parity of entitlements&rdquo; with those currently retiring. Parity in the case of teachers has always involved a distinction between incremental salary and allowances. The long-standing practice of my Department, dating back to at least 1968, is that the benefits of increases in salary are reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and that the benefits of allowances are reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held those allowances during service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> I met a representative group of principal teachers recently and I am currently considering the points put to me at that meeting.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that the Freedom of Information Act should be extended to institutions in the third level sector. There are operational issues to be considered in so extending the Act, including issues relating to resources. My Department has requested the Higher Education Authority to enter into discussions with the universities in order to establish an appropriate time-frame for the extension of the Act to that sector. My Department will consult directly with the other institutions on the matter. While it is not possible at this stage to provide for a precise time-frame, the objective of these discussions is to ensure that the Act can be extended to the institutions within a reasonable period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the package of measures announced by the Government to help people who were victims of abuse in childhood, including a commission to inquire into instances of abuse such as referred to by the Deputy in her questions. This commission, which is to be chaired by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy of the High Court, has wide terms of reference to inquire generally into the causes, nature and extent of abuse of children. The commission will be given whatever statutory powers and protections it will need to carry out those terms effectively.</P>
      <P>The abuse suffered by the victims of the teacher concerned regrettably mirror the experience of many other people. I am satisfied that the commission, given its composition, wide remit and the fact that it will be provided with the statutory powers it needs, will be in the best position to carry out inquiries into this particular case, together with inquiries relating to other similar cases of abuse. It will be open to the victims in this case to approach the commission and the Taoiseach has given an assurance on behalf of all arms of Government that full and absolute cooperation will be given to the commission.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a statement made by a member of my Department's inspectorate concerning this case. The statement was made on the 16th March, 1999 to the Secretary General of my Department. It was based on the inspector's recollection of events, as he did not have any notes or record of the matters to which it referred. In the statement the inspector recalled that a person had visited him at his home some years ago and informed him that he had been abused years previously while he was a child in primary school by the teacher concerned; that the teacher would soon retire with an unblemished record and that the victim had in the past written a letter of complaint to the Department and had written to or visited either the then Deputies Michael Keating or John Boland or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector stated that he advised the person concerned to inform, in writing, the post-primary administration section of the Department of Education and Science as the teacher in question was then working in a secondary school. The inspector informed the person that a signed written complaint would be investigated by the Depart<Col N="760" /> ment and he outlined what typically happened, in his experience, when such complaints were received. In his report on this matter the Inspector states that he believed that the victim had come to him so that he could be properly advised as to how his allegations should be advanced for investigation by the Department . The inspector understood that the meeting was a private meeting and that the person concerned did not wish him personally to take action on the allegations. He believed that he had advised him correctly and had been of help to him in clarifying how the person concerned would himself raise the matter with the Department. There is no record in my Department of the person concerned having contacted my Department following this meeting.</P>
    <P>In view of the belief of the inspector that the meeting was a private matter I wrote to the person concerned and attached a copy of the statement. I also informed him that I would, with his permission, bring the statement to the attention of members of the Oireachtas interested in this case. While in response to this question I have outlined the main elements of the statement, I consider it appropriate, given the private nature of the meeting, that the person concerned should consent to the more general availability of the statement itself.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy retired from a position in Finglas Children's Centre with effect from 31 December 1992 under the terms of the special schools superannuation schemes.</P>
      <P>Pensioners are awarded increases in their pension in accordance with general round pay increases awarded to their serving counterparts in the special schools for young offenders. These increases are paid to the pensioners once the increase is sanctioned to the serving staff in the special schools. My Department makes every effort to pay the increases to the pensioners as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>The specific arrears referred to by the Deputy relate to an announcement by the Minister for Finance on 4 November, 1997 that the Government had decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay agreements under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  should benefit from those agreements on a parity basis, subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions. Pensioners who had retired from groups that had not concluded a PCW restructuring agreement could not benefit until that agreement was concluded. The final sanction for implementation of the PCW agreement for the staff group of the person concerned, issued to Finglas Children's Centre on 5 May 1999. My Department has arranged for the new rate to issue to the person in question in the June pension payment and to issue the arrears applicable from September 1995 under the PCW agreement with the July pension payment.</P>
      <P>The first phase of Partnership 2000 was effective from 1 July 1997. The revised pension rate plus arrears under this increase were paid to the person concerned in the October 1997 pension payment. There are no outstanding arrears due to the person in question arising from this increase under Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The concerns to which the Deputy refers have not been brought to my Department's attention.</P>
      <P>The school in question is one of several hundred primary school to which the remedial teacher service is being extended from September next as part of an arrangement which will bring the service to all primary schools in the country.</P>
      <P>In most instances, this extension of service involves the allocation of full-time remedial teacher posts to individual schools or to groups of schools on a shared basis. However, in some instances, including the case to which the Deputy refers, it has not been possible to accommodate particular schools in a sharing arrangement with other schools. In such cases, a specific allocation of remedial support is made to the school in question.</P>
      <P>The level of remedial teacher support allocated to each school or group of schools in the context of this extension of service was based on the assessment of my Department's inspectorate and had regard to the recommendations of the special education review committee in relation to remedial coverage in primary schools. The allocation to the school in question reflected the fact that the school has an overall enrolment of 13 pupils.</P>
